you've ever seen my lab before no I know
it's<00:00:11.670> long<00:00:11.880> overdue<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:13.080> what's<00:00:14.040> doing<00:00:14.219> better

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it's long overdue so what's doing better

what<00:01:08.860> are<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:09.010> working<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.520> right<00:01:09.580> now<00:01:09.910> oh

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
what are you working on right now oh

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.320 
what are you working on right now oh
it's<00:01:10.630> actually<00:01:11.410> pretty<00:01:11.680> neat<00:01:12.040> yeah<00:01:12.370> it's<00:01:13.210> a

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
it's actually pretty neat yeah it's a

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.060 
it's actually pretty neat yeah it's a

tracking<00:01:17.620> here<00:01:17.770> I'll<00:01:17.890> show<00:01:17.980> you<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:20.350> this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
tracking here I'll show you put this

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.150 
tracking here I'll show you put this
pencil<00:01:21.430> over<00:01:22.120> here<00:01:22.600> sharp<00:01:23.320> thanks<00:01:23.980> to<00:01:24.070> the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
pencil over here sharp thanks to the

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.950 
pencil over here sharp thanks to the
machine<00:01:24.490> we<00:01:24.520> saw<00:01:24.820> earlier

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.450 

very<00:01:28.960> good<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.510> laser<00:01:32.170> will<00:01:32.800> map<00:01:33.250> the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
very good then a laser will map the

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.890 
very good then a laser will map the
reflective<00:01:33.580> surface<00:01:34.510> and<00:01:38.400> wow<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:40.869> is

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
reflective surface and wow that is

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:47.460 
reflective surface and wow that is
amazing<00:01:45.030> no<00:01:46.030> there's<00:01:46.240> a<00:01:46.300> foundational<00:01:47.140> idea

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
amazing no there's a foundational idea

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.560 
amazing no there's a foundational idea
in<00:01:47.680> string<00:01:48.040> theory<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.240> whole<00:01:49.420> universe

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
in string theory that the whole universe

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:58.920 
in string theory that the whole universe
may<00:01:50.140> be<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.350> hologram<00:01:50.890> what<00:01:51.640> do<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:51.790> mean<00:01:51.940> Oh

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.840 

well<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.110> holographic<00:02:00.710> principle<00:02:00.980> suggests

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
well the holographic principle suggests

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.570 
well the holographic principle suggests
that<00:02:02.030> what<00:02:02.720> we<00:02:02.840> all<00:02:03.050> experience<00:02:03.710> every<00:02:03.980> day<00:02:04.310> in

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
that what we all experience every day in

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
that what we all experience every day in
three<00:02:04.730> dimensions

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
three dimensions

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.560 
three dimensions
they<00:02:05.930> really<00:02:07.390> just<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:08.540> information<00:02:09.350> a

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
they really just be information a

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.950 
they really just be information a
surface<00:02:11.570> located<00:02:12.460> the<00:02:13.460> farthest<00:02:14.000> reaches<00:02:14.810> of

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
surface located the farthest reaches of

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.540 
surface located the farthest reaches of
our<00:02:15.050> cosmos<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.470> possible<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:19.130> our

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
our cosmos so it's possible that our

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.140 
our cosmos so it's possible that our
lives<00:02:20.480> are<00:02:20.870> really<00:02:21.020> just<00:02:22.000> acting<00:02:23.000> out<00:02:23.120> a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
lives are really just acting out a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.780 
lives are really just acting out a
painting<00:02:23.600> on<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.170> largest<00:02:24.280> canvas<00:02:25.280> in<00:02:25.700> the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
painting on the largest canvas in the

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.130 
painting on the largest canvas in the
universe<00:02:27.580> hmm<00:02:28.810> what<00:02:31.540> sometimes<00:02:32.540> I<00:02:32.690> forget<00:02:32.870> how

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
universe hmm what sometimes I forget how

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:45.390 
universe hmm what sometimes I forget how
smart<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.620> are

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.940 

are<00:02:46.400> you<00:02:46.489> doing<00:02:48.459> take<00:02:49.459> off<00:02:49.580> your<00:02:49.730> clothes

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
are you doing take off your clothes

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.500 
are you doing take off your clothes
what<00:02:51.950> here<00:02:52.280> now<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:52.760> got<00:02:52.909> a<00:02:52.940> problem<00:02:55.510> that's

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
what here now you got a problem that's

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.759 
what here now you got a problem that's
kind<00:02:56.750> of<00:02:56.780> crazy<00:02:56.959> I've<00:02:57.200> never<00:02:57.230> fooled<00:02:57.709> around

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
kind of crazy I've never fooled around

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:58.690 
kind of crazy I've never fooled around
in<00:02:58.010> the<00:02:58.069> lab<00:02:58.280> before

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
in the lab before

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.910 
in the lab before
really<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.209> never<00:02:59.480> know<00:02:59.870> well<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.319> did<00:03:00.709> have<00:03:00.739> a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
really you never know well I did have a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.530 
really you never know well I did have a
shot<00:03:01.190> with<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.430> lisatronic<00:03:01.519> but<00:03:02.360> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
shot with the lisatronic but the
