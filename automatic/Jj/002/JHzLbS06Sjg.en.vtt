00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.009
 hello today we want a mystery 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.810
 revealing the louse was 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.849
 many shake hands with the topic but 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.210
 why anything is actually in it 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:30.739
 in the ancient sailor's court 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.570
 preparation and ingredients will become us today 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:33.260
 leave the citizens in the white stage 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.120
 demonstrate 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:43.670
 there we want to quickly into the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:45.470
 follow kitchen I'm here today 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.989
 enlighten mystery when I'm in 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.940
 Nice place to make chaos and I look forward 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.089
 me that you want to show it to us today 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.589
 how to do what you eat and do 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.619
 I like that very much 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:59.360
 let's get started so what's that 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:01.250
 chaos so there is no right one 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.809
 determination for scouts from the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.610
 Tradition is not well defined 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.049
 What time does the important one come? 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.170
 components in the completion of the tall 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:11.930
 chilled meat potatoes sour 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.090
 fish rollmops earlier man salt scissors 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.409
 taken the salzburg and red pray that 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.900
 you do not store anybody earlier 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.190
 So was longer on board had exactly 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.050
 correct and fresh me fresh 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.580
 assume therefore it comes from the 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.380
 captain always used to have chicken 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.730
 because he liked to eat a chicken 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.890
 and he's definitely on his 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.150
 It's always that and what it's all about 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.550
 it has indeed itself once again the 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.990
 should make that sounds 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.840
 interesting now we just have to 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.630
 all together somehow to one 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.180
 We're just there for that 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.070
 I'm curious what there are so many 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.260
 different variations of these 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.080
 Just tell us your very own 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.540
 recipe from labskaus i use 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.680
 ironed pigs and beef 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.600
 half half i have it here once 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.409
 raw condition the cooker with onions 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.510
 laurel cloves juniper and allspice so 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.729
 it looks then a cook by the 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.900
 building stays nice and pink in front here 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.159
 that ever cut that small 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.099
 then we need to go to below 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:12.280
 normal cooked potatoes small 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.590
 sliced ​​burgen beetroot the eggs 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.180
 little parsley to garnish look 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.400
 and beetle afterwards as well as too 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.750
 components as a saturation supplement thereof 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.700
 you also need a bit more and 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.239
 We take a roll off today 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.879
 station 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.440
 When I say to the people I take 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.930
 then ask what is there to eat 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.930
 Labskaus curls the nose first 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.390
 where does that come from, why is it a small one? 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.430
 aversion to this dish labskaus 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.110
 what a completely unknown work 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.610
 rembrandts too that's just the one 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.140
 People think that the fish is ryan 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.120
 has been turned by the meat grinder 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.280
 or cut small and that is 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.739
 just not the case so it is 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.750
 terribly delicious but I believe that 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.700
 We need to get really clear up 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.489
 we're training now you said that 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.260
 no hit exactly the fish not 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.239
 only as a side dish that is always called 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.709
 Of course you can do that separately 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.359
 restaurant could also be said 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.920
 did not move it with fish there is 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.519
 also a lot to do but he is only as 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.290
 garnish 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.170
 he is not himself with the wrong 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.989
 potato industry in it a mystery 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.400
 we have cleared up so after a long time 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.709
 will look over this court now 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.440
 Once we are in every kitchen so go 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.579
 to now what can we do but like 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.169
 I told you already the head fetched yes 

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:26.530
 in private brackets and why it 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:26.530
 passed through 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.340
 what can you safely put on the front 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.120
 I 'll make that one 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:43.970
 first and the rest must be over 100 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:45.769
 forces you are very figure-conscious oh 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.609
 yes if you can tell me the stuff then 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.530
 ride back again we need 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.180
 the cattle form that ran left 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.180
 he in exactly 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:06.040
 then the beef I will only 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.650
 You can roll that again 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.640
 reset 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.170
 then we need the little ones 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.170
 sliced cucumbers and pray the red 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.400
 that come in here too 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:28.480
 you can already have the potatoes 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:30.870
 you have a kicker, how many do you have? 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.870
 not said 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:56.410
 make it so difficult and did it work 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.670
 with the potatoes all alone 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.320
 great we have to do this one more 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.850
 stir a little bit look if the 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.030
 consistency is good and now if still 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.590
 make a few potatoes 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.760
 the friday potato next to determine 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:16.570
 we still have to have a fixed one 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:21.280
 have consistency is very clear that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:23.770
 here today are indeed already before and 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.630
 has finished now the first is ready 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.160
 last time drew on a low heat cook 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.160
 and then we set up the dishes schumann 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.910
 it still cucumbers water and beetroot from 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.310
 we need that now to taste 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.640
 because to taste is the a and o at 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.640
 eat 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.800
 so and now where is that labskaus 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.289
 Still in the pot, make labskaus like 

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:57.080
 sprinkle the cucumber and the fish on it 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:58.849
 then fry me and I'll start with it 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.949
 What is this a small one? 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:02.960
 metal ring for longer Labskaus was 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.199
 it also had beautiful with the placed 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.199
 later 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.580
 then just let it taste so me 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.110
 Think so on the bounty back then 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.610
 not looked perhaps not so 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.540
 all this is a bit of today's 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:33.970
 time adjusted 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:36.250
 Okay let's see it tastes delicious 

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.230
 very tasty and I you have you 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:43.410
