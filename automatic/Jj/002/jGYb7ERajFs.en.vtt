00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.940 
we're just gonna do unfortunately this
is<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.969> Down<00:00:39.180> strum<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.629> haven't<00:00:39.930> really

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.139 

you<00:00:43.950> could<00:00:44.129> do<00:00:44.280> something<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.820> but<00:00:45.120> I

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
you could do something like that but I

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.729 
you could do something like that but I
just<00:00:45.239> tend<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> because<00:00:45.899> usually<00:00:46.170> people<00:00:46.469> are

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
just tend to because usually people are

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.110 
just tend to because usually people are
just<00:00:46.950> singing

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.420 

I<00:00:50.150> just<00:00:50.930> generally<00:00:51.200> do<00:00:51.440> down<00:00:51.680> strums<00:00:52.040> don't

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
I just generally do down strums don't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:59.460 
I just generally do down strums don't
love<00:00:52.670> that<00:00:52.700> again<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:53.870> could<00:00:54.080> easily<00:00:54.290> do<00:00:54.830> so

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.799 

what<00:01:00.470> I'm<00:01:00.590> doing<00:01:00.620> is<00:01:00.920> I'm<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.370> doing<00:01:01.610> for<00:01:02.300> one

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
what I'm doing is I'm just doing for one

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.079 
what I'm doing is I'm just doing for one
by<00:01:03.200> one<00:01:03.680> if<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:03.980> like<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.519> okay

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:05.089 
by one if you like that okay

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.440 
by one if you like that okay
for<00:01:05.750> one<00:01:06.140> look<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.250> then<00:01:07.400> under<00:01:07.640> B<00:01:07.790> minor<00:01:08.060> five

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
for one look and then under B minor five

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.950 
for one look and then under B minor five
what<00:01:08.869> more<00:01:09.320> going<00:01:09.979> back<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:10.400> a<00:01:10.430> team

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
what more going back to a team

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.020 
what more going back to a team
so<00:01:12.230> that's<00:01:12.470> another<00:01:12.770> option<00:01:12.890> I<00:01:13.430> tend<00:01:13.730> to<00:01:13.790> just

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
so that's another option I tend to just

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.700 
so that's another option I tend to just
rub<00:01:14.360> down<00:01:14.600> I'm<00:01:14.840> gonna<00:01:14.990> show<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.530> down
