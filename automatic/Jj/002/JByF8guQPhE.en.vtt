00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
played hard and they executed but I

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.530

thought<00:00:12.780> our<00:00:12.929> defense<00:00:13.110> played<00:00:13.469> hard<00:00:14.070> and<00:00:14.610> some

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
thought our defense played hard and some

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.740 
thought our defense played hard and some
good<00:00:15.719> stops<00:00:16.850> offensively<00:00:17.850> besides<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
good stops offensively besides the

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
game but we just didn't make enough

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.360 
game but we just didn't make enough
place<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> win<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.579> game<00:00:55.129> reason<00:00:56.129> that<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
place to win the game reason that the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.799 
place to win the game reason that the
offense<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.820> installed<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> way<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.600> did

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
offense is installed the way it did

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.660 
offense is installed the way it did
after<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> first<00:00:58.590> try<00:00:58.890> though<00:00:59.160> ain't<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
after the first try though ain't got to

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
after the first try though ain't got to
going<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:00.870> hurt<00:01:01.140> us<00:01:01.260> on

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
going well I think it really hurt us on

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.260 
going well I think it really hurt us on
third<00:01:01.770> down<00:01:01.980> conversions<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.910> know<00:01:03.030> we

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
third down conversions you know we

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.600 
third down conversions you know we
wanted<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> be<00:01:03.690> able<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.019> make<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.949> throws<00:01:05.220> we

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
wanted to be able to make the throws we

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.390 
wanted to be able to make the throws we
had<00:01:05.700> some<00:01:05.850> guys<00:01:06.030> open<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> dropped<00:01:07.740> one<00:01:08.040> I

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
mean it was kind of just a cumulation of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.950 
mean it was kind of just a cumulation of
the<00:01:10.619> entire<00:01:10.890> team<00:01:11.390> protection<00:01:12.390> throws

catches just a poor job by me getting

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920 
catches just a poor job by me getting
them<00:01:16.920> ready<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.189> play<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:18.119> went<00:01:18.299> with<00:01:18.450> Richie

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
them ready to play you went with Richie

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
for like three series field position

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.149 
for like three series field position
wasn't<00:01:21.390> great<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.350> try<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> get<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.860> spark

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
wasn't great but just try to get a spark

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
wasn't great but just try to get a spark
yeah<00:01:23.549> we<00:01:23.759> thought<00:01:23.939> maybe<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.330> could<00:01:24.360> get<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
yeah we thought maybe we could get a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
yeah we thought maybe we could get a
spark<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.170> get<00:01:25.350> something<00:01:25.710> going<00:01:25.979> he<00:01:26.070> looked

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
spark and get something going he looked

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
spark and get something going he looked
good<00:01:26.369> right<00:01:26.580> there<00:01:26.790> before<00:01:26.970> half<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.689> made

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
good right there before half and made

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.410 
good right there before half and made
some<00:01:28.020> plays<00:01:28.259> but<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.159> know<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.119> weren't<00:01:30.240> able

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
some plays but you know we weren't able

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.660 
some plays but you know we weren't able
to<00:01:30.600> move<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.869> ball<00:01:31.020> at<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.070> decided<00:01:32.400> to

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to move the ball at all so we decided to

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.120 
to move the ball at all so we decided to
switch<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.390> back<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.170> then<00:01:34.320> finally<00:01:34.979> got

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
switch it back up and then finally got

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.950 
switch it back up and then finally got
rolling<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.240> got<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> ball<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.689> the<00:01:36.750> end<00:01:36.900> zone

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
rolling and got the ball in the end zone

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.999 
rolling and got the ball in the end zone
a<00:01:37.079> couple<00:01:37.170> times<00:01:37.619> what<00:01:38.460> do<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.200 

well<00:01:42.009> they're<00:01:42.250> doing<00:01:42.520> a<00:01:42.579> good<00:01:42.700> job<00:01:42.759> there

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
well they're doing a good job there

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:01.959 
to keep their hands up so there's a

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.719 
to keep their hands up so there's a

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.730 
number of things that are responsible
for<00:02:03.880> it<00:02:04.240> but<00:02:04.450> there's<00:02:05.020> certainly<00:02:05.469> way<00:02:05.679> too

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
for it but there's certainly way too
