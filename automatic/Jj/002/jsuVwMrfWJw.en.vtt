to<00:01:06.750> 90%<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:08.070> varies<00:01:08.520> on<00:01:08.670> systems<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:10.170> I

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
to 90% it's it varies on systems but I

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.520 
to 90% it's it varies on systems but I
find<00:01:10.590> around<00:01:10.740> 80<00:01:11.189> 85<00:01:12.000> percent<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.970> average

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
find around 80 85 percent is the average

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.649 
find around 80 85 percent is the average
you<00:01:16.530> know<00:01:16.560> Goldie<00:01:17.369> Goldie<00:01:17.640> locks<00:01:17.909> pot<00:01:18.360> there

you know Goldie Goldie locks pot there

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.850 
you know Goldie Goldie locks pot there
for<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:20.630> but<00:01:21.630> yeah<00:01:22.170> if<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:22.350> put<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> a

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
for it but yeah if you put it to a

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.399 
for it but yeah if you put it to a
hundred<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> will<00:01:23.759> definitely<00:01:24.409> distort

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
hundred it will definitely distort

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.990 
hundred it will definitely distort
people<00:01:25.770> it's<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> boost<00:01:26.460> everyone<00:01:26.880> up

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
people it's like a boost everyone up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.380 
people it's like a boost everyone up
around<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.450> too<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.790> then<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.909> talk<00:01:30.180> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
around you too much and then the talk in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.700 
around you too much and then the talk in
the<00:01:30.420> mic<00:01:30.689> volume<00:01:31.220> I<00:01:32.990> still<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.320> quite

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the mic volume I still have not quite

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.130 
the mic volume I still have not quite
figured<00:01:34.770> out<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.850> haven't<00:01:36.270> delved<00:01:36.750> into<00:01:36.960> this

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
figured out I haven't delved into this

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.520 
figured out I haven't delved into this
too<00:01:37.350> much<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> figure<00:01:37.920> out<00:01:38.060> what<00:01:39.060> the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
too much to figure out what the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.840 
too much to figure out what the
difference<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> in<00:01:40.740> between<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.369> two<00:01:41.400> I

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
difference is in between the two I

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.160 
difference is in between the two I
believe<00:01:42.780> one<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> just<00:01:44.210> the<00:01:45.210> normal<00:01:45.630> volume

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
believe one is just the normal volume

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.740 
believe one is just the normal volume
for<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:46.920> microphone<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> other

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
for your microphone and then the other

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.960 
for your microphone and then the other
one<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.259> assuming<00:01:50.250> is<00:01:50.340> your<00:01:50.490> microphone

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
one I'm assuming is your microphone

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.179 
one I'm assuming is your microphone
boost<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:53.299> excuse<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.979> find<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> best

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
boost and excuse me I find the best

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.210 
boost and excuse me I find the best
settings<00:01:56.579> for<00:01:56.670> everybody<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.869> around<00:01:58.170> 50%

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
settings for everybody is around 50%

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.000 
settings for everybody is around 50%
and<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:01.540> the<00:02:01.690> mic<00:02:01.840> volume<00:02:01.870> sometimes<00:02:02.590> I'll

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
and for the mic volume sometimes I'll

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.890 
and for the mic volume sometimes I'll
turn<00:02:03.220> it<00:02:03.370> up<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.580> little<00:02:03.760> bit<00:02:03.970> more<00:02:04.180> but<00:02:04.750> you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
turn it up a little bit more but you

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.330 
turn it up a little bit more but you
don't<00:02:05.050> want<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.260> be<00:02:05.350> growing<00:02:05.530> up<00:02:05.740> much<00:02:06.100> higher

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
don't want to be growing up much higher

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.250 
don't want to be growing up much higher
than<00:02:06.610> than<00:02:07.000> this<00:02:07.210> because<00:02:07.540> then<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.110> will

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.260 
than than this because then you will

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.170 
than than this because then you will
definitely<00:02:08.740> be<00:02:09.190> getting<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.580> distorted

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
definitely be getting that distorted

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.670 
definitely be getting that distorted
sound<00:02:10.450> out<00:02:10.660> of<00:02:10.690> your<00:02:10.869> microphone<00:02:11.320> like<00:02:11.500> you'll

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
sound out of your microphone like you'll

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.930 
sound out of your microphone like you'll
hear<00:02:11.920> from<00:02:11.950> everybody<00:02:12.370> else

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
hear from everybody else

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.770 
hear from everybody else
so<00:02:13.750> around<00:02:14.350> 50%<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.910> safe<00:02:16.600> spot<00:02:16.870> 5060<00:02:18.780> for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so around 50% is the safe spot 5060 for

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.290 
so around 50% is the safe spot 5060 for
them<00:02:19.900> for<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.380> talk<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:20.890> mic<00:02:21.040> volume<00:02:21.300> now

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
them for the talk and the mic volume now

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.200 
them for the talk and the mic volume now
ducking<00:02:23.580> essentially<00:02:24.580> what<00:02:24.700> it's<00:02:24.820> supposed

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
ducking essentially what it's supposed

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.090 
ducking essentially what it's supposed

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
little bit - however intensity put them

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.570 
little bit - however intensity put them
up<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.150> 80%<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.200> supposed<00:02:38.440> to<00:02:38.500> turn<00:02:38.800> quite<00:02:39.520> a
