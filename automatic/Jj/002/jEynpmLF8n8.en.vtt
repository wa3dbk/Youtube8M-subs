00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.530 
not going to say really don't care but
really<00:02:01.140> not<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.530> much<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.890> stickler<00:02:02.540> then

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
really not that much of a stickler then

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.610 
really not that much of a stickler then
these<00:02:04.259> might<00:02:04.530> work

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
these might work

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.370 
these might work
the<00:02:06.220> actual<00:02:06.700> plug<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.360> kind<00:02:07.630> of<00:02:07.720> at<00:02:07.840> an<00:02:07.930> angle

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
the actual plug is kind of at an angle

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.770 
the actual plug is kind of at an angle
so<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.220> don't<00:02:09.490> know<00:02:09.550> how<00:02:09.610> conducive<00:02:10.270> that<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.600> to

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
so I don't know how conducive that is to

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.880 
so I don't know how conducive that is to
your<00:02:10.960> DJ<00:02:11.860> mixer<00:02:12.310> and<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:14.080> actual<00:02:14.790> plugins<00:02:15.790> now

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
your DJ mixer and the actual plugins now

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.400 
your DJ mixer and the actual plugins now
d<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.190> know<00:02:18.340> these<00:02:18.580> are<00:02:18.640> two-sided<00:02:19.630> they're

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
d you know these are two-sided they're

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770 
d you know these are two-sided they're
not<00:02:20.560> like<00:02:20.710> your<00:02:20.860> normal<00:02:21.060> DJ<00:02:22.060> headphones<00:02:22.540> where

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
not like your normal DJ headphones where

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.990 
not like your normal DJ headphones where
you<00:02:22.840> just<00:02:22.990> plug<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.560> end<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.980> and<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.820> got<00:02:24.970> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
you just plug one end so and you got to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.730 
you just plug one end so and you got to
have<00:02:25.240> both<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.510> them<00:02:25.720> in<00:02:25.870> front<00:02:26.200> them<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.530> work

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
have both of them in front them to work

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.120 
have both of them in front them to work
you<00:02:27.730> know<00:02:27.880> both<00:02:28.180> sides<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.770> what<00:02:29.980> it<00:02:30.040> is

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
you know both sides so it is what it is

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.720 
you know both sides so it is what it is
you<00:02:31.090> have<00:02:31.240> your<00:02:31.390> volume<00:02:31.980> answer<00:02:32.980> button<00:02:33.280> here

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
you have your volume answer button here

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.790 
you have your volume answer button here
so<00:02:34.390> you<00:02:34.480> actually<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:35.050> use<00:02:35.260> these<00:02:35.500> on<00:02:35.680> your

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
so you actually can use these on your

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.310 
so you actually can use these on your
phone<00:02:35.860> I<00:02:36.430> phone<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.390> know<00:02:38.190> android<00:02:39.190> whatever

phone I phone you know android whatever

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.100
