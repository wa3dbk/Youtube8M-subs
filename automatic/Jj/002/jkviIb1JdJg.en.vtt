oh<00:00:04.609> hello<00:00:05.810> posted<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.899> bug<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:07.470> version

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
oh hello posted a bug with this version

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.509 
oh hello posted a bug with this version
of<00:00:07.950> wings<00:00:08.160> before<00:00:09.230> you<00:00:10.230> Garrity<00:00:10.590> Oh<00:00:10.769> Bristol

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
of wings before you Garrity Oh Bristol

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.669 
of wings before you Garrity Oh Bristol
show<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.849> weeks<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.750> you<00:00:12.870> know<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.170> one

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
show you in weeks so you know it is one

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.160 
show you in weeks so you know it is one
point<00:00:13.950> three<00:00:13.980> point<00:00:14.190> one<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:14.870> think<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.990> might

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
point three point one I think it might

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
point three point one I think it might
have<00:00:16.260> been<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.440> previous<00:00:17.160> version<00:00:17.279> but<00:00:17.730> yeah

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
have been a previous version but yeah

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.929 
have been a previous version but yeah
not<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.080> long<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.529> inside<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.820> when

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
not so long in the inside so when

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.370 
not so long in the inside so when
everything<00:00:21.150> gets<00:00:21.539> long<00:00:21.810> i<00:00:21.960> define<00:00:22.199> that

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
everything gets long i define that

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.529 
everything gets long i define that
Kathleen<00:00:22.830> but<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.490> ruins<00:00:23.910> nice<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.180> short

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
Kathleen but this ruins nice a short

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.910 
Kathleen but this ruins nice a short
sweet<00:00:25.580> but<00:00:26.580> anyhow<00:00:27.199> but<00:00:28.199> I<00:00:28.289> found<00:00:28.439> before<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
sweet but anyhow but I found before I

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.589 
sweet but anyhow but I found before I
thought<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.310> was<00:00:29.369> just<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> general<00:00:30.150> texturing

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
thought it was just a general texturing

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.870 
thought it was just a general texturing
bug<00:00:30.900> but<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.349> think<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> very<00:00:32.430> specific

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
bug but now I think it's a very specific

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.569 
bug but now I think it's a very specific
kind<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.570> texturing<00:00:33.960> book<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.130> seems<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
kind of texturing book and it seems to

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
kind of texturing book and it seems to
be<00:00:35.700> particular<00:00:36.649> to<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:38.360> AMD<00:00:39.360> Radeon<00:00:39.899> line<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
be particular to the AMD Radeon line of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280 
be particular to the AMD Radeon line of

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
graphics cards and video users have not

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.630 
graphics cards and video users have not
complained<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.570> but<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.110> ati<00:00:46.920> E&amp;B

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
complained about this but the ati E&amp;B

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.290 
complained about this but the ati E&amp;B
people<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.770> hey<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:50.460> used<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.910> be<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.120> video

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
people have hey I used to be on video

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.410 
people have hey I used to be on video
but<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.590> updated<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.039> computer<00:00:53.520> it

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
but because I updated my computer it

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.779 
but because I updated my computer it
came<00:00:54.660> with<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> chipset<00:00:55.350> and<00:00:55.379> well<00:00:56.219> it's<00:00:56.579> not

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
came with the chipset and well it's not

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.119 
came with the chipset and well it's not
a<00:00:56.850> sir<00:00:57.090> it<00:00:57.870> seemed<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.230> work<00:00:58.260> these<00:00:58.559> enough<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
a sir it seemed to work these enough for

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
a sir it seemed to work these enough for
most<00:00:59.219> things<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.699> figured<00:01:00.059> stick<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.199> it<00:01:01.230> for

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
most things I figured stick with it for

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.889 
most things I figured stick with it for
now<00:01:01.730> tryouts<00:01:02.730> spend<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> money<00:01:03.329> if<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.690> don't

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
now tryouts spend the money if I don't

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.109 
now tryouts spend the money if I don't
have<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:06.110> area<00:01:07.880> essentially<00:01:08.880> what

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
have to so area essentially what

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.090 
have to so area essentially what
happened<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.950> I'll<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.280> show<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:12.920> of<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
happened is I'll just show you a of the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.859 
happened is I'll just show you a of the
textures<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.909> seed<00:01:15.360> size<00:01:15.600> here<00:01:16.580> materials

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
textures like seed size here materials

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.440 
textures like seed size here materials
they<00:01:18.869> changed<00:01:19.560> somewhere<00:01:20.460> along<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:20.820> one

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
they changed somewhere along the way one

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
they changed somewhere along the way one
of<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> tributes<00:01:22.080> got<00:01:22.290> changed<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.659> vertex

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
of the tributes got changed and vertex

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.530 
of the tributes got changed and vertex
colors<00:01:25.140> became<00:01:25.740> like<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.009> default<00:01:26.520> part<00:01:27.390> Oh

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
colors became like a default part Oh

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.410 
colors became like a default part Oh
wings<00:01:27.900> now<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> never<00:01:29.640> really<00:01:29.909> used<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
wings now and I never really used the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.069 
wings now and I never really used the
vertex<00:01:30.810> colors<00:01:32.090> for<00:01:33.090> doing<00:01:33.329> most<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> my<00:01:33.780> model

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
vertex colors for doing most of my model

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.670 
vertex colors for doing most of my model
work<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.650> text<00:01:35.579> her<00:01:35.700> down<00:01:36.200> where<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.439> set

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
work I just text her down where to set

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.940 
work I just text her down where to set
them<00:01:37.829> a<00:01:37.920> plane<00:01:38.460> slate<00:01:39.180> color<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.950> these

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
them a plane slate color and these

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.069 
them a plane slate color and these
procedurals<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.909> nowadays<00:01:42.090> support<00:01:42.659> texture

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
procedurals but nowadays support texture

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.870 
procedurals but nowadays support texture
colors<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.560> guess<00:01:43.710> its<00:01:43.890> four-game<00:01:44.130> work<00:01:44.490> song

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
colors I guess its four-game work song

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.170 
colors I guess its four-game work song
but<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:46.200> all<00:01:46.439> my<00:01:46.680> old<00:01:46.950> models<00:01:47.460> came<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.000> with

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
but so all my old models came in with

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.359 
but so all my old models came in with
the<00:01:48.329> vertex<00:01:48.750> colors<00:01:49.110> set<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.979> ignore<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> it's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
the vertex colors set to ignore and it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.209 
the vertex colors set to ignore and it's
fixed<00:01:53.970> now<00:01:54.030> corner<00:01:54.540> instead<00:01:54.840> see<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.130> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
fixed now corner instead see here on a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
fixed now corner instead see here on a
tail<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.930> certain<00:01:58.770> parts<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.189> my<00:01:59.310> model<00:01:59.759> when

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
tail like certain parts of my model when

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.149 
tail like certain parts of my model when
the<00:02:00.869> vertex<00:02:01.259> colors<00:02:01.649> were<00:02:01.829> set<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.280> ignore

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
the vertex colors were set to ignore

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.969 
the vertex colors were set to ignore
they<00:02:05.159> would<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.430> show<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.229> black<00:02:07.229> like

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
they would just show up as black like

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.380 
they would just show up as black like
this<00:02:08.190> tale<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.550> here<00:02:09.229> or

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
this tale is here or

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.809 
this tale is here or
you're<00:02:11.930> all<00:02:12.080> Coogan<00:02:12.830> gets<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.250> be<00:02:13.460> narrowing

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
you're all Coogan gets to be narrowing

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.970 
you're all Coogan gets to be narrowing
that<00:02:14.000> should<00:02:14.569> be<00:02:14.690> calling<00:02:15.560> out<00:02:15.830> said<00:02:16.220> that<00:02:17.980> to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
that should be calling out said that to

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.140 
that should be calling out said that to
ignore<00:02:20.680> yeah<00:02:21.680> see<00:02:22.250> how<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.520> one<00:02:22.790> is<00:02:22.970> all

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
ignore yeah see how this one is all

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.120 
ignore yeah see how this one is all
stretched<00:02:23.510> out<00:02:23.660> funny<00:02:23.959> if<00:02:24.500> your<00:02:24.740> show<00:02:25.010> up

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
stretched out funny if your show up

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.510 
stretched out funny if your show up

stretched out funny like that or blacked
out<00:02:28.730> like<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.680> when<00:02:30.680> you're<00:02:30.830> trying<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.250> see

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
out like that when you're trying to see

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.880 
out like that when you're trying to see
your<00:02:31.760> textures<00:02:32.300> and<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:33.020> things<00:02:33.350> to<00:02:33.560> make<00:02:33.680> sure

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
your textures and do things to make sure

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.640 
your textures and do things to make sure
they're<00:02:34.450> correctly<00:02:35.450> mapped<00:02:35.810> like<00:02:36.440> this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
they're correctly mapped like this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.350 
they're correctly mapped like this

election here you could still sees Kurt

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.440 
election here you could still sees Kurt
looking<00:02:38.840> where<00:02:39.500> they<00:02:39.620> only<00:02:40.120> but<00:02:41.120> when<00:02:41.330> you're

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
looking where they only but when you're

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
looking where they only but when you're
trying<00:02:41.630> to<00:02:41.780> see<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:42.200> you<00:02:42.319> got<00:02:42.470> stretching<00:02:43.220> or

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
trying to see if you got stretching or

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.729 
trying to see if you got stretching or
seams<00:02:43.820> or<00:02:44.180> anything<00:02:44.510> funny<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.260> you're<00:02:45.530> under

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
seams or anything funny and you're under

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.080 
seams or anything funny and you're under
like<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:47.200> obviously<00:02:48.200> it's<00:02:48.320> useless<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.970> it

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
like that obviously it's useless but it

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.560 
like that obviously it's useless but it
turns<00:02:50.300> out<00:02:50.690> with<00:02:51.230> the<00:02:51.410> AMD<00:02:52.010> cards<00:02:52.330> you<00:02:53.330> got<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
turns out with the AMD cards you got to

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.750 
turns out with the AMD cards you got to
go<00:02:53.690> through<00:02:53.720> every<00:02:54.680> material<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.280> wings<00:02:55.519> three

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
go through every material in wings three

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.960 
go through every material in wings three
and<00:02:56.320> you<00:02:57.320> want<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.620> set<00:02:57.830> your<00:02:57.980> vertex<00:02:58.610> colors

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
and you want to set your vertex colors

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.850 
and you want to set your vertex colors
from<00:02:59.239> ignore<00:02:59.709> to<00:03:00.709> multiply<00:03:02.019> boom<00:03:03.019> now<00:03:03.350> it<00:03:03.800> is

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
from ignore to multiply boom now it is

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.280 
from ignore to multiply boom now it is
correct<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:06.050> same<00:03:06.320> word<00:03:06.560> as<00:03:06.590> heights<00:03:08.230> here<00:03:09.230> it

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
correct the same word as heights here it

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.140 
correct the same word as heights here it
is<00:03:09.640> ok<00:03:10.640> material<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.080> multiply<00:03:12.850> don't<00:03:13.850> see

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
is ok material so to multiply don't see

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.479 
is ok material so to multiply don't see
how<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.330> tail<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.630> there<00:03:15.019> now<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.829> can<00:03:16.250> see

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
how the tail is there now you can see

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.840 
how the tail is there now you can see
all<00:03:16.760> your<00:03:17.239> UV<00:03:17.690> mapped<00:03:18.250> textures<00:03:19.250> as<00:03:19.549> they

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
all your UV mapped textures as they

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.110 
all your UV mapped textures as they
should<00:03:20.120> render<00:03:21.280> so<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.519> you've<00:03:22.700> been<00:03:22.850> pulling

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
should render so if you've been pulling

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.740 
should render so if you've been pulling
out<00:03:23.420> your<00:03:23.450> hair<00:03:23.630> like<00:03:24.110> using<00:03:24.739> Queen<00:03:25.430> City<00:03:25.760> it's

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
out your hair like using Queen City it's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.680 
out your hair like using Queen City it's
not<00:03:26.930> often<00:03:27.110> but<00:03:27.410> sometimes<00:03:27.680> it<00:03:28.190> happens

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
not often but sometimes it happens

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.319 
not often but sometimes it happens
though<00:03:29.690> things<00:03:30.049> have<00:03:30.170> been<00:03:30.500> oh<00:03:31.030> it's<00:03:32.030> just<00:03:32.239> a

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
though things have been oh it's just a

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.490 
though things have been oh it's just a
nature<00:03:32.630> things<00:03:32.900> but<00:03:33.579> it<00:03:34.579> turns<00:03:34.880> out<00:03:35.500> it's

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
nature things but it turns out it's

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.949 
nature things but it turns out it's
unforeseen<00:03:37.280> consequence<00:03:37.970> of<00:03:38.180> changing<00:03:38.870> how

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
unforeseen consequence of changing how

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.170 
unforeseen consequence of changing how
to<00:03:39.019> dead<00:03:39.260> things<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.720> fix<00:03:42.260> exists<00:03:43.180> until

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
to dead things but a fix exists until

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.870 
to dead things but a fix exists until
they<00:03:44.390> fix<00:03:44.630> how<00:03:45.019> ignore<00:03:45.560> vertex<00:03:46.280> colors<00:03:46.640> is

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
they fix how ignore vertex colors is

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.420 
they fix how ignore vertex colors is
handled<00:03:47.320> you<00:03:48.320> just<00:03:48.590> got<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.769> go<00:03:48.980> through<00:03:49.220> and

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
handled you just got to go through and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.000 
handled you just got to go through and
set<00:03:49.640> everything<00:03:49.790> to<00:03:50.180> multiply<00:03:50.870> if<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.829> see

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
set everything to multiply if you see

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.949 
set everything to multiply if you see
like<00:03:52.250> little<00:03:52.489> spots<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:53.000> color<00:03:53.209> after<00:03:53.690> we<00:03:53.810> do

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
like little spots of color after we do

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.160 
like little spots of color after we do
it<00:03:54.220> simple<00:03:55.220> fix<00:03:55.459> is<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.970> click<00:03:56.420> model<00:03:57.110> in

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
it simple fix is to just click model in

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.400 
it simple fix is to just click model in
object<00:03:57.590> mode<00:03:57.650> click<00:03:58.489> vertex<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.390> then<00:04:00.140> go

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
object mode click vertex and then go

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.190 
object mode click vertex and then go
vertex<00:04:01.280> color<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:02.150> just<00:04:02.329> make<00:04:02.510> sure<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.720> drag

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
vertex color and just make sure to drag

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.289 
vertex color and just make sure to drag
the<00:04:03.350> V<00:04:03.530> all<00:04:03.709> the<00:04:03.829> way<00:04:03.920> over<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.160> white<00:04:04.430> goofy

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
the V all the way over to white goofy

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.140 
the V all the way over to white goofy
little<00:04:05.480> colors<00:04:05.840> go<00:04:06.049> away<00:04:06.230> or<00:04:07.220> you<00:04:07.760> can<00:04:07.910> set

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
little colors go away or you can set

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.090 
little colors go away or you can set
them<00:04:08.299> but<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.900> don't<00:04:09.170> really<00:04:09.560> use<00:04:09.680> for<00:04:09.890> text

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
them but I don't really use for text

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.240 
them but I don't really use for text
color<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:10.670> this<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.720> the<00:04:11.870> fast<00:04:12.079> fix<00:04:12.350> and<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.920> has

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
color so this is the fast fix and it has

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.349 
color so this is the fast fix and it has
worked<00:04:14.799> but<00:04:15.799> for<00:04:16.220> now<00:04:16.340> that's<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.940> way<00:04:17.030> to<00:04:17.150> do

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
worked but for now that's the way to do

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.280 
worked but for now that's the way to do
all<00:04:18.260> right<00:04:18.380> signing<00:04:19.190> up
