00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
it on and do the controls on it so this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.920 
it on and do the controls on it so this
is<00:00:54.329> an<00:00:54.809> unboxing<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.809> once<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
is an unboxing of this and once the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
is an unboxing of this and once the
computers<00:00:58.350> built<00:00:58.620> I'll<00:00:58.859> actually<00:00:59.070> show<00:00:59.280> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
computers built I'll actually show you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.470 
computers built I'll actually show you
the<00:01:00.120> monitor<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.109> action<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.640> let's<00:01:03.329> get

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the monitor in action so let's get

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:12.020 
the monitor in action so let's get
started<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.080> cut<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.799> baby<00:01:05.040> open<00:01:10.939> now<00:01:11.939> I'm

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
started and cut this baby open now I'm

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.850 
started and cut this baby open now I'm
in<00:01:12.150> my<00:01:12.180> kitchen<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.900> since<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.590> such<00:01:13.830> a

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
in my kitchen here since this is such a

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
in my kitchen here since this is such a
big<00:01:14.159> box<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:15.650> so<00:01:16.650> if<00:01:16.979> you<00:01:17.130> hear<00:01:17.280> anything<00:01:17.490> it's

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
big box and so if you hear anything it's

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
big box and so if you hear anything it's
probably<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.060> refrigerator

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:43.170 

all<00:01:29.680> right<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.880> have<00:01:39.970> here<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:42.180> power

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
all right we have here is the power

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.380 
all right we have here is the power
brick<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:44.289> plugs<00:01:44.860> into<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.429> monitor<00:01:46.060> itself

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
brick that plugs into the monitor itself

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.889 
brick that plugs into the monitor itself
and<00:01:46.720> then<00:01:46.840> like<00:01:47.560> a<00:01:47.590> laptop<00:01:48.330> you<00:01:49.330> plug<00:01:49.539> the<00:01:49.659> cord

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
and then like a laptop you plug the cord

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:54.149 
and then like a laptop you plug the cord
into<00:01:49.960> that<00:01:50.229> into<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.500> wall<00:01:51.960> we<00:01:52.960> have<00:01:53.200> the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
into that into the wall we have the

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.700 
into that into the wall we have the
power<00:01:54.369> cord<00:01:54.729> that<00:01:55.030> plugs<00:01:55.119> into<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.750> we<00:01:56.590> have

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
power cord that plugs into that we have

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.669 
power cord that plugs into that we have
a<00:01:56.740> disc<00:01:57.299> which<00:01:58.299> has<00:01:58.899> a<00:01:58.929> monitor<00:01:59.470> driver<00:01:59.830> and

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
a disc which has a monitor driver and

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.219 
a disc which has a monitor driver and
magic<00:02:02.679> tune<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:03.959> I<00:02:04.959> guess<00:02:05.289> that's<00:02:05.440> a<00:02:05.590> way<00:02:06.310> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
magic tune and I guess that's a way to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.289 
magic tune and I guess that's a way to
control<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.410> monitor<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> course<00:02:10.179> your

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
control the monitor and the course your

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.470 
control the monitor and the course your
