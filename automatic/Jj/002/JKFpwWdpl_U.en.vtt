00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
they thought that showing gangster films

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.740 
they thought that showing gangster films
would<00:03:16.310> teach<00:03:16.669> kids<00:03:16.970> how<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.180> commit<00:03:17.449> crimes

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
would teach kids how to commit crimes

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.199 
would teach kids how to commit crimes
like<00:03:17.989> how<00:03:18.169> to<00:03:18.230> blow<00:03:18.410> up<00:03:18.560> trains<00:03:18.949> but<00:03:19.760> there<00:03:20.120> is

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
like how to blow up trains but there is

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.939 
like how to blow up trains but there is
a<00:03:20.239> one<00:03:20.629> difference<00:03:20.989> here<00:03:21.169> with<00:03:21.319> the<00:03:21.500> the<00:03:21.769> video

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
a one difference here with the the video

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.319 
a one difference here with the the video
games<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.370> think<00:03:22.579> it's<00:03:22.699> that<00:03:22.760> parents<00:03:23.239> don't

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
games I think it's that parents don't

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.210 
games I think it's that parents don't
know<00:03:23.449> how<00:03:23.599> to<00:03:23.690> operate<00:03:23.750> the<00:03:24.139> controls<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.980> you

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
know how to operate the controls so you

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.680 
know how to operate the controls so you
don't<00:03:25.609> know<00:03:25.669> what's<00:03:25.819> in<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:26.150> that's<00:03:26.359> scary

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
don't know what's in there that's scary

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.240 
don't know what's in there that's scary
as<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.870> parent<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.349> can't<00:03:27.560> flip<00:03:27.799> through<00:03:28.040> it<00:03:28.099> or

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
as a parent you can't flip through it or

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.430 
as a parent you can't flip through it or
fast-forward<00:03:28.579> to<00:03:29.419> see<00:03:29.540> what's<00:03:29.750> there<00:03:29.989> okay

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
fast-forward to see what's there okay

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.340 
fast-forward to see what's there okay
