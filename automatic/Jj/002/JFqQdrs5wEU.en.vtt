00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
the same that's why I'm doing this

comparison<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.550> think<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:27.119> will<00:00:27.270> be<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> pretty

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
comparison I think this will be a pretty

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.630 
comparison I think this will be a pretty
interesting<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.619> fair<00:00:28.859> comparison<00:00:29.490> between

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
interesting and fair comparison between

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.210 
interesting and fair comparison between
the<00:00:29.910> two<00:00:29.940> mainly<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.020> two<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.830> let's<00:00:32.040> get

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
the two mainly the two so let's get

00:00:32.220 --> 00:01:22.940 
the two mainly the two so let's get
straight<00:00:32.400> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.699> benchmarks<00:00:33.150> then

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.570 

all<00:01:24.110> right<00:01:25.110> first<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.860> want<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.070> let<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.400> know

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
all right first I want to let you know

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.179 
all right first I want to let you know
that<00:01:26.880> all<00:01:27.119> three<00:01:27.750> processors<00:01:28.470> are<00:01:28.710> pretty

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that all three processors are pretty

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.630 
that all three processors are pretty
amazing<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.330> Intel<00:01:30.720> i5<00:01:30.810> 4460<00:01:31.649> kind<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.460> falls

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
amazing the Intel i5 4460 kind of falls

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.350 
amazing the Intel i5 4460 kind of falls
back<00:01:32.880> behind<00:01:33.119> AMD<00:01:33.780> FX<00:01:34.070> 8350<00:01:35.070> when<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.030> comes<00:01:36.210> to

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
back behind AMD FX 8350 when it comes to

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
i5 4460 etter than the FX 8350 I was
kind<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.220> disappointed<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.970> seeing<00:01:48.360> these

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
kind of disappointed to seeing these

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.350 
kind of disappointed to seeing these
processors<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.619> far<00:01:49.920> behind<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.399> smallest<00:01:50.670> i5

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
processors so far behind the smallest i5

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.040 
processors so far behind the smallest i5
in<00:01:51.659> gaming<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.710> 4460<00:01:53.700> clearly<00:01:54.299> delivers<00:01:54.780> more

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
in gaming the 4460 clearly delivers more

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.350 
in gaming the 4460 clearly delivers more
FPS<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.770> games<00:01:55.979> when<00:01:56.580> looking<00:01:56.909> at<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> power

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
FPS in games when looking at the power

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.540 
FPS in games when looking at the power
consumption<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> FX<00:01:58.500> CPUs<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.190> course

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
consumption the FX CPUs of course

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.910 
consumption the FX CPUs of course
consume<00:02:00.300> a<00:02:00.450> lot<00:02:00.659> more<00:02:00.690> power<00:02:01.200> than<00:02:01.440> the<00:02:01.560> i5

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
consume a lot more power than the i5

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.840 
consume a lot more power than the i5
4460<00:02:02.600> so<00:02:03.600> let's<00:02:03.929> sum<00:02:04.200> everything<00:02:04.560> up<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.490> i-5

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
