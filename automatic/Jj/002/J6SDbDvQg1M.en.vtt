00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
exactly how i know that because if you

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.150 
exactly how i know that because if you
can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.850> here<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.360> wood<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.160> actually

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
can see here on the wood is actually

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.580 
can see here on the wood is actually
some<00:00:44.600> that<00:00:45.600> i<00:00:45.660> think<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> called<00:00:46.260> would

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
some that i think that we called would

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
some that i think that we called would
knots<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.910> know<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.210> there's<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.480> grains

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
knots so you know and there's the grains

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.770 
knots so you know and there's the grains
right<00:00:49.500> there<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.550> know<00:00:50.700> these<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.329> made

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
right there so you know these are made

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.560 
right there so you know these are made
from<00:00:52.440> real<00:00:53.070> wood<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.550> not<00:00:53.789> popsicle<00:00:54.329> sticks

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
from real wood and not popsicle sticks

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
from real wood and not popsicle sticks
and<00:00:55.969> having<00:00:56.969> said<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.780> mean<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.760> pallet<00:00:59.760> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
and having said that I mean a pallet is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.549 
and having said that I mean a pallet is
a<00:00:59.940> pretty<00:01:00.270> basic<00:01:00.600> obstacle<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:04.199> can<00:01:04.379> use

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
a pretty basic obstacle but you can use

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.130 
a pretty basic obstacle but you can use
them<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.100> raise<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:06.030> an<00:01:06.180> obstacle<00:01:06.479> or

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
them to you know raise up an obstacle or

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.440 
them to you know raise up an obstacle or
you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.650> do<00:01:07.740> tricks<00:01:07.979> over<00:01:08.159> them<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:09.270> these

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
you can do tricks over them with these

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
you can do tricks over them with these
you<00:01:09.600> can<00:01:09.689> even<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> little<00:01:10.260> little<00:01:11.159> grind

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you can even do a little little grind

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.190 
you can even do a little little grind
right<00:01:11.820> here<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> edge<00:01:12.330> because<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
right here on the edge because it is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.190 
right here on the edge because it is
very<00:01:13.439> durable<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.840> smooth

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
very durable and actually pretty smooth

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.320 
very durable and actually pretty smooth
to<00:01:16.409> grind<00:01:16.650> on<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.070> had<00:01:17.400> no<00:01:17.580> problem<00:01:17.909> with<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.150> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to grind on I had no problem with it the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.200 
to grind on I had no problem with it the
wood<00:01:18.509> didn't<00:01:18.750> crack<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.170> all<00:01:19.250> so<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.790> was<00:01:21.000> really

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
wood didn't crack at all so I was really

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.670 
wood didn't crack at all so I was really
impressed<00:01:21.299> with<00:01:21.600> that<00:01:21.630> but<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> thing<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
impressed with that but the thing that

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.740 
impressed with that but the thing that
really<00:01:23.100> impressed<00:01:23.430> me<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> most<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
really impressed me the most was the

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.289 
really impressed me the most was the
craftsmanship<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.610> reason<00:01:26.850> why<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> say

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
craftsmanship and the reason why I say

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.760 
craftsmanship and the reason why I say
that<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:28.020> know<00:01:28.170> Phil<00:01:28.530> at

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
between all the planks the the curves of

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.889 
between all the planks the the curves of
