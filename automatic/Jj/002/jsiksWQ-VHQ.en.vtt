now<00:00:09.580> what<00:00:09.730> land<00:00:09.940> is<00:00:10.150> an<00:00:10.300> area<00:00:10.570> where<00:00:10.720> water

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
now what land is an area where water

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.890 
now what land is an area where water
sits<00:00:11.380> for<00:00:11.950> all<00:00:12.400> our<00:00:12.640> part<00:00:12.880> of<00:00:12.940> the<00:00:13.000> year<00:00:13.330> this

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
sits for all our part of the year this

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.049 
sits for all our part of the year this
time<00:00:14.080> of<00:00:14.260> year<00:00:14.410> we'll<00:00:14.590> see<00:00:14.800> water<00:00:15.340> and<00:00:15.700> puddles

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
time of year we'll see water and puddles

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.420 
time of year we'll see water and puddles
many<00:00:16.540> places<00:00:16.840> and<00:00:17.230> in<00:00:17.350> fields<00:00:17.860> and<00:00:18.040> in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
many places and in fields and in

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.300 
many places and in fields and in
permanent<00:00:18.880> wetlands<00:00:19.360> like<00:00:19.480> this<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:21.160> they

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
permanent wetlands like this so they

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.460 
permanent wetlands like this so they

range quite a bit in how permanent they

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.980
