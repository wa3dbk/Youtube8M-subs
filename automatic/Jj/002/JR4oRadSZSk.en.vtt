00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.370
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.410
 little announcement video sorry if micro is 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.240
 less good it's my old micro level 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.240
 up to plug my my latest from 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.119
 convent the young and then shit everything 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 just one of the coup here it was 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.270
 just to tell you actually that there 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.600
 had a tournament pee wee man rubio 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.539
 better regulation on my forum so 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.439
 this is eyes finally I do not know actually 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 for now there are some 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.780
 participants and no matter the artists 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.250
 good I do not know how many there are 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.590
 registered for the moment but do not hesitate 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.450
 not to post them on Europe 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090
 I will try not to adapt myself to 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.360
 number of registered here is anyway this 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.329
 will be at 6 to 6 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.850
 and that will happen 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.620
 in short, what did you do? 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.659
 only rules for the tournament and 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.940
 wait i love you this is maybe a 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:57.429
 better idea to take them from a 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:02.070
 taken in front of me I worked on it so 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:03.510
 as much as the NATO as much use then 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.000
 the toys online go in come 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.400
 play online and then pokemon rubio 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.990
 but gaza virades down and then turnover 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.420
 in the bio but there you see 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.510
 beautiful image in front of green and two 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.880
 tracker then for the rules have had 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.250
 fear are forbidden so go of course 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.369
 the on the link that I will also put 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.140
 in the description of the video of the neck 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.270
 where you see all the media you 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 can not use precisely during 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.979
 the fights 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.619
 to avoid all the rage they were 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.950
 all if there is a disconnect the two 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 are eliminated the one who disconnect 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 and the one that does not disconnect the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.310
 two are eliminated unless you can 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.320
 to prove to me that just before it shakes 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.420
 it was you were winning 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.520
 blow I showed a small picture on the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.810
 forum in fact you just have to show 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.440
 the top screen when you see them 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.270
 poke ball 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.619
 so while you choose during 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.630
 your turn while you choose 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.820
 your attacks you wild pokÃ©ball and 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 those that are gray means that your 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.830
 pokemon is dead if ever your 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.390
 opponent disconnects just before the 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.970
 last round and that he already had two 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.070
 pokemon is dead you still had 3 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.660
 it's good you won so if you 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.020
 can you bring proof that you 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.020
 were winning 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.810
 my from ys connect city 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.160
 of the disconnect then you will pass 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.130
 you will still win 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.100
 this game after we have guys have good 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.260
 played but if now the guy was 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.050
 income and life is brief 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.570
 the other guy way we also go doctor 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.890
 motorcycle and I will try to compare by 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.370
 relation to the turn what is the 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:45.440
 last and I'll take the only one 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.340
 result after last turns possible 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.520
 simply believe 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 so here I hope it's clear for 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.770
 I do not say it's so clear 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.940
 do not know how many firefighters hours 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:57.950
 because I meet how many 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.480
 players will participate so that will depend 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.920
 of those who sign up but there you go 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.320
 that's it oh yes I forgot to 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.320
 specify this specified these are 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.300
 6 fights in six seconds is also that 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.500
 I have not presided to specify yet 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.750
 in the topic you owe 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.030
 save round fight you have 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.130
 saved the videos there was no 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.500
 disconnection of course you have to all 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.600
 backups and publish them on the net 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.730
 with a code so and you will have to me 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.350
 pass code 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.970
 in short there will be a topic for that of all 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.630
 way that's just the preparation and 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.700
