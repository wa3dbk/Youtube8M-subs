00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.670 
I didn't want to change that now the
next<00:03:10.670> question<00:03:10.819> also<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.600> do<00:03:11.870> I<00:03:11.930> like<00:03:12.230> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
next question also is do I like the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.129 
next question also is do I like the
effect<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.340> this<00:03:13.519> has<00:03:13.600> now<00:03:14.600> I'm<00:03:14.780> trying<00:03:15.079> to

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.139 
effect that this has now I'm trying to

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:17.470 
effect that this has now I'm trying to
use<00:03:15.319> this<00:03:15.530> artistic<00:03:15.950> kind<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.459> background<00:03:17.000> on

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
use this artistic kind of background on

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.129 
use this artistic kind of background on
my<00:03:18.170> site<00:03:18.560> and<00:03:19.090> you<00:03:20.090> know<00:03:20.209> it's<00:03:20.329> painting<00:03:20.840> that

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
my site and you know it's painting that

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.890 
my site and you know it's painting that
I<00:03:21.500> had<00:03:21.680> painted<00:03:22.069> years<00:03:22.430> ago<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.030> then<00:03:23.599> I<00:03:23.660> threw

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
I had painted years ago and then I threw

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.620 
I had painted years ago and then I threw
away<00:03:23.930> the<00:03:24.230> painting<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.209> so<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.299> question<00:03:26.599> is

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
away the painting and so the question is

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.089 
away the painting and so the question is
will<00:03:26.870> it<00:03:26.900> make<00:03:27.079> a<00:03:27.139> nice<00:03:27.410> website<00:03:27.709> though<00:03:28.069> I

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
will it make a nice website though I

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.949 
will it make a nice website though I
have<00:03:28.370> no<00:03:28.579> idea<00:03:28.880> I'm<00:03:29.060> just<00:03:29.120> kind<00:03:29.480> of<00:03:29.510> going<00:03:29.840> at

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
have no idea I'm just kind of going at

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.810 
have no idea I'm just kind of going at
this<00:03:30.109> and<00:03:30.440> just<00:03:30.650> hoping<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.340> something<00:03:31.609> good

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
this and just hoping that something good

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:32.710 
this and just hoping that something good
happens<00:03:32.329> here

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
happens here

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.350 
happens here
just<00:03:33.019> trying<00:03:33.229> to<00:03:33.259> show<00:03:33.350> you<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.680> process

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
just trying to show you the process

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.230 
just trying to show you the process
so<00:03:35.010> what<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> might<00:03:36.250> do<00:03:36.430> is<00:03:36.580> go<00:03:36.730> back<00:03:36.760> to<00:03:37.030> my

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
so what I might do is go back to my

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.480 
so what I might do is go back to my
flash<00:03:37.630> movie<00:03:38.050> here<00:03:38.290> and<00:03:38.740> then<00:03:39.070> turn<00:03:39.310> this

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
flash movie here and then turn this

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:41.550 
flash movie here and then turn this
eyeball<00:03:39.760> back<00:03:40.180> on<00:03:40.480> for<00:03:40.900> the<00:03:40.990> transparent

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
eyeball back on for the transparent

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.760 
eyeball back on for the transparent
overlay<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.670> I'll<00:03:43.000> select<00:03:43.420> it<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.960> I<00:03:44.560> will

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
overlay and I'll select it and I will

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:48.300 
overlay and I'll select it and I will
change<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.490> the<00:03:46.060> fill<00:03:46.300> color<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:47.110> white<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:48.190> now

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
change it the fill color to white so now

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.750 
change it the fill color to white so now
it's<00:03:48.490> white<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.930> it's<00:03:50.080> also<00:03:50.260> 67<00:03:51.220> percent

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
it's white but it's also 67 percent

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.570 
it's white but it's also 67 percent
transparent<00:03:52.720> and<00:03:52.960> so<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.040> what<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.370> looks

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
transparent and so this is what it looks

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.510 
transparent and so this is what it looks
like<00:03:54.850> with<00:03:55.660> a<00:03:55.690> white<00:03:56.110> transparency<00:03:57.100> on<00:03:57.250> that

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
think I like that the best to begin with

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.350
