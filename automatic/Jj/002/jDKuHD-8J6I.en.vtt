00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490 
Fortress 2 one important thing to note
is<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:10.950> tf2<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.000> CPU<00:00:12.480> intensive<00:00:12.630> game<00:00:13.170> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
is that tf2 is a CPU intensive game so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.079 
is that tf2 is a CPU intensive game so

the FPS 125 this essentially gives me a

minus one and I don't want it dropping
below<00:00:51.350> 120<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.590> I'm<00:00:52.649> having<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.039> 5<00:00:53.309> FPS<00:00:53.640> margin

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:55.939 
below 120 so I'm having it 5 FPS margin
this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> your<00:00:55.739> playing

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

the gameplay change it's okay when

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.179 
the gameplay change it's okay when

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
want to start winning in a 120 fps and

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210 
want to start winning in a 120 fps and
in<00:01:11.880> relation<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.420> as<00:01:12.659> well<00:01:13.070> actually<00:01:14.070> why

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
in relation to that as well actually why

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.140 
in relation to that as well actually why
I'm<00:01:14.369> using<00:01:14.640> 1680<00:01:15.210> x<00:01:15.420> 1050<00:01:15.869> monitor<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:17.490> 1610

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
I'm using 1680 x 1050 monitor in 1610

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.539 
I'm using 1680 x 1050 monitor in 1610
supposed<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> 69<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:19.950> other<00:01:20.100> hundred<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
supposed to 69 on the other hundred and

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.859 
supposed to 69 on the other hundred and
twenty<00:01:20.759> Hertz<00:01:20.880> displays<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.509> means<00:01:21.750> that

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
twenty Hertz displays which means that

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.830 
twenty Hertz displays which means that
it's<00:01:22.500> less<00:01:22.740> GPU<00:01:23.220> intensive<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.659> lower

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
it's less GPU intensive and the lower

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.090 
it's less GPU intensive and the lower
resolution<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.530> going<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> mean<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:25.890> have

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
resolution is going to mean I have

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.740 
resolution is going to mean I have
higher<00:01:26.369> FPS<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.540> matter<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
higher FPS and this is going to matter a

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.999 
higher FPS and this is going to matter a
lot<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.170> when<00:01:28.320> we<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> some<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:28.890> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
lot more when we get to some of the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.149 
lot more when we get to some of the
newer<00:01:29.220> games<00:01:29.460> coming<00:01:29.820> out<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.210> future

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
newer games coming out in the future

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.319 
newer games coming out in the future
you'll<00:01:32.159> also<00:01:32.310> be<00:01:32.549> wondering<00:01:32.880> why<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.299> not

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
you'll also be wondering why I'm not

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.289 
you'll also be wondering why I'm not
unlocking<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> FPS<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:35.280> essentially<00:01:35.970> because

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
unlocking the FPS is essentially because

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.210 
unlocking the FPS is essentially because
I<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.540> playing<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.930> stable<00:01:37.229> set<00:01:37.560> up<00:01:37.770> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
I like playing with a stable set up it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
I like playing with a stable set up it's
not<00:01:38.549> using<00:01:38.939> vsync<00:01:39.360> because<00:01:39.540> recent<00:01:39.960> ads

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
not using vsync because recent ads

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
not using vsync because recent ads
