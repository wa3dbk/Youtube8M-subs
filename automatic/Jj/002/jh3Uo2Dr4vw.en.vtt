00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
water because of the versatility of

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.390 
water because of the versatility of
water<00:04:30.490> many<00:04:31.180> necessary<00:04:31.840> nutrients<00:04:32.560> are<00:04:32.800> can

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
water many necessary nutrients are can

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.060 
water many necessary nutrients are can
be<00:04:33.539> resolved<00:04:34.539> in<00:04:34.659> blood<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:35.289> circulate<00:04:35.860> in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
be resolved in blood and circulate in

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.810 
be resolved in blood and circulate in
the<00:04:36.220> body<00:04:36.460> of<00:04:36.669> many<00:04:36.909> organisms<00:04:38.820> therefore

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
the body of many organisms therefore

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.740 
the body of many organisms therefore
because<00:04:40.750> of<00:04:40.900> all<00:04:41.139> those<00:04:41.650> four<00:04:42.539> circuits<00:04:43.539> of

because of all those four circuits of
water<00:04:44.610> water<00:04:45.610> is<00:04:46.800> significant<00:04:47.800> to<00:04:47.979> the

organisms that live in Earth and

therefore water makes life possible as

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.229 
therefore water makes life possible as
we<00:04:55.180> know<00:04:55.389> it<00:04:55.570> here<00:04:55.840> on<00:04:56.020> earth
