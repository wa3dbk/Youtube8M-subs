example<00:02:10.040> how<00:02:10.460> I<00:02:10.490> faked<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:11.030> with<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.240> third

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
example how I faked it with a third

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.120 
example how I faked it with a third
shooter<00:02:11.840> but<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.290> want<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.680> explain<00:02:12.920> how<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
shooter but I want to explain how you

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.970 
shooter but I want to explain how you
have<00:02:13.340> to<00:02:13.460> aim<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.270> when<00:02:14.480> you<00:02:14.630> do<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.320> taking

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
have to aim so when you do the taking

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.770 
have to aim so when you do the taking
with<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.280> first<00:02:16.550> shoot<00:02:16.670> at<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:16.970> end<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.540> also

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
with the first shoot at the end you also

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.390 
with the first shoot at the end you also
have<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.200> aim<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.620> you<00:02:18.770> would<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.040> with<00:02:19.310> the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
have to aim like you would do with the

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.640 
have to aim like you would do with the
first<00:02:19.640> shooter<00:02:19.970> and<00:02:20.150> after<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:20.840> did<00:02:21.020> that<00:02:21.050> you

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
first shooter and after you did that you

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:30.120 
first shooter and after you did that you
can<00:02:21.800> do<00:02:21.920> the<00:02:22.070> faking<00:02:22.430> part

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.120 

you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.340 

so<00:02:34.940> at<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.210> end<00:02:35.270> of<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.600> faking<00:02:35.930> section<00:02:36.260> I

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
so at the end of the faking section I

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.660 
so at the end of the faking section I
want<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.560> show<00:02:36.650> you<00:02:36.800> how<00:02:36.950> we<00:02:37.010> can<00:02:37.190> combine<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
want to show you how we can combine it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.430 
want to show you how we can combine it
so<00:02:38.210> first<00:02:38.540> I'm<00:02:38.690> going<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.930> fake<00:02:39.170> it<00:02:39.290> with<00:02:39.380> a

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
so first I'm going to fake it with a

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.800 
so first I'm going to fake it with a
second<00:02:39.830> shooter<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.340> right<00:02:41.180> after<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.510> I'm

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
second shooter and right after that I'm

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.300 
second shooter and right after that I'm
going<00:02:41.960> to<00:02:42.080> fake<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.440> with<00:02:42.560> a<00:02:42.620> third<00:02:42.920> shooter

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
going to fake it with a third shooter

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.130 
going to fake it with a third shooter
and<00:02:43.490> at<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.150> end<00:02:44.300> I'm<00:02:44.510> going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.810> take<00:02:44.990> the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
and at the end I'm going to take the

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.480 
and at the end I'm going to take the
free-kick<00:02:45.320> with<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.650> first<00:02:45.980> shooter<00:02:46.280> and<00:02:46.460> the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:46.490 
free-kick with a first shooter and the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.700 
free-kick with a first shooter and the
order<00:02:47.300> is<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.600> fixed<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.230> can<00:02:48.410> vary<00:02:48.620> the

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
order is not fixed so you can vary the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.440 
order is not fixed so you can vary the
order<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.520> you<00:02:49.550> can<00:02:49.790> start<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.270> first

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
order so you can start with the first

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.000 
order so you can start with the first
shooter<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.050> then<00:02:51.170> fake<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.440> with<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.770> third

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
shooter and then fake it with the third

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:03.030 
shooter and then fake it with the third
etc<00:02:52.430> so<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:53.330> can<00:02:53.570> be<00:02:53.690> creative

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.500 

so<00:03:04.040> now<00:03:04.189> we<00:03:04.250> come<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.519> layoffs<00:03:04.939> and<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.209> can<00:03:05.390> do

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
so now we come to layoffs and you can do

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.449 
so now we come to layoffs and you can do
them<00:03:05.750> high<00:03:05.959> or<00:03:06.230> low<00:03:06.439> in<00:03:06.650> this<00:03:06.859> case<00:03:07.069> i'm<00:03:07.219> doing

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
them high or low in this case i'm doing

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.759 
them high or low in this case i'm doing
a<00:03:07.579> low<00:03:07.790> layoffs<00:03:08.269> for<00:03:08.569> that<00:03:09.109> and<00:03:09.319> pressing<00:03:09.650> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
a low layoffs for that and pressing the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.220 
a low layoffs for that and pressing the
add<00:03:09.890> to<00:03:10.099> button<00:03:10.310> and<00:03:10.579> then<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.269> a<00:03:11.299> or<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.840> x

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
add to button and then the a or the x

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:20.250 
add to button and then the a or the x
button<00:03:12.500> to<00:03:12.709> do<00:03:12.829> a<00:03:12.859> pass<00:03:13.159> to<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.489> fourth<00:03:13.819> guy

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.830 

now<00:03:21.159> we<00:03:21.220> have<00:03:21.459> also<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.879> possibility<00:03:22.060> to<00:03:22.510> do

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
now we have also the possibility to do

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.020 
now we have also the possibility to do
high<00:03:23.049> levels<00:03:23.439> for<00:03:23.769> that<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:24.040> press<00:03:24.220> also<00:03:24.670> l2

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
high levels for that you press also l2

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.210 
high levels for that you press also l2
or<00:03:25.060> LT<00:03:25.689> and<00:03:25.930> then<00:03:26.349> you<00:03:26.500> press<00:03:26.680> the<00:03:27.040> lock<00:03:27.189> button

or LT and then you press the lock button

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.449 
or LT and then you press the lock button
so<00:03:27.879> X<00:03:28.209> or<00:03:28.510> a<00:03:28.569> square<00:03:29.049> and<00:03:29.319> this<00:03:29.769> can<00:03:30.010> result<00:03:30.159> in

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
so X or a square and this can result in

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.740 
so X or a square and this can result in
really<00:03:30.670> nice<00:03:30.879> goals

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.900 

all<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:37.590> stuff<00:03:37.860> that<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.070> showed<00:03:38.400> can<00:03:38.790> be

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
all that stuff that I showed can be

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.580 
all that stuff that I showed can be
combined<00:03:39.270> so<00:03:39.390> you<00:03:39.600> can<00:03:39.810> do<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.110> fake<00:03:40.320> shots

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
combined so you can do the fake shots

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.770 
combined so you can do the fake shots
and<00:03:40.800> then<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.310> layoffs<00:03:41.550> but<00:03:41.760> what<00:03:42.660> is

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
and then do the layoffs but what is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.110 
and then do the layoffs but what is
important<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.620> that<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:44.310> have<00:03:44.610> to<00:03:44.820> do<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
important is that you have to do the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.910 
important is that you have to do the
layoff<00:03:45.390> with<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.600> second<00:03:46.140> shooter<00:03:46.470> so<00:03:46.650> when<00:03:46.830> you

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
layoff with a second shooter so when you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.860 
layoff with a second shooter so when you
do<00:03:47.040> fake<00:03:47.310> shots<00:03:47.340> before<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.420> have<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.690> do<00:03:48.810> it

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
do fake shots before you have to do it
