00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 is very very very very good father a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.659
 option that is really sometimes useful 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.179
 in the photos put what is the date and 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.429
 the time like some digital cameras 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:38.160
 they do it to know at what moment they 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:40.589
 took the picture and it's pretty good what 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.600
 you can add if you want if you do not 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.550
 can deactivate or have it there only in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 photos that you want or need 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 that they have that option is very very 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.820
 good is a very easy and very tweet 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.940
 simple but really very useful ok and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 well before that the first thing that 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.390
 they have to have is been jailbroken in 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 your devices and do not know how to do it 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.649
 here you are appearing four 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.309
 videos of how to do the first two 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.430
 of the above are for the version of 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.350
 8.1 of me is so much 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.800
 to windows like for mac and both of 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.590
 below are for versions 8.1.1 and 8.1 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.140
 1.2 ok that are the latest versions of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.630
 I know you have to do the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.670
 jailbreak for 8.1 point 3 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.880
 there is no jailbreak what they have to do 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.560
 is to go down to 8.2 and do the jailbreak and 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.680
 for that I also have a video in my 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.119
 channel, find it there and good 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.680
 well once you follow the steps and what 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.720
 make any break 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.720

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.680

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:49.899

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.560
 done they get it the last one where 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.820
 says search and in search we are going to paste 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.550
 what this appearance in the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.410
 screen that is called photo times stamp 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.759

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.560
 green that is the one of the bid your hand ball 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.000
 at the top right he says to 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.640
 he tells me to modify you going to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.810
 put install confirm give it and ready 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.040
 That's all we have to do 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.500
 here 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.299
 and good this once they have it 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.470
 done so let's try it let's go 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.780
 take a picture 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.910
 let's take a picture you know that here 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.440
 we always have the star wars of 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.690
 photo proofs we take the photo and ready 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.850
 As you may realize, we are going to the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 photo to see it and how can they be 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:39.210
 account in the bottom there has what 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:42.450
 what is that this like this is this band-aid 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.540
 black as with blur and there you have the date 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.250
 and the time of the photo is there so that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.620
 see that in all your photos you can 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.690
 put what is the date and time is 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.910
 this you can put it on 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.040
 where they want that blues or can they 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.260
 deactivate it so that it does not come out at all 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 or only where you want ok and 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.100
 that we're going to see in the adjustments we 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.010
 let's go to the settings here of the 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.640
 from the ipad and we 're going to go where they are 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.100
 the tweets here are and we are going to photo 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.440
 stamp and the first is to activate it the 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.540
 second is for the background color what 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.060
 which is the black in which they saw the 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.320
 second is to see the transparency I 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.150
 I put it to zero so it looks 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.160
 transparent if you do not want to or if you want 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.530
 see it is totally black what can 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.430
 go through the color of the text I do not have 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.500
 blank but this 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.349
 with changing colors is totally 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.810
 configurable and that's where where they 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.790
 says where they want the text in the center 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.640
 to the left or to the right I have it 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.859
 to the right and ready others are other 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.769
 options of what is the typeface 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.840
 I believe and the size and others with others 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.959
 options that really do not occupy me just 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.879
 occupy the first four options ok and 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.680
 well that's all the truth tweet 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:55.680

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.819
