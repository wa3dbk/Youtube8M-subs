00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.680

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.680
A baseball!

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.240
Or like a soccer ball

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.820
You take this...and put it in here...

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.020
Roll it around

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.480

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
I did it!

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.780
Ah, you don't squeeze it, you roll it into a ball.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.320
Yeah, like that! Very good!

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.660
He might not be able to do it right now

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.020
Very good. You're better than mama.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.600
Okay, then put it in the topping you like.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:08.760

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480
Close your eyes!

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.160
No peeking!

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.620
They're so colorful!

00:05:23.353 --> 00:05:24.353
What's this one?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040
Almond powder

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.220
I want the pink one.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.060
These ones here are the ones you two made.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.480
This one right here is dangerous.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960
Mama I want a spoon.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
Could I have one too?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.900
