00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 early morning in the church where was 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.319
 refugee a part of women's men

 and children who have no longer lodgings 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.800
 because the state does not pay anymore they are at 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.360
 present in front of the church in their 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.980
 offering a bus to go elsewhere 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.560
 they do not want for the moment to be 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.449
 moved laughs laurent bonnart all 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.039
 actually jean-jacques the night was very 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.300
 short for this whole family since 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.949
 around 4 in the morning a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.960
 fire starting inside the church 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.090
 minimal here in the heart of 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 clermont ferrand on the place de jaude in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.230
 force the whole family to finish 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.230
 night outside in the cold at 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.660
 the ground under barnums open to 80 and 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.129
 under very light covers he 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.050
 is about two hundred people are 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.270
 asylum seekers in situation 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.680
 irregular or homeless 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.180
 a hundred children a hundred 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
 mostly school children 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.870
 in clermont schools ferrand and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.940
 who will have to make their return 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
 school like all little kids 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.559
 French in an hour and a half at 8:30 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 about then then these kids can only 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.260
 more be this family his children do not 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.629
 can be more logical because 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.250
 the association that manages the accommodation 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.080
 emergency in the capital of Auvergne 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.110
 no longer has the funds to 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.369
 pay urgent hotel nights in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 for all these people 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 this association did not receive the funds 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.560
 necessary from the prefecture and 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.270
 authorities 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
 the prefecture still promised a 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.229
 rapid solution a quarter must indeed 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.700
 arrive in a few minutes to 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.710
 drive all these people into a 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.750
 gym outside the city 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
 but associations are obviously not 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.920
 not happy that associations that is 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.439
 this person is hoping for a more solution 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 perennial and to a relocation for these 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.220
 families in apartments or in 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.610
 hotels in the city of clermont 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.200
 ferrand 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.000
 thank you and florent bonnart we are 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 with Marie Luce Penchard members of the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.270
 office of the local league 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.420
 human rights of clermont 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.450
 ferrand maryse bouchard hello state 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.890
 do not pay suddenly these men these 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.259
 women these children end up at the 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.790
 street 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.520
 I find on the street what is 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.580
 totally unworthy I recall that the 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.290
 region requests 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.450
 who do not shower like you 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.920
 say in an irregular situation some 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.320
 have just arrived they are in the process of 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.850
 procedure they did not house and they 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.310
 are in a regular situation on the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.460
 territory since they are in the running of 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.630
 procedures I correct them and simply 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.950
 others are actually snacks 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.780
 began steps to 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.210
 humanitarian adjustments 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.960
 they must be housed anyway 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.100
 emergency shelter and must be 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.380
 unconditional because they are 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.880
 men and women and children and 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.450
 the pit to sign the convention 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:34.570
 International Convention on the Rights of the Child 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.580
 a weight is a right what to say beings 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.320
 humans can not be left behind 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.510
 while we are in a rice company or 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.890
 even one even in times of crisis well 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.620
 we need to make more of 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.150
 solidarity then the conditions in 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.520
 which these families spent the 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.390
 night it's absolutely my adherents getting 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.430
 book in a 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.760
 in a city ​​like clermont 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.459
 ferrand the children are they were 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.900
 still at two in the morning do not sleep 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:04.330
 not to cry to scream 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.250
 so sleep somehow thanks to the 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.230
 mattress that france brought you 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.570
 everything and mobily all the associations 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.459
 mobilized around them but 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.769
 we demand that the state assume its 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.810
 responsibilities it's not because of 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.350
 the association anne is there 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.989
 problem 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.450
 it's because of the failure of 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.570
 guerville of the state in clermont ferrand 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.940

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.850
