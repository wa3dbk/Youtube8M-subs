shouldn't use CSS with tables you can

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.830 
shouldn't use CSS with tables you can
just<00:01:40.190> use<00:01:40.370> pure<00:01:40.730> CSS<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:42.160> personally<00:01:43.160> think<00:01:43.840> CSS

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
just use pure CSS I personally think CSS

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.290 
just use pure CSS I personally think CSS
mixed<00:01:45.440> with<00:01:45.620> tables<00:01:46.070> makes<00:01:46.970> a<00:01:47.120> great

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
mixed with tables makes a great

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.510 
mixed with tables makes a great
combination<00:01:47.980> the<00:01:48.980> cross-browser

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
combination the cross-browser

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.510 
combination the cross-browser
compatibility<00:01:49.630> is<00:01:50.630> not<00:01:50.810> very<00:01:51.080> hard<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:51.590> you

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
compatibility is not very hard and you

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.810 
compatibility is not very hard and you
get<00:01:52.670> a<00:01:52.700> lot<00:01:52.940> of<00:01:53.140> flexibility<00:01:54.140> but<00:01:54.920> different

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
get a lot of flexibility but different

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.360 
get a lot of flexibility but different
people<00:01:56.060> have<00:01:56.150> different<00:01:56.240> views<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.220> just<00:01:58.220> for

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
have a black border and I can also

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.759 
have a black border and I can also
remove<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.049> outer<00:02:34.349> border<00:02:34.890> from<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.879> table

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
remove this outer border from the table

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:40.729 
remove this outer border from the table
just<00:02:37.769> by<00:02:38.720> actually<00:02:39.720> changing<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.379> actual

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
just by actually changing the actual

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:50.190 
just by actually changing the actual
table<00:02:40.950> tag<00:02:41.340> 20

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.070 

and<00:02:50.319> see<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.190> removed<00:02:51.640> the<00:02:51.790> border

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
and see that removed the border

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.710 
and see that removed the border
just<00:02:53.710> change<00:02:53.890> border<00:02:54.400> equals<00:02:54.790> zero

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
just change border equals zero

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.340 
just change border equals zero
and<00:02:56.840> I'll<00:02:57.530> add<00:02:57.830> this<00:02:58.660> border<00:02:59.660> also<00:03:00.050> to<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
and I'll add this border also to the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:05.320 
and I'll add this border also to the
second<00:03:00.770> cell

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.660 

so<00:03:05.900> there<00:03:06.080> you<00:03:06.110> have<00:03:06.200> it<00:03:06.350> for<00:03:06.800> more<00:03:06.950> CSS<00:03:07.400> code

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
so there you have it for more CSS code

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.010 
so there you have it for more CSS code
