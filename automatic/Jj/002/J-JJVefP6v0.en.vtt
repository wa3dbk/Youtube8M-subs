00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100 
first thing I want to clear up from the
beginning<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:12.389> if<00:00:12.599> you<00:00:12.630> guys<00:00:12.780> saw<00:00:12.990> my

a<00:00:15.630> lot<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.199> people<00:00:16.379> were<00:00:16.529> trolling<00:00:16.740> me<00:00:16.920> and

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
a lot of people were trolling me and

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.769 
a lot of people were trolling me and
super<00:00:17.369> pissed<00:00:17.609> because<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.970> did<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.270> know<00:00:18.330> what

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
super pissed because I did not know what

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.040 
super pissed because I did not know what
the<00:00:18.900> zero<00:00:19.460> 326<00:00:20.460> was<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:20.939> want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.720> explain<00:00:21.990> that

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the zero 326 was I want to explain that

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.359 
the zero 326 was I want to explain that
before<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.560> into<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> review<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
before I get into the review so the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.529 
before I get into the review so the
reason<00:00:23.580> why<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.730> thought<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.180> because<00:00:24.420> it

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
reason why I thought that is because it

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.140 
reason why I thought that is because it
looks<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.170> limited<00:00:25.609> sign<00:00:26.609> normally

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
looks like it's a limited sign normally

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.580 
looks like it's a limited sign normally
when<00:00:27.300> Nike<00:00:27.449> does<00:00:27.720> limited<00:00:28.050> things<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> says

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
when Nike does limited things it says

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.220 
when Nike does limited things it says
what<00:00:29.310> number<00:00:29.820> over<00:00:30.269> whatever<00:00:30.510> else<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.109> so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
what number over whatever else it is so

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.260 
what number over whatever else it is so
I<00:00:31.260> thought<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.740> number<00:00:31.890> three<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.340> 26

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
I thought this was number three of 26

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.080 
I thought this was number three of 26
the<00:00:33.809> reason<00:00:34.230> why<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> was<00:00:34.860> led<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.850> think

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the reason why I was led on to think

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.340 
the reason why I was led on to think
that<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.450> that's<00:00:36.570> why<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.899> thrown<00:00:37.170> off

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that and that's why I was thrown off

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
that and that's why I was thrown off
completely<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> videos<00:00:38.460> because

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
completely in the videos because

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
completely in the videos because
somebody<00:00:39.719> had<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> pair<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.379> these<00:00:40.530> signed<00:00:40.890> by

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
somebody had a pair of these signed by

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.520 
somebody had a pair of these signed by
Tinker<00:00:41.370> Hatfield<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.719> was<00:00:42.930> thinking<00:00:43.110> for

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
Tinker Hatfield and I was thinking for

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
Tinker Hatfield and I was thinking for
some<00:00:43.680> crazy<00:00:43.980> reason<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.570> gave<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.350> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
some crazy reason that they gave like a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.610 
some crazy reason that they gave like a
certain<00:00:46.800> number<00:00:46.950> these<00:00:47.219> with<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.059> date<00:00:48.360> and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
certain number these with the date and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
certain number these with the date and
the<00:00:49.620> number<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> inside<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> number

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the number on the inside or the number

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.270 
the number on the inside or the number
on<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> inside<00:00:51.989> not<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> date<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.890> obviously

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
on the inside not the date it obviously

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.819 
on the inside not the date it obviously
represents<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> date<00:00:54.230> 326<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.500> Air<00:00:55.620> Max

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
represents a date 326 which is Air Max

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
represents a date 326 which is Air Max
Day<00:00:56.070> but<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.520> thought<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.329> number<00:00:57.719> so

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
Day but I thought that was a number so

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.099 
Day but I thought that was a number so
this<00:00:58.109> was<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.500> number<00:00:58.859> three<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.280> 26<00:00:59.879> of

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
this was the number three of 26 of

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.900 
this was the number three of 26 of
Tinker<00:01:01.109> Hatfield<00:01:01.140> signed<00:01:01.829> models<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.879> I

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
Tinker Hatfield signed models so then I

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
Tinker Hatfield signed models so then I
immediately<00:01:03.149> looked<00:01:03.570> around<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> shoe<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
immediately looked around the shoe to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.270 
immediately looked around the shoe to
trying<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> find<00:01:04.650> an<00:01:04.739> autograph<00:01:05.129> or<00:01:05.220> something

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
trying to find an autograph or something

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.980 
trying to find an autograph or something
like<00:01:05.519> that<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:06.420> why<00:01:06.659> there<00:01:06.900> was

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
like that that is why there was

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.810 
like that that is why there was
confusion<00:01:07.350> on<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.890> anybody<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.250> was

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
confusion on that so anybody that was

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.390 
confusion on that so anybody that was
curious<00:01:09.180> about<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:10.189> unboxing<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> why<00:01:11.369> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
curious about that unboxing and why I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.880 
curious about that unboxing and why I
didn't<00:01:11.670> know<00:01:11.729> what<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.439> 326<00:01:13.439> was<00:01:13.619> it's

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
video to watch for an informative view

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
video to watch for an informative view
of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.829> sneaker<00:01:32.189> these<00:01:32.909> ones<00:01:33.180> are<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> full

of the sneaker these ones are the full

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.780 
of the sneaker these ones are the full
reviews<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.310> wanted<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> throw<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
reviews so I just wanted to throw that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.710 
reviews so I just wanted to throw that
out<00:01:35.939> there<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.210> get<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.659> way

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
out there and get that out of the way

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080 
out there and get that out of the way
first<00:01:36.930> things<00:01:37.140> first<00:01:37.229> but<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.159> Air<00:01:38.280> Max<00:01:38.490> 0<00:01:38.880> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
first things first but the Air Max 0 is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.880 
first things first but the Air Max 0 is
basically<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:39.930> before<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.530> that's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
basically the one before the one that's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.140 
basically the one before the one that's
what<00:01:41.009> they<00:01:41.130> call<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:42.060> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
what they call it that's what it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.429 
what they call it that's what it
actually<00:01:42.270> says<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> inside<00:01:43.170> I'll<00:01:43.380> show

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
actually says on the inside I'll show

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.370 
actually says on the inside I'll show
you<00:01:43.590> guys<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> real<00:01:44.070> quick<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> Box<00:01:45.899> Air<00:01:46.170> Max

you guys it's real quick the Box Air Max
0<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.070> then<00:01:48.060> Air<00:01:48.390> Max<00:01:48.600> zero<00:01:49.470> quick-strike

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
0 and then Air Max zero quick-strike

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.520 
0 and then Air Max zero quick-strike
150<00:01:51.810> on<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.020> box<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.560> then<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.610> inside<00:01:54.530> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
150 on the box and then on the inside it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.709 
150 on the box and then on the inside it
even<00:01:55.770> says<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.159> here<00:01:56.460> though<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.509> one

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
even says it on here though the one

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.990 
even says it on here though the one
before<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.729> it<00:01:59.880> has

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
before the one so the and then it has

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.520 
before the one so the and then it has
teacher<00:02:00.299> Hatfield<00:02:00.689> signature<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> as

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
teacher Hatfield signature on that as

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:01.880 
teacher Hatfield signature on that as
well

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
well

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.920 
well
so<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.640> concept<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.149> these<00:02:03.299> are<00:02:03.509> is<00:02:03.570> these<00:02:03.750> are

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
so the concept of these are is these are

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
so the concept of these are is these are
the<00:02:04.020> ones<00:02:04.200> that<00:02:04.350> came<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.799> before<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.729> Air

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the ones that came out before the Air

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.139 
the ones that came out before the Air
Max<00:02:06.290> one<00:02:07.290> which<00:02:07.680> are<00:02:07.860> these<00:02:08.129> ones<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.520> you'll

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
Max one which are these ones so you'll

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.520 
Max one which are these ones so you'll
see<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.509> there<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:09.690> some<00:02:09.929> similarities

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
see that there are some similarities

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.140 
see that there are some similarities
between<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:11.009> two<00:02:11.220> models<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
between these two models the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.170 
between these two models the
big<00:02:13.420> notable<00:02:14.280> similarity<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.760> differences

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
big notable similarity not differences

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.940 
big notable similarity not differences
similarity<00:02:16.569> is<00:02:16.720> the<00:02:16.989> midsole<00:02:17.440> as<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.650> can<00:02:17.769> see

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
similarity is the midsole as you can see

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.580 
similarity is the midsole as you can see
it's<00:02:18.790> pretty<00:02:18.909> much<00:02:19.060> exactly<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.690> same<00:02:19.989> with

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
it's pretty much exactly the same with

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.789 
it's pretty much exactly the same with
the<00:02:20.860> air<00:02:21.220> pocket<00:02:21.700> and<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:23.019> pretty<00:02:23.680> much

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
the air pocket and and pretty much

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.070 
the air pocket and and pretty much
everything<00:02:24.099> else<00:02:24.190> but<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.690> kind<00:02:26.019> of

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
everything else but that is kind of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.199 
everything else but that is kind of
where<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.560> ends<00:02:27.459> as<00:02:27.580> soon<00:02:27.730> as<00:02:27.819> you<00:02:27.909> flip<00:02:28.090> it

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
where it ends as soon as you flip it

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.300 
where it ends as soon as you flip it
over<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.510> look<00:02:28.599> at<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:28.780> bottom<00:02:29.129> this<00:02:30.129> is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
over and look at the bottom this is

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.789 
over and look at the bottom this is
totally<00:02:30.610> like<00:02:30.849> a<00:02:30.909> retool<00:02:31.329> difference<00:02:31.959> you

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
totally like a retool difference you

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.229 
totally like a retool difference you
could<00:02:32.890> see<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.250> air<00:02:33.670> pocket<00:02:34.090> down<00:02:34.180> here

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
could see the the air pocket down here

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.710 
could see the the air pocket down here
visible<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.209> see<00:02:37.360> it<00:02:37.480> kind<00:02:37.659> of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
visible and you can see it kind of

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.830 
visible and you can see it kind of
recesses<00:02:38.019> right<00:02:38.290> here<00:02:38.519> as<00:02:39.519> well<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:40.390> so

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
recesses right here as well and so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.479 
recesses right here as well and so
that's<00:02:40.989> totally<00:02:41.680> different<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.159> it's<00:02:42.310> kind<00:02:42.459> of

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
that's totally different so it's kind of

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.710 
that's totally different so it's kind of
cool<00:02:42.670> that<00:02:42.700> they<00:02:42.879> did<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.060> midsole<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:43.540> same

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
cool that they did a midsole the same

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.890 
cool that they did a midsole the same
but<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:43.959> sole<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.319> different<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.540> think

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
but the sole is different and I think

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.539 
but the sole is different and I think
that<00:02:47.349> again<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.799> if<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.950> don't<00:02:48.099> know<00:02:48.220> what

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
that again so if you don't know what

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.130 
that again so if you don't know what
this<00:02:48.730> means<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.510> one<00:02:49.690> before<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.109> one

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
this means it's the one before the one

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.720 
this means it's the one before the one
meaning<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.220> kind<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.459> like<00:02:51.579> the

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
meaning this is kind of like the

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.640 
meaning this is kind of like the
prototype<00:02:52.060> that<00:02:52.569> supposedly<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.410> tinkerer

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
prototype that supposedly that tinkerer

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.580 
prototype that supposedly that tinkerer
had<00:02:53.970> like<00:02:54.970> non<00:02:55.510> visible<00:02:55.810> for<00:02:56.290> thirty<00:02:56.500> years

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
had like non visible for thirty years

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.949 
had like non visible for thirty years
and<00:02:57.010> then<00:02:58.000> this<00:02:58.120> year<00:02:58.180> is<00:02:58.480> the<00:02:58.599> year<00:02:58.629> where

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
and then this year is the year where

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.420 
and then this year is the year where
like<00:02:59.230> they<00:02:59.379> decided<00:02:59.799> to<00:02:59.829> like<00:02:59.980> pull<00:03:00.220> it<00:03:00.340> out

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
like they decided to like pull it out

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.869 
like they decided to like pull it out
show<00:03:00.970> people<00:03:01.299> one<00:03:02.109> of<00:03:02.230> the<00:03:02.409> the<00:03:02.950> prototype

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
show people one of the the prototype

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.149 
show people one of the the prototype
models<00:03:04.269> more<00:03:04.510> or<00:03:04.599> less<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.010> shoe

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
models more or less of the the shoe

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.009 
models more or less of the the shoe
before<00:03:06.519> the<00:03:06.640> Air<00:03:06.760> Max<00:03:06.879> one<00:03:07.090> came<00:03:07.269> out<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.750> I

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
before the Air Max one came out and I

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.030 
before the Air Max one came out and I
thought<00:03:08.170> that<00:03:08.319> was<00:03:08.409> kind<00:03:08.560> of<00:03:08.590> a<00:03:08.680> cool<00:03:08.829> concept

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
thought that was kind of a cool concept

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.309 
thought that was kind of a cool concept
if<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.489> think<00:03:09.700> about<00:03:09.849> it<00:03:10.030> Mikey<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.049> Jordan

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
if you think about it Mikey and Jordan

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.349 
if you think about it Mikey and Jordan
Brian<00:03:11.500> both<00:03:11.709> can<00:03:11.920> just<00:03:12.099> go<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.640> do<00:03:12.879> this<00:03:13.060> like

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
Brian both can just go and do this like

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.710 
Brian both can just go and do this like
endlessly<00:03:13.870> because<00:03:14.709> they<00:03:14.950> could<00:03:15.129> have<00:03:15.310> a

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
endlessly because they could have a

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.990 
endlessly because they could have a
fabled<00:03:16.799> sample<00:03:17.799> that<00:03:17.950> we've<00:03:18.069> seen<00:03:18.400> images<00:03:18.819> of

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
fabled sample that we've seen images of

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.180 
fabled sample that we've seen images of
here<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:19.329> there<00:03:19.480> for<00:03:20.049> random<00:03:20.500> sneakers<00:03:20.950> and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
here and there for random sneakers and

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.280 
here and there for random sneakers and
then<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:21.910> release<00:03:22.180> them<00:03:22.419> and<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:23.049> would<00:03:23.139> be

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
then just release them and it would be

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:24.809 
then just release them and it would be
like<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.620> prototype<00:03:24.130> version<00:03:24.459> released<00:03:24.730> to

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
like the prototype version released to

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:25.289 
like the prototype version released to
the<00:03:24.910> public

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
the public

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.120 
the public
the<00:03:25.750> demand<00:03:26.049> is<00:03:26.200> already<00:03:26.440> there<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.889> shoe

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
the demand is already there for the shoe

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.539 
the demand is already there for the shoe
and<00:03:27.430> gives<00:03:28.180> somebody<00:03:28.419> a<00:03:28.569> chance<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.549> like

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
and gives somebody a chance to like

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.009 
and gives somebody a chance to like
capture<00:03:30.970> some<00:03:31.120> of<00:03:31.180> the<00:03:31.239> history<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.810> of

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
capture some of the history of the of

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.460 
capture some of the history of the of
the<00:03:32.470> sneakers<00:03:32.889> in<00:03:33.459> particular<00:03:34.000> like<00:03:34.319> like<00:03:35.319> the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
the sneakers in particular like like the

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.490 
the sneakers in particular like like the
Tokyo<00:03:35.769> five<00:03:36.239> yellow<00:03:37.239> toes<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.690> I<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:37.930> like

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
Tokyo five yellow toes that I have like

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.839 
Tokyo five yellow toes that I have like
if<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:38.739> release<00:03:39.129> those<00:03:39.370> with<00:03:39.609> the<00:03:39.730> yellow

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
if they release those with the yellow

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.490 
if they release those with the yellow
toe<00:03:40.090> people<00:03:40.329> would<00:03:40.419> probably<00:03:40.660> freak<00:03:40.720> out<00:03:40.930> so

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
toe people would probably freak out so

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.920 
toe people would probably freak out so
there's<00:03:41.680> there's<00:03:42.099> in<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.669> just<00:03:43.329> the<00:03:43.540> obsidian

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
there's there's in the just the obsidian

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.390 
there's there's in the just the obsidian
Foamposites<00:03:44.500> which<00:03:44.620> I<00:03:44.709> have<00:03:44.829> a<00:03:44.859> sample<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.280> as

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
Foamposites which I have a sample of as

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.430 
Foamposites which I have a sample of as
well<00:03:45.549> those<00:03:46.239> people<00:03:46.840> would<00:03:47.079> probably<00:03:47.379> freak

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
well those people would probably freak

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.039 
well those people would probably freak
out<00:03:47.620> if<00:03:47.769> they<00:03:47.889> released<00:03:48.389> just<00:03:49.389> because<00:03:49.750> it<00:03:49.930> was

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
out if they released just because it was

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.740 
out if they released just because it was
like<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.440> sample<00:03:50.889> and<00:03:51.190> and<00:03:51.819> then<00:03:52.510> all<00:03:52.629> of<00:03:52.660> a

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
like a sample and and then all of a

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.720 
like a sample and and then all of a
sudden<00:03:52.780> they<00:03:53.109> they<00:03:53.290> make<00:03:53.470> kind<00:03:53.769> of<00:03:53.859> a<00:03:53.949> big<00:03:54.579> deal

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
sudden they they make kind of a big deal

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.039 
sudden they they make kind of a big deal
I<00:03:54.849> think<00:03:55.180> that's<00:03:55.419> kind<00:03:55.599> of<00:03:55.660> what<00:03:55.780> they<00:03:55.900> did

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
I think that's kind of what they did

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.930 
I think that's kind of what they did
with<00:03:56.199> this<00:03:56.379> I'm<00:03:57.160> surprised<00:03:57.459> they<00:03:57.609> didn't<00:03:57.790> do<00:03:57.910> a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
with this I'm surprised they didn't do a

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.110 
with this I'm surprised they didn't do a
bigger<00:03:58.359> release<00:03:58.690> than<00:03:59.139> what<00:03:59.349> they<00:03:59.440> did<00:04:00.120> like

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
bigger release than what they did like

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.589 
bigger release than what they did like
with<00:04:01.389> the<00:04:01.569> air<00:04:01.810> air<00:04:02.319> max<00:04:02.560> Muir<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.480> Maury<00:04:04.480> or

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
with the air air max Muir a Maury or

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:05.879 
with the air air max Muir a Maury or
whatever<00:04:05.019> the<00:04:05.109> hell<00:04:05.230> they<00:04:05.349> call<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:05.620> don't<00:04:05.769> know

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
whatever the hell they call I don't know

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.069 
whatever the hell they call I don't know
that<00:04:06.099> even<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.970> call<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.329> there's<00:04:07.780> an<00:04:07.900> inside

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
that even to call it there's an inside

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.199 
that even to call it there's an inside
the<00:04:08.199> other<00:04:08.319> like<00:04:08.549> those<00:04:09.549> ones<00:04:09.849> were<00:04:10.060> like

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
the other like those ones were like

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.180 
the other like those ones were like
limited<00:04:10.660> like<00:04:11.139> quick<00:04:11.349> strikes<00:04:11.620> from<00:04:12.040> the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
limited like quick strikes from the

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.890 
limited like quick strikes from the
beginning<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:12.849> every<00:04:13.480> sense<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.810> they

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
beginning and then every sense and they

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.170 
beginning and then every sense and they
just<00:04:14.049> mass-produce<00:04:14.650> them<00:04:14.919> so<00:04:15.099> I'm<00:04:15.639> curious<00:04:15.940> if

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
just mass-produce them so I'm curious if

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.250 
just mass-produce them so I'm curious if
they'll<00:04:16.329> do<00:04:16.449> the<00:04:16.539> same<00:04:16.570> thing<00:04:16.870> with<00:04:16.959> air<00:04:17.079> max

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
they'll do the same thing with air max

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.599 
they'll do the same thing with air max
zero<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.590> have<00:04:17.709> a<00:04:17.829> feeling<00:04:18.130> they<00:04:18.190> probably<00:04:18.400> will

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
zero I have a feeling they probably will

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.699 
zero I have a feeling they probably will
to<00:04:19.030> some<00:04:19.180> extent<00:04:19.570> but<00:04:20.049> it<00:04:20.139> is<00:04:20.229> kind<00:04:20.410> of<00:04:20.470> cool<00:04:20.590> to

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
to some extent but it is kind of cool to

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.469 
to some extent but it is kind of cool to
get<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> first<00:04:21.130> colorway<00:04:21.549> that<00:04:22.360> they

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
get the first colorway that they

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.300 
get the first colorway that they
released<00:04:22.810> and<00:04:23.110> in<00:04:23.320> general<00:04:23.680> just<00:04:23.710> one<00:04:24.070> to<00:04:24.190> add

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
released and in general just one to add

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.500 
released and in general just one to add
to<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.550> collection<00:04:24.669> for<00:04:24.969> myself<00:04:25.330> as<00:04:25.479> a

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
to the collection for myself as a

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.490 
to the collection for myself as a
collector<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
collector the

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.310 
collector the
one<00:04:26.830> of<00:04:26.920> those<00:04:26.980> pieces<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.430> I<00:04:27.580> would<00:04:27.760> go<00:04:27.880> for

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
one of those pieces that I would go for

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.480 
one of those pieces that I would go for
that's<00:04:29.320> reason<00:04:29.620> why<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:29.740> got<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:30.130> some<00:04:30.280> people

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
that's reason why I got it some people

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.820 
that's reason why I got it some people
like<00:04:30.640> only<00:04:31.000> by<00:04:31.120> hype<00:04:31.390> sneakers<00:04:31.870> but<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.590> that

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
like only by hype sneakers but it that

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.350 
like only by hype sneakers but it that
best<00:04:33.100> stuff<00:04:33.280> cracks<00:04:33.550> me<00:04:33.670> up<00:04:33.760> because<00:04:33.820> you<00:04:34.150> you

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
best stuff cracks me up because you you

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.700 
best stuff cracks me up because you you
see<00:04:34.540> some<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:34.870> stuff<00:04:35.050> I<00:04:35.140> have<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.470> nobody

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
see some of the stuff I have that nobody

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.070 
see some of the stuff I have that nobody
else<00:04:35.830> has<00:04:36.090> and<00:04:37.090> nobody<00:04:37.360> else<00:04:37.660> cares<00:04:37.870> about

else has and nobody else cares about

else has and nobody else cares about
except<00:04:38.500> for<00:04:38.650> myself<00:04:38.980> probably<00:04:39.720> everything<00:04:40.720> is

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
except for myself probably everything is

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.000 
except for myself probably everything is
what<00:04:41.050> it<00:04:41.140> is<00:04:41.230> you<00:04:41.350> know<00:04:41.440> it's<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.770> stuff<00:04:41.950> like

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
what it is you know it's just stuff like

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.490 
what it is you know it's just stuff like
that<00:04:42.220> happens<00:04:42.490> but<00:04:42.550> anyway<00:04:42.820> the<00:04:43.810> back<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.410> the

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
that happens but anyway the back to the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.690 
that happens but anyway the back to the
shoes

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
shoes

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.880 
shoes
this<00:04:46.210> one<00:04:46.450> is<00:04:46.660> more<00:04:46.840> of<00:04:46.960> like<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.110> sock<00:04:47.380> liner<00:04:47.620> as

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
this one is more of like a sock liner as

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.620 
this one is more of like a sock liner as
you<00:04:48.310> can<00:04:48.460> see<00:04:48.640> they<00:04:49.150> went<00:04:49.330> with<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.600> whole

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
you can see they went with the whole

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.060 
you can see they went with the whole
sock<00:04:49.930> liner<00:04:50.140> thing<00:04:50.320> obviously<00:04:50.740> this<00:04:50.890> is

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
sock liner thing obviously this is

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.160 
sock liner thing obviously this is
different<00:04:51.640> way<00:04:51.790> different<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.330> has<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:52.810> tongue

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.170 
different way different and has a tongue

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.060 
different way different and has a tongue
and<00:04:53.760> this<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:54.940> a<00:04:54.970> dope<00:04:55.480> version<00:04:56.260> of<00:04:56.380> the<00:04:56.560> airmax

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
and this is a dope version of the airmax

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.740 
and this is a dope version of the airmax
one<00:04:57.520> as<00:04:57.670> well<00:04:57.820> I<00:04:57.850> really<00:04:58.090> like<00:04:58.240> that<00:04:58.480> that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
one as well I really like that that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.720 
one as well I really like that that
wheat<00:04:58.990> colorway<00:04:59.380> but<00:04:59.560> I<00:04:59.919> like<00:05:00.160> kind<00:05:00.520> of<00:05:00.610> like

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
wheat colorway but I like kind of like

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:03.020 
wheat colorway but I like kind of like
how<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.060> has<00:05:01.210> this<00:05:01.390> interesting<00:05:01.930> like<00:05:02.110> side

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
how it has this interesting like side

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.310 
how it has this interesting like side
stuff<00:05:04.030> here<00:05:04.300> whatever<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.780> is<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:05.169> looks

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
stuff here whatever this is it looks

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.080 
stuff here whatever this is it looks
like<00:05:05.470> it's<00:05:05.620> almost<00:05:05.770> incomplete<00:05:06.340> kind<00:05:06.910> of<00:05:07.000> like

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
like it's almost incomplete kind of like

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.870 
like it's almost incomplete kind of like
a<00:05:07.120> prototype<00:05:07.390> type<00:05:07.840> and<00:05:08.080> then<00:05:08.410> the<00:05:09.400> materials

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
a prototype type and then the materials

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.760 
a prototype type and then the materials
on<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.090> toe<00:05:10.240> box<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.720> stuff<00:05:10.900> is<00:05:11.110> not<00:05:11.290> like

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
on the toe box and stuff is not like

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.580 
on the toe box and stuff is not like
hyper<00:05:12.070> fuse<00:05:12.540> here<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:13.750> like<00:05:13.990> it<00:05:14.140> is<00:05:14.290> kind<00:05:14.560> of

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
hyper fuse here but like it is kind of

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.159 
hyper fuse here but like it is kind of
around<00:05:14.800> the<00:05:15.160> sides<00:05:15.430> here<00:05:15.820> so<00:05:15.970> it's<00:05:16.870> like<00:05:16.930> they

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
around the sides here so it's like they

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.930 
around the sides here so it's like they
it<00:05:17.530> was<00:05:17.650> like<00:05:17.860> original<00:05:18.310> prototype<00:05:18.669> but<00:05:18.850> then

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
it was like original prototype but then

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.210 
it was like original prototype but then
they<00:05:19.030> like<00:05:19.240> revamped<00:05:19.600> it<00:05:19.810> with<00:05:20.220> newer

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:21.220 
they like revamped it with newer

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.250 
they like revamped it with newer
technology<00:05:21.910> because<00:05:22.240> hyper<00:05:22.690> fuse<00:05:22.960> wasn't

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
technology because hyper fuse wasn't

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.800 
technology because hyper fuse wasn't
available<00:05:23.470> 30<00:05:23.890> years<00:05:24.100> ago<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:25.210> probably<00:05:25.570> knew

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
available 30 years ago and probably knew

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.120 
available 30 years ago and probably knew
there<00:05:25.960> was<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.080> sock<00:05:26.380> liner<00:05:26.560> type<00:05:26.860> so<00:05:27.010> they

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
there was a sock liner type so they

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.800 
there was a sock liner type so they
probably<00:05:27.280> changed<00:05:27.970> it<00:05:28.150> up<00:05:28.210> quite<00:05:28.450> a<00:05:28.480> bit<00:05:28.660> and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
probably changed it up quite a bit and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.500 
probably changed it up quite a bit and
then<00:05:29.230> just<00:05:29.890> for<00:05:30.340> reference<00:05:30.669> I<00:05:31.000> mean<00:05:31.150> this<00:05:31.300> is

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
then just for reference I mean this is

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.300 
then just for reference I mean this is
the<00:05:31.630> one<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.900> came<00:05:32.050> after<00:05:32.470> the<00:05:32.680> Air<00:05:32.830> Max<00:05:33.010> one

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
the one that came after the Air Max one

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.180 
the one that came after the Air Max one
so<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.640> was<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.910> Air<00:05:34.030> Max<00:05:34.150> 0<00:05:34.419> the<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.200> max<00:05:35.530> 1<00:05:35.919> and

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
so it was the Air Max 0 the a max 1 and

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.520 
so it was the Air Max 0 the a max 1 and
then<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.760> big<00:05:36.940> one<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.630> dropped<00:05:37.900> I<00:05:38.229> mean

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
then the big one that dropped I mean

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.780 
then the big one that dropped I mean
well<00:05:38.890> the<00:05:38.950> one<00:05:39.070> that's<00:05:39.220> like<00:05:39.370> that's<00:05:39.550> more<00:05:39.700> of

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
well the one that's like that's more of

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.000 
well the one that's like that's more of
a<00:05:39.850> cult<00:05:40.030> classic<00:05:40.120> today<00:05:40.600> is<00:05:40.780> their<00:05:41.290> Max<00:05:41.530> 90<00:05:41.979> I

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
a cult classic today is their Max 90 I

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.560 
a cult classic today is their Max 90 I
think<00:05:42.310> this<00:05:42.760> is<00:05:42.910> the<00:05:43.000> one<00:05:43.150> that<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.330> would

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
think this is the one that I would

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:45.420 
think this is the one that I would
choose<00:05:43.750> out<00:05:44.110> of<00:05:44.380> the<00:05:44.470> three<00:05:44.710> models<00:05:45.070> if<00:05:45.190> I<00:05:45.280> had

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
choose out of the three models if I had

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.030 
choose out of the three models if I had
to<00:05:45.580> just<00:05:45.790> because<00:05:46.060> for<00:05:46.090> me<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:47.110> Air<00:05:47.229> Max<00:05:47.380> 90<00:05:47.800> is

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
to just because for me the Air Max 90 is

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.490 
to just because for me the Air Max 90 is
just<00:05:48.640> a<00:05:48.729> super<00:05:49.030> dope<00:05:49.210> model<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.169> then<00:05:50.260> the<00:05:50.350> Air

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
just a super dope model and then the Air

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.770 
just a super dope model and then the Air
Max<00:05:50.680> 95<00:05:51.070> is<00:05:51.490> another<00:05:51.729> one<00:05:51.910> that<00:05:52.030> that's<00:05:52.270> a<00:05:52.570> fan

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
Max 95 is another one that that's a fan

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.770 
Max 95 is another one that that's a fan
favorite<00:05:53.140> at<00:05:53.590> least<00:05:53.800> for<00:05:53.890> myself<00:05:54.660> what<00:05:55.660> do<00:05:55.720> you

favorite at least for myself what do you

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:56.700 
favorite at least for myself what do you
guys<00:05:55.840> think<00:05:55.900> I'll<00:05:56.169> go<00:05:56.229> ahead<00:05:56.290> and<00:05:56.440> put<00:05:56.530> the<00:05:56.590> on

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
guys think I'll go ahead and put the on

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:58.469 
guys think I'll go ahead and put the on
foot<00:05:56.950> section<00:05:57.280> right<00:05:58.000> here<00:05:58.030> what<00:05:58.270> do<00:05:58.330> you<00:05:58.390> guys

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 
foot section right here what do you guys

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:00.990 
foot section right here what do you guys
think<00:05:58.660> about<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.870> model<00:05:59.200> though<00:05:59.320> a<00:05:59.560> sock<00:06:00.130> put

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000 
think about the model though a sock put

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.690 
think about the model though a sock put
set<00:06:01.300> aside<00:06:01.540> all<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:01.780> hype<00:06:02.020> and<00:06:02.610> what<00:06:03.610> do<00:06:03.669> you

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
set aside all the hype and what do you

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.280 
set aside all the hype and what do you
think<00:06:03.910> about<00:06:04.000> the<00:06:04.180> actual<00:06:04.510> model<00:06:04.900> like<00:06:05.140> I

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
think about the actual model like I

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.070 
think about the actual model like I
think<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:06.669> design<00:06:06.850> is<00:06:07.210> just<00:06:07.240> simplistic

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
think that the design is just simplistic

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.810 
think that the design is just simplistic
it's<00:06:08.260> nothing<00:06:08.530> too<00:06:08.650> too<00:06:09.130> crazy<00:06:09.370> and<00:06:09.580> if<00:06:09.729> you

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820 
it's nothing too too crazy and if you

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.850 
it's nothing too too crazy and if you
were<00:06:09.940> like<00:06:10.240> a<00:06:10.270> even<00:06:11.229> if<00:06:11.320> you<00:06:11.410> feel<00:06:11.620> like<00:06:11.830> a

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
were like a even if you feel like a

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.219 
were like a even if you feel like a
retired<00:06:12.310> sneaker<00:06:12.729> person<00:06:13.150> that<00:06:13.630> you<00:06:13.750> really

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
retired sneaker person that you really

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.870 
retired sneaker person that you really
focus<00:06:14.590> on<00:06:14.740> sneakers<00:06:15.070> you're<00:06:15.460> in<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:15.729> you're

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 
focus on sneakers you're in and you're

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.430 
focus on sneakers you're in and you're
out<00:06:15.910> and<00:06:16.240> then<00:06:16.630> you<00:06:16.720> saw<00:06:16.900> these<00:06:17.110> ones<00:06:17.350> you

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 
out and then you saw these ones you

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.750 
out and then you saw these ones you
would<00:06:17.530> probably<00:06:17.830> think<00:06:17.919> nothing<00:06:18.280> fancy<00:06:18.669> of

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:18.760 
would probably think nothing fancy of

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.150 
would probably think nothing fancy of
them<00:06:18.930> but<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:19.960> like<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:20.620> fact<00:06:20.740> that<00:06:20.950> they<00:06:21.040> have

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 
them but I like the fact that they have

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.430 
them but I like the fact that they have
Tinker<00:06:21.550> Hatfield<00:06:21.610> branding<00:06:22.419> all<00:06:23.110> over<00:06:23.320> the

Tinker Hatfield branding all over the

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.490 
Tinker Hatfield branding all over the
shoe<00:06:23.680> I<00:06:23.919> really<00:06:24.190> like<00:06:24.310> that<00:06:24.490> they<00:06:24.580> sold<00:06:24.850> his

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
shoe I really like that they sold his

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.960 
shoe I really like that they sold his
signature<00:06:26.500> and<00:06:26.890> sold<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.280> story<00:06:27.520> of<00:06:27.760> his

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
signature and sold the story of his

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.100

creation<00:06:28.450> because<00:06:28.720> he's<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:28.990> one<00:06:29.020> that

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
creation because he's the one that

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.170 
creation because he's the one that
created<00:06:29.290> the<00:06:29.530> Air<00:06:30.100> Max<00:06:30.310> obviously<00:06:30.850> he's<00:06:31.000> also

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
created the Air Max obviously he's also

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.290 
created the Air Max obviously he's also
the<00:06:31.360> one<00:06:31.450> that's<00:06:31.630> created<00:06:32.610> many<00:06:33.610> many<00:06:33.880> of<00:06:34.120> the

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
the one that's created many many of the

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.570 
the one that's created many many of the
the<00:06:34.539> best<00:06:34.750> Jordans<00:06:35.440> out<00:06:35.560> there<00:06:35.740> Jordan<00:06:35.979> 3's<00:06:36.340> I

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
the best Jordans out there Jordan 3's I

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.990 
the best Jordans out there Jordan 3's I
think<00:06:37.270> fours<00:06:37.479> fives<00:06:37.780> 11s<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.590> so<00:06:39.130> on

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
think fours fives 11s and so on

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.540 
think fours fives 11s and so on
so<00:06:40.810> he's<00:06:41.290> a<00:06:41.320> long-standing<00:06:41.860> tradition<00:06:42.070> within

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
so he's a long-standing tradition within

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.970 
so he's a long-standing tradition within
Nike<00:06:43.000> and<00:06:43.210> within<00:06:43.810> Jordan<00:06:44.290> Brannan<00:06:44.650> he<00:06:44.740> really

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
Nike and within Jordan Brannan he really

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.850 
Nike and within Jordan Brannan he really
helped<00:06:45.220> start<00:06:45.670> a<00:06:45.970> lot<00:06:46.630> of<00:06:46.750> it<00:06:46.870> with<00:06:47.050> the<00:06:47.530> window

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
helped start a lot of it with the window

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.620 
helped start a lot of it with the window
that<00:06:48.430> we<00:06:48.610> saw<00:06:48.850> in<00:06:49.510> the<00:06:49.720> air<00:06:49.840> max<00:06:50.050> won<00:06:50.410> and<00:06:50.710> now

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 
that we saw in the air max won and now

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.810 
that we saw in the air max won and now
we're<00:06:52.630> seeing<00:06:52.810> in<00:06:53.140> 2015<00:06:54.040> in<00:06:54.220> the<00:06:54.280> air<00:06:54.430> max<00:06:54.580> zero

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.700
