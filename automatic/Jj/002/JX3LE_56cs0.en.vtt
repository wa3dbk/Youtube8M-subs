now Nix it's incredible how you blended
the<00:00:46.070> shelves<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:46.579> how'd<00:00:46.730> you<00:00:46.760> do<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
the shelves and how'd you do that

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.790 
the shelves and how'd you do that
we<00:00:47.780> actually<00:00:47.929> came<00:00:48.260> up<00:00:48.319> with<00:00:48.469> a<00:00:48.589> technique

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
we actually came up with a technique

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.770 
we actually came up with a technique
using<00:00:49.339> a<00:00:49.370> laser<00:00:49.609> pointer<00:00:49.940> what<00:00:50.269> we<00:00:50.359> do<00:00:50.539> is<00:00:50.659> we

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
using a laser pointer what we do is we

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.049 
using a laser pointer what we do is we
mark<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.199> line<00:00:51.409> for<00:00:51.890> perspective<00:00:52.519> and<00:00:52.789> we<00:00:52.879> base

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
mark a line for perspective and we base

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.509 
mark a line for perspective and we base
it<00:00:53.239> up<00:00:53.329> with<00:00:53.449> my<00:00:53.600> height<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.159> we've<00:00:55.309> also

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
it up with my height and then we've also

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.959 
it up with my height and then we've also
kind<00:00:56.269> of<00:00:56.329> check<00:00:56.569> our<00:00:56.749> work<00:00:56.960> by<00:00:57.760> looking<00:00:58.760> at<00:00:58.850> the

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
kind of check our work by looking at the

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:00.610 
kind of check our work by looking at the
image<00:00:59.059> to<00:00:59.390> kind<00:00:59.569> of<00:00:59.629> see<00:00:59.870> where<00:01:00.109> we're<00:01:00.229> at<00:01:00.409> with

image to kind of see where we're at with

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.599 
image to kind of see where we're at with
this<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.039> you<00:01:01.129> keep<00:01:01.219> taking<00:01:01.489> pictures

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
this so you keep taking pictures

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:03.369 
this so you keep taking pictures
throughout<00:01:02.030> see<00:01:02.629> how<00:01:02.809> you're<00:01:02.960> doing<00:01:03.199> because

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
what it does is it actually takes a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.030 
what it does is it actually takes a
three-dimensional<00:01:05.449> image<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.990> flattens<00:01:06.920> it

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
three-dimensional image and flattens it

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.899 
three-dimensional image and flattens it
out<00:01:07.220> now<00:01:08.000> I<00:01:08.030> gotta<00:01:08.420> say<00:01:08.690> wiser<00:01:09.190> you've<00:01:10.190> done<00:01:10.820> an

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
circles right well yeah it's it's one of

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.760 
circles right well yeah it's it's one of
the<00:01:16.640> more<00:01:16.820> difficult<00:01:17.060> things<00:01:17.420> because<00:01:18.230> you

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
the more difficult things because you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.200 
the more difficult things because you
know<00:01:18.800> right<00:01:19.190> on<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> very<00:01:19.640> front<00:01:19.940> yeah

they're circles but as you get around

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.010 
they're circles but as you get around
the<00:01:22.070> curvature<00:01:22.460> of<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:22.790> body<00:01:23.060> like<00:01:23.570> you'll

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
the curvature of the body like you'll

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.570 
the curvature of the body like you'll
notice<00:01:24.290> some<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.590> them<00:01:24.830> are<00:01:24.950> elongated

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
notice some of them are elongated

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.790 
notice some of them are elongated
especially<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.210> this<00:01:26.480> side<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.230> about<00:01:27.500> Lake

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
especially on this side and about Lake

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.680 
especially on this side and about Lake
they're<00:01:28.160> not<00:01:28.340> even<00:01:28.610> circles<00:01:29.060> at<00:01:29.240> all<00:01:29.390> they're

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
they're not even circles at all they're

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.050 
they're not even circles at all they're
actually<00:01:30.170> whole<00:01:30.410> sections<00:01:31.100> that<00:01:31.430> when<00:01:31.700> viewed

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
actually whole sections that when viewed

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.390 
actually whole sections that when viewed
from<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.360> certain<00:01:32.720> angle<00:01:33.170> look<00:01:33.770> like<00:01:33.920> a<00:01:33.950> perfect

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
from a certain angle look like a perfect

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.250 
from a certain angle look like a perfect
circle<00:01:34.730> one<00:01:35.330> of<00:01:35.420> the<00:01:35.480> big<00:01:35.600> challenges<00:01:36.050> with

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
circle one of the big challenges with

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.320 
circle one of the big challenges with
doing<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.830> camouflage<00:01:37.190> is<00:01:37.400> that<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.060> notice

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
doing the camouflage is that you notice

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.420 
doing the camouflage is that you notice
the<00:01:38.420> little<00:01:38.540> pieces<00:01:38.780> of<00:01:38.960> tape<00:01:39.260> in<00:01:39.890> order<00:01:40.310> to

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
the little pieces of tape in order to

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.130 
the little pieces of tape in order to
make<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.700> work<00:01:40.970> successfully<00:01:41.510> we<00:01:41.930> have<00:01:42.050> to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
make it work successfully we have to

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.750 
make it work successfully we have to
make<00:01:42.320> sure<00:01:42.530> that<00:01:42.710> every<00:01:43.160> single<00:01:43.490> time<00:01:43.730> she

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
make sure that every single time she

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.150 
make sure that every single time she
goes<00:01:44.180> right<00:01:44.570> back<00:01:44.780> in<00:01:44.990> a<00:01:45.050> position<00:01:45.320> because

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
goes right back in a position because

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.890 
goes right back in a position because
even<00:01:46.430> if<00:01:46.550> she<00:01:46.730> shifts<00:01:47.090> a<00:01:47.180> little<00:01:47.300> bit<00:01:47.450> than<00:01:47.810> it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
even if she shifts a little bit than it

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.040 
even if she shifts a little bit than it
changes<00:01:48.350> everything<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.160> whole<00:01:49.250> perspective

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
changes everything the whole perspective

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.940 
changes everything the whole perspective
interesting<00:01:51.050> this<00:01:51.140> is<00:01:51.350> probably<00:01:51.650> one<00:01:51.800> of<00:01:51.830> the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
interesting this is probably one of the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.060 
interesting this is probably one of the
hardest<00:01:52.340> things<00:01:52.910> for<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.330> body<00:01:53.780> paint<00:01:54.110> model<00:01:54.380> to

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
hardest things for a body paint model to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.950 
hardest things for a body paint model to
stand<00:01:55.370> for<00:01:55.640> because<00:01:55.820> she<00:01:56.240> has<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.720> stay

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
stand for because she has to stay

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.930 
stand for because she has to stay
exactly<00:01:57.140> in<00:01:57.740> that<00:01:57.800> position<00:01:58.070> the<00:01:58.460> whole<00:01:58.700> time

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
exactly in that position the whole time

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.910 
exactly in that position the whole time
