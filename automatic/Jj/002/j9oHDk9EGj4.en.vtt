00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
friend went away thinking that he

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.879

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
have personal experience of that as well

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.159 
have personal experience of that as well
and<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:56.639> pricing<00:04:57.090> is<00:04:57.210> reasonable<00:04:57.720> this<00:04:57.900> one

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
and the pricing is reasonable this one

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:04.130 
and the pricing is reasonable this one
checks<00:04:58.919> in<00:04:59.190> at<00:04:59.490> 21<00:05:00.560> 995<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.979> think<00:05:02.310> somewhere

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
checks in at 21 995 I think somewhere

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.140 
checks in at 21 995 I think somewhere
in<00:05:05.070> white<00:05:05.780> it<00:05:06.780> comes<00:05:07.140> in<00:05:07.410> at<00:05:07.650> about<00:05:07.940> $500<00:05:08.940> more

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
in white it comes in at about $500 more

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.180 
in white it comes in at about $500 more
but<00:05:09.420> that's<00:05:09.600> because<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.230> white<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.890> in

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
but that's because the white is in

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.029 
but that's because the white is in
pearlescent<00:05:11.880> while<00:05:12.720> black<00:05:13.350> is

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
pearlescent while black is

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.579 
pearlescent while black is
so<00:05:15.699> there<00:05:15.849> you<00:05:15.879> go<00:05:15.969> if<00:05:16.719> you'd<00:05:16.990> like<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.439> go<00:05:17.559> a
