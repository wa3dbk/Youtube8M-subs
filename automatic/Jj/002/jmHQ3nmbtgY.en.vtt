00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
by my opposition and this game it was

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.819 
by my opposition and this game it was
just<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.750> stressful<00:01:28.080> look<00:01:28.320> at<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> you

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
should be catching that keeper and it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.999 
should be catching that keeper and it
almost<00:01:30.869> gives<00:01:31.020> my<00:01:31.229> opponent<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> chance<00:01:31.650> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
almost gives my opponent a chance to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.770 
almost gives my opponent a chance to
score<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.729> he<00:01:32.759> did<00:01:33.150> pull<00:01:33.299> off<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:33.600> there<00:01:33.750> a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
score but he did pull off and there a

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.240 
score but he did pull off and there a
few<00:01:33.900> save<00:01:34.229> now<00:01:34.409> on<00:01:34.500> them<00:01:34.619> but<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.890> honest

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
few save now on them but to be honest

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.230

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
for 20k
what<00:01:36.810> can<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.079> really<00:01:37.259> expect<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> 20k<00:01:38.159> team
