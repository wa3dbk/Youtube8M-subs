00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.420 
this I was thinking you know what I
think<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.299> time<00:03:09.569> that<00:03:09.599> I<00:03:10.130> decided<00:03:11.130> what<00:03:11.400> I

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
think it's time that I decided what I

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.670 
think it's time that I decided what I
was<00:03:11.549> gonna<00:03:11.640> do<00:03:11.819> with<00:03:11.849> the<00:03:12.120> other<00:03:12.150> videos<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.810> I
