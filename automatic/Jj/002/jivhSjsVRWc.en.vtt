access that can be done one or two ways
using<00:01:02.829> your<00:01:03.100> bio<00:01:03.309> blaster<00:01:03.999> ozone<00:01:04.420> machine

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
using your bio blaster ozone machine

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.110 
using your bio blaster ozone machine
what<00:01:05.530> we've<00:01:05.710> done<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.070> we've<00:01:06.220> set<00:01:06.549> the<00:01:06.700> ozone

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
what we've done is we've set the ozone

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.750 
what we've done is we've set the ozone
generator<00:01:07.150> up<00:01:07.990> we've<00:01:08.799> hooked<00:01:09.010> up<00:01:09.220> our<00:01:09.370> timer

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
generator up we've hooked up our timer

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.540 
generator up we've hooked up our timer
and<00:01:10.090> now<00:01:10.600> we're<00:01:10.840> using<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.470> large<00:01:11.800> cold<00:01:12.340> air

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
and now we're using a large cold air

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.300 
and now we're using a large cold air
return<00:01:13.090> great<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:14.200> first<00:01:14.470> method<00:01:14.890> is<00:01:14.950> just<00:01:15.190> to

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
return great the first method is just to

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.080 
return great the first method is just to
set<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.610> bio<00:01:15.970> blaster<00:01:16.630> with<00:01:16.810> its<00:01:16.990> output<00:01:17.290> end

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
set the bio blaster with its output end

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.800 
set the bio blaster with its output end
facing<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.930> cold<00:01:20.200> air<00:01:20.470> great<00:01:21.100> and<00:01:21.670> what<00:01:22.660> we're

facing the cold air great and what we're

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.030 
facing the cold air great and what we're
going<00:01:23.050> to<00:01:23.140> do<00:01:23.350> is<00:01:23.820> turn<00:01:24.820> up<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:26.080> bio<00:01:26.380> blaster
