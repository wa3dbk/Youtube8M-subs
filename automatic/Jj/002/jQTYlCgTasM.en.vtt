so<00:00:14.700> definitely<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.360> strapped<00:00:15.719> with

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
so definitely this one strapped with

so definitely this one strapped with
more<00:00:16.170> about<00:00:16.439> controlling<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.220> mass<00:00:17.490> media

more about controlling the mass media

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.730 
more about controlling the mass media

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
and once again being very political

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
and once again being very political
about<00:00:20.250> just<00:00:20.580> how<00:00:20.700> to<00:00:20.760> go<00:00:20.939> about<00:00:21.029> these<00:00:21.390> things

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
about just how to go about these things

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.560 
about just how to go about these things
and<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.590> actually<00:00:23.189> defeat<00:00:23.669> the<00:00:24.210> royal

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
and can they actually defeat the royal

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.269 
and can they actually defeat the royal
government<00:00:24.960> when<00:00:25.259> they<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.590> total<00:00:25.980> control

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
government when they have total control

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.279 
government when they have total control
over<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.029> media<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.689> what<00:00:27.930> people's

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
over the media and what people's

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.839 
over the media and what people's
perceptions<00:00:28.829> are<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> it's<00:00:29.640> kind<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
perceptions are and it's kind of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.220 
perceptions are and it's kind of
interesting<00:00:30.060> because<00:00:30.269> this<00:00:30.779> really

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
interesting because this really

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.380 
interesting because this really
correlates<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.800> how<00:00:31.890> real<00:00:32.189> life<00:00:32.220> goes<00:00:32.699> as<00:00:32.940> far

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
correlates to how real life goes as far

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.200 
correlates to how real life goes as far
as<00:00:33.480> like<00:00:33.690> even<00:00:34.350> if<00:00:34.470> it's<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> truth<00:00:35.070> if<00:00:35.430> it's

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
as like even if it's the truth if it's

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.420 
as like even if it's the truth if it's
not<00:00:36.540> portrayed<00:00:37.080> as<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.470> truth<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.980> it's<00:00:38.160> just

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
not portrayed as the truth if it's just

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
not portrayed as the truth if it's just
done<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.879> perception<00:00:39.510> of<00:00:39.600> somebody<00:00:39.989> else's

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
done in perception of somebody else's

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.840 
done in perception of somebody else's
word<00:00:40.949> against<00:00:41.370> yours

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
word against yours

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
word against yours
ultimately<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.960> truth<00:00:43.260> sometimes<00:00:43.800> won't

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
ultimately the truth sometimes won't

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.640 
ultimately the truth sometimes won't
even<00:00:44.430> take<00:00:44.970> effect<00:00:45.330> in<00:00:45.479> it<00:00:45.629> in<00:00:45.780> a<00:00:46.170> sense<00:00:46.440> won't

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
even take effect in it in a sense won't

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.920 
even take effect in it in a sense won't
even<00:00:46.860> matter<00:00:47.040> because<00:00:47.250> if<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:48.299> King<00:00:48.540> you<00:00:48.839> know

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
even matter because if the King you know

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660 
even matter because if the King you know
regardless<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.500> how<00:00:49.589> fucked<00:00:49.890> up<00:00:50.040> he<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.339> if<00:00:50.489> his

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
regardless of how fucked up he is if his

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
regardless of how fucked up he is if his
word<00:00:50.909> is<00:00:51.089> on<00:00:51.330> and<00:00:51.690> he<00:00:52.080> controls<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.619> media<00:00:52.739> and

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
word is on and he controls the media and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920 
word is on and he controls the media and
he<00:00:53.400> could<00:00:53.610> T's<00:00:53.850> perception<00:00:54.479> of<00:00:54.540> what<00:00:54.690> people

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
he could T's perception of what people

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
he could T's perception of what people
think<00:00:55.080> then<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.650> really<00:00:55.799> doesn't<00:00:56.010> matter<00:00:56.220> so

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
think then it really doesn't matter so

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.700 
think then it really doesn't matter so
this<00:00:57.089> was<00:00:57.330> really<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.659> struggle<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:58.379> getting

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this was really a struggle about getting

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.469 
this was really a struggle about getting
the<00:00:58.799> word<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.729> people<00:00:59.909> so<00:01:00.449> that

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:00.479 
the word out there to the people so that

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.630 
the word out there to the people so that
the<00:01:00.720> people<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:01.229> understand<00:01:01.680> ultimately<00:01:02.400> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the people can understand ultimately the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.640 
the people can understand ultimately the
truth<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.150> see<00:01:03.390> who's<00:01:03.869> really<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> right

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
truth and see who's really in the right

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.140 
truth and see who's really in the right
and<00:01:04.860> who's<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> wrong<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.030> can

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
and who's in the wrong and you can

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.310 
and who's in the wrong and you can
definitely<00:01:06.270> see<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.570> everyone's<00:01:07.020> head<00:01:07.200> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
definitely see that everyone's head is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.960 
definitely see that everyone's head is
on<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.560> chopping<00:01:07.799> block<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.490> at<00:01:08.700> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
on the chopping block because at the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.219 
on the chopping block because at the
other<00:01:09.090> day<00:01:09.240> they<00:01:09.390> want<00:01:09.600> somebody<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.110> take

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
other day they want somebody to take

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
other day they want somebody to take
responsibility<00:01:11.070> for<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.610> happened

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
responsibility for what has happened

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.520 
responsibility for what has happened
and<00:01:12.330> what<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> survey<00:01:12.960> courts<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.350> been

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
and what the survey courts have been

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
and what the survey courts have been
doing<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.340> ultimately<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:14.939> like

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
doing and they ultimately look like

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.219 
doing and they ultimately look like
they're<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.479> take<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.750> blame<00:01:15.930> out<00:01:16.110> on

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
they're going to take the blame out on

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.120 
they're going to take the blame out on
him<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.680> look<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:16.920> they've<00:01:17.100> been

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
him like they look like they've been

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
him like they look like they've been
fucking<00:01:17.670> him<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.149> they're<00:01:18.509> probably

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
fucking him up and they're probably

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.349 
fucking him up and they're probably
going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> execute<00:01:19.619> him<00:01:19.829> very<00:01:20.159> soon<00:01:20.429> and<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:21.359 
going to execute him very soon and I

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.240 
going to execute him very soon and I
mean<00:01:21.659> nobody<00:01:22.140> is<00:01:22.320> really<00:01:22.649> close<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
mean nobody is really close to

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.940 
mean nobody is really close to
ultimately<00:01:24.210> saving<00:01:24.719> him<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.289> this<00:01:25.679> could

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
ultimately saving him so this could

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.489 
ultimately saving him so this could
definitely<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.820> end<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.270> her<00:01:27.570> won<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.020> how

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:28.499 
definitely be the end of her won and how

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:30.709 
definitely be the end of her won and how
ironic<00:01:28.710> would<00:01:29.249> it<00:01:29.280> be<00:01:29.520> though<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.939> he<00:01:29.999> did<00:01:30.509> die

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
ironic would it be though if he did die

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.569 
ironic would it be though if he did die
one<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.770> man<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.249> willing<00:01:32.429> to

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
one it's the man that's willing to

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.300 
one it's the man that's willing to
sacrifice<00:01:32.759> anything<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.659> save<00:01:33.869> humanity

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
sacrifice anything to save humanity

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
sacrifice anything to save humanity
ultimately<00:01:35.310> dies<00:01:35.729> at<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.119> hands<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.570> humanity

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
ultimately dies at the hands of humanity

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.480 
ultimately dies at the hands of humanity
that<00:01:37.200> would<00:01:37.320> be<00:01:37.409> ironic<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:38.009> fucked<00:01:38.249> up<00:01:38.399> in

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
that would be ironic and fucked up in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.700 
that would be ironic and fucked up in
two<00:01:38.609> souls<00:01:38.850> sometimes<00:01:39.479> how<00:01:39.630> stupid<00:01:40.170> Humanity

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
two souls sometimes how stupid Humanity

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
two souls sometimes how stupid Humanity
is<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.039> other<00:01:41.130> day<00:01:41.479> unless<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
is at the other day unless the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.719 
is at the other day unless the
government<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.159> kingdom<00:01:44.609> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
government and the kingdom and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
government and the kingdom and
everything<00:01:45.090> knows<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:46.140> there's<00:01:46.380> no<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.859> out

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
everything knows that there's no way out

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.709 
everything knows that there's no way out
of<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> feeding<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.939> titans<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.420> everything

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
of the feeding of titans and everything

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:49.700 
of the feeding of titans and everything
and<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.899> why<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.289> give<00:01:49.469> a<00:01:49.499> fuck

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
and that's why they don't give a fuck

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.380 
and that's why they don't give a fuck
it's<00:01:49.859> like<00:01:49.979> let<00:01:50.159> us<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.429> pull<00:01:50.700> within<00:01:51.240> these

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's like let us just pull within these

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.940 
it's like let us just pull within these
walls<00:01:51.420> if<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.929> allow<00:01:52.140> us<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.560> then

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
walls if they allow us to then

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.169 
walls if they allow us to then
ultimately<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.609> they're<00:01:53.700> doing<00:01:53.969> it's<00:01:54.119> a

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
ultimately what they're doing it's a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.599 
ultimately what they're doing it's a
stupid<00:01:54.719> selfish<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.590> ignorant<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.399> fuck

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
stupid selfish and ignorant as fuck

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.090 
stupid selfish and ignorant as fuck
because<00:01:56.789> why<00:01:57.389> would<00:01:57.749> you<00:01:58.020> face<00:01:58.859> yourself

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
because why would you face yourself

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.039 
because why would you face yourself
against<00:01:59.700> your<00:01:59.939> ally<00:02:00.389> because<00:02:00.569> all<00:02:00.929> of

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
humanity should be allies at this

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.340 
humanity should be allies at this
particular<00:02:02.639> point<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.299> why<00:02:03.719> would<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.020> do

there that Kenny is an Akron and the way
it<00:02:28.230> will<00:02:28.350> set<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.680> kind<00:02:28.830> of<00:02:28.860> makes<00:02:29.070> me<00:02:29.220> wonder

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
it will set it kind of makes me wonder

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.820 
it will set it kind of makes me wonder
could<00:02:30.120> she<00:02:30.300> already<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.690> who<00:02:30.810> Kenny<00:02:31.050> is<00:02:31.350> I

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
could she already know who Kenny is I

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.500 
could she already know who Kenny is I
doubt<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.340> because<00:02:32.490> I<00:02:32.850> mean<00:02:33.060> it<00:02:33.300> just

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
doubt that because I mean it just

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.030 
doubt that because I mean it just
doesn't<00:02:33.810> seem<00:02:33.900> likely<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.680> then<00:02:34.860> that<00:02:35.010> also

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
doesn't seem likely but then that also

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.500 
doesn't seem likely but then that also
makes<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.460> wonder<00:02:35.640> okay<00:02:35.940> what<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.390> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
makes you wonder okay what is the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.940 
makes you wonder okay what is the
connection<00:02:36.930> because<00:02:36.990> when<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.380> seen<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.740> cost

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
connection because when we seen the cost

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.440 
connection because when we seen the cost
in<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> beginning<00:02:38.580> it<00:02:38.820> seemed<00:02:39.090> as<00:02:39.210> though<00:02:39.240> her

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
in the beginning it seemed as though her

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.760 
in the beginning it seemed as though her
family<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.900> know<00:02:39.990> that<00:02:40.140> was<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.260> family<00:02:40.740> I

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
family you know that was a family I

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.710 
family you know that was a family I
don't<00:02:40.980> think<00:02:41.160> she<00:02:41.340> was<00:02:41.490> adopted<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:42.540> anything

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
don't think she was adopted or anything

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.300 
don't think she was adopted or anything
like<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.470> it<00:02:43.590> makes<00:02:43.740> you<00:02:43.830> wonder<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.220> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
like that so it makes you wonder what is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.130 
like that so it makes you wonder what is

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
prove what they said so while it was a

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.840 
prove what they said so while it was a
good<00:03:43.440> move<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.830> a<00:03:43.920> sense<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.250> get<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.520> people

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
good move in a sense to get the people

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.820 
good move in a sense to get the people
knowing<00:03:45.209> about<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.690> ultimately<00:03:46.320> is<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
knowing about it ultimately is not the

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.100 
knowing about it ultimately is not the
entirety<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:48.240> know<00:03:48.330> everyone<00:03:48.780> inside<00:03:49.050> the

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
entirety of you know everyone inside the

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.260 
entirety of you know everyone inside the
wall<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.370> military<00:03:50.610> police<00:03:51.030> we've

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
wall so the military police we've

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.000 
wall so the military police we've
already<00:03:51.420> seen<00:03:51.810> them<00:03:52.020> be<00:03:52.140> fucked<00:03:52.470> up<00:03:52.620> before

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
already seen them be fucked up before

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.110 
already seen them be fucked up before
like<00:03:53.190> they'll<00:03:53.340> do<00:03:53.490> whatever<00:03:53.640> it<00:03:53.850> takes<00:03:53.970> to

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
like they'll do whatever it takes to

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.330 
like they'll do whatever it takes to
control<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.500> ultimately<00:03:55.890> get<00:03:56.100> what<00:03:56.220> they

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
control and ultimately get what they

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.010 
control and ultimately get what they
want<00:03:56.610> they'll<00:03:56.970> just<00:03:57.180> kill<00:03:57.360> everyone<00:03:57.600> in<00:03:57.840> there

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
want they'll just kill everyone in there

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.600 
want they'll just kill everyone in there
so<00:03:58.230> they're<00:03:58.560> basically<00:03:58.860> in<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.130> race<00:03:59.250> for<00:03:59.430> time

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
so they're basically in a race for time

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.890 
so they're basically in a race for time
because<00:03:59.940> they<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.180> to<00:04:00.300> get<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.570> story<00:04:00.840> out

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
because they have to get the story out

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.420 
because they have to get the story out
immediately<00:04:01.290> if<00:04:01.650> not<00:04:01.680> all<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.310> would<00:04:02.400> take

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
immediately if not all it would take

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.620 
immediately if not all it would take
would<00:04:02.670> be<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.030> government<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.510> basically

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
would be for the government to basically

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.870 
would be for the government to basically
come<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.110> kill<00:04:04.709> everyone<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.340> then<00:04:05.520> you<00:04:05.820> know

come in kill everyone and then you know

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.460 
come in kill everyone and then you know
it<00:04:06.060> won't<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:06.390> to<00:04:06.420> where<00:04:06.690> so<00:04:06.810> they<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.350> need

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
it won't go to where so they really need

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.650 
it won't go to where so they really need
to<00:04:07.500> get<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:07.860> story<00:04:08.070> out<00:04:08.190> ASAP<00:04:08.760> even<00:04:09.239> if<00:04:09.330> Ponzi

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
ultimately we did get a little bit of

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.080 
ultimately we did get a little bit of
progression<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.130> this<00:04:38.250> one<00:04:38.460> basically<00:04:38.789> people

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
progression to this one basically people

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.370

finding<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.950> that's<00:04:40.130> what<00:04:40.700> needs<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.030> be

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.280 
finding out and that's what needs to be
done<00:04:41.360> because<00:04:41.450> ultimately<00:04:41.810> right<00:04:42.170> now

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
done because ultimately right now

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.390 
done because ultimately right now
everybody's<00:04:42.680> looking<00:04:42.890> like<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.070> circuit

different<00:05:21.770> reviews<00:05:22.250> attack<00:05:23.000> on<00:05:23.150> Titan

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
different reviews attack on Titan

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.670 
different reviews attack on Titan
doesn't<00:05:23.600> feel<00:05:23.690> like<00:05:23.750> attack<00:05:24.020> on<00:05:24.170> Titan<00:05:24.440> as<00:05:24.530> of

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
doesn't feel like attack on Titan as of

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.800 
doesn't feel like attack on Titan as of
right<00:05:24.800> now<00:05:25.010> it<00:05:25.250> really<00:05:25.580> feels<00:05:25.730> more<00:05:26.150> like<00:05:26.300> it's

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
right now it really feels more like it's

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.300 
right now it really feels more like it's
taking<00:05:27.260> some<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.650> elements<00:05:27.920> of<00:05:28.070> what<00:05:28.220> it

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
taking some of the elements of what it

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.980 
taking some of the elements of what it
was<00:05:28.490> and<00:05:28.790> kind<00:05:28.940> of<00:05:29.090> wanted<00:05:29.330> a<00:05:29.420> political<00:05:29.570> route

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
was and kind of wanted a political route

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.290 
was and kind of wanted a political route
for<00:05:30.230> now<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.680> I'm<00:05:31.070> really<00:05:31.370> hoping<00:05:31.880> that<00:05:31.940> we<00:05:32.060> do

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
for now and I'm really hoping that we do

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.940 
for now and I'm really hoping that we do
get<00:05:32.480> back<00:05:32.630> to<00:05:32.690> it<00:05:32.900> attack<00:05:33.140> on<00:05:33.290> Titan<00:05:33.620> once<00:05:33.770> was

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
especially humanity's defender to die

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.050 
especially humanity's defender to die
against<00:06:09.590> the<00:06:09.800> enemy<00:06:10.160> not<00:06:10.310> against<00:06:10.610> humanity

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:11.060 
against the enemy not against humanity

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.000 
against the enemy not against humanity
itself<00:06:11.270> while<00:06:11.510> it's<00:06:11.750> ironic<00:06:12.530> it<00:06:12.650> just<00:06:12.830> seems

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
itself while it's ironic it just seems

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.950 
itself while it's ironic it just seems
wrong<00:06:13.370> for<00:06:13.850> the<00:06:13.910> characters<00:06:14.360> feels<00:06:14.780> like<00:06:14.930> a

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
wrong for the characters feels like a

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.170 
wrong for the characters feels like a
big<00:06:15.440> fuck<00:06:15.770> you<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.040> him<00:06:16.370> and<00:06:16.580> I<00:06:16.730> really<00:06:17.060> hope

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
Levi doesn't die at all this because

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:19.990 
Levi doesn't die at all this because
they<00:06:18.800> were<00:06:18.890> basically<00:06:19.040> saying<00:06:19.400> that<00:06:19.550> if<00:06:19.790> they

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
they were basically saying that if they

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.130 
they were basically saying that if they
take<00:06:20.180> Levi's<00:06:20.570> head

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.140
