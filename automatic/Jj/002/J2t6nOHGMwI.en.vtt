00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
color-changing headlights I'm going to

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.370 
color-changing headlights I'm going to
show<00:00:05.700> you<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.120> basically<00:00:07.040> wire<00:00:08.040> them<00:00:08.309> up

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:09.380 
show you how to basically wire them up

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.060 
show you how to basically wire them up
these<00:00:10.380> are<00:00:10.650> one<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> my<00:00:11.250> customer<00:00:11.790> sets<00:00:13.070> here's

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
these are one of my customer sets here's

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.150 
these are one of my customer sets here's
a<00:00:14.690> look<00:00:15.690> like<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.020> OEM<00:00:16.410> halo<00:00:16.890> RS<00:00:17.400> halo<00:00:19.160> here's

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
a look like the OEM halo RS halo here's

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.439 
a look like the OEM halo RS halo here's
the<00:00:20.340> back<00:00:21.619> this<00:00:22.619> is<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> connector<00:00:23.640> where<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the back this is the connector where you

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.550 
the back this is the connector where you
plug<00:00:24.720> in<00:00:26.689> the<00:00:27.689> power<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.710> color-changing

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
plug in the power for the color-changing

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.549 
plug in the power for the color-changing
basically<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> there's<00:00:31.920> one<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.340> leg<00:00:32.610> -

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
basically and there's one on this leg -

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:35.979 
basically and there's one on this leg -
it's<00:00:34.559> coming<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> there

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
it's coming out of there

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's coming out of there
basically<00:00:36.989> you'll<00:00:37.260> get<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> big<00:00:38.070> harness

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
basically you'll get this big harness

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.240 
basically you'll get this big harness
here<00:00:39.410> these<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.680> connectors<00:00:41.219> right<00:00:41.520> here<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
here these two connectors right here and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.910 
here these two connectors right here and
one<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.399> these<00:00:44.520> connectors<00:00:45.260> goes<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.710> one

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
one of these connectors goes to one

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:57.549 
one of these connectors goes to one
light<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:50.420> like<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:55.129> you'll<00:00:56.129> hear<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> click

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
light and like so you'll hear it click

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:02.420 
light and like so you'll hear it click
and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.160> other<00:00:59.430> one<00:01:00.199> goes<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:02.370> one

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
and then the other one goes to this one

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:11.570 
and then the other one goes to this one
the<00:01:02.969> driver<00:01:03.329> side<00:01:09.439> fits<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.430> no

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the driver side fits in one way and no

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.850 
the driver side fits in one way and no
click<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> now<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.369> them<00:01:14.850> all

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
click so now that you have them all

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.760 
click so now that you have them all
wired<00:01:16.860> up<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:18.570> will<00:01:18.780> have<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.170> controller

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
wired up you will have this controller

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.630 
wired up you will have this controller
and<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.630> blue<00:01:22.259> green<00:01:22.860> red<00:01:23.189> and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and it will have the blue green red and

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.560 
and it will have the blue green red and
black<00:01:23.850> wise<00:01:24.409> already<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:27.390> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
black wise already in it and you just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.740 
black wise already in it and you just
have<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> add<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> plus<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.549> red<00:01:30.479> wire

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
have to add a plus right here a red wire

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.700 
have to add a plus right here a red wire
and<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.259> minus<00:01:31.710> will<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.490> your<00:01:32.700> ground<00:01:33.710> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
and then a minus will be your ground it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.469 
and then a minus will be your ground it
will<00:01:34.799> come<00:01:34.979> with<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.159> remote<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.030> and

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
will come with a remote like this and

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.230 
will come with a remote like this and
let's<00:01:37.259> say<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.500> want<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.740> read<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.700> press<00:01:38.939> red

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
let's say you want to read you press red

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.590 
let's say you want to read you press red
that's<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.110> power<00:01:40.350> button<00:01:41.060> all<00:01:42.060> your<00:01:42.240> colors

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600

are here white - your settings so this
is<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.850> controller<00:01:48.299> has<00:01:49.079> an<00:01:49.439> antenna<00:01:49.829> thing

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
is the controller has an antenna thing

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.310 
is the controller has an antenna thing
you<00:01:51.420> mount<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.899> wherever<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.439> want<00:01:54.170> keep<00:01:55.170> in

a place dry so I'm just going to test it

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.200 
a place dry so I'm just going to test it
using<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.219> little<00:01:59.729> AC<00:02:00.350> charger<00:02:01.350> thing<00:02:01.619> here

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
using a little AC charger thing here

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.149 
using a little AC charger thing here
just<00:02:03.210> plug<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.689> this<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.799> card
