00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.900
 but they got 36 and 33 for how much 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.940
 regards the component think year 9 the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.549
 18 in the choreography not 18 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.190
 of interpretation then go 14 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.010
 90 francisci partners and in the jambs 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 to the special all he has given is 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.430
 inferior to what we have seen 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.580
 burner the canada uses 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.759
 are asked what intent 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.530
 let's make 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:29.680
 indicated 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.530
 the team 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.160
 paolo mexico 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.570
 in plain clothes 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.790
 with you 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.530
 all that sword so 80 cheerful 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.020
 to cleaning that sometimes 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.379
 they are retreating much more linearly 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:52.090
 much more stylized than you think they are 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.159
 especially more than reflections than he 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.379
 rightly intercultural 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.539
 this is a very fun program 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.879
 this of Finland 1 they have 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.530
 chosen a particular music if you are 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.630
 much of entertainment enjoyed 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.909
 immediately all with a new reputation 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.750
 also considered a bit childish no 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.759
 why 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.700
 but honestly I find it brilliant then 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.200
 the theme of African music 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.450
 we already really have to knock for the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.409
 national champions of the buoy rule 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.409
 aids me of you 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.460
 beautiful more 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.510
 Hello 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.209
 no 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.550
 perfect 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.440
 to 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:13.250
 this is an original choice from the team 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.400
 filannino of america iq te 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.919
 andrea had pronounced and much of 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.340
 entertainment with music everything 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:26.169
 interesting from the point on the track site 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.169
 now we are in the perfect part 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.509
 they did a really good one 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.849
 beautiful performance 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.560
 I believe it is particular in this 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:36.110
 program 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.650
 I must say that in short we must 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:45.560
 who likes it easy to interpret 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.180
 in short, very easy taste 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.650
 particular 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:52.430
 yes, however, it comes away from others 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.960
 programs where my show is 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.030
 programs always very difficult 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:01.160
 city â€‹â€‹let's also decline on the side 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.689
 artistic because time really is 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.009
 limited to refute is not time at all 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:09.379
 also joined does not exist 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.820
 dr succeed well and manage to do 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.620
 of the candid 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.250
 the rotation configuration 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:18.140
 details interpret a lot it seems to me 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.520
 also that the whole score of the inter 

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.800
 home together 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.920
 nothing else yes yes we are seeing everyone 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.490
 the levels 

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.490
 they are from bridge 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.210
 in fact the usual usual already 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.210
 rectangle kills tells us that the 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.050
 technician now 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.119
 absolute even dish of 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:41.300
 as I said because the artistic too 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:43.759
 always seems to rise 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.499
 I said the levels to this one before 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:48.110
 well at this peak level 

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:49.870
 protection a missed level 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.260
 naturally 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.250
 it makes you lose so many points in this case 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.560
 that if teams here they got 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.340
 almost all the maximum level 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.200
 it is played on a performance case on stage 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.280
 and then we would go right to see for 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.850
 this team 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:07.960
 we are really seeing components 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.930
 however, it was only i 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.280
 scores of two judges for whom one must 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.530
 still wait for the job though 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.420
 really an original idea drawn from 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.370
 seen approved these days 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.350
 simply with their all black 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:24.220
 so I must say that it was already effective 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.930
 seen simply in training and the 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:29.730
 I saw try and try again almost 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:32.680
 manic and their trainer 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:35.920
 he stopped whenever there was a child 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:38.110
 error stopped but called them back and 

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.100
 it really brought research again 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.770
 of perfection 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.040
 well obviously he paid to do 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.960
 what we are about to see 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:52.020
 absolutely bad indeed 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:54.220
 they are spent the favorites this year 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.250
 really very strong programs 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.810
 even the long is much more difficult to 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:08.169
 to play this sadly was king 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:12.479
 lion remixes that need 74 to 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.479
 99 to go to the command 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:24.419
 and then hear the screams the 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:27.750
 central alps celebrations with 76 and 14 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:31.919
 from me as the command have a score 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:36.360
 of 39 and 21 regarding the 

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:39.960
 programs the technical part and 36 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:43.159
 93 regarding the components 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.159
 have had in the
