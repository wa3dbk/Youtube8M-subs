00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:12.880
 well we present this idv lance engine 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:15.260
 3,150 of the 50s of 50 horses to 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.280
 1,800 rpm 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.010
 your water cooling motor for the 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.990
 knowers of this brand in the oak 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.070
 brand of agricultural engines but 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.270
 recognized by engines cooled by 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.780
 air 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:37.160
 it's a series we say little known 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:40.290
 very uncommon and this may highlight 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:45.800
 this model in this video 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:49.590
 and does not recognize the hardness of it 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.640
 the strong the robust these engines and 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.350
 good in the way they were 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.080
 built in the postwar period 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.990
 but the 50 that things 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.330
 they did to last 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.880
 and well and we recognize it was those who 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.110
 they made these engines for 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.410
 they really are not alive since they are from 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.410
 another generation 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.410
 well and there's also what I'm going to take advantage of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.950
 the occasion to highlight may these 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.469
 nine first engines 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.579
 when I got into mechanics and even 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:22.750
 international educational cooperation 

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:25.800
 ince 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:32.730
 and we ordered the first motor that we started 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.730
 I could do to walk 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.690
 well as this was a first 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.070
 engines that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.810
 that I lit that I learned from the reggae walk 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.030
 something funny was to run away and the 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.310
 aranda teacher called my attention 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.960
 hand that had to stay and look for the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.520
 turn it off so my 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.690
 recognition to all the people of 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.620
 national cooperation institute 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.150
 educative ince of the people who formed what 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.400
 which I was one of them and that after 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.410
 so also colleague of them his 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.930
 instructor is also honorable 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.020
 institution well that we already know 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.420
 everything that happened there greeted me 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.960
 all of them to raul 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:53.440
 caÃ±izales alberto aranda and the teacher 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:53.440
 kings good my recognition
