still on the top of the head you're

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.120 
still on the top of the head you're
gonna<00:02:08.170> get<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.649> really<00:02:09.280> good<00:02:10.620> volume<00:02:11.620> shape

gonna get a really good volume shape

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.280 
gonna get a really good volume shape
here<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.120> teasing<00:02:13.360> really<00:02:13.810> helps<00:02:14.080> to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
here and the teasing really helps to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.640 
here and the teasing really helps to
form<00:02:14.500> that<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.870> you're<00:02:17.080> just<00:02:17.200> kind<00:02:17.500> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
form that so you're just kind of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.960 
form that so you're just kind of
wrapping<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.160> same<00:02:18.400> way<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:18.610> would<00:02:18.820> have

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
wrapping it the same way you would have

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.440 
wrapping it the same way you would have
been<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.450> just<00:02:19.630> be<00:02:19.750> really<00:02:20.020> careful<00:02:21.450> this

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
been but just be really careful this

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.480 
been but just be really careful this
look<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.840> still<00:02:22.959> really<00:02:23.410> messy<00:02:23.740> but<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.190> looks

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
look is still really messy but it looks

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.850 
look is still really messy but it looks
really<00:02:25.390> great<00:02:25.750> when<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.050> tease<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.620> big

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
really great when you tease it up big

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.150 
really great when you tease it up big
like<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:30.780> once<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.020> get<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.890> shape

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
like that and once you get the shape

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.900 
like that and once you get the shape
that<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.550> want<00:02:34.800> just<00:02:35.800> tuck<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.250> ends<00:02:36.430> in<00:02:36.640> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
then you're just gonna pin it

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.900 
then you're just gonna pin it
to<00:02:39.310> secure<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.820> hair<00:02:40.050> and<00:02:41.430> be<00:02:42.430> careful<00:02:42.700> not<00:02:42.760> to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
to secure the hair and be careful not to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.340 
to secure the hair and be careful not to
push<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.120> in<00:02:43.300> too<00:02:43.570> far<00:02:43.600> like<00:02:43.989> I<00:02:44.019> did<00:02:44.290> because

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
push it in too far like I did because

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.590 
push it in too far like I did because
then<00:02:44.590> you<00:02:44.680> create<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> bump<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.489> little<00:02:46.060> indent

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
then you create a bump a little indent

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.090 
then you create a bump a little indent
so<00:02:46.750> you<00:02:46.870> want<00:02:47.110> to<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.290> be<00:02:47.470> careful<00:02:50.100> sometimes

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
so you want to just be careful sometimes

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.160 
so you want to just be careful sometimes
doing<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.459> little<00:02:51.700> horizontal<00:02:52.480> pinning<00:02:53.050> is

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
doing a little horizontal pinning is

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.690 
doing a little horizontal pinning is
good<00:02:53.380> because<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:53.980> can<00:02:54.160> just<00:02:54.370> still

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
good because then you can just still

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.839 
good because then you can just still
maintain<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.330> shape

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:00.849 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.089 

now<00:03:01.749> this<00:03:01.959> I<00:03:02.109> would<00:03:02.319> pretty<00:03:02.530> much<00:03:02.620> stay

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:03.099 
now this I would pretty much stay

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:12.270 
now this I would pretty much stay
because<00:03:03.670> it's<00:03:04.150> really<00:03:04.599> not<00:03:04.689> going<00:03:04.870> anywhere

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.430 

and<00:03:12.610> just<00:03:13.300> keep<00:03:13.480> checking<00:03:13.690> your<00:03:13.959> shape<00:03:14.170> make

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
and just keep checking your shape make

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:28.800 
and just keep checking your shape make
sure<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.830> looks<00:03:14.920> even<00:03:15.250> on<00:03:15.610> both<00:03:15.970> sides

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.970 

tuck<00:03:29.470> in<00:03:29.620> any<00:03:29.860> loose<00:03:30.220> ends<00:03:31.830> there<00:03:32.830> we<00:03:32.950> go

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
tuck in any loose ends there we go

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.500 
tuck in any loose ends there we go
from<00:03:35.980> the<00:03:36.100> back<00:03:37.560> from<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.620> front<00:03:39.180> my<00:03:40.180> name<00:03:40.360> is

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
from the back from the front my name is

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.120 
from the back from the front my name is
Claire<00:03:40.750> Coleman<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.440> just<00:03:41.650> showed<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:42.010> how

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
Claire Coleman and I just showed you how

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.420 
Claire Coleman and I just showed you how
to<00:03:42.160> do<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> Carrie<00:03:42.700> Bradshaw<00:03:43.150> bun
