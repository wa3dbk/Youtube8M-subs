00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.460
 the upper austrian industry us 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.460
 generate future 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.279
 when it comes to heavy items 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.759
 from a to b, they are the measure 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.820
 of the things 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.599
 weigh forklift and forklift the 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.669
 company linde 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.349
 are produced the so-called corridor 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.149
 Although conveyors in the Bavarian 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.250
 aschaffenburg according to customer requirements 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.079
 are manufactured and serviced the 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.940
 However, in Leeds the machines 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.010
 Austrian customer is basically 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.200
 not aligned with the standard device 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.850
 but would like his machine for the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.980
 special field of application in his 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.740
 companies have designed enough 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.220
 as I said from the attachment started to 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.280
 to various extras from 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:03.730
 ease of use economy all the way to 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.259
 small things that just the lighting 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.090
 wants to have another height 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.159
 environmentally friendly vehicles will not 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.200
 only in the automotive market more popular 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.780
 also with stackers and hub devices 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.520
 play alternative drive systems one 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.439
 increasingly important role 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.850
 the conditions in the area and 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.920
 diesel units from a certain 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.569
 Performance figures are getting higher 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.310
 The machines are characterized by the 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.579
 used technology also more expensive 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.869
 and that makes it very useful here 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:31.359
 switch to electric 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.729
 where also very strong in new 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.039
 innovative techniques in the field of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.549
 charging technology, for example, the so-called 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.889
 flader was invested and by the 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.229
 large cost savings side by side 

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:46.240
 possible are the customers can save 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.249
 But not only at the fuel city 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.090
 You can buy stapler this blind 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:51.729
 also rent 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.679
 whether for a day or for several years 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.359
 every second Linde device in Austria 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.490
 is now in the long-term rental 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:58.179
 one rents the device provider the 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.109
 driving park 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:04.420
 one has predictable costs and the 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.909
 Entrepreneurs must be calorie participants for 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.640
 new acquisitions but there is one 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.760
 monthly rent covering everything 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.740
 so to speak in the purchase price or just the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.240
 content performance that is not just stacking 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.160
 to carry heavy loads 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.860
 but also be driven sporty 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.600
 can be one of linden 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.190
 proven linear for six years 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.320
 the company is organizing the 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.990
 austrian staplercup and selects the best 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.420
 stacker driver of austria 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.640
 the upper austrian industry takes care of it 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.850
 For more than 50 percent of the employed 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.670
 now for two-thirds of the added value 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:44.010
 Upper Austria the Upper Austrian 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.010
 industry we generate future
