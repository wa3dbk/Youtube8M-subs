00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.820
 and 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.780
 in the world 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.610
 so everyone is welcome here at 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.990
 computer exam before starting 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.970
 the video would like to tell you that it 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.590
 subscribe to this channel we will reach 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.000
 what are the 10,000 subscribers and 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.210
 just the 10,000 will have 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.070
 some surprises and in my second channel 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 rinôçérôse magic that you just told 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.150
 I just started this project going to 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.370
 have surprises to what are the thousand 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.600
 subscribers and on the facebook page 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.340
 at 2500 likes and good the video what 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.860
 let's make a pretty nice effect 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.870
 pretty pretty colorful father we are going to 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.850
 make the fisheye effect this 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.640
 typical effect of the cameras 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.309
 photographic and some cell phones that 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.020
 somehow they make a distortion 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.230
 as if it were in a dome what 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.780
 It is our image however it is much 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.300
 better do it here in photoshop because 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.900
 here we have full control of the 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.210
 amount of the effect of some 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.619
 distances and also from what they are 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.590
 some curvatures or all the 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.130
 curvatures had not said since if you 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:18.290
 you take this picture with what is your 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.970
 cell phone or with your camera if they are 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.670
 what are some faces can be 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.160
 distort besides that here in what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.680
 what is photoshop you can achieve effects 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.350
 much better let's start opening 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.420
 any image and actually what 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.490
 let's do it is very simple if you have 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.640
 padlock we drag it here to what it is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.729
 the trash can only you drag 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.100
 not here I do not have unlocked and we go 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.960
 to press and control jota to duplicate 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.270
 the layer and see a before and see a later 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.000
 now in the top layer we're going to 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.990
 press control t right click him 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.479
 let's say we want to deform 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.369
 I've put him to form will be 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.979
 activate these divisions that are going to 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.369
 give us emphasis so we can edit 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.670
 what this image we are going to skew what 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.459
 is this image these points that we see in 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.690
 the corners we are going to bring 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.540
 up and in these ones from here 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.760
 down and in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.989
 and what we should do is digital with 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.829
 our handlers or those 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:26.920
 manipulators what is this angle that 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:29.680
 it is being straight we do it towards 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 back we will do the same with this 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.670
 handler 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.190
 with this other one here and we're going to do what 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.000
 same with this one here is not that we have 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:45.930
 this we can go playing with what 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.440
 so pronounced we want this fish eye 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.190
 now let's make another step yet 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.319
 but let's go 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.989
 let's say that exaggerating a bit is the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.660
 trick of this effect is to exaggerate a 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.220
 so much and right now they will see why 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.000
 what are we going to be quite father what 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.000
 what is this effect 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.910
 let's add curvatures somewhat 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.410
 pronounced somewhat marked by 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.410
 gentlemen from here of mexico 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.920
 let's continue adding what they are 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.920
 these curvatures 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.790
 more or less in this way 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.360
 let's give an enter and let's go to 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.650
 second step that has been going to 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.440
 filter 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.630
 let's go to what is liquefying and here in 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.580
 liquefy let's select what is the 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.580
 inflate tool and we're going to 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.860
 select more or less a large size 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.790
 as in this sense or on this occasion 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.010
 more or less in this proportion and then 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.840
 is giving you a brush density of 30 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 percent this will also depend a 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.520
 little of the size of your image 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.650
 You can also play with what is 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.300
 the density of the brush and we're going to give a 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.520
 click and we will leave sharp 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:11.470
 only one or two seconds 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.730
 and what is happening we are attracting 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:19.329
 let's say that the image towards us 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.609
 and let's give it enough and we'll go 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.820
 to give in ok and I want you to see what it is 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.340
 this result like that was what is the 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.639
 image and the result of this effect is 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.560
 quite impressive pretty colorful 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.010
 it seems that we are right there with 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.100
 she seems like we're in that scene 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.410
 it seems to me that it seems like 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.210
 coming out that is not a photograph but 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.949
 that we are there that is the effect that 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:50.560
 we can create what it is with, then this 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:53.590
 these steps in fact in what is the 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.229
 video if I use a little bit to add 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.289
 a little bit of detail that is a certain 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.080
 false detail and it's like to give it a 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:05.620
 certain style different but that you see 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.090
 a bit like that perspective plays you 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.310
 what is a joke and it seems that 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.810
 you are there watching it 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:15.350
 let's see a before 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.080
 and a later ok this is going to serve you 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.970
 quite with what are people with what 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.040
 which are landscapes practically with 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.570
 any photograph and as you will see it is very 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.790
 easy to do it you just have to 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:29.340
 find the angles mode 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.080
 and obviously the way to do it and 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:33.120
 well remember to install this 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.140
 type of videos you can give a click on 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.850
 the ads that are going to be 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.400
 appearing right down before 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.230
 every video and I will be happy to be 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.750
 climbing many more practices pretty 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.860
 quite interesting up to here what 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.510
 is today's video my name is 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.670
 william urbina industrial designer and 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.820
 graphic and see you in the next up 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.820
 then
