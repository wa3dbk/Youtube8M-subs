00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.830
 hello in this video let's see how 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.450
 easily clean a guitar what 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.520
 first what you want to say is that for 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:12.790
 have a clean guitar the best is 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.260
 after each use clean them on 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.670
 all the strings that are the areas that 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.109
 they are always in contact with the fingers 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.990
 the fingers printed on having fat 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.089
 sweat is mixing is forming a 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.400
 kind of pasta that stays attached to 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.109
 the ropes that pasta then how does 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.179
 that the ropes are oxidized because the 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.730
 Ropes are made of metal or 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.190
 covered by metal as well as 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.800
 the mast the mast as you can see here 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.500
 between the frets here the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.320
 the dirt that the fingers generate to the 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.239
 time to play the guitar that if plants 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.820
 the finger that has it dirty and for example 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.399
 you put it here because of the normal use 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.629
 is that it is filled with crap what 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.320
 best you can do is after 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.559
 touch clean as always with a cloth 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.120
 that does not leave dust we want to remove dust 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.440
 we want to remove the dirt that is 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.449
 we want to remove fat we do not want 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:06.110
 add it so the best thing is a chamois 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.450
 that does not leave remains and 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.690
 It is made as if a gripper is passed 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.290
 above the rope is caught with two 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.000
 fingers 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.920
 and it goes along the rope 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 so for each of the six strings 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.680
 in this way we ensure that it is removed 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.920
 all the dirt that stays stuck to the 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.810
 rope making it rust 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.460
 even good even what it causes is 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.380
 shorten the rope to life 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.479
 of the rope ends up breaking or 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.430
 it ends up oxidizing it ends up losing 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.370
 elasticity and that makes the rope 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.460
 break and a new set of strings 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.680
 it's something that shows in your pocket is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.240
 priced 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.600
 now let's see how to clean the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.600
 frets 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.070
 once we have cleaned the six strings 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.750
 it's the easiest thing to say of the parties 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.570
 delicate guitars to clean 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.500
 his thing would be to clean the dishes because 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:06.080
 the frets are made of metal 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.900
 and as with the ropes rubbing 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.850
 can generate unpleasant sounds like this 

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.940
 that the best thing would be to clean it 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.630
 just like the ropes with the same 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.200
 cloth and in this case alcohol sell 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.350
 different types of liquids that are 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.000
 removes fats and others but I do not always know 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.640
 I have used alcohol and I see it the most 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.960
 cheap and the simplest the quantity very 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.970
 small alcohol does not need to be 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.130
 very big more than anything also so that 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.750
 not damage wood wood remember that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.530
 it is a material that can be damaged 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.840
 with the seasoning is liquid do not use 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.180
 liquids too abrasive for alcohol 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.130
 or good that you have to remove the dirt and 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.740
 it evaporates right away does not stay there 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.540
 generating excessive damage is not necessary 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.450
 using a lot too little is enough 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.459
 and a tip that I give you can do it 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.250
 in two ways one removing for example 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.740
 a whole rope 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.290
 and leaving all that would be free 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.150
 surface that occupies all that rope 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.100
 then we could go cleaning what 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.450
 what happens then requires a lot of time 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.380
 put the rope back and it's a bit 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.730
 roll but good 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.310
 I what is a do is the following 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.730
 He loosened the rope he had cleaned 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.710
 for example the sixth in this case and the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.920
 left loose because I did not remove all 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:25.870
 because the mast suffers inside the mast 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.560
 what is this big piece of wood there 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:32.350
 a on a metal shaft that is called 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:35.290
 I have soul body what makes forgiveness 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.230
 is hold hold smooth and I do not 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.820
 keep the mast straight then the 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.750
 tension of the strings can make 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:45.130
 that soul varies if that soul moves if 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.470
 loses elasticity if it is not so 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.590
 rigid as always the guitar tends to 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.860
 to tune makes strange noises and not 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.540
 it's good 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.240
 it's not good to leave the guitar without the 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.680
 six strings put so I what 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.320
 I usually do is to remove a 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.290
 clean and replace or loosen the 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.270
 rope of the section that I am going to clean 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:08.190
 move it away with your hand and with the other go 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.720
 cleaning as simple as that 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.130
 with the thick strings you can go 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.380
 doing no more no need to go 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.640
 loosening a lot because the good thing that 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.860
 have these strings is that they are very 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.359
 thick are very hard very resistant not 

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:21.159
 as well as the thin strings 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.409
 that yes they can break if you 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.520
 you stretch to try to make room for 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:29.759
 the thin strings and that would have to 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.759
 loosen it must be removed clean 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.069
 and he's already a little patience with 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.590
 a little bit of a clean cloth and 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:40.500
 time the guitar is cleaned 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.909
 perfectly then we would have the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.680
 last part that is to cleanse the body in 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.710
 the guitar is the simplest thing that is 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.060
 clean this or the rest that can be 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.449
 see this is as if a mold 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.789
 normal because with any typical 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:55.560
 liquid removes grease or cleaner and a 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.760
 you can remove it, there is no 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.740
 problem 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.210
 it's quite simple but once 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.590
 clean guitar that can carry 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:07.710
 enough time it's best to keep 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.320
 one use be a daily cleaning after 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.690
 of each use to clean the ropes and 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.260
 frets like this will stay clean for 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.260
 the next use
