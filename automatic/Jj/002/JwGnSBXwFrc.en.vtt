for ever sign powder on top and honestly
my<00:02:43.730> makeup<00:02:44.120> stayed<00:02:44.420> on<00:02:44.600> from<00:02:45.319> the<00:02:45.650> like<00:02:46.010> the

my makeup stayed on from the like the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.470 
my makeup stayed on from the like the
nighttime<00:02:46.519> when<00:02:46.640> i<00:02:46.700> applied<00:02:47.030> until<00:02:47.360> the

morning<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.019> lie<00:02:48.200> slept<00:02:48.470> up<00:02:48.590> I<00:02:48.739> think<00:02:49.220> of<00:02:49.310> it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
morning this lie slept up I think of it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.830 
morning this lie slept up I think of it
the<00:02:49.580> parties<00:02:50.000> at<00:02:50.180> Sierra's<00:02:50.480> house<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:50.810> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
the parties at Sierra's house and I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.509 
the parties at Sierra's house and I
slept<00:02:51.019> at<00:02:51.170> her<00:02:51.290> house<00:02:51.440> at<00:02:51.709> the<00:02:51.799> next<00:02:52.010> morning<00:02:52.370> I

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
slept at her house at the next morning I

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:54.039 
slept at her house at the next morning I
guess<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.090> was<00:02:53.209> too<00:02:53.360> tired<00:02:53.390> so<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> did<00:02:53.840> take<00:02:53.959> off

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
guess I was too tired so I did take off

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.420 
guess I was too tired so I did take off
my<00:02:54.140> makeup<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.590> next<00:02:54.799> money<00:02:54.950> might<00:02:55.130> make<00:02:55.280> up

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
my makeup the next money might make up

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.520 
my makeup the next money might make up
look<00:02:55.580> exactly<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> same<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.110> I<00:02:57.140> really

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
look exactly the same and so I really

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.050 
look exactly the same and so I really
like<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.830> product<00:02:58.099> for<00:02:58.370> me<00:02:58.519> doesn't<00:02:58.760> make<00:02:58.910> my

know that a lot of people might have

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.330
