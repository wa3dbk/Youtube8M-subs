which has got the treasure we want so
we'd<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.320> be<00:01:38.410> very<00:01:38.620> careful<00:01:39.160> with<00:01:39.280> our

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
we'd have to be very careful with our

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.430 
we'd have to be very careful with our
guns<00:01:39.700> we<00:01:40.240> could<00:01:40.390> shoot<00:01:40.600> at<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:40.840> rudder<00:01:41.050> and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
guns we could shoot at the rudder and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.230 
guns we could shoot at the rudder and
take<00:01:41.620> out<00:01:41.770> her<00:01:41.950> sailing<00:01:42.220> gear<00:01:42.610> but<00:01:42.910> we<00:01:42.940> need<00:01:43.150> to

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
take out her sailing gear but we need to

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.900 
take out her sailing gear but we need to
be<00:01:43.330> very<00:01:43.480> careful<00:01:44.080> with<00:01:44.500> our<00:01:44.530> shots<00:01:44.980> if<00:01:45.370> we<00:01:45.670> get

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
be very careful with our shots if we get

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.390 
be very careful with our shots if we get
alongside<00:01:46.180> then<00:01:46.960> we<00:01:47.470> need<00:01:47.710> to<00:01:47.860> affect<00:01:48.190> a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
alongside then we need to affect a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.820 
alongside then we need to affect a
boarding<00:01:48.850> action<00:01:49.210> I've<00:01:49.360> got<00:01:49.990> to<00:01:50.320> clear<00:01:50.620> a

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
boarding action I've got to clear a

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.130 
boarding action I've got to clear a
space<00:01:51.130> on<00:01:51.400> the<00:01:51.700> decks<00:01:51.910> and<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.750> weapon<00:01:53.050> of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
space on the decks and the weapon of

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.180 
space on the decks and the weapon of
choice<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.800> do<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:55.180> this<00:01:55.840> is<00:01:56.080> a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
choice to do that is this this is a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.280 
choice to do that is this this is a
flintlock<00:01:57.240> musket<00:01:58.240> okay

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
flintlock musket okay

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.790 
flintlock musket okay
so<00:01:59.920> longer<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.970> barrel<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.900> more<00:02:02.290> accurate

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
so longer the barrel the more accurate

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.750 
so longer the barrel the more accurate
it<00:02:02.920> is<00:02:03.040> and<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:04.210> greater<00:02:04.630> range<00:02:05.080> it<00:02:05.320> has

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
it is and the greater range it has

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
it is and the greater range it has
pistol<00:02:06.760> works<00:02:06.970> in<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.150> same<00:02:07.390> way<00:02:07.600> as<00:02:07.900> the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
pistol works in the same way as the

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.980 
pistol works in the same way as the
musket<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> black-powder<00:02:10.119> weapon<00:02:10.630> we

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
musket so it's a black-powder weapon we

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.690 
musket so it's a black-powder weapon we
put<00:02:11.200> powder<00:02:11.500> in<00:02:11.620> there<00:02:11.770> than<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.950> patch<00:02:12.310> ball

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
put powder in there than a patch ball

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.760 
put powder in there than a patch ball
you<00:02:13.420> know<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> got<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.810> ramrod<00:02:14.050> we<00:02:14.410> Ram<00:02:14.650> it

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
you know it's got a ramrod we Ram it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.430 
you know it's got a ramrod we Ram it
down<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.250> once<00:02:15.760> rammed<00:02:16.060> down<00:02:16.390> that's<00:02:16.990> going

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
down and once rammed down that's going

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.670 
down and once rammed down that's going
to<00:02:17.620> be<00:02:17.830> secure<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.120> need<00:02:19.450> as<00:02:19.840> many<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.500> these

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to be secure you need as many of these

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.100 
to be secure you need as many of these
