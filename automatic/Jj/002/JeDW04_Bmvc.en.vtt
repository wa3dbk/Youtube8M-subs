their diving equipment to move on to do
all<00:00:17.260> types<00:00:17.770> of<00:00:17.920> diving<00:00:18.400> activities<00:00:19.150> start

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
all types of diving activities start

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.360 
all types of diving activities start
with<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:20.140> high<00:00:20.350> performance<00:00:20.800> regulator<00:00:21.280> like

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:21.370 
with a high performance regulator like

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.460 
with a high performance regulator like
the<00:00:21.640> XT<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.420> it's<00:00:22.570> not<00:00:22.690> just<00:00:22.870> the<00:00:23.050> regulator

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
the XT and it's not just the regulator

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:24.840 
the XT and it's not just the regulator
it's<00:00:23.620> how<00:00:23.710> you<00:00:23.770> set<00:00:24.040> it<00:00:24.130> up<00:00:24.190> and<00:00:24.370> configure<00:00:24.820> it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
it's how you set it up and configure it

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.880 
it's how you set it up and configure it
and<00:00:25.120> to<00:00:25.840> me<00:00:25.990> that's<00:00:26.170> what<00:00:26.380> makes<00:00:26.410> the<00:00:26.710> whole

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
and to me that's what makes the whole

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.680 
and to me that's what makes the whole
package<00:00:27.370> come<00:00:27.640> together<00:00:27.820> so<00:00:28.330> when<00:00:28.450> you<00:00:28.540> look

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:28.690 
package come together so when you look

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.170 
package come together so when you look
at<00:00:28.840> it<00:00:29.020> here's<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.500> short<00:00:29.800> hose<00:00:30.010> this<00:00:30.880> is<00:00:30.940> the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:31.180 
at it here's a short hose this is the

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.209 
at it here's a short hose this is the
safe<00:00:31.390> second<00:00:31.870> it's<00:00:31.990> on<00:00:32.110> a<00:00:32.140> necklace<00:00:32.439> because

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
safe second it's on a necklace because

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.020 
safe second it's on a necklace because
it's<00:00:33.370> only<00:00:33.520> for<00:00:33.789> her<00:00:33.940> to<00:00:34.300> use<00:00:34.510> as<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:34.690> backup<00:00:34.989> for

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
it's only for her to use as a backup for

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.670 
it's only for her to use as a backup for
a<00:00:37.030> primary<00:00:37.300> right<00:00:37.780> here<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:38.200> on<00:00:38.350> a<00:00:38.380> little<00:00:38.590> bit

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
a primary right here is on a little bit

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.130 
a primary right here is on a little bit
longer<00:00:38.890> hose<00:00:39.190> with<00:00:40.060> a<00:00:40.090> right<00:00:40.300> angled<00:00:40.600> adapter

and<00:00:41.440> when<00:00:42.310> someone<00:00:42.579> comes<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.880> her<00:00:43.090> for<00:00:43.329> gas

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
and when someone comes to her for gas

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.180 
and when someone comes to her for gas
she<00:00:43.780> can<00:00:43.930> take<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.140> out<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:44.530> hand<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:44.890> to<00:00:45.040> him

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
she can take it out and hand it to him

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.160 
she can take it out and hand it to him
and<00:00:45.850> then<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.239> one<00:00:46.450> is<00:00:46.570> right<00:00:46.720> here<00:00:46.780> to<00:00:47.020> put

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
and then this one is right here to put

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.660 
and then this one is right here to put
in<00:00:47.260> her<00:00:47.380> mouth<00:00:47.410> she's<00:00:47.860> not<00:00:47.980> looking<00:00:48.310> for<00:00:48.489> not

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
in her mouth she's not looking for not

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.760 
in her mouth she's not looking for not
having<00:00:48.970> a<00:00:49.030> search<00:00:49.239> for<00:00:49.540> it<00:00:49.630> all<00:00:50.079> the<00:00:50.320> hoses<00:00:50.530> are

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:50.770 
having a search for it all the hoses are

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.490 
having a search for it all the hoses are
nice<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.160> tucked<00:00:51.340> in<00:00:51.750> under<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.840> body<00:00:53.050> under

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
nice and tucked in under the body under

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.799 
nice and tucked in under the body under
the<00:00:53.620> arm<00:00:53.800> so<00:00:54.100> they<00:00:54.220> don't<00:00:54.399> get<00:00:54.550> in<00:00:54.640> the<00:00:54.730> way<00:00:54.880> and

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
the arm so they don't get in the way and

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.690 
the arm so they don't get in the way and
then<00:00:55.899> you<00:00:55.960> turn<00:00:56.230> around<00:00:56.260> and<00:00:56.890> look<00:00:57.130> at<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.340> SPG

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
then you turn around and look at the SPG

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.960 
then you turn around and look at the SPG
here<00:00:58.480> it<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.690> 24<00:00:59.350> inches<00:00:59.380> long<00:00:59.649> that's<00:01:00.520> nice<00:01:00.730> on

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:00.970 
here it is 24 inches long that's nice on

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.580 
here it is 24 inches long that's nice on
the<00:01:01.030> torso<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.660> can<00:01:01.780> be<00:01:01.899> clipped<00:01:02.110> to<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.380> waist

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
the torso it can be clipped to the waist

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.590 
the torso it can be clipped to the waist
it<00:01:02.829> can<00:01:02.950> be<00:01:03.040> clipped<00:01:03.309> up<00:01:03.430> here<00:01:03.730> but<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.329> point

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
it can be clipped up here but the point

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.840 
it can be clipped up here but the point
is<00:01:04.750> it's<00:01:05.019> not<00:01:05.110> much<00:01:05.860> longer<00:01:06.280> than<00:01:06.520> what<00:01:06.670> it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
is it's not much longer than what it's

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.180 
is it's not much longer than what it's
needed<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.149> be<00:01:07.360> for<00:01:07.630> her<00:01:07.720> torso<00:01:08.229> length<00:01:08.680> and<00:01:09.130> we

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
needed to be for her torso length and we

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.070 
needed to be for her torso length and we
have<00:01:09.220> all<00:01:09.490> those<00:01:09.640> custom<00:01:10.090> hoses<00:01:10.510> to<00:01:10.630> make<00:01:10.870> that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
have all those custom hoses to make that

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.440 
have all those custom hoses to make that
kind<00:01:11.260> of<00:01:11.380> thing<00:01:11.590> happen<00:01:12.010> so<00:01:12.250> you<00:01:12.790> can<00:01:13.000> get<00:01:13.270> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
kind of thing happen so you can get the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.120 
kind of thing happen so you can get the
right<00:01:13.659> fit<00:01:13.960> and<00:01:14.170> look<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.470> your<00:01:14.560> regulators

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
right fit and look on your regulators

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.640 
right fit and look on your regulators
you<00:01:15.250> don't<00:01:15.430> have<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.729> be<00:01:15.880> confined<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:17.110> a

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
you don't have to be confined to a

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.500 
you don't have to be confined to a
standard<00:01:18.250> hose<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.670> comes<00:01:18.850> on<00:01:19.000> a<00:01:19.030> regulator

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
standard hose that comes on a regulator

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.060 
standard hose that comes on a regulator
because<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:20.080> needs<00:01:20.260> to<00:01:20.350> fit<00:01:20.560> you<00:01:20.799> and<00:01:21.010> your

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
because it needs to fit you and your

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.789 
because it needs to fit you and your
body<00:01:21.369> size<00:01:21.670> so<00:01:22.510> this<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.990> our<00:01:23.110> typical<00:01:23.290> open

fashion<00:01:38.200> with<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> yoke<00:01:38.619> now<00:01:39.280> you<00:01:39.340> couple<00:01:39.820> that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
fashion with a yoke now you couple that

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.520 
fashion with a yoke now you couple that
with<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.210> harness<00:01:40.540> that<00:01:40.840> doesn't<00:01:41.110> put<00:01:41.260> any<00:01:41.409> of

with a harness that doesn't put any of
the<00:01:41.619> lift<00:01:41.830> up<00:01:42.070> around<00:01:42.430> and<00:01:42.729> she<00:01:43.330> can<00:01:43.479> adjust<00:01:43.570> it

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
the lift up around and she can adjust it

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.320 
the lift up around and she can adjust it
to<00:01:44.080> make<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.409> fit<00:01:44.650> properly<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.400> then<00:01:45.880> here<00:01:46.210> is

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
to make it fit properly and then here is

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.690 
to make it fit properly and then here is
a<00:01:46.450> travel<00:01:46.930> link<00:01:47.140> which<00:01:47.680> has<00:01:47.710> 28<00:01:48.250> pounds<00:01:48.610> of

warm<00:01:50.830> water

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
warm water

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.130 
warm water
she<00:01:51.640> was<00:01:51.759> diving<00:01:51.939> cold<00:01:52.330> water<00:01:52.600> then<00:01:52.810> she<00:01:52.960> could

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
she was diving cold water then she could

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.780 
she was diving cold water then she could
put<00:01:53.350> on<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.530> voyage<00:01:53.860> wearing<00:01:54.250> something<00:01:54.520> with

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
put on a voyage wearing something with

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.820 
put on a voyage wearing something with
more<00:01:54.939> lift<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.780> change<00:01:56.229> that<00:01:56.470> out<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
more lift and change that out on the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.740 
more lift and change that out on the
harness<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.430> she's<00:01:57.610> got<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.790> right<00:01:58.180> BC

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
harness so she's got the right BC

in they're not stuck with one BC for

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:07.080 
in they're not stuck with one BC for
anything<00:02:05.590> so<00:02:06.280> for<00:02:06.520> us<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.820> putting<00:02:07.030> the

you<00:02:43.000> can<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.209> them<00:02:43.299> in<00:02:43.389> different<00:02:43.420> lengths

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
you can get them in different lengths

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.030 
you can get them in different lengths
and<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.230> want<00:02:44.409> to<00:02:44.470> make<00:02:44.590> sure<00:02:44.620> that<00:02:44.889> that

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
and you want to make sure that that

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.530 
and you want to make sure that that
length<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.430> hose<00:02:45.639> is<00:02:45.909> fitting<00:02:46.209> right<00:02:46.239> with

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
length the hose is fitting right with

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.289 
length the hose is fitting right with
your<00:02:46.659> torso<00:02:46.930> so<00:02:47.739> this<00:02:48.010> hose<00:02:48.219> is<00:02:48.250> 26<00:02:48.939> inches<00:02:49.060> a

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299 
your torso so this hose is 26 inches a

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.089 
your torso so this hose is 26 inches a
little<00:02:49.569> bit<00:02:49.659> longer<00:02:49.840> than<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.109> other<00:02:50.200> one<00:02:50.560> now

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
little bit longer than the other one now

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.800 
little bit longer than the other one now
the<00:02:51.159> other<00:02:51.459> change<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:52.000> on<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.239> regulator

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the other change is on the regulator

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.929 
the other change is on the regulator
since<00:02:53.349> it's<00:02:53.530> more<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.859> tech<00:02:54.069> flare<00:02:54.400> he's

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:54.939 
since it's more of a tech flare he's

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:57.240 
since it's more of a tech flare he's
gone<00:02:55.180> with<00:02:55.299> a<00:02:55.359> den<00:02:55.599> connector<00:02:56.109> here<00:02:56.349> we<00:02:56.980> routed

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
gone with a den connector here we routed

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.949 
gone with a den connector here we routed
the<00:02:57.459> short<00:02:57.730> hose<00:02:57.909> off<00:02:58.150> of<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.419> fifth<00:02:58.659> port

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
the short hose off of the fifth port

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.929 
the short hose off of the fifth port
turn<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.739> regulator<00:03:00.189> down<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.609> get<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:00.879> a

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
turn the regulator down to get it a

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.369 
turn the regulator down to get it a
little<00:03:01.090> bit<00:03:01.239> flatter<00:03:01.510> going<00:03:01.840> across<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.349> top

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
little bit flatter going across the top

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.289 
little bit flatter going across the top
because<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.040> wanted<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.370> tech<00:03:03.669> look<00:03:03.939> to<00:03:04.150> it

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
because we wanted that tech look to it

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.929 
because we wanted that tech look to it
now<00:03:05.019> same<00:03:05.709> harness<00:03:06.189> in<00:03:06.340> terms<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.700> being<00:03:06.819> able

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:06.939 
now same harness in terms of being able

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.119 
now same harness in terms of being able
to<00:03:07.030> have<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.329> harness<00:03:07.620> free<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.739> everything

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
to have the harness free of everything

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.250 
to have the harness free of everything
up<00:03:09.310> front<00:03:09.579> but<00:03:10.000> now<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.209> wing<00:03:10.629> that<00:03:10.659> he's<00:03:11.079> got

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
up front but now the wing that he's got

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.110 
up front but now the wing that he's got
now<00:03:11.500> he's<00:03:11.859> selected<00:03:12.280> as<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> Voyager<00:03:12.909> wing

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
now he's selected as a Voyager wing

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.349 
now he's selected as a Voyager wing
because<00:03:13.950> he's<00:03:14.950> a<00:03:14.980> little<00:03:15.250> bit<00:03:15.340> more<00:03:15.549> lift<00:03:15.790> and

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
because he's a little bit more lift and

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.300 
because he's a little bit more lift and
at<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.599> same<00:03:16.780> time<00:03:17.049> this<00:03:17.319> is<00:03:17.379> using<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.919> xt

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
at the same time this is using the xt

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.429 
at the same time this is using the xt
model<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.090> it<00:03:19.209> which<00:03:19.359> has<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.569> super<00:03:19.840> fabric

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
model of it which has a super fabric

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.770 
model of it which has a super fabric
which<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.650> super<00:03:20.799> abrasion<00:03:21.489> resistant<00:03:22.030> for

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
which is super abrasion resistant for

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.220 
which is super abrasion resistant for
that<00:03:22.900> more<00:03:23.139> tech<00:03:23.349> flavor<00:03:23.620> to<00:03:23.829> the<00:03:23.919> regen
