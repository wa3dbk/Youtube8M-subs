00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
WASD at the moment they are not gonna

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.080 
WASD at the moment they are not gonna
input<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.200> I'm<00:01:38.530> pretty<00:01:38.950> sure<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:39.790> they

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
input that I'm pretty sure because they

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.960 
input that I'm pretty sure because they
want<00:01:40.270> to<00:01:40.390> keep<00:01:40.720> it<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.200> Diablo<00:01:42.189> 2<00:01:42.399> but<00:01:42.939> I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
want to keep it like Diablo 2 but I

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.030

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
to move with WASD with a program outside

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.020
