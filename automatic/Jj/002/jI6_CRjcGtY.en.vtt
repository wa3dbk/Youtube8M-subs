00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
experience there's a lot of things that

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.859 
experience there's a lot of things that
you<00:00:24.939> don't<00:00:25.939> have<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.179> go<00:00:26.330> through<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.660> small

you don't have to go through a small

festivals cargo can't completely get
away<00:00:34.160> from<00:00:34.219> it<00:00:34.489> whereas<00:00:35.649> you<00:00:36.649> very<00:00:36.860> rarely<00:00:37.309> see

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
away from it whereas you very rarely see

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.849 
away from it whereas you very rarely see
a<00:00:37.640> brown<00:00:37.879> stocker<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.600> queue<00:00:38.930> for<00:00:39.230> the<00:00:39.260> bar<00:00:39.500> or

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
for the toilets and it's a in my view

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.250 
for the toilets and it's a in my view
it's<00:00:43.579> a<00:00:43.699> more<00:00:43.879> pleasant<00:00:44.329> experience<00:00:44.600> and<00:00:45.199> we

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's a more pleasant experience and we

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.529 
it's a more pleasant experience and we
really<00:00:46.160> are<00:00:46.280> trying<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.579> be<00:00:46.879> able<00:00:47.030> to<00:00:47.120> fest<00:00:47.329> all

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
really are trying to be able to fest all

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.290 
really are trying to be able to fest all
that<00:00:47.800> but<00:00:48.800> we'd<00:00:49.250> enjoy<00:00:49.550> going<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:50.030> as<00:00:50.149> well

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
that but we'd enjoy going to as well

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.830 
that but we'd enjoy going to as well
it's<00:00:50.539> not<00:00:50.719> just<00:00:51.019> about<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:52.090> sort<00:00:53.090> of<00:00:53.210> growing

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
it's not just about and sort of growing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.750 
it's not just about and sort of growing
and<00:00:54.050> growing<00:00:54.140> it's<00:00:54.620> about<00:00:55.190> creating<00:00:55.489> an

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and growing it's about creating an

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.939 
and growing it's about creating an
experience<00:00:56.120> for<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.230> whole<00:00:57.260> weekend<00:00:57.739> that

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
experience for the whole weekend that

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.610 
experience for the whole weekend that
people<00:00:58.219> and<00:00:58.519> find<00:00:58.910> enjoyable<00:00:59.379> this<00:01:00.379> year

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
people and find enjoyable this year

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.430 
people and find enjoyable this year
we've<00:01:00.829> changed<00:01:01.219> our<00:01:01.460> ticket<00:01:01.879> policy<00:01:02.440> to

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
we've changed our ticket policy to

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.830 
we've changed our ticket policy to
weekend<00:01:04.070> camping<00:01:04.430> tickets<00:01:04.640> only<00:01:04.910> seriously

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
weekend camping tickets only seriously

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.840 
weekend camping tickets only seriously
the<00:01:06.140> rationale<00:01:06.710> behind<00:01:06.740> this<00:01:07.010> is<00:01:07.160> that<00:01:07.190> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
the rationale behind this is that the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.340 
the rationale behind this is that the
festival<00:01:08.270> has<00:01:08.300> been<00:01:08.420> moving<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.200> way

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
festival has been moving that way

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.160 
festival has been moving that way
naturally<00:01:10.070> anyway<00:01:10.370> um<00:01:10.550> year-on-year<00:01:11.540> the

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
naturally anyway um year-on-year the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.350 
naturally anyway um year-on-year the
number<00:01:12.440> of<00:01:12.530> day<00:01:12.740> tickets<00:01:13.100> we<00:01:13.220> sell<00:01:13.360> get

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
number of day tickets we sell get

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.670 
number of day tickets we sell get
smaller<00:01:14.660> and<00:01:14.840> smaller<00:01:14.900> than<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.470> percentage

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
smaller and smaller than the percentage

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.960 
smaller and smaller than the percentage
of<00:01:15.860> people<00:01:15.980> that<00:01:16.160> are<00:01:16.310> willing<00:01:16.400> to<00:01:16.520> commit<00:01:16.790> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
of people that are willing to commit to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.150 
of people that are willing to commit to
the<00:01:17.060> weekend<00:01:17.450> is<00:01:17.660> getting<00:01:17.960> larger<00:01:18.770> so<00:01:19.070> it

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
the weekend is getting larger so it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.340 
the weekend is getting larger so it
makes<00:01:19.280> sense<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.820> phase<00:01:20.540> it<00:01:20.720> out<00:01:20.810> really<00:01:21.140> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
makes sense to phase it out really and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.100 
makes sense to phase it out really and
we<00:01:21.950> want<00:01:22.130> everybody<00:01:22.340> to<00:01:22.610> experience<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
we want everybody to experience the

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.530 
we want everybody to experience the
whole<00:01:24.230> festival<00:01:24.830> not<00:01:25.010> just<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:26.030> Saturday

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
whole festival not just the Saturday

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.130 
whole festival not just the Saturday
asked<00:01:27.730> previously<00:01:28.730> we've<00:01:29.180> stuck<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.840> an

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
asked previously we've stuck to an

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.400 
asked previously we've stuck to an
ethics<00:01:31.070> based<00:01:31.700> bands<00:01:32.360> on<00:01:32.510> the<00:01:32.900> Friday<00:01:33.140> night

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
ethics based bands on the Friday night

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:35.350 
ethics based bands on the Friday night
but<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:33.800> year<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:34.190> are<00:01:34.340> we<00:01:34.790> are<00:01:34.910> stepping<00:01:35.120> up

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
but this year we are we are stepping up

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.500 
but this year we are we are stepping up
to<00:01:35.690> having<00:01:36.050> some<00:01:36.260> more<00:01:36.740> well-known<00:01:37.210> UK<00:01:38.210> talent

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
to having some more well-known UK talent

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.930 
to having some more well-known UK talent
on<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.870> Friday<00:01:39.110> I<00:01:39.380> think<00:01:40.130> again<00:01:40.550> this<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.760> a

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
on the Friday I think again this is a

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.350 
on the Friday I think again this is a
this<00:01:41.810> is<00:01:41.870> a<00:01:42.350> sign<00:01:43.040> of<00:01:43.070> progression<00:01:43.730> five<00:01:44.120> years

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
this is a sign of progression five years

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.840 
this is a sign of progression five years
ago<00:01:44.570> the<00:01:44.720> Friday<00:01:44.960> night<00:01:45.140> was<00:01:45.350> no<00:01:46.250> music<00:01:46.400> at<00:01:46.730> all

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
ago the Friday night was no music at all

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.120 
ago the Friday night was no music at all
so<00:01:46.910> it's<00:01:47.750> all<00:01:47.960> gradually<00:01:48.410> taking<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.860> step

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
so it's all gradually taking that step

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.180 
so it's all gradually taking that step
up<00:01:49.370> and<00:01:49.640> as<00:01:49.970> the<00:01:50.630> lineups<00:01:51.020> grown<00:01:51.680> stronger<00:01:52.070> and

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
up and as the lineups grown stronger and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.760 
up and as the lineups grown stronger and
stronger<00:01:52.370> we<00:01:53.000> need<00:01:53.930> that<00:01:54.080> Friday<00:01:54.350> to<00:01:54.470> spread

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
stronger we need that Friday to spread

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.470 
stronger we need that Friday to spread
it<00:01:54.860> out<00:01:54.920> really<00:01:55.250> this<00:01:55.970> year<00:01:56.180> we've<00:01:56.300> actually

element of that but there's also the

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.000 
element of that but there's also the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.280

various<00:05:03.880> things<00:05:03.940> of<00:05:04.210> that<00:05:04.389> it's<00:05:04.870> come<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> long

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
various things of that it's come a long

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.260 
various things of that it's come a long
way<00:05:05.440> now<00:05:05.470> now<00:05:05.889> being<00:05:06.160> in<00:05:06.220> its<00:05:06.370> ninth<00:05:06.669> year<00:05:06.880> and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
way now now being in its ninth year and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.900 
way now now being in its ninth year and
it's<00:05:07.810> taken<00:05:08.200> a<00:05:08.260> few<00:05:08.530> turns<00:05:09.220> into<00:05:09.580> different

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
it's taken a few turns into different

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.240 
it's taken a few turns into different
directions<00:05:09.940> and<00:05:10.660> changed<00:05:11.620> them<00:05:11.800> along<00:05:12.160> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
directions and changed them along the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.580 
directions and changed them along the
way<00:05:12.280> but<00:05:12.430> I<00:05:12.850> think<00:05:13.450> the<00:05:13.570> key<00:05:14.050> thing<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.500> is

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
way but I think the key thing that is

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.610 
way but I think the key thing that is
always<00:05:15.120> maintained<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.540> that<00:05:16.810> it<00:05:17.530> definitely

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
always maintained is that it definitely

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.440 
always maintained is that it definitely
doesn't<00:05:17.919> take<00:05:18.130> itself<00:05:18.280> too<00:05:18.550> seriously<00:05:18.669> it's

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
doesn't take itself too seriously it's

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.659 
doesn't take itself too seriously it's
very<00:05:20.139> much<00:05:20.260> about<00:05:20.440> having<00:05:20.919> a<00:05:20.950> good<00:05:21.100> time<00:05:21.310> we're

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
very much about having a good time we're

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.129 
very much about having a good time we're
lucky<00:05:21.790> enough<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.180> have<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.330> late<00:05:22.479> license<00:05:22.900> till

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:23.139 
lucky enough to have a late license till

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:26.370

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
3am because of that has always been so

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.890 
3am because of that has always been so
