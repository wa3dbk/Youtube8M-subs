Hey guys, today we are testing the Reusch Waorani Deluxe G2 Ortho Tec, hope you like the video !

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480
The Material offers a good feel for the ball

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.900
The catch control supperts catching the ball by giving you an extra grip

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.560
While fisting the ball, an extra layer on the upper hand gives you a softer and saver feeling

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.320
The gloves are a bit wider though an extra part which is added to the little finger, its called "keep control"

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.740
This really supports catching the ball and is a great feature

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.740
The comfort is on a high level, the material is very flexible and offers a great mobility

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.420
Through the AirVentSystem your hands stay cool and dont sweat that much while playing

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.140
The durability is OK, but could be better, after 2 training sessions small damages appeared

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:50.400
The gloves have fingersave, its very agile but also offers a great protection

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.500
If you dont like the Fingersave you can easily remove it 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.360
The Reusch Waorani Deluxe G2 Ortho Tec gets 8/10 points from us

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.500
Its a great glove, however, the price is very high so we substract 2 points

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.920
I hope you liked the video, see you next time
