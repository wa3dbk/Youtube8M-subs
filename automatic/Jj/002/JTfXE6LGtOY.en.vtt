00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
don't have one I suggest you just

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.140 
don't have one I suggest you just
substitute<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:59.310> teleport<00:02:00.310> tab<00:02:00.550> or<00:02:00.700> something

substitute a teleport tab or something

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
substitute a teleport tab or something
for<00:02:01.720> one<00:02:02.050> of<00:02:02.080> your<00:02:02.320> prayer<00:02:02.620> flasks<00:02:03.870> we<00:02:04.870> have<00:02:04.990> to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.869 
for one of your prayer flasks we have to
take<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.710> reporting<00:02:06.430> pouches<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:08.399> also<00:02:09.399> suggest

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
take to reporting pouches I also suggest

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.500 
take to reporting pouches I also suggest
this<00:02:10.390> instead<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.170> overloads<00:02:11.950> because<00:02:12.459> it's<00:02:13.330> a

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
this instead of overloads because it's a

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.010 
this instead of overloads because it's a
lot<00:02:13.659> cheaper<00:02:13.920> obviously<00:02:14.920> I'll<00:02:15.640> do<00:02:16.120> fresh

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
lot cheaper obviously I'll do fresh

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.450 
lot cheaper obviously I'll do fresh
check

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.460 

okay<00:02:21.460> it's<00:02:22.090> only<00:02:22.330> 3<00:02:22.750> 190<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.590> GP<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:26.110> gives

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
okay it's only 3 190 to GP and it gives

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.800 
okay it's only 3 190 to GP and it gives
you<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.710> same<00:02:27.010> magic<00:02:27.520> bonus<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.180> an<00:02:28.360> overload

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
you the same magic bonus as an overload

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.690 
you the same magic bonus as an overload
so<00:02:29.500> obviously<00:02:29.830> it's<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.220> lot<00:02:30.400> better<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:33.430> my

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
so obviously it's a lot better then my

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.530 
so obviously it's a lot better then my
equipment<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:36.190> course<00:02:36.460> make<00:02:37.320> void<00:02:38.320> in<00:02:38.500> each

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
equipment is of course make void in each

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.330 
equipment is of course make void in each
