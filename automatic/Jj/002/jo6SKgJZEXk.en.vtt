00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.590
 the people today's issue is about the population 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.580
 is a recurring theme in the vestibular 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.220
 I was essentially able to tell people about their level of 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:12.359
 demography 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:16.259
 demography would be science related to population study 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.449
 this term 'population' gives as much as is a danger 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.140
 because he wants something like a beak 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.550
 when speaking population can relate any group of living things 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:30.310
 That is why there is a 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.990
 mc population 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.820
 they are the Marxist theorists who prefers to relate the term as 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.950
 social relations that deal more poignantly with the relationship 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.680
 people but study and demographics is what we put here 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.070
 is to bring back both biological concepts 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.840
 as the birth rate 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.920
 the mortality rate of fertility 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.860
 the life of those who have other things as economic concepts of the 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.250
 population or economically active unpopular population are in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.590
 active life 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.060
 these two economic concepts correlated to the population 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.850
 that is effectively exercised the hymn 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 a paid function and a population that is whistling 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.119
 to work or to enter 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:20.230
 in the market 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.680
 of work 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.140
 correlating these economic concepts of population 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.970
 the very multilateral powers as well as the ana state organisms they do 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.360
 these economic studies for power promises to promote 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.710
 with greater strength 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.910
 the public policies to favor the population through foot 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.900
 example you can remove 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 aa rate of unemployment 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.840
 then through this growth is it really 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.510
 is that governments are able to carry out their public policies with greater 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.520
 is that the effectiveness 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.080
 mistreates constancy that is put in the population study 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.979
 it is the pretext of theories 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 will emerge 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.289
 deivid in christ 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.799
 the theory points and now 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:17.529
 who studies the population essentially 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.289
 by the screen 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:21.749
 Mathematical question of foot air 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.379
 prisoners 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.299
 the idea of ​​theories than what he had in mind 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.929
 odilon comments on his population theories 

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:34.840
 essentially controlling poverty as early as the 18th century, you realize that 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.540
 population and it then strikes that the development of 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.639
 socioeconomic 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:42.170
 the development itself 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.119
 social-economic 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.839
 an idea of ​​rationalism to be able to promote better is the issues in 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:52.459
 and coercion 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.820
 of social groups this is what will be placed 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.219
 in relation to the formulation of theories 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:01.419
 returning to Malthusian theory was formulated by an Anglican pastor 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.210
 right protestant but robert malthus 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.109
 in the early 18th century 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.190
 his idea 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.470
 she said that it increased in a fish rhythm, that is progression 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.409
 geometric the 'very good' risk accelerated 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.819
 and attacked food resources fall victim to 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.570
 that is 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.230
 and dragged seeing a runaway one weaning launch between the rhythm of 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.899
 population growth 

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:27.789
 and food resources 

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:30.789
 is this theory she was proposed during the period the industrial revolution 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.229
 another theory 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.109
 that comes to explain the structure of the population is a neural theory 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.279
 malthusian 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.159
 the radical is something that gives the idea of ​​a new room and the resumption of ideas 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.279
 baucus 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:49.359
 the viana abortion theory is from the mid-twentieth century of the 50's that proposed 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.349
 a game of interest in three levels seed of the economy ' 

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:57.259
 and in civil society 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:04:00.999
 realizing that in this period the plane obeidi good or was having a 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.469
 big blast is little trigger a big name children's birth 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.159
 this could affect 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.050
 the development of the 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.700
 demographers from the countries involved mainly in the organization of 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.200
 nations to poor countries 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.969
 which controls the action 

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:19.699
 is the rate of population growth as 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:23.099
 investing in the economy 'and leaving social sectors 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.860
 the poor 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.020
 the other another theory that comes to support that makes critical to the models 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.009
 previous 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.669

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.009
 the reformist actually does not fulfill much figure with the mathew would because the

 'car marques german philosopher 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.729
 November bags talked a lot about the population 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.029
 this of social relations 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:47.410
 then the Marxist theorists and embezzlement 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.779
 For you to control poverty you must give access 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.449
 development. 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.219

 and makes becomes by an essential critique capitalism and theoretical pros 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.919
 The problem of population poverty is essentially the 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:06.919
 linked to capitalism as a mode of reproduction
