00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.900
 the passenger who urged those present 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.310
 tolerance and mutual respect we have shown 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050
 this video is famous for loud 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.370
 statements towards the Russian 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.680
 federation chairman liberal

 party mikhay gimpu who expressed 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.460
 opinion that the problem is not in the flags but in 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.880
 recent actions of Russia in particular 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.010
 reaction to the situation in Ukraine 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.900
 blame the laser response of our citizens 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.760
 quite justified it's all because 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.800
 aggressive policy of Russia and for her 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.670
 military intervention in Ukraine and 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.830
 bloodshed 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.450
 because of the occupation of the Crimea after so many years 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.520
 Peace and calm Putin now 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.740
 breeds hatred of Russia because 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.040
 Russia is not considered a desire for freedom of those 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.540
 peoples who were occupied by their 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.229
 we must understand that society 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.180
 split 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.310
 famous politician journalist philosopher 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.260
 Yuri Rosha believes that there are deep 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.000
 historical reasons for transnational 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.100
 disputes in his opinion the matter is that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.580
 propaganda conducted by a number of politicians and 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:14.000
 the media heard grief 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.450
 by an interesting girl or woman 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.450
 she said they sucked our grandfathers 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.290
 I am also of the strong but the first drink was 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.260
 pines russian and russian this is confusion 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.660
 head of many post-Soviet societies I 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.300
 I hope that we live it from ourselves and 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.230
 somehow look at the world with different eyes 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.190
 that not romania they Russians should 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.430
 treated by us then external enemies 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.650
 on the contrary, we are very proud that we are free 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.720
 democratic country in fact she 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.610
 did not become so if we return to 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.320
 political analyst says these topics 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.480
 Vitaly Andreevsky in his opinion 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.910
 participating or stirring up such conflicts 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.739
 we ourselves show that we have not yet grown to 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.570
 European values â€‹â€‹and for this 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.130
 Moldovan society has yet to 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.530
 long way to stop first 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.660
 all sorts of such convictions because 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.470
 it is absolutely not normal to condemn for 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.280
 manifestation of freedom is a human right and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.709
 we must appreciate the right to implement it 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.330
 European values don't scream what we 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.480
 want European values 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.519
 Introduce public daily life 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.769
 transport is the place where more often 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.750
 total residents unfortunately show their 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.640
 not the best part here 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.769
 various conflicts are born 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.049
 start ignorance of ordinary rules 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.680
 etiquette how to give place to the elderly 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.090
 man before political disputes as in 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.730
 With all my friend it leads 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.570
 certain consequences which we learn from 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.570
 the drivers themselves we hang say 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.489
 ribbons all sorts of trinkets here no well 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.760
 here St. George ribbons 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:04:00.420
 well, when May 9th floor is counting people 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.790
 who fought were conflicts even what 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.579
 and ripped off 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.690
 we why this is necessary I can not understand 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:08.730
 democratic society is tolerant 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.980
 so you must tolerate others 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.380
 positions and look to prevent 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.750
 cases of domestic nationalism including 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.669
 says political analyst Bogdan tsyrdya by his 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.000
 opinion of many citizens is missing this 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.540
 the damn why we're poor so we were 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.700
 war 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.450
 in 90 second go then there was a marching 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.830
 head here then there was a revolution in 2009 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.950
 today I do not rule out that it can 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.470
 can these events happen again 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.470
 and they also occur because 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.760
 the authorities have liberal parties so 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.800
 called orientation which 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.590
 stimulates and that's such in tolerance 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.120
 according to experts, it is tolerance 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.920
 leads to the arrival of tourists that 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.480
 attracts foreign investors and 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.940
 positive effect on development 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.310
 economy it also leads to the fact that 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.200
 there is no stability in society 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.420
 this is what we should strive for
