00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
little handle on it made this thing out

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.150 
little handle on it made this thing out
of<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.950> bolt<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.470> wing<00:04:19.680> nut<00:04:19.859> here<00:04:19.890> on

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
of a bolt so that and a wing nut here on

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.700 
of a bolt so that and a wing nut here on
the<00:04:20.280> back<00:04:20.489> a<00:04:20.790> couple<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:21.479> washers<00:04:21.840> so<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.680> I

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
the back a couple of washers so that I

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.820 
the back a couple of washers so that I
could<00:04:23.010> now<00:04:23.160> face<00:04:23.640> my<00:04:24.090> microphone<00:04:24.750> into<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
could now face my microphone into the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.170 
could now face my microphone into the
parabolic<00:04:26.340> so

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
parabolic so

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.960 
parabolic so
the<00:04:27.270> parabolic<00:04:27.690> focuses<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.800> sounds<00:04:29.310> on<00:04:29.460> the

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
the parabolic focuses the sounds on the

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.680 
the parabolic focuses the sounds on the
end<00:04:30.150> of<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.389> microphone<00:04:31.100> now<00:04:32.100> I<00:04:32.130> recorded<00:04:33.060> the
