00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
right now it will ask us to either

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.199 
right now it will ask us to either
return<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.709> cydia<00:02:48.950> or<00:02:49.430> to<00:02:49.670> restart<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
return to cydia or to restart the

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.770 
return to cydia or to restart the
springboard<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:53.360> it's<00:02:53.510> overriding<00:02:53.959> something

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
springboard so it's overriding something

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.250 
springboard so it's overriding something
okay<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:58.489> if<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.640> happens<00:02:59.209> just<00:02:59.330> agree<00:03:00.080> with

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
okay so if that happens just agree with

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.449 
okay so if that happens just agree with
everything<00:03:01.299> you'll<00:03:02.299> just<00:03:02.630> do<00:03:02.930> is<00:03:06.250> no<00:03:07.250> once

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
everything you'll just do is no once

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.250 
everything you'll just do is no once

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
it's done reloading I guess is going to

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.350 
it's done reloading I guess is going to
