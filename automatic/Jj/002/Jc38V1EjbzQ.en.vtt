00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
all of our posts are associated with now

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.950 
all of our posts are associated with now
when<00:01:02.770> we<00:01:03.340> have<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.610> blog<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.299> this<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.750> has

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
when we have a blog like this that has

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.649 
when we have a blog like this that has
hundreds<00:01:05.619> and<00:01:05.829> hundreds<00:01:06.189> of<00:01:06.280> posts<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:07.360> only

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
hundreds and hundreds of posts the only

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.630 
hundreds and hundreds of posts the only
way<00:01:07.780> we<00:01:07.960> can<00:01:08.110> really<00:01:08.380> keep<00:01:08.619> track<00:01:08.890> of<00:01:09.040> them<00:01:09.399> is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
way we can really keep track of them is

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.440 
way we can really keep track of them is
through<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> use<00:01:10.240> of<00:01:10.420> categories<00:01:11.200> so<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:13.210> this

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
through the use of categories so in this

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.380 
through the use of categories so in this
case<00:01:13.690> we<00:01:13.960> have<00:01:14.200> races<00:01:14.830> which<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.390> top-level

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
case we have races which is a top-level

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.690 
case we have races which is a top-level
category<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.830> we<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.159> hundred<00:01:18.490> and

we'll add this and there it is we have
our<00:05:20.490> new<00:05:20.700> test<00:05:21.000> category<00:05:21.270> and<00:05:21.840> so<00:05:22.110> far<00:05:22.350> 0<00:05:23.040> links

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
our new test category and so far 0 links

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.420 
our new test category and so far 0 links
are<00:05:23.580> associated<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.390> it<00:05:24.830> ok<00:05:25.830> let's<00:05:26.070> jump

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
are associated with it ok let's jump

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.480 
are associated with it ok let's jump
over<00:05:26.610> and<00:05:27.510> see<00:05:27.840> how<00:05:27.990> this<00:05:28.650> actually<00:05:28.919> applies

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
over and see how this actually applies

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.120 
over and see how this actually applies
when<00:05:29.880> we<00:05:30.000> add<00:05:30.180> a<00:05:30.210> link<00:05:30.540> let's<00:05:31.530> click<00:05:31.860> into

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
when we add a link let's click into

when we add a link let's click into
links<00:05:33.000> here<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.620> now<00:05:34.620> we're<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.919> the<00:05:35.040> manage

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669

links menu we see all of our links down
the<00:05:38.460> side<00:05:38.669> here<00:05:40.190> we<00:05:41.190> see<00:05:41.370> what<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.790> URL<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:42.540> and

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
the side here we see what the URL is and

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.820 
the side here we see what the URL is and
then<00:05:43.350> what<00:05:44.160> category<00:05:44.790> it's<00:05:45.120> actually<00:05:45.600> under

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
then what category it's actually under

so let's go ahead and add a new link and
we're<00:05:51.030> just<00:05:51.120> going<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.330> call<00:05:51.540> this<00:05:51.720> a<00:05:52.100> test

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
we're just going to call this a test

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.420 
we're just going to call this a test
link<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.570> we<00:05:55.020> can<00:05:55.200> put<00:05:55.380> an<00:05:55.500> address<00:05:55.950> in<00:05:56.130> here

example and we could put a category in
here<00:06:10.439> let's<00:06:10.680> give<00:06:10.919> let's<00:06:11.189> put<00:06:11.370> this<00:06:11.490> in<00:06:11.550> our

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
here let's give let's put this in our

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.399 
here let's give let's put this in our
new<00:06:12.029> test<00:06:12.449> category<00:06:12.749> and<00:06:15.139> there<00:06:16.139> it<00:06:16.259> is<00:06:16.319> right

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:16.409 
new test category and there it is right

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:20.649 
new test category and there it is right
there<00:06:16.620> check<00:06:17.610> that<00:06:17.789> box<00:06:18.060> then<00:06:18.870> we<00:06:19.169> say<00:06:19.379> save

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:04.220 
first one we looked at were the post
categories<00:07:01.380> and<00:07:01.860> if<00:07:02.550> we<00:07:02.700> look<00:07:02.880> down<00:07:03.120> here<00:07:03.600> we

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
categories and if we look down here we

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.100 
categories and if we look down here we
see<00:07:04.410> that<00:07:04.850> we<00:07:05.850> have<00:07:05.880> our<00:07:06.150> post<00:07:06.420> categories

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:07.110 
see that we have our post categories

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.550 
see that we have our post categories
that<00:07:07.140> enable<00:07:08.040> us<00:07:08.160> to<00:07:08.900> actually<00:07:09.900> group<00:07:10.320> our

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 
that enable us to actually group our

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.060 
that enable us to actually group our
post<00:07:11.120> into<00:07:12.120> logical<00:07:12.750> categories<00:07:12.990> so<00:07:13.830> we<00:07:13.950> can

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
post into logical categories so we can

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.760 
post into logical categories so we can
look<00:07:14.280> them<00:07:14.430> up<00:07:14.610> much<00:07:14.880> easier<00:07:15.300> later<00:07:15.770> the

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:16.770 
look them up much easier later the

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.590 
look them up much easier later the
second<00:07:17.190> type<00:07:17.340> of<00:07:17.550> category<00:07:17.910> we<00:07:18.240> looked<00:07:18.480> at

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
second type of category we looked at

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.710 
second type of category we looked at
where<00:07:18.750> the<00:07:18.930> link<00:07:19.140> categories<00:07:19.770> and<00:07:20.360> as<00:07:21.360> we

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:21.720 
where the link categories and as we

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.260 
where the link categories and as we
discovered<00:07:22.230> links<00:07:22.680> are<00:07:22.860> simply<00:07:23.580> URLs<00:07:24.120> to

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:24.270 
discovered links are simply URLs to

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.140 
discovered links are simply URLs to
external<00:07:25.020> sites<00:07:25.290> and<00:07:25.670> this<00:07:26.670> gives<00:07:26.820> us<00:07:27.030> the

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:27.150 
external sites and this gives us the

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:30.650 
external sites and this gives us the
ability<00:07:27.240> to<00:07:27.950> group<00:07:28.950> our<00:07:29.160> links<00:07:29.580> into<00:07:29.880> logical

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 
ability to group our links into logical

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.820 
ability to group our links into logical
categories<00:07:31.940> so<00:07:32.940> we<00:07:33.090> can<00:07:33.320> search<00:07:34.320> those<00:07:34.620> much

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
categories so we can search those much

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:39.080 
categories so we can search those much
easier

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.090
