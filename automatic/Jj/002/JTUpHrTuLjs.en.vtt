hey what's up YouTube brother Bastogne
here<00:00:05.310> with<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.640> new<00:00:05.819> drawing<00:00:06.089> time-lapse<00:00:06.750> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
here with the new drawing time-lapse and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.520 
here with the new drawing time-lapse and
today<00:00:07.440> we<00:00:07.740> are<00:00:08.059> revisiting<00:00:09.059> some<00:00:09.809> characters

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
today we are revisiting some characters

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.360 
today we are revisiting some characters
that<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> drew<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> couple<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.759> videos<00:00:12.090> ago<00:00:12.200> the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
that I drew a couple of videos ago the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.650 
that I drew a couple of videos ago the
person<00:00:14.370> who<00:00:14.549> commissioned<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.210> those<00:00:15.420> two

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
person who commissioned that those two

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.439 
person who commissioned that those two
character<00:00:16.139> concepts<00:00:16.619> wanted<00:00:17.580> some<00:00:17.880> art<00:00:18.210> of

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
character concepts wanted some art of

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
character concepts wanted some art of
them<00:00:18.660> fighting<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.980> like<00:00:20.279> lunging<00:00:20.850> at<00:00:21.029> each

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
them fighting or like lunging at each

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.660 
them fighting or like lunging at each
other<00:00:21.359> so<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> was<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.890> basic<00:00:23.310> idea<00:00:23.430> behind

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
other so that was the basic idea behind

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.330 
other so that was the basic idea behind
this<00:00:24.150> drawing<00:00:24.420> I<00:00:25.380> thought<00:00:25.949> about<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
this drawing I thought about the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.480 
this drawing I thought about the
composition<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.240> while<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.869> tried<00:00:28.140> to

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
composition for a while and I tried to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.790 
composition for a while and I tried to
take<00:00:29.490> into<00:00:29.880> consideration<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.800> fighting

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
take into consideration the fighting

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.370 
take into consideration the fighting
abilities<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.790> these<00:00:33.000> two<00:00:33.239> characters<00:00:33.719> like

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
abilities of these two characters like

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.160 
abilities of these two characters like
one<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> them<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.420> like<00:00:36.420> melee<00:00:36.840> fighter

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
one of them is this like melee fighter

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.400 
one of them is this like melee fighter
with<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.129> booster<00:00:38.579> gauntlets<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.899> probably

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
with like booster gauntlets so probably

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.280 
with like booster gauntlets so probably
kind<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.770> acrobatic<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> fast<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.809> like

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
kind of acrobatic and fast and like

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.220 
kind of acrobatic and fast and like
jumpy<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.610> other<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.120> like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
jumpy and the other one is like a is a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.520 
jumpy and the other one is like a is a
smaller<00:00:46.649> girl<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> huge<00:00:47.820> sniper<00:00:48.239> rifle<00:00:48.809> so

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
smaller girl with a huge sniper rifle so

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600 
smaller girl with a huge sniper rifle so
probably<00:00:49.950> more<00:00:50.370> grounded<00:00:51.120> more<00:00:51.539> defensive<00:00:52.610> so

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
probably more grounded more defensive so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.779 
probably more grounded more defensive so
I<00:00:53.640> tried<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.350> reflect<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> poses<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I tried to reflect that in the poses and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.349 
I tried to reflect that in the poses and
how<00:00:57.000> they<00:00:57.239> sort<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.660> interact<00:00:58.280> with<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.550> with

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
how they sort of interact with the with

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.510 
how they sort of interact with the with
a<00:01:00.390> melee<00:01:00.780> character<00:01:00.930> diving<00:01:01.829> from<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> top<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
a melee character diving from the top of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.960 
a melee character diving from the top of
the<00:01:02.640> page<00:01:02.850> going<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.840> really<00:01:04.379> aggressively

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
the page going in really aggressively

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.000 
the page going in really aggressively
try<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> make<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> look<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:06.659> she's<00:01:07.010> she's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
try to make it look like she's she's

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.010 
try to make it look like she's she's
charging<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.880> punch<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.570> those<00:01:09.780> gauntlets

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
charging a punch with those gauntlets

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.090 
charging a punch with those gauntlets
and<00:01:10.939> then<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.290> sniper<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.680> long-range

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and then the sniper the long-range

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.060 
and then the sniper the long-range
character<00:01:14.670> more<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.299> dashing<00:01:15.810> back<00:01:16.070> evading

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
character more like dashing back evading

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.300 
character more like dashing back evading
like<00:01:18.000> repositioning<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> get<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> better<00:01:19.950> shot

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
like repositioning to get a better shot

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.700 
like repositioning to get a better shot
maybe<00:01:20.720> but<00:01:21.720> yeah<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.140> wanted<00:01:22.470> something

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
maybe but yeah I just wanted something

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.700 
maybe but yeah I just wanted something
more<00:01:23.570> vertical<00:01:24.570> in<00:01:24.780> terms<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.380> composition

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
more vertical in terms of composition

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.980 
more vertical in terms of composition
instead<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.820> both<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> them<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
instead of both of them just on the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.260 
instead of both of them just on the
ground<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.619> same<00:01:28.799> level<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.310> talked<00:01:30.180> about

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
ground on the same level I talked about

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
ground on the same level I talked about
the<00:01:30.689> giant<00:01:31.259> rifle<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> giant<00:01:32.400> weapons

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
the giant rifle and the giant weapons

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
the giant rifle and the giant weapons
issue<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.390> general<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> video<00:01:34.380> where<00:01:34.680> our

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
issue in general and the video where our

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.510 
issue in general and the video where our
first<00:01:35.100> drew<00:01:35.790> Ashera<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.840> sniper<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
first drew Ashera the sniper and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.760 
first drew Ashera the sniper and
obviously<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.939> with<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.500> with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> dynamic

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
obviously here with a with a dynamic

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.920 
obviously here with a with a dynamic
pose<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.579> with<00:01:41.700> movement<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> characters

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
pose and with movement of the characters

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.340 
pose and with movement of the characters
involved<00:01:44.000> making<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.329> giant<00:01:45.570> weapon<00:01:45.990> look

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
involved making a giant weapon look

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.069 
involved making a giant weapon look
practical<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.310> at<00:01:47.939> least<00:01:48.329> somewhat<00:01:48.750> usable

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
practical and at least somewhat usable

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.310 
practical and at least somewhat usable
was<00:01:49.950> even<00:01:50.280> harder<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.909> there<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
was even harder and there is actually a

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.249 
was even harder and there is actually a
whole<00:01:52.560> explanation<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> lore<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.759> these

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
whole explanation in the lore of these

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.459 
whole explanation in the lore of these
characters<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:56.159> how<00:01:56.340> she<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:57.210> use<00:01:57.479> she<00:01:58.320> can

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
characters as to how she can use she can

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.310 
characters as to how she can use she can
manipulate<00:01:58.619> her<00:01:59.280> giant<00:02:00.119> rifle<00:02:00.780> very<00:02:01.079> easily

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
manipulate her giant rifle very easily

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.219 
manipulate her giant rifle very easily
but<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.310> cannot<00:02:02.759> include<00:02:03.060> that<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.810> single

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
but I cannot include that in a single

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.679 
but I cannot include that in a single
drawing<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.729> still<00:02:06.060> has<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.479> look

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
drawing like it it still has to look

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.600 
drawing like it it still has to look
plausible<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:08.280> at<00:02:08.369> least<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.729> has<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:10.160> it<00:02:11.160> has

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
plausible or at least it has to it has

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820 
plausible or at least it has to it has
to<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:11.790> distract<00:02:12.690> by<00:02:13.020> how<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.560> we

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
to not distract by how and we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.980 
to not distract by how and we
allistic<00:02:14.160> it<00:02:14.310> looks<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:14.820> think<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.630> that's<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
allistic it looks I think that that's a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.900 
allistic it looks I think that that's a
better<00:02:16.110> way<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.380> put<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.280> she's<00:02:17.580> kind<00:02:17.820> of

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
better way to put it so she's kind of

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.970 
better way to put it so she's kind of
holding<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.480> under<00:02:18.750> her<00:02:18.900> arm<00:02:19.110> like<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.410> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
holding it under her arm like that like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.950 
holding it under her arm like that like
it<00:02:20.130> has<00:02:20.340> at<00:02:20.580> least<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.330> bit<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.630> weight

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it has at least a little bit of weight

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.880 
it has at least a little bit of weight
to<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.040> I<00:02:23.940> did<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:24.390> about<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.900> having

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
to it and I did think about the having

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.680 
to it and I did think about the having
the<00:02:26.130> rifle<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:26.820> gauntlets<00:02:27.210> actually

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
the rifle and the gauntlets actually

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
the rifle and the gauntlets actually
clash<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.380> impact<00:02:29.280> somehow<00:02:29.790> but<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
clash like impact somehow but the the

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.490 
clash like impact somehow but the the
poses<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.610> would<00:02:32.820> have<00:02:33.000> involved<00:02:33.500> were

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
poses that that would have involved were

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.480 
poses that that would have involved were
just<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.250> too<00:02:35.910> awkward<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.630> my<00:02:36.750> mind<00:02:36.960> I<00:02:37.490> mean

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
just like too awkward in my mind I mean

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.040 
just like too awkward in my mind I mean
I'm<00:02:38.610> sure<00:02:38.790> she<00:02:38.970> could<00:02:39.210> like<00:02:39.450> hold<00:02:39.810> it

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
I'm sure she could like hold it

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.230 
I'm sure she could like hold it
differently<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:40.920> melee<00:02:41.250> range<00:02:41.280> or<00:02:41.880> something

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
differently in melee range or something

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.940 
differently in melee range or something
and<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.930> would<00:02:43.110> be<00:02:43.260> just<00:02:43.290> fine

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
and it would be just fine

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.130 
and it would be just fine
but<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.280> don't<00:02:44.550> know<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:44.880> thought<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.720> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
but I don't know I thought that the the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.430 
but I don't know I thought that the the
idea<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.710> their<00:02:46.920> fight<00:02:47.250> being<00:02:47.640> more<00:02:47.910> about

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
idea of their fight being more about

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.280 
idea of their fight being more about
range<00:02:49.440> control<00:02:50.040> was<00:02:50.520> more<00:02:50.760> interesting<00:02:51.300> but

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
range control was more interesting but

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.370 
range control was more interesting but
yeah<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.500> mentioned<00:02:53.090> dynamic<00:02:54.090> poses<00:02:54.380> action

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
yeah I mentioned dynamic poses action

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.980 
yeah I mentioned dynamic poses action
poses<00:02:55.860> lunging<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:56.700> dashing<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.420> evading

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
poses lunging and dashing and evading

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.810 
poses lunging and dashing and evading
and<00:02:58.230> stuff<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.740> and<00:02:59.280> that's<00:02:59.580> always

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
and stuff like that and that's always

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.449 
and stuff like that and that's always
more<00:03:00.180> difficult<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.750> draw<00:03:01.050> than<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:02.040> neutral

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
more difficult to draw than just neutral

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.820 
more difficult to draw than just neutral
static<00:03:03.000> poses<00:03:03.540> when<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.170> have<00:03:04.320> to<00:03:04.470> capture<00:03:04.800> a

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
static poses when you have to capture a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.010 
static poses when you have to capture a
movement<00:03:05.400> and<00:03:05.610> momentum<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.630> can<00:03:06.870> be<00:03:06.990> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
movement and momentum it can be a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.949 
movement and momentum it can be a
problem<00:03:07.260> for<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.680> lot<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> people<00:03:08.250> me<00:03:08.760> included

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
problem for a lot of people me included

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.390 
problem for a lot of people me included
so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.990> thought<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.500> would<00:03:10.770> give<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:11.130> couple

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
so I thought that I would give a couple

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.480 
so I thought that I would give a couple
of<00:03:11.550> tips<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:11.970> those<00:03:12.840> types<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.290> poses<00:03:13.770> stuff

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
of tips for those types of poses stuff

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.250 
of tips for those types of poses stuff
that<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.730> try<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> keep<00:03:15.390> in<00:03:15.510> mind<00:03:15.720> while<00:03:15.930> drawing

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
that I try to keep in mind while drawing

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.820 
that I try to keep in mind while drawing
poses<00:03:16.800> like<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:19.140> most<00:03:19.320> important

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
poses like this and the most important

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.940 
poses like this and the most important
thing<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.100> me<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.670> first<00:03:20.910> thing<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.570> that<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
thing to me the first thing is that the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.550 
thing to me the first thing is that the
overall<00:03:23.430> shape<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.940> curves<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.080> body<00:03:25.110> is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
overall shape and curves of the body is

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.490 
overall shape and curves of the body is
more<00:03:26.160> important<00:03:26.730> than<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.150> details<00:03:27.510> like

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
more important than the details like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.949 
more important than the details like
when<00:03:28.830> you<00:03:28.920> start<00:03:29.250> your<00:03:29.670> drawing<00:03:29.910> don't<00:03:30.720> worry

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
when you start your drawing don't worry

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.500 
when you start your drawing don't worry
about<00:03:31.200> what<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> limbs<00:03:32.100> look<00:03:32.550> like<00:03:32.760> more

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
about what the limbs look like more

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.100 
about what the limbs look like more
about<00:03:35.090> muscle<00:03:36.090> structure<00:03:36.570> or<00:03:36.780> stuff<00:03:36.959> like

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
about muscle structure or stuff like

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.740 
about muscle structure or stuff like
that<00:03:37.260> just<00:03:37.500> zoom<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.519> really<00:03:38.970> far<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.480> look

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
that just zoom out really far and look

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.229 
that just zoom out really far and look
at<00:03:39.930> how<00:03:40.110> your<00:03:40.410> character's<00:03:40.890> body<00:03:41.130> curves<00:03:41.880> and

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
at how your character's body curves and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.630 
at how your character's body curves and
does<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.170> match<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.860> motion<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.310> you're

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
does that match the motion that you're

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.720 
does that match the motion that you're
trying<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.030> portray<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.160> this<00:03:47.280> case<00:03:47.489> for

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
trying to portray like in this case for

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.670 
trying to portray like in this case for
example<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.480> top<00:03:48.690> character<00:03:49.110> has<00:03:49.410> like

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
example that the top character has like

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.650 
example that the top character has like
an<00:03:49.830> s-shaped<00:03:50.580> curve<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.269> her<00:03:51.420> body<00:03:51.630> as<00:03:51.930> she<00:03:52.010> is

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
an s-shaped curve to her body as she is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.090 
an s-shaped curve to her body as she is
free-falling<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:55.080> kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.380> bracing<00:03:55.920> for

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
free-falling and kind of bracing for

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.710 
free-falling and kind of bracing for
impact

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
impact

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.750 
impact
well<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.590> bottom<00:03:58.890> character<00:03:59.280> has<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.459> more

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
well the the bottom character has a more

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.530 
well the the bottom character has a more
simple<00:04:00.620> like<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> reverse<00:04:02.310> see<00:04:02.880> type<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.330> shape

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
simple like a reverse see type of shape

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.259 
simple like a reverse see type of shape
like<00:04:04.290> a<00:04:04.530> line<00:04:04.920> of<00:04:05.100> action<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.760> from<00:04:06.000> horse

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
like a line of action going from horse

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.710 
like a line of action going from horse
shot<00:04:06.510> from<00:04:06.870> her<00:04:07.019> shoulders<00:04:07.560> to<00:04:08.300> to<00:04:09.300> that<00:04:09.480> foot

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
shot from her shoulders to to that foot

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.830 
shot from her shoulders to to that foot
planted<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.530> ground<00:04:10.680> pushing<00:04:11.310> her<00:04:11.489> away

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
planted in the ground pushing her away

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.289 
planted in the ground pushing her away
so<00:04:12.840> uh<00:04:12.870> yeah<00:04:13.560> before<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.160> details<00:04:14.580> or<00:04:14.910> even

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
so uh yeah before the details or even

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.080 
so uh yeah before the details or even
before<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.870> start<00:04:16.229> drawing<00:04:16.979> guidelines<00:04:17.609> for

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
before you start drawing guidelines for

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.050 
before you start drawing guidelines for
the<00:04:18.330> different<00:04:18.780> body<00:04:18.959> parts<00:04:19.700> try<00:04:20.700> just

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the different body parts try just

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.330 
the different body parts try just
starting<00:04:21.720> with<00:04:21.930> simple<00:04:22.320> gesture<00:04:23.070> lines

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
starting with simple gesture lines

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.790 
starting with simple gesture lines
action<00:04:24.180> lines<00:04:24.419> and<00:04:24.690> building<00:04:25.229> around<00:04:25.620> those

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
action lines and building around those

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.460 
action lines and building around those
once<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.550> have<00:04:26.700> that<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.120> you

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
once you have that and you

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.560 
once you have that and you
art<00:04:27.590> building<00:04:28.400> more<00:04:28.670> detailed<00:04:29.180> guidelines

art building more detailed guidelines
keep<00:04:30.380> in<00:04:30.530> mind<00:04:30.740> that<00:04:31.010> a<00:04:31.040> human<00:04:31.430> body<00:04:31.610> is<00:04:32.000> not<00:04:32.180> a

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
keep in mind that a human body is not a

solid block when it moves and the faster
it<00:04:36.890> moves<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.760> more<00:04:37.940> it<00:04:38.180> bends<00:04:38.540> and<00:04:39.220> sort<00:04:40.220> of

guidelines<00:04:46.190> for<00:04:46.760> the<00:04:46.850> human<00:04:47.120> body

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
guidelines for the human body

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.870 
guidelines for the human body
I<00:04:47.600> mentioned<00:04:48.200> that<00:04:48.260> even<00:04:48.710> in<00:04:48.920> a<00:04:49.190> static<00:04:49.670> pose

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
I mentioned that even in a static pose

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.110 
I mentioned that even in a static pose
you<00:04:50.630> should<00:04:50.870> not<00:04:51.110> use<00:04:51.680> straight<00:04:52.430> lines<00:04:52.790> as

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
you should not use straight lines as

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.600 
you should not use straight lines as
guidelines<00:04:53.600> for<00:04:54.170> like<00:04:54.440> limbs<00:04:54.920> or<00:04:55.280> for<00:04:55.490> the

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
guidelines for like limbs or for the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.240 
guidelines for like limbs or for the
spine<00:04:55.880> for<00:04:56.240> anything<00:04:56.680> everything<00:04:57.680> is<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.890> curve

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
spine for anything everything is a curve

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.270 
spine for anything everything is a curve
well<00:04:59.150> when<00:04:59.390> you<00:04:59.510> add<00:04:59.660> movement<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:00.890> it

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
well when you add movement to that it

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.160 
well when you add movement to that it
becomes<00:05:01.430> even<00:05:01.760> more<00:05:01.880> true<00:05:02.330> and<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.900> curves

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
becomes even more true and the curves

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.300 
becomes even more true and the curves
become<00:05:03.710> even<00:05:04.010> more<00:05:04.090> accentuated<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.710> S

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
become even more accentuated like the S

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.700 
become even more accentuated like the S
shapes<00:05:07.790> that<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.300> find<00:05:08.570> everywhere<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:09.590> the

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
advice in the human body everything is a

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.220 
advice in the human body everything is a
curve<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.880> in<00:05:26.090> the<00:05:26.240> human<00:05:26.570> body<00:05:26.750> in<00:05:27.020> motion

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
curve and in the human body in motion

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.090 
curve and in the human body in motion
every<00:05:27.919> curve<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.700> even<00:05:29.360> curvier<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.169> so<00:05:30.890> a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
every curve is even curvier and so a

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.700 
every curve is even curvier and so a
third<00:05:31.340> thing<00:05:31.930> third<00:05:32.930> advice<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.530> would<00:05:33.680> give

third thing third advice I would give

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.000 
third thing third advice I would give
something<00:05:34.550> that<00:05:34.900> may<00:05:35.900> be<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:36.050> little<00:05:36.290> easier<00:05:36.770> to

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.010 
something that may be a little easier to

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:40.780 
something that may be a little easier to
apply<00:05:37.310> and<00:05:37.640> practice<00:05:37.990> you<00:05:38.990> can<00:05:39.200> use<00:05:39.790> details

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
apply and practice you can use details

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.330 
apply and practice you can use details
on<00:05:41.030> your<00:05:41.150> character<00:05:41.419> to<00:05:41.930> accentuate<00:05:42.350> movement

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
on your character to accentuate movement

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.120 
on your character to accentuate movement
like<00:05:43.729> in<00:05:43.940> this<00:05:44.150> drawing<00:05:44.419> for<00:05:44.870> example<00:05:45.260> stuff

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
like in this drawing for example stuff

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:50.409 
like in this drawing for example stuff
like<00:05:46.340> the<00:05:47.150> the<00:05:47.720> cape<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.320> hair<00:05:48.590> the<00:05:49.419> jacket

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:50.419 
like the the cape the hair the jacket

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.150 
like the the cape the hair the jacket
and<00:05:50.930> the<00:05:51.050> straps<00:05:51.380> and<00:05:51.650> stuff<00:05:51.830> like<00:05:51.979> that

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
and the straps and stuff like that

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.180 
and the straps and stuff like that
anything<00:05:52.669> that<00:05:52.700> moves<00:05:53.120> anything<00:05:53.660> that<00:05:53.810> flows

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.190 
anything that moves anything that flows

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.950 
anything that moves anything that flows
anything<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:55.340> is<00:05:55.460> affected<00:05:55.940> by<00:05:56.120> airflow<00:05:56.390> and

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
anything that is affected by airflow and

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.469 
anything that is affected by airflow and
momentum<00:05:57.530> can<00:05:58.100> be<00:05:58.280> a<00:05:58.310> great<00:05:58.610> way<00:05:58.790> to<00:05:58.820> drive

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
momentum can be a great way to drive

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:01.600 
momentum can be a great way to drive
home<00:05:59.810> the<00:06:00.140> point<00:06:00.290> that<00:06:00.680> these<00:06:01.040> characters<00:06:01.580> are

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
home the point that these characters are

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:06.250 
home the point that these characters are
moving<00:06:02.830> so<00:06:03.830> take<00:06:04.610> your<00:06:04.880> initial<00:06:05.510> action<00:06:05.960> lines

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
moving so take your initial action lines

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.130 
moving so take your initial action lines
and<00:06:06.530> make<00:06:07.040> all<00:06:07.310> these<00:06:07.550> things<00:06:08.030> move<00:06:08.419> and<00:06:08.750> flow

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
and make all these things move and flow

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.610 
and make all these things move and flow
along<00:06:09.650> those<00:06:09.890> lines<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:11.000> more<00:06:11.380> coherent<00:06:12.380> you

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
along those lines the more coherent you

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.860 
along those lines the more coherent you
can<00:06:12.800> keep<00:06:12.979> it<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.729> more<00:06:13.910> you<00:06:14.060> can<00:06:14.210> see<00:06:14.479> those

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
can keep it the more you can see those

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.050 
can keep it the more you can see those
action<00:06:15.290> lines<00:06:15.530> in<00:06:15.800> all<00:06:16.010> these<00:06:16.370> little<00:06:16.880> details
