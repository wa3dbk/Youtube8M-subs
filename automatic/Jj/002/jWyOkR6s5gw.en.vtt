I<00:00:01.190> want<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.220> talk<00:00:02.340> about<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.790> Brixton<00:00:03.179> arches

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:03.740 
I want to talk about the Brixton arches

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.140 
I want to talk about the Brixton arches
that's<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.799> reason<00:00:04.920> that<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.339> speaking<00:00:05.819> and

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
that's the reason that I'm speaking and

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.080 
that's the reason that I'm speaking and
one<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.480> reasons<00:00:06.509> we've<00:00:07.170> been<00:00:07.379> marching

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
one of the reasons we've been marching

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.629 
one of the reasons we've been marching
well<00:00:09.090> you'll<00:00:09.240> want<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.570> put<00:00:09.719> Brixton<00:00:10.200> first

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
well you'll want to put Brixton first

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.610 
well you'll want to put Brixton first
but<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> do<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.389> true<00:00:12.870> that<00:00:13.049> we<00:00:13.380> must

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
but to do that is true that we must

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.939 
but to do that is true that we must
define<00:00:14.040> Brixton<00:00:14.849> first<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:16.109> ways<00:00:16.289> Brixton

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
define Brixton first so ways Brixton

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.310 
define Brixton first so ways Brixton
well<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:18.150> could<00:00:18.270> argue<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.900> place<00:00:19.140> could

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
well one could argue that a place could

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.590 
well one could argue that a place could
be<00:00:19.439> defined<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.279> one<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.760> following<00:00:21.029> basis

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
be defined on one of the following basis

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.509 
be defined on one of the following basis
i'll<00:00:21.810> make<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.140> concise<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:23.070> say<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> place

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
i'll make this concise they say a place

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400 
i'll make this concise they say a place
