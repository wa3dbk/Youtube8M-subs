00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 new man o man the avenues of butter that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.490
 has no intro who has made a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.830
 with a drawing all rotten in 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 singing anything your morning we in 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.519
 cheap credit on the site fifa.com and 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.990
 to claude nobs even 5% of 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.280
 reduction in addition there is even tutorial 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 to explain how to order so if 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.980
 you get there pop throw nothing for you 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.660
 I saw that it's the same name 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.730
 finds for the final the Argentine neither 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 the final norman possible its suitcases 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.150
 sorry in argentina why am I 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.740
 not live because I have a card and 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.730
 audacity that he was corrupt I did 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.529
 what I could to recover I did 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 never succeeds so I saw myself badly or 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.349
 pretend to be live we're going 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.820
 federate to make this small final 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.620
 finally this big final even in 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.989
 sequences and so you see the team of 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.760
 my opponent a blunder of very good 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.930
 augur with them that means nothing of 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.620
 auspicious but hey it's okay 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 you see we had to iniesta we got 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.700
 due pedro we had benzema onu carlos vela 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 Chess players par excellence we had to 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.899
 James Rodriguez was offered a beautiful 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.920
 bba team and it'll start for 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.629
 rather not bad but good the first 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 action it will be to my account 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.149
 match frankly it's towards 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.770
 the opponent and defend very very well 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.210
 me also it was more a duel of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.809
 defenses world still managed to get 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 to make a small opening 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.500
 quietly and striking 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.420
 n de di maria that puts 20 minutes before 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.860
 to lift the paw on the counterattack 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.390
 almost at stake the 15th minute the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 first foray my opponent into 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.290
 my camp and it ends with a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.610
 opening score of his carlos vela la 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.600
 strike from the left michael it's almost 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.250
 the same action that I just did I 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.960
 I'm seeing this but him by 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 against are will make his player to score 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.840
 obviously guardian bread pat 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.460
 cavallero stops is not the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.390
 best goalkeeper of the game but hey it's 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.850
 like that to 0 for my opponent 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.770
 maybe a thirteenth defeat in 15 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 finals that every 15 offers on 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.950
 my channel it starts to be a lot 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.360
 here is 0 during the opponent who 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.290
 continues more beautiful opening you 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.850
 have very good opening every time 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.020
 that there is a defensible with pedro the 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.820
 big hit of pedro it's pushed back 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.170
 by my guardian it starts to be very 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.970
 very hot we still arrive at 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.799
 still get a little hungry yet 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.060
 a new opportunity there in shifts for 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.350
 lavezzi had said he is right-handed and ben 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.640
 no they send a species of his rating 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.140
 from the left that passes squarely above 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.329
 47th minute 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 again we see that it is not 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.610
 spent a lot on stats 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.780
 you see three strikes three times a 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.340
 year for my typing opponent for 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.930
 mold to frames and inevitably it's 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.579
 much harder to mark the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.670
 final and even more difficult than 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.220
 from the beginning of this second period 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.180
 marca second the 48th minute is pedro 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.189
 who escapes alone is not 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.209
 overtaken by my defense wearing toth on 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.259
 commitment we will try to do the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.459
 small straight to the small wheels 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.540
 quiet no it's not an all-right 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.099
 does you see that this is a 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.180
 complicated tournament small wheels 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.040
 little fan of typing 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.270
 we get on with the bdis screams on 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.840
 his good foot must also but by the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.430
 good position 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.050
 unfortunately we can not get there 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.459
 actions that we chained 54th minute 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.080
 perhaps say why not but if 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.400
 that we finally see if pushed back by the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.569
 guardian but if body still a fact 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.350
 hand that will have made a match yet 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.780
 transparent 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.040
 66th minute we work a little envied of 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.780
 put his game quietly we are on 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.340
 see that we are attacked we find pastore 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.930
 pastore on the left foot the typing of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.160
 pastore and the pole the pole 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.750
 unfortunately when it does not want that 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.519
 not want her 17th minute a beautiful 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 opening a beautiful and there at the moment 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.319
 nutella the track they do not see there 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.459
 even when I want to do pbs arias 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.330
 finals where it does not go I wanted 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.350
 to do a ps yes I know this is 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 disgusting but the opponent has very 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.720
 well defended 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.040
 90th minute you see we are going very very 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.060
 quickly he had very few opportunities I 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.230
 thought I had made a mistake and 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.730
 no apparently it's the opponent who 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.440
 once done his bibi so the refereed 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.310
 whistle a penalty for me 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.390
 personally I thought that when we 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.560
 see the slow ones that because there is 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.010
 still his knee in her ass we 're going 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.660
 not lie to each other 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.680
 so I still think it's she 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.989
 had said he had made fault not 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.880
 at all so lionel finally who will serve 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.569
 to something since I'm talking to you a 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.700
 bit 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.170
 the score he will succeed in scoring when 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.849
 even small typing see a little this 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.230
 position the fox's eye he rushes he 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.370
 rushes and of course deceives the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.879
 lionel messi guardian never lie 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.930
 idle sheets in penalty and 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.010
 now as we in the 90th minute you 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.269
 go see that my opponent to be done 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.829
 a small sequence of passes at ten 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.959
 since he is very fond of his 2000 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.590
 not afraid to lie to each other 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.239
 unfortunately we have not arrived from 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.650
 everything to see her my opponent who takes 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.480
 won this victory deserves and 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.500
 frankly this deserved to 1 to say we're going 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.569
 go see the general stages of the match 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.200
 13th defeat so in 15 finals that 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:37.609
 begins to do a lot 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.900
 we do not inherit in the final at the level of 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.310
 general stages of the match I saw that 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.319
 my guy already did that because his is in 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.519
 did 8 and at the stats level will do 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.239
 handsome and he hit four times less 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:46.489
 six times but I hit 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.780
 - in the frame again a final of 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.859
 lost it's not serious yet very 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.280
 next time tell you next and 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.090
 wear well 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.090
 Hi everybody
