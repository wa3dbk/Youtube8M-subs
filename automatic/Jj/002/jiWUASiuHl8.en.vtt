00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
since a little more difficult to see

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.420 
since a little more difficult to see
because<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> way<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:40.100> crossed<00:00:41.100> my<00:00:41.190> hair

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430

the<00:04:26.250> real<00:04:26.520> key<00:04:26.820> to<00:04:26.850> this<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.389> just

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
the real key to this is just

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.120 
the real key to this is just
concentrating<00:04:28.470> on<00:04:28.470> what<00:04:28.710> you're<00:04:28.860> doing

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
because it is a little disorienting to

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.960 
because it is a little disorienting to
grab<00:04:31.650> hair<00:04:31.949> from<00:04:32.100> not<00:04:32.389> opposite<00:04:33.389> side<00:04:33.630> but<00:04:34.970> you

get<00:04:36.180> used<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.690> it<00:04:36.990> will<00:04:37.050> be<00:04:37.199> committed<00:04:37.620> to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
get used to it it will be committed to

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.020 
get used to it it will be committed to
muscle<00:04:38.100> memory<00:04:38.280> after<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.820> few<00:04:39.350> turns<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.850> can

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
muscle memory after a few turns you can

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.500 
muscle memory after a few turns you can
go<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.180> little<00:04:42.360> faster<00:04:42.510> but<00:04:44.210> just<00:04:45.210> be<00:04:45.479> patient
