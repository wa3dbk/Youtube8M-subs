00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
when you're starting off with something

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
when you're starting off with something
you're<00:00:53.789> working<00:00:53.969> from<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.420> color<00:00:54.719> photo<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you're working from a color photo and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
you're working from a color photo and
you're<00:00:55.469> translating<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.219> into<00:00:56.340> black<00:00:57.000> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you're translating it into black and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.270 
you're translating it into black and
white<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:58.230> every<00:00:58.680> colored<00:00:59.039> photo

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
white is that not every colored photo

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220 
white is that not every colored photo
translates<00:01:00.059> well<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.300> black<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.079> white

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
translates well into black and white

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.479 
translates well into black and white
this<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> something<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.100> happen<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
this is something that I see happen a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.369 
this is something that I see happen a
lot<00:01:02.670> with<00:01:02.850> amateur<00:01:03.270> photographers<00:01:03.930> they

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
lot with amateur photographers they

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.960 
lot with amateur photographers they
think<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.769> they<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.250> take<00:01:05.430> any<00:01:05.610> photo

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
think that they can just take any photo

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.760 
think that they can just take any photo
and<00:01:06.330> change<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> into<00:01:06.930> black<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.229> white<00:01:07.530> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
and change it into black and white and

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.600 
bam there this amazing photographer and
that<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.650> it<00:01:10.740> works<00:01:10.920> rendering

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that is just not how it works rendering

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.920 
that is just not how it works rendering
things<00:01:11.880> into<00:01:12.090> black<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.450> white<00:01:12.570> whether<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
things into black and white whether it

things into black and white whether it
be<00:01:13.020> photography<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.040> face<00:01:14.250> taking<00:01:14.610> a

be photography or in your face taking a
color<00:01:14.909> photograph<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.540> translating<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.409> into

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
color photograph and translating it into

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
color photograph and translating it into
black<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.159> white<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> actually<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.090> really

black and white and actually be really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.480 
black and white and actually be really
difficult<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.930> do<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.350> color<00:01:19.799> you've<00:01:20.189> got<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
difficult to do in color you've got the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.399 
difficult to do in color you've got the
colors<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.909> are<00:01:21.210> actually<00:01:21.420> separating<00:01:22.229> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
colors that are actually separating one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230 
colors that are actually separating one
object<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.950> another<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.729> sometimes<00:01:24.090> when

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
object from another but sometimes when

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.670 
object from another but sometimes when
you<00:01:24.330> translate<00:01:24.630> those<00:01:24.869> into<00:01:24.930> black<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.409> white

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you translate those into black and white

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
you translate those into black and white
like<00:01:25.860> I've<00:01:25.979> done<00:01:26.130> here<00:01:26.400> with<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:26.729> sample

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
like I've done here with your sample

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.749 
like I've done here with your sample
photo<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.280> colors<00:01:29.549> are<00:01:29.729> so

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
photo you can see that the colors are so

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.399 
photo you can see that the colors are so
muted<00:01:30.420> they're<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.840> they're<00:01:31.110> too<00:01:31.259> close

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
muted they're just they're too close

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.380 
muted they're just they're too close
together<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.040> value<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.030> you're<00:01:33.210> not

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
together in value and so you're not

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
together in value and so you're not
getting<00:01:33.810> enough<00:01:34.079> contrast<00:01:34.470> there<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.009> one<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
getting enough contrast there now one of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.710 
getting enough contrast there now one of
the<00:01:35.430> things<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.640> I<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.150> your<00:01:36.509> piece

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the things that I like and your piece

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.569 
the things that I like and your piece
you<00:01:37.079> hiked<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.560> out<00:01:37.710> quite<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> bit<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.400> made

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
you hiked that out quite a bit you made

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.390 
you hiked that out quite a bit you made
your<00:01:38.820> peppers<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.299> hut<00:01:39.630> or<00:01:40.020> jalapenos<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.829> don't

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
your peppers a hut or jalapenos I don't

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.440 
your peppers a hut or jalapenos I don't
know<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> don't<00:01:41.640> cook<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.090> don't<00:01:42.270> know<00:01:42.329> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
know I don't cook so I don't know the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
know I don't cook so I don't know the
difference<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.290> made<00:01:43.590> everything<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.340> lot

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
difference but you made everything a lot

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.999 
difference but you made everything a lot
lighter<00:01:44.850> than<00:01:45.140> what<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.259> actual<00:01:46.560> reference

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
lighter than what the actual reference

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
lighter than what the actual reference
photo<00:01:47.280> would<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> changed<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
photo would have when you changed it to

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.330 
photo would have when you changed it to
black<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.020> white<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:49.560> even<00:01:49.680> still<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:50.280> think

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
black and white but even still I think

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.190 
black and white but even still I think
that<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.759> could<00:01:50.939> pull<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> little<00:01:51.960> bit

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
that you could pull out a little bit

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.539 
that you could pull out a little bit
more<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> lights<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.100> darks<00:01:53.399> on

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
more with the lights and the darks on

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.219 
more with the lights and the darks on
the<00:01:53.880> peppers<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.720> they'll<00:01:54.840> stand<00:01:55.020> out

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the peppers so that they'll stand out

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
the peppers so that they'll stand out
that<00:01:55.259> much<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.399> only<00:01:56.549> real<00:01:56.880> thing

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that much more so the only real thing

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.910 
that much more so the only real thing
that<00:01:57.329> I<00:01:57.360> would<00:01:57.509> adjust<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that I would adjust on this is to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.160 
that I would adjust on this is to
strengthen<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.909> shadows<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.570> all<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239

look better if I adjusted these values
and<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:27.870> case<00:02:28.050> I<00:02:28.230> would<00:02:28.680> strengthen<00:02:29.160> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
