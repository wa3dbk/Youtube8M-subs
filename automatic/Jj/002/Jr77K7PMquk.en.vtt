00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.340 
both phones are bigger than the current
5s<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.730> now<00:00:17.850> feature<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.449> rounded<00:00:19.050> edges

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
5s and now feature these rounded edges

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.260 
5s and now feature these rounded edges
that<00:00:19.529> kind<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.920> give<00:00:20.039> the<00:00:20.130> phone<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.580> slightly

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
that kind of give the phone a slightly

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.700 
that kind of give the phone a slightly
different<00:00:21.539> look<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:21.960> would<00:00:22.109> say<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.619> new

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
different look I would say the new

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.290 
different look I would say the new
design<00:00:23.039> changes<00:00:23.400> actually<00:00:23.580> make<00:00:23.880> both<00:00:24.090> phones

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
design changes actually make both phones

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.120 
design changes actually make both phones
look<00:00:24.810> more<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.170> an<00:00:25.289> iPad<00:00:25.710> than<00:00:25.920> they<00:00:26.010> look

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
look more like an iPad than they look

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.349 
look more like an iPad than they look
like<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> iPhone<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.939> that's<00:00:27.000> things<00:00:27.269> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
like the iPhone and that's things that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.970 
like the iPhone and that's things that
are<00:00:27.449> bad<00:00:27.689> or<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.230> but<00:00:28.289> just<00:00:28.710> something<00:00:28.949> that

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980

which<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.950> 25%<00:00:35.850> faster<00:00:36.059> than<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> last

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
which is about 25% faster than the last

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.299 
which is about 25% faster than the last
generation<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.770> also<00:00:37.950> have<00:00:38.160> been

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
generation and they also have been

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.520 
generation and they also have been
upgraded<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.940> m8<00:00:39.270> coprocessor<00:00:40.200> which

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
upgraded to the m8 coprocessor which

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.049 
upgraded to the m8 coprocessor which
handles<00:00:40.890> all<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> motion<00:00:41.520> stuff<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
handles all the motion stuff like the

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.700 
handles all the motion stuff like the
gyroscope<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> accelerometer<00:00:43.350> for

basically all of the health stuff and

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.139 
basically all of the health stuff and
the<00:00:45.360> stuff<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.750> 90<00:00:46.110> plus<00:00:46.579> size-wise<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.910> six

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
