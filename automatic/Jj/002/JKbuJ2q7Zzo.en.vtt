the<00:01:16.020> bottle<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.509> squeeze<00:01:19.020> it<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.730 

little<00:01:24.540> bit<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.900> hemant<00:01:25.320> goes<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little bit so that hemant goes to the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.249 
little bit so that hemant goes to the
bottom<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.460> bottle<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.080> fill

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
bottom of the bottle and then you fill

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.780 
bottom of the bottle and then you fill
it<00:01:28.409> some<00:01:28.590> more<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.340> fill<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it some more because when you fill it

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.469 
it some more because when you fill it
the<00:01:30.170> henna<00:01:31.170> paste<00:01:31.229> doesn't<00:01:31.740> always<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.479> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the henna paste doesn't always go to the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.390 
the henna paste doesn't always go to the
bottom<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:36.500> bottle<00:01:37.500> initially<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.159> you

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
bottom of the bottle initially so you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
bottom of the bottle initially so you
have<00:01:38.640> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890

tap it make sure it goes in there and

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.030 
tap it make sure it goes in there and
just<00:01:44.450> fill<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.630> as<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:46.020> much<00:01:46.290> as<00:01:46.470> you<00:01:46.590> can

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.790 
take the tip and you screw that into the
cap<00:02:12.450> if<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.750> look<00:02:12.930> there<00:02:13.200> there's<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.470> little

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
cap if you look there there's a little

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.470 
cap if you look there there's a little
opening<00:02:14.550> there<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.930> part<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.800> loops

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
opening there and this part of the loops

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
opening there and this part of the loops
as<00:02:18.480> part<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> tip<00:02:19.200> fits<00:02:19.470> right<00:02:19.680> over<00:02:19.739> that

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
as part of the tip fits right over that

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.770 
as part of the tip fits right over that
and<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.580> twist<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.000> on<00:02:21.120> until<00:02:21.480> it's<00:02:21.630> snug

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and you just twist it on until it's snug

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.670 
and you just twist it on until it's snug
if<00:02:22.530> it's<00:02:23.430> loose<00:02:23.670> then<00:02:23.940> it'll<00:02:24.420> pop<00:02:24.750> off<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.380> top

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
if it's loose then it'll pop off the top

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.380 
if it's loose then it'll pop off the top
and<00:02:26.010> then<00:02:26.220> hitta<00:02:26.430> will<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.760> everywhere<00:02:27.120> so<00:02:27.180> you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
and then hitta will be everywhere so you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.430 
and then hitta will be everywhere so you
just<00:02:27.600> want<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> screw<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.050> in<00:02:28.140> there<00:02:28.320> until

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
just want to screw it in there until

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.190 
just want to screw it in there until
it's<00:02:28.709> snug<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.880> it<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.239> pretty<00:02:30.540> easy<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.989> can

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
it's snug then it is pretty easy you can

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.890 
it's snug then it is pretty easy you can
do<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.040> about<00:02:32.160> anything<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.750> it

do just about anything you like and it
flows<00:02:37.170> pretty<00:02:37.440> easily<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.209> much

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
flows pretty easily it's not much

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.330 
flows pretty easily it's not much
different<00:02:39.540> than<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.260> cone<00:02:40.500> in<00:02:40.830> my<00:02:41.010> opinion

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
different than the cone in my opinion

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.860 
different than the cone in my opinion
you<00:02:44.340> can<00:02:44.489> do<00:02:44.610> all<00:02:44.730> sorts<00:02:44.760> of<00:02:45.150> small<00:02:45.450> details

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
you can do all sorts of small details

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.650 
you can do all sorts of small details
and<00:02:46.080> because<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:47.180> stainless<00:02:48.180> steel<00:02:48.209> tips

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
and because the stainless steel tips

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.370 
and because the stainless steel tips
come<00:02:48.959> in<00:02:49.140> several<00:02:49.380> different<00:02:49.610> gauge<00:02:50.610> sizes

come in several different gauge sizes

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.320 
come in several different gauge sizes
you<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.560> have<00:02:52.769> tiny<00:02:53.160> openings<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.150> have

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
large openings you can do lots of

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.880 
large openings you can do lots of
different<00:02:57.959> designs<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> really<00:02:58.860> cool

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
different designs and the really cool

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.380 
different designs and the really cool
thing<00:02:59.220> about<00:02:59.250> that<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.700> while<00:03:00.000> you're<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
middle of doing a design if you want to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.850 
middle of doing a design if you want to
switch<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.519> a<00:03:02.549> larger<00:03:03.320> stainless<00:03:04.320> steel<00:03:04.530> gauge

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
switch to a larger stainless steel gauge

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.560 
switch to a larger stainless steel gauge
size<00:03:05.190> you<00:03:05.400> just<00:03:05.430> twist<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.000> off<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.420> put<00:03:06.480> a

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
size you just twist this off and put a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.900 
size you just twist this off and put a
new<00:03:06.630> one<00:03:06.780> on<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.320> it's<00:03:08.010> just<00:03:08.250> that<00:03:08.430> easy

you may have some questions about
cleaning<00:03:11.810> these<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:15.540> put<00:03:15.750> these<00:03:16.040> just

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
cleaning these I just put these just

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.190 
cleaning these I just put these just
soak<00:03:17.220> them<00:03:17.250> in<00:03:17.489> water<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.030> don't<00:03:18.720> let<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.019> henna

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
soak them in water I don't let the henna

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.690 
soak them in water I don't let the henna
get<00:03:19.410> dry<00:03:19.620> in<00:03:19.680> these<00:03:19.860> because<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.430> really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
get dry in these because that's really

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.830 
get dry in these because that's really
hard<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:20.970> get<00:03:21.060> it<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.510> can<00:03:21.630> get<00:03:21.750> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
hard to get it out and you can get it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.890 
hard to get it out and you can get it
out<00:03:21.989> with<00:03:22.170> like<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.320> safety<00:03:22.799> pin<00:03:23.010> or<00:03:23.900> straight

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
out with like a safety pin or straight

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.420 
out with like a safety pin or straight
pin<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.230> can<00:03:25.350> just<00:03:25.530> stick<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.010> tip<00:03:26.220> if

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
pin you can just stick it in the tip if

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.430 
pin you can just stick it in the tip if
you<00:03:27.120> let<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.450> henna<00:03:27.630> accidentally<00:03:28.290> get

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
you let the henna accidentally get

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.070 
you let the henna accidentally get
clogged<00:03:28.739> inside<00:03:29.160> of<00:03:29.340> there<00:03:29.750> if<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.870> let<00:03:31.049> it

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
clogged inside of there if you let it

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.830 
clogged inside of there if you let it
dry<00:03:31.380> out<00:03:31.560> inside<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.730> poke<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.420> pin<00:03:33.540> through

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
dry out inside just poke a pin through

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.750 
dry out inside just poke a pin through
and<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.080> will<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.410> heart<00:03:34.739> drying<00:03:35.519> out

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and that will get the heart drying out

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.940 
and that will get the heart drying out
and<00:03:36.750> where<00:03:36.930> you<00:03:37.110> can<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.500> soak<00:03:37.709> them<00:03:37.739> in

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
and where you can just soak them in

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.229 
and where you can just soak them in
water<00:03:38.220> where<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.640> want<00:03:38.820> to<00:03:38.880> clean<00:03:39.000> them

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
water where you want to clean them

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.420 
water where you want to clean them
that's<00:03:39.450> what<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.660> do<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.590> I<00:03:41.570> soaked<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
that's what I do and I soaked the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.199 
that's what I do and I soaked the
this<00:03:44.180> part<00:03:44.510> and<00:03:44.689> water<00:03:44.959> as<00:03:45.230> well<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:46.180> then<00:03:47.180> I

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
this part and water as well and then I

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.300 
this part and water as well and then I
just<00:03:47.569> wash<00:03:47.780> this<00:03:47.989> like<00:03:48.260> I'd<00:03:48.470> wash<00:03:48.709> any<00:03:48.920> bottle

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
just wash this like I'd wash any bottle

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.280 
just wash this like I'd wash any bottle
if<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.909> find<00:03:50.269> that<00:03:50.390> the<00:03:50.540> bottle<00:03:50.840> is<00:03:50.959> a<00:03:51.049> little

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
if you find that the bottle is a little

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.720 
if you find that the bottle is a little
bit<00:03:51.409> too<00:03:51.590> hard<00:03:51.860> for<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.129> to<00:03:52.220> squeeze<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.700> can

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
bit too hard for you to squeeze you can

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.630 
bit too hard for you to squeeze you can
boil<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.269> just<00:03:53.780> put<00:03:53.930> a<00:03:54.230> pot<00:03:54.980> of<00:03:55.040> boiling<00:03:55.430> water

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
boil it just put a pot of boiling water

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.330 
boil it just put a pot of boiling water
on<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.060> stove<00:03:56.299> small<00:03:56.750> pot<00:03:56.989> just<00:03:57.769> put<00:03:58.010> this<00:03:58.129> in

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
on the stove small pot just put this in

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.190 
on the stove small pot just put this in
there<00:03:58.519> less<00:03:59.299> than<00:03:59.540> 10<00:03:59.720> minutes<00:03:59.930> probably

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
there less than 10 minutes probably
