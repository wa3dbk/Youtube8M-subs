00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.530
 while there is no trunk 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.819
 chain 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.130
 sagged heavily 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.780
 cottages

 Here are such things Well, for now 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.850
 naturally more 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:56.590
 five years and back to the bike 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.770
 Well, I hope it will be more pleasant as long as 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.770

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.829
 decided to sit out 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.829
 dad I'll have coffee now and go further 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.650

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.070
 this 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.950
 companion fall 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:42.090
 Hello everyone, I got out safely 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:44.280
 It cost only blows in general 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.590
 get out of the way went not because 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:53.189
 direction in general on the navigator forgot 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:05:06.240
 look got in general here judge here 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:05:09.539
 yourself how I got here at all 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.969
 a separate story in general, the essence is such 

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:14.550
 this road who made snowmobiles 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.539
 it's impossible to go because all the same 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.469
 failing 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.219
 the only normal option 

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:23.779
 movement across the field 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:28.699
 I found the rails dragged here 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:37.979
 it is heavy in general more or less firmly 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:42.469
 but there is one thing but by no means 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:46.310
 I do not know how I can do it 

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:57.199
 I try to choose me out of options 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:57.199
 what are not going to go try to get out 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:10.440
 whether to order it 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.440
 we are on the edge of the world 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.839
