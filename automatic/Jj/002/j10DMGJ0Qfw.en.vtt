00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.040 

you're<00:00:25.920> also<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.580> need<00:00:27.029> a<00:00:27.390> hot<00:00:27.779> glue<00:00:27.810> gun

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you're also going to need a hot glue gun

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:38.709 
you're also going to need a hot glue gun
and<00:00:28.470> glue<00:00:28.980> sticks<00:00:33.770> and<00:00:35.090> a<00:00:36.090> pair<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.329> scissors

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:38.719 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.080 

so<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:39.989> thing<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.820> is

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
so the first thing that I do for this is

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.729 
so the first thing that I do for this is
I<00:00:42.300> cut<00:00:42.540> off<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:44.180> flaps<00:00:45.180> as<00:00:45.660> carefully<00:00:46.649> as

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
I cut off the flaps as carefully as

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.369 
I cut off the flaps as carefully as
possible<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.539> I<00:00:48.539> keep<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> side

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
possible and I keep on to the side

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.060 
possible and I keep on to the side
because<00:00:49.680> later<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.360> making

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
because later I'm going to be making

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.910 
because later I'm going to be making
little<00:00:53.120> dividers<00:00:54.120> out<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.719> one<00:00:54.960> of<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
little dividers out of one of them or a

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209 
little dividers out of one of them or a
divider<00:00:56.340> out<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.879> them<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
divider out of them so that's what the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
divider out of them so that's what the
box<00:00:59.430> looks<00:00:59.579> like<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.350> begin<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.160> see

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
box looks like and then I begin to see

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.929 
box looks like and then I begin to see
where<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.660> box<00:01:03.870> fits<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.439> middle<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.040> I

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
where the box fits in the middle and I

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.480 
where the box fits in the middle and I
just<00:01:06.150> glue<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> one<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.780> down<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.320> now<00:01:07.500> flip

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
just glue the one side down for now flip

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.289 
just glue the one side down for now flip
it<00:01:08.610> over<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.060> then<00:01:09.950> slowly<00:01:10.950> glow<00:01:11.369> glue<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
it over and then slowly glow glue on the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.340 
it over and then slowly glow glue on the
rest<00:01:13.189> you<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.580> can't<00:01:14.840> put<00:01:15.840> glue<00:01:16.110> all<00:01:16.140> over

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
rest you kind of can't put glue all over

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.289 
rest you kind of can't put glue all over
it<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:17.009> press<00:01:17.250> it<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
it and then press it down because it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.080 
it and then press it down because it
won't<00:01:18.479> stick<00:01:18.960> because<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> hot<00:01:19.500> glue<00:01:19.799> gun

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
won't stick because the hot glue gun

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.539 
won't stick because the hot glue gun
it'll<00:01:21.090> dry<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.659> fast<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> just<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.520> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
it'll dry really fast so I just do a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
it'll dry really fast so I just do a
little<00:01:23.790> bit<00:01:24.000> at<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.150> time<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.659> make<00:01:24.689> sure<00:01:24.840> that

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
little bit at a time to make sure that

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.760 
little bit at a time to make sure that
it<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:26.009> attached<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.210> box<00:01:29.090> sure<00:01:30.200> it<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.470> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it is attached to the box sure it is and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.179 
it is attached to the box sure it is and
then<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.880> I<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.869> put<00:01:34.170> little<00:01:34.320> cut<00:01:34.860> marks

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
then what I do is I put little cut marks

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.880 
then what I do is I put little cut marks
on<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.670> sides<00:01:35.939> here<00:01:36.470> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
on the sides here kind of like you do

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.080 
on the sides here kind of like you do
with<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> duct<00:01:38.460> tape<00:01:40.340> wallets<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.729> cut<00:01:41.909> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
with the duct tape wallets you cut the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
with the duct tape wallets you cut the
squares<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.780> corners<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.490> way<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
squares out of the corners that way it

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.819 
squares out of the corners that way it
folds<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.329> cut<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> little

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
folds over and then I cut a little

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:56.209 
folds over and then I cut a little
diagonal<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:52.670> fold<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.880> over<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:56.159> do

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
diagonal in and fold it over and I do

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.959 
diagonal in and fold it over and I do
that<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.759> all<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> size<00:01:57.479> sides<00:01:58.759> now<00:01:59.759> when<00:01:59.939> I

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
that to all the size sides now when I

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.749 
that to all the size sides now when I
get<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.450> long<00:02:00.659> ways<00:02:00.869> flaps<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:02.009> have<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.640> do

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
get to the long ways flaps I have to do

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.280 
get to the long ways flaps I have to do
something<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.240> little<00:02:03.360> different<00:02:03.869> or<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.020> had<00:02:04.170> to

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
something a little different or I had to

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.809 
something a little different or I had to
fold<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.219> both<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> corners<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.819> glue

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
fold in both of the corners and glue

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
fold in both of the corners and glue
them<00:02:09.090> before<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.569> glued<00:02:09.899> them<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> box<00:02:10.560> and

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
them before I glued them to the box and

00:02:10.860 --> 00:03:19.880 
them before I glued them to the box and
you<00:02:11.039> will<00:02:11.190> see<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.550> shortly

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.470 

now<00:03:20.370> for<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.640> inside<00:03:20.910> of<00:03:20.940> the<00:03:21.030> box<00:03:21.240> what<00:03:21.450> you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
now for the inside of the box what you

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.140 
now for the inside of the box what you
need<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.810> do<00:03:21.960> first<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:22.530> cut<00:03:22.860> out<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.910> fabric

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
need to do first is cut out the fabric

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.240 
need to do first is cut out the fabric
to<00:03:25.050> be<00:03:25.170> just<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.440> little<00:03:25.590> bit<00:03:25.770> bigger<00:03:25.980> than<00:03:26.160> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to be just a little bit bigger than the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:33.350 
to be just a little bit bigger than the
box<00:03:28.850> and<00:03:30.770> for<00:03:31.770> some<00:03:31.920> reason<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.250> lost<00:03:32.580> part<00:03:33.210> of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
box and for some reason I lost part of

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.940 
box and for some reason I lost part of
my<00:03:33.420> clips<00:03:33.780> but<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.740> pretty

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
my clips but it's pretty

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.920 
my clips but it's pretty
self-explanatory<00:03:35.340> how<00:03:36.330> you're<00:03:36.570> gonna<00:03:36.660> glue

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
self-explanatory how you're gonna glue

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
self-explanatory how you're gonna glue
it<00:03:36.960> inside<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.470> box<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:37.950> don't<00:03:38.040> actually

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it inside the box you don't actually

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.240 
it inside the box you don't actually
need<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.700> put<00:03:39.000> fabric<00:03:39.570> in<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.810> box<00:03:40.020> it's<00:03:40.890> up<00:03:41.070> to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
need to put fabric in the box it's up to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.130 
need to put fabric in the box it's up to
you<00:03:41.400> so<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.120> just<00:03:42.330> cut<00:03:42.540> these<00:03:42.720> little<00:03:42.870> snippets

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
you so I just cut these little snippets

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.310 
you so I just cut these little snippets
on<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.100> sides<00:03:44.660> make<00:03:45.660> sure<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:46.110> gonna<00:03:46.230> fit

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
on the sides make sure it's gonna fit

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.380 
on the sides make sure it's gonna fit
and<00:03:46.830> then<00:03:47.640> I<00:03:47.910> glue<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:50.100> piece<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:50.790> because

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and then I glue this piece here because

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.090 
and then I glue this piece here because
there's<00:03:51.660> no<00:03:51.750> trim<00:03:52.230> and<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.590> don't<00:03:52.770> want<00:03:52.920> to<00:03:53.010> be

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
there's no trim and you don't want to be

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.850 
there's no trim and you don't want to be
able<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.460> see<00:03:53.670> like<00:03:53.880> frayed<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.840> edges<00:03:55.530> you

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
able to see like frayed and edges you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.430 
able to see like frayed and edges you
want<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.130> look<00:03:56.310> nice<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:57.570> I<00:03:57.630> do<00:03:57.720> that<00:03:58.020> with<00:03:58.200> this

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
want to look nice so I do that with this

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.340 
want to look nice so I do that with this
and<00:03:59.240> then<00:04:00.240> I<00:04:00.270> stick<00:04:00.570> it<00:04:00.660> in<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.870> box<00:04:01.080> those

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
and then I stick it in the box those

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.740 
and then I stick it in the box those
splits<00:04:02.010> are<00:04:02.280> where<00:04:02.490> the<00:04:02.610> corners<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.180> so<00:04:03.540> that

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
splits are where the corners are so that

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.710 
splits are where the corners are so that
you<00:04:03.900> can<00:04:04.080> overlap<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.550> pieces<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.540> is

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
you can overlap the pieces and this is

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.160 
you can overlap the pieces and this is
what<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.990> looks<00:04:07.200> like<00:04:07.290> when<00:04:07.650> I'm<00:04:07.740> finished<00:04:08.100> and

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
what it looks like when I'm finished and

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.510 
what it looks like when I'm finished and
now<00:04:10.170> I'm<00:04:10.260> gonna<00:04:10.380> show<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.680> how<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> make<00:04:11.310> a

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
now I'm gonna show you how I make a

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.699 
now I'm gonna show you how I make a
little<00:04:13.670> separator<00:04:14.670> or<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:15.930> just<00:04:15.990> blew<00:04:16.500> two

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
little separator or it I just blew two

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.180 
little separator or it I just blew two
of<00:04:16.830> the<00:04:16.890> flaps<00:04:17.160> together<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.959> then<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.190> glue

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
of the flaps together and then I glue

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:27.800 
of the flaps together and then I glue
the<00:04:20.549> fabric<00:04:20.730> around<00:04:21.269> it<00:04:25.669> like<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.270> I

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
the fabric around it like that and I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.870 
the fabric around it like that and I
fold<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.260> fabric<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.980> little<00:04:29.220> bit<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.760> it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
fold that fabric in a little bit so it

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.620 
fold that fabric in a little bit so it
has<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.060> nice<00:04:30.620> seam

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.630 

and<00:04:39.230> then<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.380> fold<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.830> ends<00:04:40.160> kind<00:04:40.310> of<00:04:40.490> like

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
and then I fold the ends kind of like

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.110 
and then I fold the ends kind of like
you<00:04:40.760> do<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.210> gift<00:04:41.660> dirt<00:04:41.960> present<00:04:42.760> had<00:04:43.760> to<00:04:43.910> cut<00:04:44.090> a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
you do a gift dirt present had to cut a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.080 
you do a gift dirt present had to cut a
little<00:04:44.270> off<00:04:44.510> though<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:46.670> then<00:04:46.790> it<00:04:46.880> worked

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
little off though and then it worked

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:54.890 
little off though and then it worked
better

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.200 

if<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.530> guys<00:04:55.680> aren't<00:04:56.130> really<00:04:56.550> good<00:04:56.760> with<00:04:57.000> hot

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
if you guys aren't really good with hot

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.950 
if you guys aren't really good with hot
glue<00:04:57.530> don't<00:04:58.530> exactly<00:04:58.940> do<00:04:59.940> what<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.449> did<00:05:00.750> here

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
glue don't exactly do what I did here

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.510 
glue don't exactly do what I did here
because<00:05:01.139> I<00:05:01.230> touch<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.680> glue<00:05:02.160> a<00:05:02.190> lot<00:05:03.199> and

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
because I touch the glue a lot and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.520 
because I touch the glue a lot and
everyone's<00:05:05.520> gonna<00:05:05.639> be<00:05:05.729> hot<00:05:05.940> so<00:05:06.270> does<00:05:07.050> hot<00:05:07.320> glue

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
everyone's gonna be hot so does hot glue

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.219 
everyone's gonna be hot so does hot glue
so<00:05:08.190> anyways<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.820> is<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.330> separator<00:05:09.810> I<00:05:09.900> made

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
so anyways this is the separator I made

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.590 
so anyways this is the separator I made
and<00:05:11.040> it<00:05:11.370> fits<00:05:11.639> in<00:05:11.850> there<00:05:12.060> nicely

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
and it fits in there nicely

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.730 
and it fits in there nicely
and<00:05:13.729> then<00:05:14.729> I'll<00:05:14.910> show<00:05:15.150> you<00:05:15.470> what<00:05:16.470> it<00:05:16.590> looks

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
and then I'll show you what it looks

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.020 
and then I'll show you what it looks
like<00:05:16.860> we'll<00:05:17.040> stuff<00:05:17.280> in<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.520> I'm<00:05:17.669> putting<00:05:17.850> my

like we'll stuff in it I'm putting my

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.340 
like we'll stuff in it I'm putting my
duct<00:05:18.270> tape<00:05:18.330> in<00:05:18.600> it<00:05:18.660> because<00:05:18.870> I<00:05:18.930> have<00:05:19.080> too<00:05:19.229> much

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
duct tape in it because I have too much

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.090 
duct tape in it because I have too much
duct<00:05:19.650> tape

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.189 
duct tape
they<00:05:20.580> don't<00:05:20.760> fit<00:05:20.970> on<00:05:21.120> my<00:05:21.300> little<00:05:21.510> shelf<00:05:21.840> things

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
they don't fit on my little shelf things

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:30.469 
they don't fit on my little shelf things
anymore<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:28.760> here's<00:05:29.760> what<00:05:29.970> it<00:05:30.060> looks<00:05:30.240> like

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
anymore and here's what it looks like
