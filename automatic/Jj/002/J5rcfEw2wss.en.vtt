so if you need to enlarge in the holes
in<00:00:08.380> your<00:00:08.410> top<00:00:08.740> like<00:00:09.010> I<00:00:09.160> do<00:00:09.219> could<00:00:09.790> be<00:00:09.820> a<00:00:09.880> little

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
in your top like I do could be a little

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.480 
in your top like I do could be a little
bit<00:00:10.150> of<00:00:10.210> a<00:00:10.240> nerve-wracking<00:00:10.780> experience

your current guitar minor 5/16 of an
inch<00:00:20.710> and<00:00:21.009> then<00:00:21.550> do<00:00:21.849> some<00:00:22.000> experiments<00:00:22.570> with

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689 
inch and then do some experiments with

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.240 
inch and then do some experiments with
your<00:00:22.869> with<00:00:23.259> your<00:00:23.410> drill<00:00:23.590> just<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:23.890> see<00:00:24.040> how<00:00:24.130> it

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
your with your drill just to see how it

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.720 
your with your drill just to see how it
feels

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
feels

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.490 
feels
you're<00:00:25.390> going<00:00:25.509> to<00:00:25.570> need<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.720> 3/8<00:00:26.050> inch<00:00:26.230> drill

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
you're going to need a 3/8 inch drill

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.589 
you're going to need a 3/8 inch drill
bit<00:00:26.560> to<00:00:26.890> match<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.340> diameter<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:28.450> new

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
bit to match the diameter of the new

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.889 
bit to match the diameter of the new
threaded<00:00:29.349> sections<00:00:29.680> on<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.890> new<00:00:29.980> pots<00:00:30.220> and

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
threaded sections on the new pots and

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.440 
threaded sections on the new pots and
what<00:00:31.899> I<00:00:31.930> find<00:00:32.259> is<00:00:32.380> that<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.790> a<00:00:33.850> standard

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
what I find is that with a standard

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.270 
what I find is that with a standard
drill<00:00:34.630> bit<00:00:34.750> like<00:00:34.930> this<00:00:35.170> when<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.710> start<00:00:36.100> on

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
drill bit like this when you start on

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.070 
drill bit like this when you start on
your<00:00:36.309> top<00:00:36.670> it<00:00:36.910> tends<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.300> chip<00:00:37.570> at<00:00:37.719> the<00:00:37.809> finish

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
your top it tends to chip at the finish

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.740 
your top it tends to chip at the finish
a<00:00:38.110> little<00:00:38.320> bit<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:40.120> isn't<00:00:40.360> that<00:00:40.450> big<00:00:40.570> of<00:00:40.660> a

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
a little bit which isn't that big of a

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:42.030 
a little bit which isn't that big of a
deal<00:00:40.900> since<00:00:41.200> it's<00:00:41.320> gonna<00:00:41.410> be<00:00:41.530> covered<00:00:41.890> by<00:00:42.010> a

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.040 
deal since it's gonna be covered by a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.100 
deal since it's gonna be covered by a
washer<00:00:42.790> and<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:43.000> nut<00:00:43.030> but<00:00:43.840> if<00:00:43.930> we're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
washer and a nut but if we're

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.480 
washer and a nut but if we're
perfectionist<00:00:44.590> like<00:00:44.650> me<00:00:44.800> you<00:00:45.130> might<00:00:45.280> want<00:00:45.430> to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.490 
perfectionist like me you might want to

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.070 
perfectionist like me you might want to
start<00:00:45.700> with<00:00:45.790> a<00:00:45.910> step<00:00:46.180> drill<00:00:46.510> bit<00:00:46.690> like<00:00:46.870> this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.080 
start with a step drill bit like this

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.750 
start with a step drill bit like this
which<00:00:47.320> makes<00:00:47.560> a<00:00:47.650> cleaner<00:00:47.890> cut<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.340> begin<00:00:48.580> with

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
which makes a cleaner cut to begin with

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.300 
which makes a cleaner cut to begin with
so<00:00:49.330> as<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:49.630> starts<00:00:50.020> it<00:00:50.230> cuts<00:00:50.590> a<00:00:50.680> real<00:00:50.890> nice<00:00:51.130> edge

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310 
so as it starts it cuts a real nice edge

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.530 
so as it starts it cuts a real nice edge
on<00:00:51.490> it<00:00:51.550> then<00:00:51.760> you<00:00:51.790> can<00:00:51.970> pull<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.240> out<00:00:52.329> and

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
on it then you can pull it out and

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.150 
on it then you can pull it out and
finish<00:00:52.960> off<00:00:53.140> with<00:00:53.170> three-eighths<00:00:53.740> inch<00:00:53.950> bit

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
finish off with three-eighths inch bit

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.250 
finish off with three-eighths inch bit
so<00:00:55.090> let's<00:00:55.329> go<00:00:55.450> in<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.720> take<00:00:55.810> a<00:00:55.870> closer<00:00:56.140> look

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
so let's go in and take a closer look

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.510 
so let's go in and take a closer look
and<00:00:56.560> see<00:00:56.680> how<00:00:56.770> I<00:00:56.800> bore<00:00:57.070> this<00:00:59.160> before<00:01:00.160> doing<00:01:00.310> any

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
and see how I bore this before doing any

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.040 
and see how I bore this before doing any
drilling<00:01:00.880> it's<00:01:01.000> a<00:01:01.060> good<00:01:01.180> idea<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.540> just<00:01:01.900> do<00:01:02.020> a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
drilling it's a good idea to just do a

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.750 
drilling it's a good idea to just do a
little<00:01:02.110> sanity<00:01:02.500> check<00:01:02.950> you<00:01:03.430> want<00:01:03.579> to<00:01:03.640> make

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
little sanity check you want to make

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.219 
little sanity check you want to make
sure<00:01:03.790> which<00:01:04.089> holes<00:01:04.329> you're<00:01:04.479> gonna<00:01:04.629> drill<00:01:04.960> in

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
sure which holes you're gonna drill in

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.600 
sure which holes you're gonna drill in
this<00:01:05.320> case<00:01:05.560> I'm<00:01:05.710> going<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.920> drill<00:01:06.070> these<00:01:06.220> four

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
this case I'm going to drill these four

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.850 
this case I'm going to drill these four
holes<00:01:06.880> that's<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.170> tone<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.680> three

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
holes that's the the tone and the three

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.300 
holes that's the the tone and the three
volumes

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
volumes

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.890 
volumes
don't<00:01:09.759> touch<00:01:09.909> the<00:01:10.090> switch<00:01:10.300> of<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.450> jack<00:01:10.659> hole

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
don't touch the switch of the jack hole

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.850 
don't touch the switch of the jack hole
you<00:01:11.710> want<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:12.010> double-check<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:13.620> the<00:01:14.620> pot

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
you want to double-check that the pot

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.399 
you want to double-check that the pot
shaft<00:01:15.610> size<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.270> what<00:01:16.420> you<00:01:16.540> think<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:17.140> case

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
shaft size is what you think this case

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.680 
shaft size is what you think this case
is<00:01:17.560> 3/8<00:01:18.010> make<00:01:18.700> sure<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.120> drill<00:01:19.330> bit

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
is 3/8 make sure the drill bit

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.320 
is 3/8 make sure the drill bit
you<00:01:19.990> picked<00:01:20.320> matches<00:01:21.220> that<00:01:21.370> this<00:01:21.790> is<00:01:21.909> a<00:01:21.970> 3/8

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
you picked matches that this is a 3/8

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.289 
you picked matches that this is a 3/8
bit<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:23.370> for<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.490> step<00:01:24.729> fit<00:01:24.940> if<00:01:25.060> you're<00:01:25.180> going

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
bit and for the step fit if you're going

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.899 
bit and for the step fit if you're going
to<00:01:25.450> use<00:01:25.600> one<00:01:25.870> identify<00:01:26.680> which<00:01:26.950> step<00:01:27.310> matches

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
to use one identify which step matches

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.969 
to use one identify which step matches
the<00:01:28.090> 3/8<00:01:28.540> in<00:01:29.049> this<00:01:29.170> case<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.790> the<00:01:31.000> third<00:01:31.270> step

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the 3/8 in this case it's the third step

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.520 
the 3/8 in this case it's the third step
and<00:01:32.979> what<00:01:33.400> I'm<00:01:33.460> going<00:01:33.580> to<00:01:33.610> do<00:01:34.260> use<00:01:35.260> a<00:01:35.290> little

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and what I'm going to do use a little

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.020 
and what I'm going to do use a little
piece<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.680> blue<00:01:36.010> tape<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:37.540> to<00:01:37.720> mark<00:01:38.020> off

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
piece of blue tape just to mark off

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.450 
piece of blue tape just to mark off
above<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.240> third<00:01:40.450> step<00:01:40.780> so<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.470> when<00:01:42.310> I'm

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
above the third step so that when I'm

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.830 
above the third step so that when I'm
drilling<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:43.030> don't<00:01:43.210> accidentally<00:01:43.600> go<00:01:43.780> too

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
drilling I don't accidentally go too

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.990 
drilling I don't accidentally go too
deep<00:01:44.140> let's<00:01:44.979> just<00:01:45.130> double-check<00:01:45.460> that<00:01:45.700> one

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
deep let's just double-check that one

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.630 
deep let's just double-check that one
more<00:01:46.180> time

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
more time

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.660 
more time
that's<00:01:48.640> the<00:01:48.760> 3/8<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:50.170> next<00:01:50.380> thing<00:01:50.530> is<00:01:50.619> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
that's the 3/8 the next thing is to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.380 
that's the 3/8 the next thing is to
chuck<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> step<00:01:52.030> bit

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 

and<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.050> gonna<00:01:58.200> drill<00:01:58.530> only<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.520> blue

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and I'm gonna drill only up to the blue

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:11.540 
and I'm gonna drill only up to the blue
tape<00:02:05.000> no<00:02:06.500> double<00:02:07.500> check<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.800> size<00:02:10.310> it's<00:02:11.310> just

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
tape no double check the size it's just

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.240 
tape no double check the size it's just
under<00:02:11.760> 3/8<00:02:12.120> wherever<00:02:12.960> you<00:02:13.020> want<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.290> let's

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
under 3/8 wherever you want it let's

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.000 
under 3/8 wherever you want it let's
swap<00:02:14.640> out<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.360> steps<00:02:15.750> drill<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.290> for<00:02:16.710> the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
swap out the steps drill bit for the

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.460 
swap out the steps drill bit for the
three-eighths<00:02:17.970> inch<00:02:18.180> bit<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.050> again<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.380> you

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
three-eighths inch bit and again if you

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.350 
three-eighths inch bit and again if you
don't<00:02:19.710> have<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.400> stepped<00:02:20.760> bit<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.180> can<00:02:21.330> just

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
don't have a stepped bit you can just

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.390 
don't have a stepped bit you can just
start<00:02:21.720> with<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.170> just<00:02:22.710> be<00:02:22.860> very<00:02:23.010> careful

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
start with this just be very careful

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.949 
start with this just be very careful
when<00:02:23.550> you<00:02:23.640> start<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.030> try<00:02:24.270> not<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> let<00:02:24.630> it<00:02:24.690> skip

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
when you start it try not to let it skip

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.800 
when you start it try not to let it skip
around<00:02:25.910> all<00:02:26.910> right<00:02:27.030> what<00:02:27.209> we're<00:02:27.330> gonna<00:02:27.420> do<00:02:27.630> is

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
around all right what we're gonna do is

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.020 
around all right what we're gonna do is
take<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.320> all<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.590> way<00:02:28.680> through<00:02:28.940> careful<00:02:29.940> to

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
take this all the way through careful to

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.580 
take this all the way through careful to
control<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.570> as<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.780> go<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.350> don't<00:02:31.500> go

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
control it as you go in so you don't go

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.810 
control it as you go in so you don't go
all<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.860> way<00:02:31.890> through<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> hit<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:32.490> back<00:02:32.610> of

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
all the way through and hit the back of

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.510 
all the way through and hit the back of
the<00:02:32.880> guitar<00:02:33.860> you<00:02:34.860> just<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.250> take<00:02:35.370> it

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
the guitar you just want to take it

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.229 
the guitar you just want to take it
gently<00:02:36.120> through<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:38.280> this<00:02:38.580> top<00:02:39.090> is

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
gently through so that's this top is

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.390 
gently through so that's this top is
about<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.420> quarter-inch<00:02:39.750> deep<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.739> then<00:02:41.250> what

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
about a quarter-inch deep and then what

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.890 
about a quarter-inch deep and then what
you<00:02:41.489> want<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.910> try<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.120> wipe<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.660> stuff

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
you want to do is try to wipe this stuff

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.479 
you want to do is try to wipe this stuff
off<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.440> guitar<00:02:43.709> instead<00:02:43.980> of<00:02:44.100> sweeping<00:02:44.400> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
off the guitar instead of sweeping it

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.180 
off the guitar instead of sweeping it
into<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> hole<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.090> saves<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.190> hassle

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
into the hole and that saves the hassle

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.710 
into the hole and that saves the hassle
of<00:02:47.310> vacuuming<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.180> inside<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:48.630> guitar

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
of vacuuming the inside of the guitar

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.470 
of vacuuming the inside of the guitar
later<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.830> can<00:02:49.950> avoid<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> last

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
later you can avoid it and the last

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.750 
later you can avoid it and the last
thing<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.750> do<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:51.989> take<00:02:52.140> your<00:02:52.320> pot<00:02:52.530> drop<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.610> in

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
thing you do is take your pot drop it in

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.280 
thing you do is take your pot drop it in
and<00:02:53.940> I'm<00:02:54.030> sure<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.330> fits<00:02:55.070> looks<00:02:56.070> good<00:02:57.110> so<00:02:58.110> after

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and I'm sure it fits looks good so after

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.180 
and I'm sure it fits looks good so after
that<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.560> just<00:02:58.680> want<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:58.890> hit<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> other

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
that you just want to hit the other

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.460 
that you just want to hit the other
three<00:02:59.459> holes<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.180> you'll<00:03:00.330> be<00:03:00.390> done<00:03:00.570> so

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
three holes and you'll be done so

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.020 
three holes and you'll be done so
chances<00:03:01.830> are<00:03:02.010> when<00:03:02.220> you're<00:03:02.340> drilling<00:03:02.610> some<00:03:02.940> of

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
chances are when you're drilling some of

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.550 
chances are when you're drilling some of
the<00:03:03.090> dust<00:03:03.269> didn't<00:03:03.750> end<00:03:03.900> up<00:03:03.959> falling<00:03:04.320> inside

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
the dust didn't end up falling inside

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.170 
the dust didn't end up falling inside
the<00:03:04.620> guitar<00:03:05.010> you<00:03:05.519> want<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.760> try<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.060> that

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
the guitar you want to try to get that

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.539 
the guitar you want to try to get that
out<00:03:06.360> of<00:03:06.390> there<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.870> not<00:03:06.959> rattling<00:03:07.410> around

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
out of there so it's not rattling around

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.370 
out of there so it's not rattling around
first<00:03:08.549> thing<00:03:08.820> decidedly<00:03:09.420> low-tech<00:03:09.660> is<00:03:10.140> just

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
first thing decidedly low-tech is just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.800 
first thing decidedly low-tech is just
flip<00:03:10.799> the<00:03:10.950> guitar<00:03:11.040> over<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.760> give<00:03:12.660> it<00:03:12.690> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
flip the guitar over and give it a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.420 
flip the guitar over and give it a
little<00:03:12.930> shake<00:03:13.260> around<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.010> you'll<00:03:14.400> be

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
little shake around and you'll be

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.310 
little shake around and you'll be
surprised<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.299> lot<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.630> stuff<00:03:15.870> will<00:03:15.989> just<00:03:16.140> fall

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
surprised a lot of stuff will just fall

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.539 
surprised a lot of stuff will just fall
out<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.950> then<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.130> just<00:03:20.280> a<00:03:20.370> standard

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
out and then this is just a standard

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.340 
out and then this is just a standard

crevice tool on my vacuum cleaner you

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.699 
crevice tool on my vacuum cleaner you
can<00:03:22.769> shove<00:03:23.040> that<00:03:23.070> through<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.610> hole<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.709> turn

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
can shove that through the hole and turn

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.110 
can shove that through the hole and turn
it<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.010> sort<00:03:26.310> of<00:03:26.400> move<00:03:26.519> the<00:03:26.640> guitar<00:03:26.910> around

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
it on and sort of move the guitar around

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.530 
it on and sort of move the guitar around
and<00:03:27.390> hopefully<00:03:27.660> that'll<00:03:27.810> get<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.080> rest<00:03:28.260> of<00:03:28.380> it
