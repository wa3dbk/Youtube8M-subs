00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.770 
care you see i see that it's working hot
here<00:01:59.980> and<00:02:00.220> i<00:02:00.310> can<00:02:00.550> already<00:02:00.820> see<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.300> first

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
there for very long time yes it's

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.770 
there for very long time yes it's
sparkling<00:02:15.129> and<00:02:15.310> it's<00:02:15.430> already<00:02:15.940> shining<00:02:16.239> not
