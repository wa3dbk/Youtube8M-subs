00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480
 Come on, I'll talk a little about it. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.250
 the chord filling and the people 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.719
 speak a little practically chords 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.730
 let's take into account everything that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.280
 I passed until today it's on my channel. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.320
 So study everything I've been through. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
 studying that I speak does not exist once and 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.150
 Great, beautiful, wonderful and watch. 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.939
 sit cry on the piano playing 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.640
 I can exercise and everything. 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.680
 because only then did I learn then 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.570
 come on, I had talked about 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:38.760
 Harmonic distribution that you pick up 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.840
 the chord you get the chord right in your 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.110
 essence 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:47.480
 I'm taking the ground 79 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 so I'm using here is the fifth of the 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:01:00.620
 to the ninth 7 using 13 yes 19 7 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.850
 and then, for example, I'll get the song I 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:17.460
 and it's caetano veloso right? 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.460
 Sometimes in the silence of the night 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.880
 and then I'll use harmonic distribution 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.659
 is every year old the other is 17 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:41.850
 173 Brazil is that I'm 07 again if the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.329
 You'll realize a right I'm 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.329
 using back 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:57.810
 so you're using the distribution 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.590
 Harmonica, just me for a chord to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.899
 to get from one to the other I 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.469
 Path is the fake not somebody best rock 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.469
 basic 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:18.180
 I'm using that 10 is the landing 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.430
 walking solo kholkin tony I do not know how 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.040
 You want to call it here that it is me. 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.770
 path or one according to the other 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.310
 so I was here on mine and you go with 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.310
 smaller 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.400
 and that's when I started using extensions 79 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400
 huh 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:47.610
 I can also make the arpeggios the yew air 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:51.360
 I spent in some video lesson I do not remember. 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:58.110
 which one do I always use the big toe on? 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:03.230
 fifth then the hair metal on the fifth 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.230
 It's so good with five. 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:16.070
 and to complete I can use one with 13 or 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.070
 or 19 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.490
 very beautiful stayed 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.640
 my bad who to whom who only speak 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.710
 O 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:51.680
 so I use the passage of denotes 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.320
 making a drawing on top I think 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.290
 This is very cool and fills 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.510
 enough music and then I fill in the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:11.030
 music recapping with attribution 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:15.370
 harmonica and using mine here on solo 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:17.930
 People, I'm cool, I like them a lot. 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.420
 and let's try to do an exercise in 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:25.430
 top of that that song started right 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.050
 we were there in the silence of the night here 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.050
 in the river where it is possible 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.950
 I'm imagining our 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.530
 Why am I not doing a solo piano? 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.740
 I'm doing follow up doing the 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.740
 side dish 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.530
 then I do another rhythm something in 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.530
 solo piano 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.449
 in the silence of the night 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.380
 imagining us two 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:29.510
 now daydreaming to join your 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.510
 jay within 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:39.289
 the one you leave me so loose 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.289
 ae 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.330
 whether you do not 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:51.520
 feeling very alone 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:59.410
 what I want I do not want to give the senna 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.410
 our excellent 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.490
 It's cool so it's just the exercises. 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:09.590
 harmonic distribution and make the 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.590
 passage is of note 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:19.849
 using a drawing that is what I use 

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:24.879
 It's cool, it's basically good. 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.879
 studies and until the next 

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:57.559
 ah
