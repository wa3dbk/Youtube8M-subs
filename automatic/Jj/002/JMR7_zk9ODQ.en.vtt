economically oppressed for so long and
now<00:01:15.150> they're<00:01:15.900> booming<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.340> Chinese

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
now they're booming so that Chinese

of these manufactured goods and I think
that<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.170> has<00:02:26.439> propelled<00:02:27.310> their

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that really has propelled their

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.880 
that really has propelled their
importance<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.690> terms<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.590> metal

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
importance in terms of the metal

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.149 
importance in terms of the metal
industry<00:02:30.370> around<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.819> world<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.360> am<00:02:31.959> very<00:02:32.920> very

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
industry around the world I am very very

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.550 
industry around the world I am very very
much<00:02:33.400> of<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.730> view<00:02:33.760> that<00:02:34.090> Asia<00:02:34.329> growth<00:02:35.230> in

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
much of the view that Asia growth in

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.039 
much of the view that Asia growth in
demand<00:02:35.829> is<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.700> beginning

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
demand is just beginning

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.530 
demand is just beginning
you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.739> there's<00:02:39.400> 1.3<00:02:39.940> billion<00:02:40.180> Chinese

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
you know there's 1.3 billion Chinese

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.720 
you know there's 1.3 billion Chinese
there's<00:02:40.900> a<00:02:40.959> billion<00:02:41.260> Indian<00:02:41.739> so<00:02:41.950> there's<00:02:42.310> 200

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
there's a billion Indian so there's 200

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.819 
there's a billion Indian so there's 200
million<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.180> Indonesia<00:02:43.629> I<00:02:43.930> mean<00:02:44.230> it's<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.470> vast

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
million in Indonesia I mean it's a vast

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.819 
million in Indonesia I mean it's a vast
source<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.790> demand<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.720> all<00:02:46.900> metals<00:02:47.319> not<00:02:47.560> just

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
source of demand for all metals not just

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.569
