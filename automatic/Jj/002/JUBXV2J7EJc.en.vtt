00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.740
 hello everyone here with a new tutorial 

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:09.220
 this time we will learn how you can add 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:13.090
 our games that are not from steam to 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.180
 the steam library is very easy not 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.550
 we need to do more first thing 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.720
 that we should have in our games 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.050
 truth in this case I have here as 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.830
 You can see the price principle 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 and what 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.780
 one that I just added that is very good 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.510
 mcilroy 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.460
 lego batman 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.680
 good and endless the one that you want 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.170
 even the fifa and I can take it out I have it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.690
 for mac we can add it to our 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.180
 steam library just 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.890
 what we have to do is go to the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.100
 tab where it says add a game 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.109
 you can see here 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.760
 we are going to add a game that is not 

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.000
 steam 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.810
 and here it shows us everything we have in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.110
 our applications 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.620
 in my case 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:11.240
 I will put the 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.579
 the baboon certainly just what 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.909
 the active and everything is a good game to them 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:22.090
 I recommend a little fun 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.850
 let's look for applications to hunt 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.350
 we select it and we give it to add 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.780
 selected 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.030
 as you can see here is 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.440
 we give you in details and can see what 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.380
 says game information for the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.770
 manual click on play button so that 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:44.259
 It listed above or is it tells you 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.049
 here missing detailed information on 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.650
 more droid because it's a word mode mode 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.640
 that his direct that is not destiny 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.580
 as he told them before 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.409
 Well, the point to do this is for 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.840
 our games ordered to 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.030
 libraries that are not from time like 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.240
 you can see here, we do not have our 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.680
 our image as the games that is a 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.850
 directly from it's time to see that 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.270
 has its covers 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.680
 good is what we should do I will give 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.459
 one page 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.739
 they almost have many covers of 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.590
 any game in the description of the 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.160
 video I will leave the address of this 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.470
 page 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.510
 when we enter shows us this 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.630
 home page we simply put the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.590
 name of the game in this case the brand 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:37.530
 droid 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.239
 very good to pages the truth I do not know no 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.890
 usa know what country do not know who they are 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.630
 the 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540
 will not take care of this page but 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.060
 can see here shows us what it has 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.310
 related to mac droid we can see that 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.310
 here is your original cover 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.159
 let's wait for it to load while it 's a 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.159
 little slow 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:06.170
 and here we have it 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.000
 can see simply we keep it in 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.890
 my case I will keep it in my 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.890
 my caratulÃ³ of my games 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.920
 the game and what man 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.269
 droid 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.269
 let's save 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.150
 then we made the library 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.840
 we click right 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.700
 and we give in choosing image 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.440
 customized 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.920
 we should look 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.870
 here because he always added games to me 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.530
 showed my face directly in my 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.760
 folder we give siamak droid we are going to 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.819
 open 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.650
 and we put you to establish image and how 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.500
 can see we have here 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.260
 and then as a shortcut but 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.819
 we can order the library 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.260
 in seeing it I can start from here 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.799
 without any problem 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.799
 Y 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:16.269
 we will not be able to play online 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:18.299
 with our friends but we can see it 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.930
 here well ordered 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.819
 and good for those who would like to order 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.650
 your games already know how to do it is not 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:29.070
 very difficult 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.900
 I think Windows is like no 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.080
 it has a lot of difference I do not know this is 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.820
 especially for mac users 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.759
 so I hope you like it, you know 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.669
 Any doubt they have can leave it 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.050
 on my channel or even on the page that 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:45.449
 I'm leaving you the description of 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.009
 video where I'm now putting all 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.500
 the links of my videos among others 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.449
 things I hope you like a greeting from 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.449
