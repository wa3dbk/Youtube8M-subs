00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 and now we want to introduce you 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.299
 very special person haruhiko 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.830
 Murakami 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.139
 he became interested in making lures 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.259
 say from childhood about 12 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.139
 as often happens to this occupation of his 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.940
 pushed immediately two reasons 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.340
 sincerely and passion for fishing this 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.590
 the fact that the pocket money of the boy is not 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.710
 enough for everything he wanted to buy for 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.760
 of his hobby big firms noticed him 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.579
 pretty quickly dorigo about inertia leaks 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.800
 Murakami is constantly in demand and any 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.020
 the company is honored if he 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.809
 agrees to develop bait for her 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.610
 because haruhiko agrees 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 Murakami 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.450
 brilliant angler and he himself says 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.600
 what subconsciously thinks about bait 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.570
 constantly finding design elements with might and main 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.420
 what does the female eye line see 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.620
 car shape fish fin or 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.489
 foliage on trees 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.289
 kind of things to flow in search of inspiration 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.719
 Murakami himself travels a lot and in 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.119
 last year I went fishing in Russia 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.000
 we took advantage of a unique case 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.460
 to chat with so versatile 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.229
 man can not say that we have 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.770
 there is no manufacturing culture 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.200
 bait 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.479
 us familiar homemade wobblers and 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.570
 models that firms do specifically 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.640
 for our conditions moreover already have 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.740
 first experience exactly when our 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 professional angler made 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.979
 designer of your personal bait 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.090
 This is our good friend Alexey Shanin 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.409
 developed and the model is called 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.900
 shallow first 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.270
 Japanese technical support 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.270
 Russian Japanese wobbler turned out 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.909
 rather a whole series of three sizes 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.820
 several modifications some people 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.570
 counting most alexey already caught by these 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.790
 wobblers 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.170
 and soon this opportunity will appear 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.320
 all of our anglers 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.759
 of course alexey in his new incarnation and 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.219
 developer bait 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.790
 it was very instructive to talk with 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.830
 genius 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.530
 japanese wobbler on cotton for 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.950
 she and he first of all dragged Murakami 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.740
 get to know our fish and our 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.360
 the beauties came out to look at the Japanese and 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.830
 on our guest and his bait 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.170
 in general it should be noted that the manner of catching 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.560
 Murakami something like his bait 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.320
 fantasies on even when catching bass 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.410
 bait for which first and foremost 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:40.190
 makes our japanese guest and russian 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:46.830
 the perch was surprised so I got good 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:48.900
 dead accuracy and lucia having fun our 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.420
 travelers moved on a little more 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.450
 serious tone and Murakami began 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 ask Alex about the habits of pike 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.450
 and of course asked to show him how u 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.210
 we are caught pike and what is 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.840
 dying alexey showed 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.840
 spain 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.220
 raid says 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.980
 people evaluation and then it began 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 interesting Murakami himself started 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.720
 tell for which way of posting 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.270
 he made his hosting 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.870
 that's what you think looking at this 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.230
 model 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:38.140
 well this one seems to be ok so posting 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.750
 walking dog called wolking 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.970
 jews when the bait due to jerks 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.220
 equal intensity and frequency 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.920
 gets sweeping moves from the side 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.459
 aside as they say classics of the genre 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.090
 Walker aspen but this is not just another 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.360
 oki 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.730
 This author's lure and Murakami san 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.970
 invested in this wobbler fish instinct 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.350
 fed from the surface and achieved 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.720
 incredible similarity 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.660
 have you ever seen a fish 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.019
 feeding on fallen insects moving 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.380
 herringbone yes no of course and to revive 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:17.280
 hose pen as intended 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.840
 single medium force wrenches 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.720
 has pen has a length of ninety two 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.150
 millimeter and weight 13 grams about loaded 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.810
 so as to occupy in water 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.010
 almost vertical position 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.890
 waterline runs right through 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:36.310
 small nasal recess and jerking 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.979
 the bait creates a thumping sound 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.280
 diving under the surface making 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.990
 somersault and returning to the original 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.750
 the vertical position of the fish 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.539
 breakfast and only opening for 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:53.520
 Alexei did not is he catches crank 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.520
 already a couple of years and his character 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.960
 there is 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.750
 as she soberly attacked 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:11.050
 went lilies collector let's go out 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.050
 here 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:23.430
 but the crowd water lily here sat down for strength 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:26.910
 let's go eat lodged gone out 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.970
 in the hands of Alexei back pontoon21 with 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.170
 dough to 17 and a half grams 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.430
 Of course this is something I am not experiencing. 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.950
 difficulties with hsn 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.970
 here rather need the habit of aggressive 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.640
 Aleksei's manner 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:44.340
 but this Japanese manages but sober 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.330
 while vyvezhival along the way several times 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.380
 dug into the grass 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:52.290
 but still and size from one and a half to two 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.640
 kilograms this is probably the most frisky 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:58.560
 the most sporty size of all the onions is big 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.540
 it just crushes its mass as a rule 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.100
 rarely do some jogging 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.390
 lateral daughter one and a half or two 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.610
 pound pike 

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.080
 you spend an incredible amount of strength well and 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.960
 of course it splashes into the circle 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:13.490
 huge strides amount of adrenaline is 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.490
 perhaps real sport fishing 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:22.850
 Murakami meanwhile dragged others 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.650
 members of that autumn expedition and can you 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.900
 assure that he himself produces 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.780
 no less impression of baits 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.330
 who develop his bait him 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.230
 the character is eccentric and deep 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.280
 philosophical 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:39.350
 cheerful and focused reckless and 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.540
 hardworking separately noticed him 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.520
 always with the tools to 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.890
 something to bait the bait or 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.430
 trim and he always says thank you 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.710
 when take out the fish from the water after 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.960
 several days spent old women to 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:58.580
 and his lures can be said with full 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:00.820
 with confidence stand tomorrow 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:03.350
 someone lures draw a computer 

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:06.200
 pieces of plastic will turn on whether 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.850
 some are more successful and the money 

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.910
 we made sure again 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.860
 spark of life lure puts people and 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:15.410
 when is such an exceptional person 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.780
 like haruhiko murakami 

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:20.660
 then talk it lures it 

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:23.860
 separate pleasure and about this we still 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.860
 talk in the next issues
