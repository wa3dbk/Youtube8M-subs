for<00:00:11.940> this<00:00:12.120> right<00:00:12.330> here<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:13.170> body<00:00:13.469> glove

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
for this right here the body glove

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.689 
for this right here the body glove
diamond<00:00:15.059> brush<00:00:15.330> case<00:00:16.039> for<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.390> galaxy<00:00:18.390> note<00:00:18.420> 2

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
diamond brush case for the galaxy note 2

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:21.800 
diamond brush case for the galaxy note 2
there's<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.850> case<00:00:21.029> right<00:00:21.240> there

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
there's the case right there

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.920 
there's the case right there
it's<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.289> t-mobile<00:00:23.539> so<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.630> could<00:00:24.750> probably

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
it's from t-mobile so you could probably

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.380 
it's from t-mobile so you could probably
just<00:00:25.170> go<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.680> t-mobile<00:00:26.460> store<00:00:26.880> pick<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> up<00:00:27.269> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
just go to a t-mobile store pick it up I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.420 
just go to a t-mobile store pick it up I
picked<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.779> from<00:00:28.019> Wireless<00:00:28.619> ground<00:00:29.099> comm

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
picked it up from Wireless ground comm

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.979 
picked it up from Wireless ground comm
let's<00:00:32.430> check<00:00:32.579> it<00:00:32.700> out<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:34.550> dual<00:00:35.550> layer

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
let's check it out it is a dual layer

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.700 
let's check it out it is a dual layer
case<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.920> has<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.160> softer<00:00:38.879> inside<00:00:39.680> than<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
case it has a softer inside than the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.930 
case it has a softer inside than the
outside<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:43.379> outside<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.920> type<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.700> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
outside the outside is the type of a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.220 
outside the outside is the type of a
hard<00:00:45.149> shell<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.750> right<00:00:45.960> here<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.200> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
hard shell and this right here is a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.450 
hard shell and this right here is a
little<00:00:46.410> rubberized<00:00:46.829> compared<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.899> part

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
little rubberized compared to this part

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.279 
little rubberized compared to this part
and<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.940> really<00:00:51.329> like<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> look<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> that's

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
and I really like the look of it that's

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.950 
and I really like the look of it that's
why<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.440> picked<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.770> up<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.390> was<00:00:54.539> looking<00:00:54.660> for

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
why I picked it up and I was looking for

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.770 
why I picked it up and I was looking for
something<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.949> had<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> softer<00:00:57.149> inside<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.750> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
something that had a softer inside and a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
something that had a softer inside and a
harder<00:00:58.050> outside<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> dual<00:00:58.800> layer<00:00:59.010> kind<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.520> case

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
harder outside a dual layer kind of case

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.770 
harder outside a dual layer kind of case
and<00:01:00.620> I<00:01:01.620> thought<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.789> best<00:01:03.600> way

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and I thought that that was the best way

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.359 
and I thought that that was the best way
to<00:01:03.809> protect<00:01:04.670> this<00:01:05.670> beast<00:01:06.030> right<00:01:06.299> here

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
to protect this beast right here

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.969 
to protect this beast right here
and<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.360> liked<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.960> first<00:01:10.439> I<00:01:10.970> dug<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.979> still

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and I liked the first I dug it I still

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.240 
and I liked the first I dug it I still
like<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.250> look<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.140> but<00:01:16.970> I'm<00:01:17.970> not<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.210> a

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
like the look of it but I'm not really a

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.410 
like the look of it but I'm not really a
fan<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:21.290> how<00:01:22.290> smooth<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.670> want<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
fan of how smooth it is I want to get a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.420 
fan of how smooth it is I want to get a
case<00:01:24.890> that<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.040> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:27.860> give<00:01:28.860> me<00:01:28.979> some<00:01:29.189> more

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
case that was going to give me some more

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.630 
case that was going to give me some more
grip<00:01:29.900> than<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.079> actual<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.860> cover<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
grip than the actual back cover of the

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.690 
grip than the actual back cover of the
note<00:01:32.820> 2<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:34.310> pretty<00:01:35.310> slippery<00:01:36.229> but<00:01:37.700> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
note 2 which is pretty slippery but you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.380 
note 2 which is pretty slippery but you
know<00:01:38.759> this<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> little<00:01:39.299> better<00:01:41.119> it's<00:01:42.119> a<00:01:42.210> lot

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
know this is a little better it's a lot

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.280 
know this is a little better it's a lot
better<00:01:42.920> because<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.399> cover<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:45.290> pretty

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
better because the back cover is pretty

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.770 
better because the back cover is pretty
much<00:01:46.920> like<00:01:47.100> ice<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.939> are<00:01:48.119> trying<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
much like ice when you are trying to

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.380 
much like ice when you are trying to
slight<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> put<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.740> somewhere<00:01:50.360> but<00:01:51.360> uh

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
slight and put it down somewhere but uh

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.380 
slight and put it down somewhere but uh
but<00:01:52.049> yeah<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.439> one<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.860> feels<00:01:53.790> better<00:01:54.000> than

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
but yeah this one it feels better than

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.090 
but yeah this one it feels better than
that<00:01:55.250> but<00:01:56.250> it's<00:01:56.430> still<00:01:56.840> fairly<00:01:57.840> slippery

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
that but it's still fairly slippery

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.670 
that but it's still fairly slippery
this<00:02:00.820> could<00:02:01.030> be<00:02:01.180> a<00:02:01.390> lot<00:02:01.630> more<00:02:01.780> rubberized<00:02:02.230> I

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
this could be a lot more rubberized I

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.280 
this could be a lot more rubberized I
guess<00:02:03.300> you<00:02:04.300> could<00:02:04.450> feel<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:04.840> difference<00:02:04.960> in

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
guess you could feel the difference in

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.359 
guess you could feel the difference in
the<00:02:05.350> texture<00:02:05.650> but<00:02:06.630> it's<00:02:07.630> not<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.860> big<00:02:09.130> of<00:02:09.190> a

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
the texture but it's not that big of a

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.050 
the texture but it's not that big of a
difference<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.929> buttons<00:02:11.790> they're<00:02:12.790> not

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
difference the buttons they're not

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
difference the buttons they're not
really<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.140> easy<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.710> push<00:02:14.890> down<00:02:15.510> but<00:02:16.890> you

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
really that easy to push down but you

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.620 
really that easy to push down but you
know<00:02:17.980> they're<00:02:18.160> they're<00:02:18.430> pretty<00:02:18.460> good<00:02:18.880> you<00:02:19.510> can

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
know they're they're pretty good you can

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.030 
know they're they're pretty good you can
push<00:02:19.810> down<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.140> volume<00:02:20.470> buttons<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.920> lot

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
push down the volume buttons a lot

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.560 
push down the volume buttons a lot
better<00:02:21.280> than<00:02:21.460> you<00:02:21.580> can<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:21.790> power<00:02:22.210> button<00:02:22.660> and

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
better than you can the power button and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.730 
better than you can the power button and
yeah<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:27.870> it's<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.959> pretty<00:02:29.110> good<00:02:29.350> case<00:02:29.470> it

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
yeah it's it's a pretty good case it

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.740 
yeah it's it's a pretty good case it
looks<00:02:29.890> nice<00:02:30.130> I<00:02:30.520> really<00:02:31.060> like<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.540> way<00:02:31.630> it

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
looks nice I really like the way it

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.850 
looks nice I really like the way it
looks<00:02:32.430> maybe<00:02:33.430> I'll<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:35.110> something<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.590> little
