that's something I boy to do but I would
usually<00:01:28.159> look<00:01:29.090> for<00:01:29.120> a<00:01:30.190> seat<00:01:31.190> where<00:01:31.549> there's

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
usually look for a seat where there's

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.460 
usually look for a seat where there's
like<00:01:32.120> a<00:01:32.150> wall<00:01:32.420> so<00:01:32.690> you<00:01:32.720> can<00:01:32.810> turn<00:01:33.049> your<00:01:33.200> back<00:01:33.440> to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470

everybody else and be facing the wall

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.700 
everybody else and be facing the wall
that<00:01:36.049> way<00:01:36.560> you're<00:01:36.799> eliminating<00:01:37.460> exposure

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710
