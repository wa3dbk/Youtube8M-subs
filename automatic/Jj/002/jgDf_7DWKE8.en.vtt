00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.580
 hello guys here we are with ours 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.740
 advent calendar i am the the 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.990
 sky color I replace bamboo presence 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.390
 who is found to deliver the gifts in 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.900
 england is today san francesco saverio 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.580
 that the good internet tells me to be the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.800
 patron of missions and I recommend a 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.320
 game in which the mission is to save the 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.310
 world but above all save a stick 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160
 a wooden stick 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.949
 the game is south park the stig of truth 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.440
 title released this year on consoles 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.719
 old generation and on PC that you are 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.789
 revealed a truly extraordinary game 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.979
 especially for those who love the series 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.129
 south park actually the game is a 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:48.559
 great project designed for those 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.499
 really loves the south park to madness 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.519
 because it is full of reference inserts 

00:00:51.499 --> 00:00:57.199
 which we call the episodes of the 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.389
 series all the episodes of the series I think 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.719
 up to the fifteenth and sixteenth 

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:04.699
 season so it really is anyway 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.920
 very rich full of connections 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.330
 of easter egg full of things that if 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.580
 you know under par that they will do to you 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.870
 die to laugh if you don't know the 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.180
 series obviously you can grasp 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.920
 only a few of these references but 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.720
 the game does cause an overlap because 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.140
 one the characters are really 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.290
 hit the spot 2 the story is so ridiculous from 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.000
 be fun right away and 3 the game 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.320
 it's also a lot of fun it was 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.660
 developed by the obsidian who 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.850
 famously develop full titles 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.130
 of problems and there are problems there 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.660
 they are also quite serious bugs 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.400
 we must also say that the title was 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.930
 censored in Europe in the versions for 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.670
 console so if you lose the version 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.010
 360 or playstation 3 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.530
 you will find a scene censored in 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.270
 particular a scene in which they insert 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.179
 in 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.159
 rectum intestine of Mr. maso a beach 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.890
 giant so unfortunately you will lose yourself 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.590
 this topical scene but we still say 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.420
 99.9 percent of the content is not 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.819
 been censored the game came out 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.829
 exactly as starting material e 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.750
 to entertain is an rpg 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.509
 obviously a rpg of those in shifts 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.119
 old style studied of the 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.580
 old school by players of the 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.549
 old school so certainly will like it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.140
 also the public that is interested in 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:19.750
 this type of games and is a title that 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.849
 I absolutely recommend it and that was it 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 recently also on steam sales 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.440
 so a few days ago it was cheap 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.840
 more than 10 euros was really worth it 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 but I believe that even at the price of 20 25 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.760
 euro you can find it online at that 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.370
 price ii is more than convenient then 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.260
 today's game south park the stig of 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.180
 truth the stick of truth for whom 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.340
 buy the italian version 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.870
 I have concluded and see you at the next 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.870
