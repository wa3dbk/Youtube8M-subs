00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.670
 What is yours 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.670
 now the feeling of the mother being killed 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:10.859
 the same emotion will be from here 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:13.859
 in the chase at night to discuss the hotel here 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:18.789
 in practice represents 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:26.710
 I wanted to give a hug of the gameleira my father always said if it goes through the red 

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:29.709
 mining blind goat 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.910
 It is very exciting and suddenly it comes 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.670
 to tell this story as the greatest in the history of our people 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.350
 that's a story 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.820
 it's a history 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.820
 who knows that you do not teach in schools 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.790
 the corporation 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.890
 your colleagues 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.310
 the worst of our history c 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.640
 by balance persisted and write 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.640
 the princesses 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.450
 life knows 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.310
 you can guess past history in schools with denied screen 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.760
 refers to it 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.680
 it's like a joke 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.800
 like the heat that Brazil would have given in Bolivia with a paid plan 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.009
 I want to hear a joke 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.380
 should be like this 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.760
 sounds a little like your city 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.360
 but it did not 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.360
 interesting when you look at history 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.900
 to make mystery 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.370
 there was an excess per month 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.370
 You realize that you did not exist and always 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.790
 than programs 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.060
 in the center 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.190
 we would have thus 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.580
 Eliana says to be right. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.560
 localized 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.090
 in 2011 we have legislation 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.080
 anyway I do not know where 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.080
 or you do well 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.779
 walking and sp 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.959
 and I think all this 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.559
 and was almost spoiled 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:17.779
 here will be shown donated 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.779
 This is a good thing 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:25.009
 I do not know if all the states 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.189
 one of the subscribers 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.919
 heinrich schliemann 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:31.909
 usc baptism 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.909
 another history of the time the identity of the members of the cpi 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.209
 two time 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.679
 it's the last cycle 

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:43.549
 author of works 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:44.769
 mc 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.349
 south mcl 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.239
 throughout its history 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.189
 the pursuit of your identity 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.329
 and here it is not 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.329
 It's something that calls me sane. 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.919
 a precedent of a child who came from são paulo brandão 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:03.959
 but he also knows 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.579
 exist 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.439
 it is not this act that is going to be taken 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.439
 the form of you and your people 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:20.039
 because the story has 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:21.949
 and she deserves it 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.039
 if shown 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.199
 I was more caught up 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:27.499
 in 2000 when 

00:03:27.499 --> 00:03:30.499
 in the first quarter for the first time if he said 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.419
 I am she was in your plans and writer 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.479
 do the work that would be the first to tell this story of the 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.749
 attack would be your best job 

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.489
 if you are not convinced of this 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.549
 and I always found this 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.250
 the problem is that they avoid the country problems are my problem said 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.739
 at 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.340
 coffee was not a defense, but it was not a big story. 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.919
 bad 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.279
 because he would be arrested 

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.429
 take our how it was now show pieces stories I can not 

00:04:01.429 --> 00:04:03.169
 he points out that the payment 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:05.629
 today you have 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.629
 you put 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.909
 filmed take revenge 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.709
 did not have the equipments were very heavy and not 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.520
 thinking they were born here 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.830
 and frames 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.959
 it is not an advantage that you might find something similar 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.580
 What I saw you can use here authorities 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.270
 in relation to January 2010, how will it be 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:46.090
 He said how are you with seven? 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.090
 besides being necessary a vigorous action offenses 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.659
 so are you have the historical narrative 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.740
 What will decide the set? 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.620
 Flag Inappropriate Content 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.539
 in this period 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 smiling the rubber worker 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.389
 I do not know the fictional part either 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.389
 the romances the rubber tree 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:18.729
 of executives 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.599
 more job miss 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.080
 in the miniseries 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.080
 it is not a transposition 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.680
 do not wait days 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:33.039
 and this is a tribute 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:34.379
 I want to do 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:37.379
 miniseries 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:38.699
 to honor
