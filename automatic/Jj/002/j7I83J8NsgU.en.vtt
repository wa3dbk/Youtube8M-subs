course<00:03:57.420> with<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:57.810> I'll<00:03:58.260> just<00:03:58.290> say<00:03:58.680> something

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
course with that I'll just say something

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.160 
course with that I'll just say something
real<00:03:59.130> quick<00:03:59.160> about<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.610> screen<00:04:00.110> something<00:04:01.110> I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
real quick about the screen something I

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.170 
real quick about the screen something I
didn't<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.410> so<00:04:01.680> much<00:04:01.740> is<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.459> viewing<00:04:02.790> angle

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
didn't like so much is the viewing angle

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.940 
didn't like so much is the viewing angle
on<00:04:03.300> it<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.780> I'm<00:04:03.990> not<00:04:04.350> sure<00:04:04.410> you'll<00:04:04.680> be<00:04:04.800> able<00:04:04.860> to

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
on it and I'm not sure you'll be able to

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.290 
on it and I'm not sure you'll be able to
see<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.190> from<00:04:05.310> here<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:05.640> if<00:04:05.850> you<00:04:05.970> look<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.240> it

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
see it from here but if you look at it

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.330 
see it from here but if you look at it
from<00:04:06.360> the<00:04:06.510> side<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.770> lose<00:04:07.890> a<00:04:07.950> lot<00:04:08.190> of

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
from the side you really lose a lot of

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.150 
from the side you really lose a lot of
color<00:04:08.610> and<00:04:09.050> which<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.200> pretty<00:04:10.410> disappointing

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
color and which is pretty disappointing

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.980 
color and which is pretty disappointing
but<00:04:11.370> when<00:04:12.030> looking<00:04:12.300> at<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> screen<00:04:12.720> on<00:04:12.900> the

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
but when looking at the screen on the

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.140 
but when looking at the screen on the
right<00:04:13.020> angle<00:04:13.530> it's<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:13.890> really<00:04:14.250> a<00:04:14.280> nice<00:04:14.790> nice

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
right angle it's it's really a nice nice

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.210 
right angle it's it's really a nice nice
screen<00:04:15.480> but<00:04:16.260> another<00:04:16.470> one<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.770> my<00:04:16.890> favorite

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
screen but another one of my favorite

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.770 
screen but another one of my favorite
smart<00:04:17.489> buttons<00:04:17.760> here<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.419> button<00:04:18.750> here

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
smart buttons here is this button here

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.560 
smart buttons here is this button here
which<00:04:19.020> turns<00:04:19.530> out<00:04:19.710> the<00:04:19.919> LED<00:04:20.549> backlit

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
which turns out the LED backlit

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450 
which turns out the LED backlit
and<00:04:21.660> you<00:04:22.320> might<00:04:22.470> not<00:04:22.500> see<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.830> from<00:04:23.010> here<00:04:23.280> from

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
and you might not see it from here from

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.760 
and you might not see it from here from
your<00:04:23.700> from<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.300> screen<00:04:24.750> there<00:04:24.960> but<00:04:25.170> you<00:04:25.620> can

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
your from the screen there but you can

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.080 
your from the screen there but you can
actually<00:04:25.860> still<00:04:26.220> see<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.460> content<00:04:26.850> on<00:04:26.940> the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
actually still see the content on the

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.820 
actually still see the content on the
screen<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:27.390> we've<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:28.050> were<00:04:28.170> outdoors<00:04:28.560> you

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
screen so we've you were outdoors you

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.620 
screen so we've you were outdoors you
could<00:04:28.980> probably<00:04:29.160> still<00:04:29.490> get<00:04:30.030> away<00:04:30.150> with<00:04:30.450> using

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
could probably still get away with using

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.860 
could probably still get away with using
the<00:04:30.870> laptop<00:04:31.110> without<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.860> backlit<00:04:32.790> LED<00:04:33.570> you

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
the laptop without the backlit LED you

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.530 
the laptop without the backlit LED you
on<00:04:36.110> alright<00:04:37.110> so<00:04:37.350> with<00:04:37.530> that<00:04:37.680> said<00:04:38.190> I<00:04:38.820> think

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
on alright so with that said I think

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.530 
on alright so with that said I think
that's<00:04:39.930> pretty<00:04:40.200> much<00:04:40.380> it<00:04:40.620> as<00:04:40.890> far<00:04:40.920> as<00:04:41.250> two<00:04:41.540> logs

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
that's pretty much it as far as two logs

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.890 
that's pretty much it as far as two logs
on<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.780> laptop<00:04:43.200> goes<00:04:44.090> another<00:04:45.090> thing<00:04:45.540> here

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
on the laptop goes another thing here

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.690 
on the laptop goes another thing here
then<00:04:46.080> you<00:04:46.230> have<00:04:46.290> here<00:04:46.560> is<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> webcam<00:04:47.190> and<00:04:47.430> of
