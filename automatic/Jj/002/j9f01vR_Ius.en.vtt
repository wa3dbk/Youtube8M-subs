here's crush how do you guys were asking

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.720 
here's crush how do you guys were asking
me<00:00:07.020> how<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.200> did<00:00:07.560> crushes<00:00:08.189> four-wheel<00:00:08.790> steering

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
me how I did crushes four-wheel steering

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.770 
me how I did crushes four-wheel steering
as<00:00:11.730> you<00:00:11.910> can<00:00:12.059> see<00:00:12.230> there's<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.349> rear<00:00:14.660> is<00:00:15.660> the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
as you can see there's the rear is the

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.710 
as you can see there's the rear is the
front<00:00:16.049> got<00:00:16.890> something<00:00:17.220> binding<00:00:17.609> gotta<00:00:18.510> figure

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
front got something binding gotta figure

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.429 
front got something binding gotta figure
it<00:00:18.869> out<00:00:18.960> again

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
it out again

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.150 
it out again
I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.580> Crawfords<00:00:21.029> getting<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.449> off

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
I think the Crawfords getting one off

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.550 
I think the Crawfords getting one off
how<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> set<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> radio<00:00:23.880> up<00:00:24.410> throttle

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
how it set the radio up throttle

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.380 
how it set the radio up throttle
I<00:00:25.590> got<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> disconnected<00:00:26.760> so<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.000> real<00:00:27.119> books

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I got a disconnected so the real books

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.890 
I got a disconnected so the real books
don't<00:00:27.570> roll<00:00:28.080> there's<00:00:28.710> throttle<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.369> there

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
don't roll there's throttle right there

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.569 
don't roll there's throttle right there
this<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> rear<00:00:31.380> steer<00:00:34.040> this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> front

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
this is the rear steer this is the front

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is the rear steer this is the front
steer<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.390> if<00:00:36.540> anybody<00:00:36.899> want<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.170> drive<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> and

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
steer so if anybody want to drive it and

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.590 
steer so if anybody want to drive it and
they<00:00:38.579> were<00:00:38.640> used<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> stick<00:00:39.239> radio

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
they were used to the stick radio

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.869 
they were used to the stick radio
everything's<00:00:40.219> still<00:00:41.219> pretty<00:00:41.280> much<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.700> same

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
everything's still pretty much the same

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.150 
everything's still pretty much the same
except<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> rear<00:00:42.809> steer<00:00:43.110> just<00:00:43.980> serve<00:00:44.129> it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
except for the rear steer just serve it

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.869 
except for the rear steer just serve it
reverse<00:00:44.610> it

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
reverse it

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.600 
reverse it
so<00:00:45.059> when<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> go<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.079> right<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:47.430> wheels

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
so when you go to the right the wheels

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
so when you go to the right the wheels
actually<00:00:48.059> turn<00:00:48.329> left<00:00:48.710> which<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.860> way<00:00:49.950> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
actually turn left which the way you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.439 
actually turn left which the way you
want<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.550> such<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.030> rotates<00:00:53.449> seems

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
want it to do such as it rotates seems

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:55.729 
want it to do such as it rotates seems
like<00:00:54.660> going<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> right<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.350> wheels<00:00:55.530> are

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
like going to the right the wheels are

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.010 
like going to the right the wheels are
now<00:00:55.860> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.100> turn<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> left<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
now going to turn to the left on the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.319 
now going to turn to the left on the
rear<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.800> they've<00:00:58.980> actually<00:00:59.210> rotates<00:01:00.210> around

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
rear so they've actually rotates around

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.340 
rear so they've actually rotates around

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
Claud setup you notice it steers more

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.620 
Claud setup you notice it steers more
with<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.700> rear<00:02:25.880> than<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.150> does<00:02:26.269> the<00:02:26.390> front

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
with the rear than it does the front

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.949 
with the rear than it does the front
also<00:02:27.500> eliminate<00:02:28.100> some<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.340> that<00:02:28.810> the<00:02:29.810> only

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
also eliminate some of that the only

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.509 
also eliminate some of that the only
thing<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.200> recommend<00:02:30.350> is<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.860> do<00:02:30.980> put<00:02:31.160> a<00:02:31.190> servo

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
thing I recommend is you do put a servo

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.630 
thing I recommend is you do put a servo
saver<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.570> servo<00:02:32.900> itself<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:34.070> there's

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
saver on the servo itself so there's

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.290 
saver on the servo itself so there's
crush<00:02:34.910> that's<00:02:35.510> how<00:02:35.780> I<00:02:35.810> did<00:02:35.930> it<00:02:36.140> guys
