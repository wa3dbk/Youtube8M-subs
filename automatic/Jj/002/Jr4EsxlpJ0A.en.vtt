00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.320
 this is the first year he planted with the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.300
 Actions 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.300
 I have proposed to bury them 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.590
 so that the fruit is more aerated 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 and do not touch the ground 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:38.830
 although as you can see that is a bit difficult 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.830
 love those of the stem the fruits come out 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.829
 and to avoid damaging them you have to give 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.829
 back to the rope 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.690
 carefully 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.870
 as you can see and there are some to catch this 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.870
 for example 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.890
 and it will be and we will also catch it today 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:26.630
 the plant is growing by turning over 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.560
 looking for the sun to the south 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.759
 we have stuck rods 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.759
 the back 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 and so we are raising the stem 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.270
 We will check the results 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.560
 because this is a plant 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.570
 it is supposed to creep 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.530
 although in greenhouses 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.930
 I believe that 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.769
 they put tutors to these plants 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.670
 there goes the stem 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.250
 around the rope 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.250
 is pushing him 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.319
 and it will also be good to go eliminating 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.599
 the leaves are below 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.569
 touching the ground 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.210
 I have not done anything 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:17.650
 guiding them up 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.650
 and little by little we will see the results
