by the cast animation does do damage

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.420 
by the cast animation does do damage
near<00:00:29.160> him<00:00:29.400> when<00:00:29.550> he<00:00:29.670> casts<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.210> or<00:00:30.859> by<00:00:31.859> if<00:00:32.279> you

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
near him when he casts it or by if you

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
near him when he casts it or by if you
kind<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> walk<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.540> ring<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.809> fire<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
kind of walk over the ring of fire it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.680 
kind of walk over the ring of fire it
does<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.100> ridiculous<00:00:35.670> amount<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.940> damage<00:00:36.300> so

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
does a ridiculous amount of damage so

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.170 
does a ridiculous amount of damage so
you<00:00:36.750> probably<00:00:37.200> going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.469> end<00:00:37.500> up<00:00:37.620> dying<00:00:38.180> his

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
you probably going to end up dying his

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
you probably going to end up dying his
other<00:00:39.329> abilities<00:00:39.600> he<00:00:40.200> will<00:00:40.590> throw<00:00:40.920> very

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
other abilities he will throw very

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.549 
other abilities he will throw very
slow-moving<00:00:41.760> flames<00:00:42.360> towards<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.500> you

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
slow-moving flames towards you now you

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
slow-moving flames towards you now you
want<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.860> avoid<00:00:44.280> these<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.760> much<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.059> possible

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
want to avoid these as much as possible

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.779 
want to avoid these as much as possible
and<00:00:45.660> he<00:00:46.350> starts<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.920> leave<00:00:47.070> patches<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> fire

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
and he starts to leave patches of fire

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.160 
and he starts to leave patches of fire
on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> floor<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.629> you're<00:00:48.750> going<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
on the floor so you're going to have to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.500 
on the floor so you're going to have to
keep<00:00:49.350> moving<00:00:49.760> obviously<00:00:50.760> kids<00:00:51.420> are

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
keep moving obviously kids are

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
keep moving obviously kids are
constrained<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.199> ring<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> fire<00:00:52.770> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
constrained by the ring of fire it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.610 
constrained by the ring of fire it
starts<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:54.270> pretty<00:00:54.570> difficult<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.559> you

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
starts to get pretty difficult and you

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.250 
starts to get pretty difficult and you
start<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.010> run<00:00:56.250> out<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.399> room<00:00:56.760> very<00:00:57.239> quickly<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
start to run out of room very quickly so

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.369 
start to run out of room very quickly so
you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:59.070> use<00:00:59.460> things<00:00:59.670> such<00:01:00.000> as<00:01:00.030> mist<00:01:00.690> form<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
you can use things such as mist form to

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.049 
you can use things such as mist form to
get<00:01:01.530> yourself<00:01:01.829> out<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> ring<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.609> fire<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
get yourself out of the ring of fire I

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
get yourself out of the ring of fire I
can't<00:01:03.780> really<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> anything<00:01:04.500> else<00:01:04.739> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
can't really think of anything else you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.910 
can't really think of anything else you
need<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> be<00:01:05.540> completely<00:01:06.540> invulnerable<00:01:06.920> it's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
need to be completely invulnerable it's

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.640 
need to be completely invulnerable it's
not<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:09.390> probably<00:01:09.659> not<00:01:09.810> good<00:01:09.960> enough<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
not it's probably not good enough you to

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.710 
not it's probably not good enough you to
not<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:11.100> taking<00:01:11.430> damage<00:01:11.610> such<00:01:12.330> as<00:01:12.510> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
not be taking damage such as the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.870 
not be taking damage such as the
Warriors<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.500> your<00:01:13.770> pain<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.729> know

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
Warriors and your pain because I know

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
Warriors and your pain because I know
quite<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> lot<00:01:15.509> does<00:01:15.900> actually<00:01:16.020> go<00:01:16.380> through

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
quite a lot does actually go through

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
quite a lot does actually go through
that<00:01:16.830> which<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.280> annoying<00:01:17.700> but<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.810> going

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
that which is annoying but you're going

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.149 
that which is annoying but you're going
to<00:01:19.020> need<00:01:19.110> something<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> makes<00:01:20.040> you

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to need something which is makes you

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
to need something which is makes you
completely<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> vulnerable<00:01:21.420> if<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.750> want<00:01:21.960> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
completely and vulnerable if you want to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.950 
completely and vulnerable if you want to
traverse<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.189> ring<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.150> i'll<00:01:24.360> go<00:01:24.540> ahead<00:01:24.570> and

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
traverse the ring so i'll go ahead and

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.660 
traverse the ring so i'll go ahead and
queue<00:01:25.920> up

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.219 

so<00:01:33.670> one<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.479> first<00:01:34.540> things<00:01:34.750> he's<00:01:34.990> going<00:01:35.170> to

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
so one of the first things he's going to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.039 
so one of the first things he's going to
do<00:01:35.380> is<00:01:35.590> try<00:01:36.070> and<00:01:36.100> spawn<00:01:36.490> a<00:01:36.729> ring<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.090> fire<00:01:37.119> so

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
do is try and spawn a ring of fire so

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:39.660 
do is try and spawn a ring of fire so
I'm<00:01:38.110> going<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.350> try<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.619> do<00:01:38.770> as<00:01:38.950> much<00:01:38.979> damage<00:01:39.220> as

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
I'm going to try to do as much damage as

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:52.850 
I'm going to try to do as much damage as
I<00:01:39.790> can<00:01:40.030> off<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.710> get-go<00:01:41.890> so

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.940 

now<00:01:53.400> you<00:01:53.910> can<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> patches<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> fire<00:01:55.050> they

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
now you can see the patches of fire they

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
now you can see the patches of fire they
drop<00:01:56.250> exactly<00:01:56.850> where<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.180> are<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.440> kind

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
drop exactly where you are and you kind

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.590 
drop exactly where you are and you kind
of<00:01:58.860> can't<00:01:59.160> get<00:01:59.400> hit<00:01:59.580> by<00:01:59.760> any<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> his<00:02:00.330> fire

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of can't get hit by any of his fire

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.660 
of can't get hit by any of his fire
