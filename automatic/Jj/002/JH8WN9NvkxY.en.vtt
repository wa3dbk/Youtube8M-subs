00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.200 
know as far as placement of symbols you
know<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.920> way<00:04:39.040> a<00:04:39.070> symbol<00:04:39.490> works<00:04:39.730> when<00:04:39.970> you<00:04:40.030> hit

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
know the way a symbol works when you hit

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.200 
know the way a symbol works when you hit
most<00:04:41.110> of<00:04:41.230> the<00:04:41.350> vibrations<00:04:41.920> happen<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:43.090> know

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
most of the vibrations happen you know

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.380 
most of the vibrations happen you know
towards<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.810> edge<00:04:43.990> of<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:45.130> Sun<00:04:45.340> okay<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:45.850> in

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
towards the edge of the Sun okay so in

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.490 
towards the edge of the Sun okay so in
theory<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:48.390> closer<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.630> put<00:04:49.810> a<00:04:49.840> moon<00:04:50.080> gel<00:04:50.320> to

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
theory the closer you put a moon gel to

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.200 
theory the closer you put a moon gel to
the<00:04:50.530> edge<00:04:50.740> towards<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.550> edge<00:04:51.700> of<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:51.880> symbol

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
the edge towards the edge of the symbol

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.180 
the edge towards the edge of the symbol

symbol<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.430> still<00:05:00.670> want<00:05:00.820> to<00:05:00.850> keep<00:05:01.030> some<00:05:01.300> of

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330

those crash qualities then stick your

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.260 
those crash qualities then stick your
moon's<00:05:04.600> up<00:05:04.780> closer<00:05:05.050> to<00:05:05.200> the<00:05:05.920> bell<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:07.210> the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
moon's up closer to the bell but the

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.460 
moon's up closer to the bell but the
cool<00:05:07.420> thing<00:05:07.450> about<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.900> gels<00:05:08.140> is<00:05:08.320> that

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
cool thing about the gels is that

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.410 
cool thing about the gels is that
they're<00:05:08.680> sticking<00:05:09.130> slaughters<00:05:10.060> are<00:05:10.180> clean

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
they're sticking slaughters are clean

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:12.420 
they're sticking slaughters are clean
then<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.290> got<00:05:11.470> to<00:05:11.530> go<00:05:11.650> anywhere<00:05:11.950> even<00:05:12.220> if<00:05:12.310> you're

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
then I got to go anywhere even if you're

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.400 
then I got to go anywhere even if you're
really<00:05:12.610> playing<00:05:13.180> on<00:05:13.330> your<00:05:13.450> cymbals<00:05:13.810> they're

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
really playing on your cymbals they're

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.530 
really playing on your cymbals they're
going<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:14.620> stay<00:05:14.800> put<00:05:15.010> so<00:05:15.850> you<00:05:16.150> know<00:05:16.300> you<00:05:16.360> can

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
going to stay put so you know you can

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.390 
going to stay put so you know you can
take<00:05:16.660> them<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:16.960> move<00:05:17.110> them<00:05:17.260> around<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.830> do

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
take them and move them around and do

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.730 
take them and move them around and do
whatever<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.790> need<00:05:18.850> to<00:05:19.060> do<00:05:19.240> for<00:05:20.230> larger

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
whatever you need to do for larger

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.400 
whatever you need to do for larger
symbols<00:05:21.100> like<00:05:21.310> 20<00:05:21.640> inches<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.060> up<00:05:22.410> you're

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
symbols like 20 inches and up you're

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.660 
symbols like 20 inches and up you're
probably<00:05:23.500> going<00:05:23.800> to<00:05:23.860> want<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.130> consider<00:05:24.460> using

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
probably going to want to consider using

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.210 
probably going to want to consider using
two<00:05:25.080> gels<00:05:26.080> on<00:05:26.350> it<00:05:26.470> you<00:05:26.590> just<00:05:26.710> get<00:05:26.890> a<00:05:26.950> little<00:05:27.070> bit

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
two gels on it you just get a little bit

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.810 
two gels on it you just get a little bit
more<00:05:27.400> control<00:05:27.760> that<00:05:28.030> way<00:05:29.370> but<00:05:30.370> that's<00:05:30.580> about

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
more control that way but that's about

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.200 
more control that way but that's about
it<00:05:31.030> so<00:05:31.500> you<00:05:32.500> know<00:05:32.650> moon<00:05:33.520> gels<00:05:33.820> if<00:05:34.060> they're

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
it so you know moon gels if they're

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.740 
it so you know moon gels if they're
great

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
great

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.140 
great
