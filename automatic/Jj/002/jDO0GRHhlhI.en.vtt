00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this is a very unassuming card it's a

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
this is a very unassuming card it's a
six-man<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.590> 35<00:00:31.949> flyer<00:00:32.250> which<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:32.759> not<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
six-man of 35 flyer which is not that

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.600 
six-man of 35 flyer which is not that
great<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.809> terms<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.260> basic<00:00:34.440> stats<00:00:34.829> but<00:00:35.460> its

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
great in terms of basic stats but its

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.040 
great in terms of basic stats but its
ability<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.120> give<00:00:36.450> your<00:00:36.540> multicolored

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
creatures flying is I think what is

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
creatures flying is I think what is
going<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.059> push<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.360> over<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> top<00:00:39.750> because

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
going to push it over the top because

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.229 
going to push it over the top because
dragon's<00:00:41.100> maze<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> going<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.700> mostly<00:00:42.120> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
dragon's maze is going to be mostly a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.330 
dragon's maze is going to be mostly a
slower<00:00:42.540> format<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.200> case<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.040> board

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
slower format in case of any board

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.670 
slower format in case of any board
stalls<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.940> card<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.750> lets<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.410> past

blocker<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.210> could<00:01:33.390> turn<00:01:33.540> into<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
blocker and then it could turn into a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.140 
blocker and then it could turn into a
huge<00:01:34.049> attacker<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.400> card<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> not<00:01:35.909> as

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
huge attacker so this card is not as

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.539 
huge attacker so this card is not as
good<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.869> blocker<00:01:37.140> as<00:01:37.439> free<00:01:37.829> loculus<00:01:38.310> was

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
good of a blocker as free loculus was

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.179 
good of a blocker as free loculus was
but<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.810> way<00:01:40.079> better<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.409> offense<00:01:40.740> because

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
but it is way better on offense because

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.999 
but it is way better on offense because
for<00:01:41.549> power<00:01:41.820> flying<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.299> huge<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.590> mean<00:01:43.799> any

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
for power flying is huge so I mean any

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.499 
for power flying is huge so I mean any
more<00:01:44.280> stalls<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.790> will<00:01:44.939> happen<00:01:45.060> because<00:01:45.360> of

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
more stalls that will happen because of

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.480 
more stalls that will happen because of
for<00:01:45.780> toughness<00:01:45.990> creatures<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.590> gatekeepers

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
for toughness creatures like gatekeepers

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.770 
for toughness creatures like gatekeepers
and<00:01:47.520> stuff<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> ground<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.570> matter

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and stuff on the ground will not matter

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.749 
and stuff on the ground will not matter
at<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.380> buta<00:01:50.070> for<00:01:50.220> mates<00:01:50.399> will<00:01:50.549> fly

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
at all because buta for mates will fly

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
at all because buta for mates will fly
over<00:01:51.149> them<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.020> only<00:01:52.170> thing<00:01:52.229> keeping<00:01:52.649> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
over them so the only thing keeping this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.499 
over them so the only thing keeping this
from<00:01:52.890> being<00:01:53.070> higher<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.640> basically<00:01:54.030> two<00:01:54.299> mana

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
from being higher is basically two mana

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.420 
from being higher is basically two mana
turn<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.100> don't<00:01:56.310> an

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
turn is you know it's don't an

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.910 
turn is you know it's don't an
investment<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.840> when<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.290> not<00:01:58.530> pumped

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
investment so and when it's not pumped

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.830 
investment so and when it's not pumped
up<00:01:59.040> it's<00:01:59.250> not<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> really<00:01:59.790> good<00:01:59.939> defender<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
up it's not a really good defender so

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.420 
up it's not a really good defender so
even<00:02:01.350> though<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.560> great<00:02:01.799> offense<00:02:02.130> machine

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
even though it's great offense machine

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
even though it's great offense machine
it's<00:02:02.640> not<00:02:02.850> really<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.299> great<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.659> a<00:02:03.719> defense

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
it's not really that great of a defense

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.469 
it's not really that great of a defense
machine<00:02:04.350> so<00:02:05.340> coming<00:02:05.549> at<00:02:05.729> number<00:02:06.000> 3<00:02:06.270> i'm

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
machine so coming at number 3 i'm

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
machine so coming at number 3 i'm
actually<00:02:06.689> cheating<00:02:07.140> little<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.619> i'm<00:02:07.740> going

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
actually cheating little and i'm going

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.240 
actually cheating little and i'm going
to

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
to

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
to
I<00:02:08.280> like<00:02:08.490> two<00:02:08.640> cards<00:02:08.970> those<00:02:09.509> cards<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.990> via

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
I like two cards those cards are in via

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
I like two cards those cards are in via
tional<00:02:10.500> first<00:02:10.710> blade<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.190> nivek<00:02:11.790> Cyclops<00:02:12.240> and

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
tional first blade and nivek Cyclops and

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.910 
tional first blade and nivek Cyclops and
the<00:02:12.960> reason<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.320> want<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.500> talk<00:02:13.620> about<00:02:13.650> these

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
the reason I want to talk about these

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.890 
the reason I want to talk about these
cars<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.340> they<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.880> both<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.360> potential<00:02:15.810> for

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
cars is they have both the potential for

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.650 
cars is they have both the potential for
for<00:02:16.110> power<00:02:16.290> there<00:02:16.920> are<00:02:17.010> temporary<00:02:17.460> fours<00:02:18.000> so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
for power there are temporary fours so

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.730 
for power there are temporary fours so
let's<00:02:18.840> go<00:02:18.930> ahead<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.140> talk<00:02:19.290> about<00:02:19.500> first

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
let's go ahead and talk about first

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.530 
let's go ahead and talk about first
blade<00:02:20.010> first<00:02:20.310> since<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.060> first<00:02:21.270> plate

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
blade first since it is the first plate

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.350 
blade first since it is the first plate
I<00:02:21.690> guess<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.770> card<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> Boris<00:02:23.700> card<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.240> a

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I guess this card is a Boris card it's a

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.660 
I guess this card is a Boris card it's a
three-man<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.780> 22<00:02:25.080> with<00:02:25.920> haste<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.520> is<00:02:26.640> very

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
three-man of 22 with haste which is very

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.460 
three-man of 22 with haste which is very
powerful<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.840> first<00:02:28.050> term<00:02:28.200> that<00:02:28.320> comes

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
powerful but the first term that comes

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.949 
powerful but the first term that comes
into<00:02:28.620> play<00:02:28.830> it's<00:02:29.160> a<00:02:29.310> 44<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.660> does

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
into play it's a 44 and what that does

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.960 
into play it's a 44 and what that does
is<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.320> lets<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.830> past<00:02:32.100> most<00:02:32.520> defenders

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
is it lets you get past most defenders

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.699 
is it lets you get past most defenders
in<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> format<00:02:33.480> so<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.230> only<00:02:34.350> do<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.590> have

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
in the format so not only do you have

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.380 
in the format so not only do you have
the<00:02:34.770> gatekeepers<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:35.730> are<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.060> basically

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the gatekeepers which are all basically

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.810 
the gatekeepers which are all basically
for<00:02:36.780> toughness<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.350> our<00:02:38.100> one<00:02:38.459> going<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.760> be

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
for toughness and our one going to be

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.949 
for toughness and our one going to be
the<00:02:38.910> one<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.180> most<00:02:39.300> common<00:02:39.600> cards<00:02:39.840> you're

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the one of the most common cards you're

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.930 
the one of the most common cards you're
going<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.140> see<00:02:40.290> in<00:02:40.530> Dragon's<00:02:40.890> maze<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.850> you

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
going to see in Dragon's maze but you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.340 
going to see in Dragon's maze but you
know<00:02:42.030> other<00:02:42.239> things<00:02:42.390> remoter<00:02:42.840> sets<00:02:43.110> like<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
know other things remoter sets like a

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.040 
know other things remoter sets like a
Frostburg<00:02:43.920> weird<00:02:44.190> for<00:02:44.430> example<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.060> all<00:02:45.900> those

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
Frostburg weird for example in all those

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.900 
Frostburg weird for example in all those
other<00:02:46.230> horn<00:02:46.530> turtles<00:02:46.920> they<00:02:47.130> are<00:02:47.400> for

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
other horn turtles they are for

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.850 
other horn turtles they are for
toughness<00:02:48.180> creatures<00:02:48.600> so<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.380> power<00:02:49.650> lets

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
toughness creatures so for power lets

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.460 
toughness creatures so for power lets
you<00:02:49.920> get<00:02:50.010> past<00:02:50.250> them<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:51.750> nibix<00:02:52.080> Cyclops

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
you get past them and the nibix Cyclops

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.080 
you get past them and the nibix Cyclops
i<00:02:52.590> think<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.890> slightly<00:02:53.400> better<00:02:53.730> than<00:02:53.850> the

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
i think is slightly better than the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
i think is slightly better than the
first<00:02:54.300> plane<00:02:54.570> because<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.470> lets<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.680> do<00:02:55.800> it

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
first plane because it lets you do it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.860 
first plane because it lets you do it
repeatedly<00:02:56.130> it<00:02:56.970> doesn't<00:02:57.239> have<00:02:57.300> hey<00:02:57.480> so<00:02:57.540> it's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
repeatedly it doesn't have hey so it's

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.199 
repeatedly it doesn't have hey so it's
not<00:02:57.959> explosive<00:02:58.470> but<00:02:59.250> if<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.459> ever<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.910> any

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
not explosive but if you ever have any

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.540 
not explosive but if you ever have any
instance<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.260> sorceries<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.890> if<00:03:02.160> you<00:03:02.280> have

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
instance of sorceries and if you have

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.160 
instance of sorceries and if you have
multiple<00:03:02.760> even<00:03:03.270> this<00:03:03.510> guy<00:03:03.660> can<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:03.900> really

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
multiple even this guy can get really

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.860 
multiple even this guy can get really
big<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.709> in<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.730> meantime<00:03:05.850> he<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.510> great

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
big and in the meantime he is a great

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.900 
big and in the meantime he is a great
blocker<00:03:07.320> for<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.709> because<00:03:08.130> I'll<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.400> know<00:03:08.430> 14

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
blocker for you because I'll you know 14

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.370 
blocker for you because I'll you know 14
body<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.480> has<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.720> for<00:03:09.870> toughness<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.230> you

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
body it has the for toughness that you

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320 
body it has the for toughness that you
need<00:03:10.500> a<00:03:10.530> block<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.430> those<00:03:11.700> are<00:03:11.850> two<00:03:12.299> really

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
need a block so those are two really

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.509 
need a block so those are two really
good<00:03:12.750> cards<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.200> think<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.799> will<00:03:13.890> affect<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
good cards I think that will affect the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.970 
good cards I think that will affect the
format<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.720> coming<00:03:16.049> at<00:03:16.140> number<00:03:16.410> two<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:16.830> have

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
format and coming at number two we have

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.310 
format and coming at number two we have
type<00:03:17.220> trigger<00:03:17.459> so<00:03:17.880> this<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.239> 2-1<00:03:18.810> lifelink

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
type trigger so this is a 2-1 lifelink

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.110 
type trigger so this is a 2-1 lifelink
extort<00:03:19.769> creature<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.790> amazing<00:03:20.910> thing

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
extort creature and the amazing thing

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.910 
extort creature and the amazing thing
about<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.959> unlike<00:03:22.320> sending<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.709> ties

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
about this is is unlike sending of ties

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.340 
about this is is unlike sending of ties
because<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> life<00:03:24.150> link<00:03:24.360> your<00:03:24.900> opponent

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
because of the life link your opponent

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:26.870 
because of the life link your opponent
will<00:03:25.440> have<00:03:25.620> to<00:03:25.769> keep<00:03:25.980> someone<00:03:26.250> back<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.610> block

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
will have to keep someone back to block

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.360 
will have to keep someone back to block
or<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:28.019> will<00:03:28.170> get<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.320> four-point<00:03:28.860> life<00:03:29.040> swing

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
or you will get a four-point life swing

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.490 
or you will get a four-point life swing
with<00:03:29.610> every<00:03:29.880> attack<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.870> know<00:03:31.140> sending<00:03:31.380> of

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
with every attack so you know sending of

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.110 
with every attack so you know sending of
tires<00:03:31.709> they<00:03:32.040> could<00:03:32.280> let<00:03:32.489> city<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.910> tires

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
tires they could let city of tires

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.880 
tires they could let city of tires
attack<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.019> they<00:03:34.230> would<00:03:34.380> only<00:03:34.530> lose<00:03:34.709> to

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
attack in and they would only lose to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890 
attack in and they would only lose to
life<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.370> you<00:03:35.820> know<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> two-point<00:03:36.510> live<00:03:36.660> swing

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
life and you know a two-point live swing

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.539 
life and you know a two-point live swing
and<00:03:37.079> a<00:03:37.110> four-point<00:03:37.500> live<00:03:37.590> swing<00:03:37.890> are<00:03:38.070> a<00:03:38.130> huge

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
and a four-point live swing are a huge

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.880 
and a four-point live swing are a huge
difference<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.120> then<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.230> tight<00:03:40.410> stranger<00:03:40.709> is

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
difference and then so tight stranger is

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.530 
difference and then so tight stranger is
a<00:03:40.920> very<00:03:41.130> dangerous<00:03:41.250> early<00:03:41.700> game<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.480> the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
a very dangerous early game and in the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.819 
a very dangerous early game and in the
late<00:03:42.690> game<00:03:42.870> of<00:03:42.989> course<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.290> have<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.500> extort

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
late game of course you have the extort

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.500 
late game of course you have the extort
value<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.700> I<00:03:44.730> think<00:03:44.850> this<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.239> just<00:03:45.269> going<00:03:45.450> to

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
value so I think this is just going to

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.960 
value so I think this is just going to
be<00:03:45.570> a<00:03:45.630> really<00:03:45.840> great<00:03:46.049> card<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.820> kind<00:03:47.820> of<00:03:47.850> like

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
be a really great card and kind of like

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.850 
be a really great card and kind of like
King<00:03:48.209> pink<00:03:48.420> spat<00:03:48.690> in<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.049> certain<00:03:49.290> way<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.530> King

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
King pink spat in a certain way and King

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.710 
King pink spat in a certain way and King
pick<00:03:50.040> spec<00:03:50.370> was<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.610> really<00:03:50.880> good<00:03:51.030> comment<00:03:51.690> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
pick spec was a really good comment and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.509 
pick spec was a really good comment and
gatecrash<00:03:52.140> and<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.980> know<00:03:53.070> you're<00:03:53.220> to<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.430> to

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
gatecrash and you know you're to get to

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.160 
gatecrash and you know you're to get to
use<00:03:53.670> both<00:03:53.880> hopefully<00:03:54.450> if<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:54.690> go<00:03:54.810> roars<00:03:54.989> off

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
use both hopefully if you go roars off

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.650 
use both hopefully if you go roars off
so<00:03:55.769> yeah<00:03:55.950> very<00:03:56.160> powerful<00:03:56.610> creature<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.120> then

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
so yeah very powerful creature and then

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.509 
so yeah very powerful creature and then
of<00:03:57.750> course<00:03:57.780> coming<00:03:58.079> at<00:03:58.260> number<00:03:58.560> one<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.040> this

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
of course coming at number one and this

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.009 
of course coming at number one and this
is<00:03:59.670> my<00:03:59.790> prediction<00:04:00.000> might<00:04:00.450> be<00:04:00.600> wrong<00:04:00.750> might<00:04:00.930> be

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
is my prediction might be wrong might be

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:01.970 
is my prediction might be wrong might be
right<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.410> think<00:04:01.650> it's<00:04:01.769> going<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.920> be

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
right but I think it's going to be

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.640 
right but I think it's going to be
searched<00:04:02.549> hog<00:04:02.850> druid<00:04:03.329> so<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:04.019> is<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> grill

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
searched hog druid so this is a grill

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.240 
searched hog druid so this is a grill
card<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.130> nano<00:04:05.370> 4011<00:04:05.850> seems<00:04:06.660> bad<00:04:06.900> but<00:04:07.010> one<00:04:08.010> it

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
card to nano 4011 seems bad but one it

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.160 
card to nano 4011 seems bad but one it
ramps<00:04:08.730> you<00:04:08.880> it<00:04:09.180> gives<00:04:09.299> you<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.480> green<00:04:09.720> mana<00:04:09.930> and

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
ramps you it gives you a green mana and

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.530 
ramps you it gives you a green mana and
two<00:04:10.530> whenever<00:04:11.190> you<00:04:11.519> tap<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.970> gets<00:04:12.120> tapped<00:04:12.360> for

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
two whenever you tap it gets tapped for

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.420 
two whenever you tap it gets tapped for
mana<00:04:12.780> it<00:04:13.440> deals<00:04:13.650> one<00:04:13.890> damage<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.310> each

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
mana it deals one damage to each

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.820 
mana it deals one damage to each
opponent<00:04:14.700> so<00:04:15.660> this<00:04:15.810> is<00:04:15.840> actually<00:04:16.049> pretty<00:04:16.410> huge

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830 
opponent so this is actually pretty huge

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.159 
opponent so this is actually pretty huge
for<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> drop<00:04:17.789> and<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.690> thing<00:04:18.840> about<00:04:18.870> this

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
for a to drop and the thing about this

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.110 
for a to drop and the thing about this
format<00:04:19.500> is<00:04:19.530> because<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:20.010> slower<00:04:20.310> ramp<00:04:20.789> is

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
format is because the slower ramp is

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.450 
format is because the slower ramp is
really<00:04:21.540> get<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.900> out<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.440> those<00:04:22.680> fast<00:04:23.070> starts

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
really get you out of those fast starts

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.890 
really get you out of those fast starts
before<00:04:23.639> any<00:04:24.090> other<00:04:24.150> decks<00:04:24.510> can<00:04:24.660> establish

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
before any other decks can establish

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.330 
before any other decks can establish
like<00:04:25.320> four<00:04:25.560> stalls<00:04:25.770> or<00:04:25.919> anything<00:04:26.190> like<00:04:26.220> that

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
like four stalls or anything like that

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.210 
like four stalls or anything like that
and<00:04:26.760> in<00:04:27.360> addition<00:04:27.479> before<00:04:28.410> to<00:04:28.590> drop<00:04:28.830> it's

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
and in addition before to drop it's

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.590 
and in addition before to drop it's
going<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.490> really<00:04:29.729> good<00:04:29.910> late-game<00:04:30.180> know

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
going to be really good late-game know

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.409 
going to be really good late-game know
it<00:04:31.350> kind<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.560> gives<00:04:31.740> extort<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> drool<00:04:32.729> whereas

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
it kind of gives extort to drool whereas

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.879 
it kind of gives extort to drool whereas
girl<00:04:33.630> didn't<00:04:33.900> have<00:04:33.990> extort<00:04:34.440> because<00:04:34.680> you<00:04:34.800> know

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:34.889 
girl didn't have extort because you know

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.850 
girl didn't have extort because you know
that's<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.190> white<00:04:35.520> and<00:04:35.669> black<00:04:36.080> ability<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.650> this

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
that's a white and black ability so this

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.860 
that's a white and black ability so this
will<00:04:38.190> give<00:04:38.220> you<00:04:38.520> reach<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.120> four<00:04:39.449> to<00:04:39.630> drop

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
will give you reach and four to drop

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.300 
will give you reach and four to drop
that's<00:04:40.050> pretty<00:04:40.380> much<00:04:40.470> all<00:04:40.650> you<00:04:40.740> can<00:04:40.860> ask<00:04:41.010> forms

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
that's pretty much all you can ask forms

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.430 
that's pretty much all you can ask forms
i<00:04:41.400> think<00:04:41.550> it's<00:04:41.639> going<00:04:41.729> to<00:04:41.790> be<00:04:41.850> very<00:04:41.910> powerful

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
i think it's going to be very powerful

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.620 
i think it's going to be very powerful
ramp<00:04:43.440> and<00:04:43.680> reach<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.310> one<00:04:44.639> card<00:04:44.910> and<00:04:45.150> is

definitely my number one by a pretty
long<00:04:47.820> margin<00:04:48.270> so<00:04:49.169> those<00:04:49.380> were<00:04:49.530> my<00:04:49.710> rankings

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
long margin so those were my rankings
