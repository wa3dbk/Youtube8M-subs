00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.420
 Hey, people, beauty. 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.400
 The video that shows you a review 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.929
 of bad results 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.539
 it is a mouse that is the cheapest 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.930
 daniel heise of course is not so 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.779
 so cheap it is around 1 180 150 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.420
 and may the rate for less yet 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.070
 11 consider a little each for others 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.260
 models 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.600
 This boy here is a mouse that is not 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.809
 macro it only has three flick buttons 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.690
 left scrum is what I know 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.000
 this mouse and the rescue mode right? 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.420
 I think they are the only ones who have not 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.370
 I'm a monkey but they rated it 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.170
 difference not only the price also in the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.090
 creche source much more expensive 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.539
 it has a slightly different look 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.760
 so that the Mozambican left 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 it serves both hands he does not 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.170
 what is not a format 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.940
 normal if you do not have such 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.619
 put in the left hand a right not 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.640
 it will make no difference shows 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.659
 just like it's good, it's a very 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.460
 comfortable 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 it has a well- rubberized look and 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 can get a bit dirty with your 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.290
 fingerprints 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 I do not know if all bad helcio rizzi né 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 but it gets a bit dirty a bit, right? 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.580
 This is a big problem, you can 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.710
 to clean here under the consolation I think 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.430
 which is black piano is just part of the 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.829
 team year and even so the very way 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.930
 comfortable to hold small mose 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.610
 down is also not very high 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.390
 so if you do not like to change like this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 consummate his hand is this property that 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.890
 it is perfect comfortable to play alone and 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 surf the Internet 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.909
 he has a one baby configuration 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.829
 3,500 the most of it you can go there 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.290
 except for the synapse king 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.530
 but this one here is evil here 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.119
 person with a single mouse and 3015 p 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.790
 was not recognized by racing 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.580
 Snow already tried to use it but 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.480
 future belfort a video showing 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.310
 How to configure the mouse is yours 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.180
 reign made that mistake 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.400
 this error did not give what was recognized 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.080
 but it 's in another video this video is a 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.020
 review the mouse even with your 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.750
 specialization talk all about yourself mouse is 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.840
 this is not the result of the new 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.300
 reservoir on that day 2 the cradle 2014 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.950
 it is an older version since the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:45.610
 razr logo is still blue and well and that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:49.670
 he has not chosen the best is 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.150
 the church logo below 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.120
 its mode also does not shine the laser is 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.660
 so he will not be early then 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.989
 it is not defect or without its law is r 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.920
 3,500 cpi for you to see a spark here in the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.750
 background but there is a red glow and the 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.000
 two buttons also shown here was the 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.870
 pina configuration other than the razr 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.450
 synapse that is with 150 dp in 1803 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.540
 1,500 so none of these I think 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.130
 it is very good for t fps 450 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 I think it's too slow for me. 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.060
 slowly in 1803 1500 already a little more 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.790
 above 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.250
 if you have gotten accustomed well, but 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.980
 have a program of the same data network 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.530
 of the resin that is promoting your s malzac 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.829
 his sensitivity I said then 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:42.049
 another video shows and has another button that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.590
 this down here that this generation of 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:47.630
 mouse is 125 hz and a thousand 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.519
 I let it not be too much that was 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.330
 What difference does it make, I 'm not a specialist. 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.810
 on mouse and 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.250
 types of technology it has in its 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.190
 power as in leaving here in the 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:03.480
 comments what is better this way né 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:07.140
 What's worse is that I thank you and have it 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.910
 even is a term that much to speak of this 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.110
 Evil here is a great mouse, that's how I said it. 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:15.780
 It gets a little dirty but it's ours. 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.070
 comfortable is his clip is very good 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.870
 It's even got a great resistance in these 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.560
 two buttons on them the shell is great 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.690
 even though it is not bright and well 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.670
 This is a great way, but it's one thing. 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.290
 which is a bit bad is the price it can 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.310
 be the mouse cheaper than the others 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.530
 versions 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.290
 yet it is still the price more 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.530
 higher than many other brands like 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.230
 read but changed is an expensive model but 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.180
 also has cheaper model 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.610
 this is why I like this video I 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.460
 I know you did not reveal too detailed but 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.790
 if you are looking for this evil, I will not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.600
 I recommend a great mouse for both the 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.210
 fps with web browsing that navigation 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.470
 on the web any mouse is just ok 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.510
 Running, okay? 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:09.150
 now it's even to play the mouse 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.040
 if you like and do not be landmark that is 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.190
 a more reasonable price, right? 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.710
 It's great for those who do not like map as 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.610
 all versions almost 30 years except 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:23.730
 kraft has a macro then you mother 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:26.550
 no matter right here that already serves the 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.530
 Macaé, just something, you're just two. 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.610
 buttons only depending on the glass of the 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.460
 box that is 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.200
 you may be paying a lot more 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.110
 But that's it , I'm not just eating that. 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.969
 I mean it's nothing against him is a 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.819
 nothing against bad machinations 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:45.279
 but this way I'll tell you points 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:47.019
 positive for those who like this video if 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:49.389
 I like this one a lot. 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:52.839
 in the disclosure to enroll in the channel being 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.939
 and write a question that you 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:57.009
 has about this evil if he is in faith 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:06:01.509
 comfortable little any question 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:05.189
 some doubt is just as well until the 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:05.189
 next video said
