00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.960
 It's a business that was produced next year. 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.910
 Once a11 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.990
 I think it would be a happier day than a shoulder. 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.340
 From now on 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.340
 The details are as students 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.540
 I'm very old. 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.390
 It's a day when you need to see and learn more 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.040
 I think 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.810
 How long is the weather 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.810
 I wanted to plan a trip. 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.270
 Someday and when you want to go on a trip to Seoul at dawn 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.990
 Get out of the car 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.800
 I'm poisoned in history. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 As for the photos, 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.540
 I know that there are a lot of places like this in Seoul now. 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.470
 There was. 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.230
 therefore 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.200
 Living as a citizen of Seoul 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.130
 It's fun now. 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.130
 Maybe even a little proud 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.230
 I got a lot of emotions. 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.119
 I am so grateful to those who have just worn these cases. 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.530
 Is it coming? 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.680
 It comes with a torch. 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.410
 taxi 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.630
 Unfiltered mark 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.530
 There are also glazes 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.950
 Hi Seoul and Seoul National University 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.569
 Hit the title 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.740
 Very surprised when you get sick 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.850
 I do not know if there is a rising 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:18.539
 I really hope you do. 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:21.099
 I think I was doing today. 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.159
 Ah, I've been to many 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.159
 I have been working as a public relations ambassador 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.269
 So it's too big to be able to tell the world 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:30.379
 It's an honor. 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:31.729
 upgraded 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.259
 The meeting to Asia 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.429
 At the Mason event in English 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.699
 It is important to notify myself, of course, 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:42.569
 Over how beautiful we are 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.679
 I am full of people's smell and how beautiful and beautiful 

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:48.729
 This place is trying to announce more 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.810
 Then I will become a public relations ambassador. So far there have been 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.810
 Most of them are young 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.749
 Search 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:01.019
 I will study. 3.
