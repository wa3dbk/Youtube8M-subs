00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:12.780
 we will visualize the resonance 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.449
 between two of the identical passions 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:20.320
 these days passions are designed to 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.360
 oscillate the frequency of 440 exercises 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.349
 which is the frequency of the eagerness of 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:29.360
 noted this device is used to 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.150
 tune the musical instruments 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.790
 we hit one of the day reasons for 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.210
 make you loved and you swing to this 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:44.990
 own or natural frequency of the system 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:46.630
 and this would be the 440 frequency sound 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.630
 hertz 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.480
 if we hit the other day it happened then 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.140
 we will see that the sound is identical has 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 the same tone 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.900
 then now let's hit one of 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 the ten reasons he will begin to oxidize 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.520
 with this frequency of own nature of 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.950
 440 exercises 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.000
 the fingerboard is in contact with the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.430
 air particles 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.320
 and it makes these also begin to 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.810
 society with the same frequency of 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.900
 way such that this disturbance that 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.030
 it generates in the air propagates through 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.440
 of the air itself as a wave one 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.100
 very large speed at a speed 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.979
 of the order of 340 meters per second 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 you immediately reach the second 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.800
 fingerboard and how often 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.860
 they close the particles of the air is of 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.310
 440 exercises the coincides with the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 own frequency of the system because this 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.490
 another this second day spent this second 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.520
 system will begin to oscillate broadly 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.050
 maximum and we'll see what happens in the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.980
 phenomenon of resonance consisting 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.200
 precisely in that 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.850
 that the system oscillates as maximum affect 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.459
 when an external disturbance 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.040
 he does it in truth with a frequency 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:16.050
 equal to the own frequency then 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.050
 for that we copied the first day 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.480
 we see that the sound persists when 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.260
 stop this tuning fork repeat the 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.260
 operation 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.380
 is only oscillating in this case the 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:44.050
 second day past 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.050
 we'll see what happens now when 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:50.740
 we modify the mass slightly and 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.570
 geometry of the second fretboard now the 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.670
 oscillation frequencies of the second 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.130
 Fingerboard will be slightly different 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.720
 now we will copy both days passions 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.920
 to hear sounds different sounds 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.920
 the first step 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.850
 continue with this tone 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 and the second day passed 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.819
 with a tone 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.850
 then we hit them the first day 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.060
 of steps to try to have 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.060
 resonance 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:32.010
 when we stop we do not hear any 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.570
 sound because the second does not continue because 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.090
 does not enter the resonance because the 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.770
 frequency of the sound emitted by the 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.820
 first day passed does not match the 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.820
 own frequency 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.340
 this is today's experiment
