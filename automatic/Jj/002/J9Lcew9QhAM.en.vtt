will be getting rid of it will be

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.630 
will be getting rid of it will be
treating<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:02.940> radiation<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:05.070> mean

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
do we're fighting through it where you

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.710 
do we're fighting through it where you
know<00:01:16.770> kicking<00:01:17.549> its<00:01:17.939> ass<00:01:18.119> as<00:01:18.390> much<00:01:18.509> as<00:01:18.630> we

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
know kicking its ass as much as we

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.539 
know kicking its ass as much as we
possibly<00:01:18.750> can<00:01:19.229> we've<00:01:19.979> already<00:01:20.130> got<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> date

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
possibly can we've already got a date

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.999 
possibly can we've already got a date
for<00:01:20.610> surgery<00:01:21.450> scheduled<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:22.890> know

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
for surgery scheduled and then we know

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.980 
for surgery scheduled and then we know
but<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> radiation<00:01:23.759> follow<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.119> or<00:01:24.330> we're

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
but the radiation follow up or we're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
but the radiation follow up or we're
actually<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.560> really<00:01:25.590> good<00:01:25.950> position<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
actually in a really good position I

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.330 
actually in a really good position I
mean<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.060> found<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> super<00:01:27.720> early<00:01:27.840> at<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
mean we found it super early at that

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.249 
mean we found it super early at that
like<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.790> way<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.840> scared<00:01:31.880> because

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
like in a way I'm not scared because

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.630 
like in a way I'm not scared because
statistically<00:01:34.259> we<00:01:34.470> should<00:01:34.650> be<00:01:34.799> fine<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.460> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
statistically we should be fine but you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.060 
statistically we should be fine but you
know<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.000> still<00:01:36.799> terrifying<00:01:37.799> at<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:37.979> same

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
of the games but overall a big thing of
