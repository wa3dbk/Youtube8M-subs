one of the most effective things that

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.269 
one of the most effective things that
saxophone<00:00:05.109> players<00:00:05.410> can<00:00:05.710> do<00:00:05.830> to<00:00:06.069> improve

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:06.279 
saxophone players can do to improve

saxophone players can do to improve
their<00:00:06.460> sound<00:00:06.729> is<00:00:06.939> working<00:00:07.630> on<00:00:07.720> what<00:00:08.080> we<00:00:08.200> call

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
their sound is working on what we call

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.070 
their sound is working on what we call
overtones<00:00:08.980> now<00:00:09.849> when<00:00:10.030> you<00:00:10.120> hear<00:00:10.420> a<00:00:10.480> musical

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.080 
overtones now when you hear a musical

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.930 
overtones now when you hear a musical
note<00:00:11.320> we're<00:00:12.009> actually<00:00:12.280> hearing<00:00:12.730> is<00:00:12.910> a

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
note we're actually hearing is a

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.339 
note we're actually hearing is a
combination<00:00:13.599> of<00:00:13.629> what<00:00:13.959> we<00:00:14.080> call<00:00:14.259> the

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:14.349 
combination of what we call the

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.220 
combination of what we call the
fundamental<00:00:14.530> and<00:00:15.249> overtones<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.870> pics<00:00:17.110> that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
fundamental and overtones the pics that

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.600 
fundamental and overtones the pics that
you<00:00:17.440> hear<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.800> pitches<00:00:18.070> that<00:00:18.100> you<00:00:18.220> can<00:00:18.370> name

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:18.610 
you hear the pitches that you can name

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.030 
you hear the pitches that you can name
we<00:00:19.240> call<00:00:19.480> the<00:00:19.600> fundamental<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.770> there<00:00:20.950> are

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
we call the fundamental but there are

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.530 
we call the fundamental but there are
many<00:00:21.190> pictures<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:21.730> are<00:00:21.820> ringing<00:00:22.120> above

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
many pictures that are ringing above

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.100 
many pictures that are ringing above
that<00:00:22.870> note<00:00:23.140> and<00:00:23.470> we<00:00:23.770> call<00:00:23.980> those<00:00:24.160> overtones

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
that note and we call those overtones

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.780 
that note and we call those overtones
now<00:00:26.110> if<00:00:26.500> we're<00:00:26.770> able<00:00:26.920> to<00:00:27.130> isolate<00:00:27.640> these

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
now if we're able to isolate these

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.090 
now if we're able to isolate these
overtones<00:00:28.270> in<00:00:28.510> our<00:00:28.660> sound<00:00:28.960> through<00:00:29.470> series<00:00:30.040> of

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:30.100 
overtones in our sound through series of

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.249 
overtones in our sound through series of
long<00:00:30.400> tones<00:00:30.700> what<00:00:31.300> we're<00:00:31.510> doing<00:00:31.840> is<00:00:31.990> we're

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
long tones what we're doing is we're

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.230 
long tones what we're doing is we're
we're<00:00:32.529> greatly<00:00:33.010> expanding<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.700> quality<00:00:34.149> of

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
we're greatly expanding the quality of

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.390 
we're greatly expanding the quality of
our<00:00:34.330> sound<00:00:34.660> by<00:00:35.230> making<00:00:35.620> those<00:00:35.770> overtones

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
our sound by making those overtones

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.770 
our sound by making those overtones
Richard<00:00:36.880> all<00:00:37.420> right

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
Richard all right

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.570 
Richard all right
the<00:00:38.140> second<00:00:38.620> thing<00:00:38.800> that<00:00:38.830> that<00:00:39.070> does<00:00:39.130> is

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
the second thing that that does is

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.640 
the second thing that that does is
expand<00:00:40.000> our<00:00:40.150> range<00:00:40.420> since<00:00:40.960> these<00:00:41.110> overtones

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
expand our range since these overtones

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.980 
expand our range since these overtones
are<00:00:41.860> heard<00:00:42.100> above<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.670> fundamental<00:00:43.300> if<00:00:43.480> we

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
are heard above the fundamental if we

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.870 
are heard above the fundamental if we
can<00:00:44.170> move<00:00:44.350> into<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.860> overtones<00:00:45.400> we<00:00:45.700> can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880 
can move into the overtones we can

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.670 
can move into the overtones we can
actually<00:00:46.060> play<00:00:46.450> higher<00:00:46.930> than<00:00:47.200> the<00:00:47.320> natural

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
actually play higher than the natural

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.530 
actually play higher than the natural
range<00:00:47.829> of<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> saxophone<00:00:48.489> we<00:00:49.000> call<00:00:49.180> this<00:00:49.329> the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
range of the saxophone we call this the

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.630 
range of the saxophone we call this the
Old<00:00:49.660> Testament<00:00:50.050> range<00:00:50.230> practicing<00:00:51.190> overtones

Old Testament range practicing overtones

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.550 
Old Testament range practicing overtones
are<00:00:51.790> really<00:00:52.450> going<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.630> lay<00:00:52.810> the<00:00:52.989> foundation

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
are really going to lay the foundation

very naturally in nature I am to observe
this<00:01:02.380> if<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.739> take<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.460> hose<00:01:03.940> and<00:01:04.360> start

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:04.899 
this if you take a hose and start

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.599 
this if you take a hose and start
swinging<00:01:05.259> that<00:01:05.530> over<00:01:05.799> to<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:05.950> head<00:01:06.159> you're

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:06.609 
swinging that over to your head you're

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.669 
swinging that over to your head you're
gonna<00:01:06.729> hear<00:01:06.999> a<00:01:07.030> single<00:01:07.359> pitch<00:01:07.569> the<00:01:08.109> faster<00:01:08.560> you

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:08.679 
gonna hear a single pitch the faster you

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:10.260 
gonna hear a single pitch the faster you
swing<00:01:09.009> it<00:01:09.039> you're<00:01:09.609> going<00:01:09.729> to<00:01:09.789> hear<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.090> next

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
swing it you're going to hear the next

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300 
swing it you're going to hear the next
pitch<00:01:10.569> in<00:01:10.719> the<00:01:10.810> overtone<00:01:11.259> series<00:01:11.560> if<00:01:11.920> you

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
pitch in the overtone series if you

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.739 
pitch in the overtone series if you
listen<00:01:12.609> very<00:01:12.639> closely<00:01:12.939> you<00:01:13.270> will<00:01:13.359> actually

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749 
listen very closely you will actually

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.139 
listen very closely you will actually
hear<00:01:14.079> that<00:01:14.469> hose<00:01:14.740> whistling<00:01:15.399> up<00:01:15.639> and<00:01:15.819> down<00:01:15.939> the

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
hear that hose whistling up and down the

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:19.080 
hear that hose whistling up and down the
overtone<00:01:16.630> series<00:01:16.990> this<00:01:17.740> figure<00:01:18.219> outlines<00:01:18.819> the

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
overtone series this figure outlines the

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.330 
overtone series this figure outlines the
overtone<00:01:19.509> series<00:01:19.719> using<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.350> b-flat<00:01:20.740> as<00:01:21.039> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
overtone series using the b-flat as the

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
fundamental as you can see the first

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.899 
fundamental as you can see the first
overtone<00:01:25.240> is<00:01:25.950> another<00:01:26.950> b-flat<00:01:27.399> this<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.789> an

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
overtone is another b-flat this is an

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.410 
overtone is another b-flat this is an
octave<00:01:28.270> a<00:01:28.600> fifth<00:01:29.530> above<00:01:29.829> that<00:01:30.009> is<00:01:30.249> an<00:01:30.399> F<00:01:30.549> and<00:01:30.819> a

fourth<00:01:31.689> above<00:01:31.990> the<00:01:32.170> F<00:01:32.350> would<00:01:32.679> come<00:01:32.859> back<00:01:33.039> to<00:01:33.249> a

00:01:33.269 --> 00:01:33.279 
fourth above the F would come back to a

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:35.940 
fourth above the F would come back to a
b-flat<00:01:33.579> but<00:01:34.539> go<00:01:34.630> even<00:01:34.899> higher<00:01:35.109> a<00:01:35.170> third<00:01:35.679> above

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
b-flat but go even higher a third above

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.819 
b-flat but go even higher a third above
that<00:01:36.310> next<00:01:36.700> b-flat<00:01:37.149> we're<00:01:37.659> looking<00:01:37.929> at<00:01:38.049> a<00:01:38.079> D<00:01:38.319> we

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
that next b-flat we're looking at a D we

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.419 
that next b-flat we're looking at a D we
can<00:01:38.950> go<00:01:39.069> on<00:01:39.279> and<00:01:39.459> on<00:01:39.549> but<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.209> ratio<00:01:41.109> is<00:01:42.039> the

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
can go on and on but this ratio is the

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:44.669 
can go on and on but this ratio is the

fundamental we choose to start up we can
start<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.469> on<00:01:47.709> an<00:01:48.039> any<00:01:48.219> pitch<00:01:48.490> B<00:01:48.909> or<00:01:49.299> C<00:01:49.689> or<00:01:49.929> C

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
start this on an any pitch B or C or C

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.769 
start this on an any pitch B or C or C
sharp<00:01:50.439> and<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:51.429> series<00:01:51.759> is<00:01:51.939> always<00:01:52.359> going<00:01:52.689> to

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:52.779 
sharp and this series is always going to

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.459 
sharp and this series is always going to
share<00:01:53.319> the<00:01:53.709> exact<00:01:54.130> same<00:01:54.450> ratio<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.349> an

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
share the exact same ratio that of an

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.849 
share the exact same ratio that of an
octave<00:01:56.829> and<00:01:57.009> a<00:01:57.039> fifth<00:01:57.609> fourth<00:01:58.389> and<00:01:58.869> third<00:01:59.229> and

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859 
octave and a fifth fourth and third and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.730 
octave and a fifth fourth and third and
so<00:02:00.099> on<00:02:00.359> when<00:02:01.359> you<00:02:01.479> hear<00:02:01.719> a<00:02:01.749> players<00:02:02.139> sound<00:02:02.529> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
so on when you hear a players sound that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.919 
so on when you hear a players sound that
you<00:02:02.829> really<00:02:03.099> like<00:02:03.340> it's<00:02:04.029> probably<00:02:04.630> because

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:04.929 
you really like it's probably because

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.660 
you really like it's probably because
there's<00:02:05.139> a<00:02:05.229> lot<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.409> overtone<00:02:06.039> content

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
there's a lot of overtone content

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.210 
there's a lot of overtone content
bringing<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.990> overtones<00:02:08.500> is<00:02:08.679> what<00:02:08.830> gives<00:02:09.039> us

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
bringing the overtones is what gives us

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.790 
bringing the overtones is what gives us
the<00:02:09.459> rich<00:02:09.729> warm<00:02:10.390> full<00:02:10.989> sound<00:02:11.349> that<00:02:11.560> we<00:02:11.680> all

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
the rich warm full sound that we all

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.070 
the rich warm full sound that we all
want<00:02:12.180> now<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.209> best<00:02:13.480> way<00:02:13.720> to<00:02:13.750> begin

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
want now the best way to begin

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.199 
want now the best way to begin
practicing<00:02:14.319> this<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:15.069> by<00:02:15.459> doing<00:02:15.520> an<00:02:15.819> exercise

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
practicing this is by doing an exercise

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.420 
practicing this is by doing an exercise
that<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.480> call<00:02:16.569> matching<00:02:17.230> how<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.250> going

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
that I call matching how this is going

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.790 
that I call matching how this is going
to<00:02:18.489> work<00:02:18.520> we're<00:02:19.330> gonna<00:02:19.420> use<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.410> b-flat

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
to work we're gonna use the b-flat

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.100 
to work we're gonna use the b-flat
overtone<00:02:21.459> series<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.330> fundamental<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.080> a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
overtone series so the fundamental is a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.650 
overtone series so the fundamental is a
low<00:02:23.319> B<00:02:23.530> flat<00:02:24.060> however<00:02:25.060> we're<00:02:25.270> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.480> begin

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
low B flat however we're going to begin

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.479 
low B flat however we're going to begin
on<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.230> octave<00:02:26.620> okay<00:02:26.890> so<00:02:26.950> we're<00:02:27.190> gonna<00:02:27.280> begin

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
on the octave okay so we're gonna begin

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.460 
on the octave okay so we're gonna begin
with<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.940> b-flat<00:02:28.330> that's<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.900> staff<00:02:29.140> for<00:02:29.440> a

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
with a b-flat that's in the staff for a

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.010 
with a b-flat that's in the staff for a
third<00:02:29.709> line<00:02:29.950> b-flat<00:02:30.510> we're<00:02:31.510> gonna<00:02:31.600> hold<00:02:31.870> this

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
third line b-flat we're gonna hold this

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.140 
third line b-flat we're gonna hold this
out<00:02:32.260> like<00:02:32.650> a<00:02:32.680> long<00:02:32.980> tone<00:02:33.250> and<00:02:33.519> we're<00:02:34.000> gonna

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
out like a long tone and we're gonna

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.030 
out like a long tone and we're gonna
alternate<00:02:34.690> beaken<00:02:35.080> between<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> regular

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
alternate beaken between the regular

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.150 
alternate beaken between the regular
b-flat<00:02:36.459> fingering<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.420> low<00:02:37.660> B<00:02:37.959> flat

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
b-flat fingering and the low B flat

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.470 
b-flat fingering and the low B flat
fundamental<00:02:39.160> but<00:02:39.730> we're<00:02:39.850> going<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.030> keep<00:02:40.269> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
fundamental but we're going to keep the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.570 
fundamental but we're going to keep the
same<00:02:40.660> pitch<00:02:40.989> level<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:42.040> whole<00:02:42.160> time<00:02:42.400> it's

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
same pitch level the whole time it's

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:51.770 
same pitch level the whole time it's
gonna<00:02:42.700> sound<00:02:42.910> like<00:02:43.060> this

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.740 

I<00:02:52.190> can<00:02:53.190> do<00:02:53.310> this<00:02:53.490> for<00:02:53.790> any<00:02:53.940> pitch<00:02:54.270> that's<00:02:54.540> found

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I can do this for any pitch that's found

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.320 
I can do this for any pitch that's found
within<00:02:54.930> that<00:02:55.140> series<00:02:55.470> here<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.250> is<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.550> F<00:02:56.790> where

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
within that series here it is on F where

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.210 
within that series here it is on F where
I'm<00:02:57.420> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> play<00:02:57.750> regular<00:02:58.170> f<00:02:58.350> matching

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
I'm going to play regular f matching

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.190 
I'm going to play regular f matching
down<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.850> low<00:03:00.060> B<00:03:00.330> flat<00:03:00.360> fingering<00:03:01.020> and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
down to the low B flat fingering and

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.680 
down to the low B flat fingering and
then<00:03:01.620> back<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.980> F<00:03:02.100> however<00:03:02.640> F<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.300> gonna<00:03:03.450> sound

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
then back to F however F is gonna sound

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:12.820 
then back to F however F is gonna sound
the<00:03:03.990> whole<00:03:04.170> time

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:22.010 

and<00:03:13.610> b-flat

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
at least your practice regimen is really

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.360 
at least your practice regimen is really
really<00:03:25.600> going<00:03:25.780> to<00:03:25.960> improve<00:03:26.320> yourself<00:03:26.830> your

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
really going to improve yourself your

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.100 
really going to improve yourself your
tone<00:03:27.580> quality<00:03:28.000> but<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> need<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.840> throw<00:03:29.020> out<00:03:29.080> a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
tone quality but I need to throw out a

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.770 
tone quality but I need to throw out a
word<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.440> caution<00:03:29.650> as<00:03:30.070> we<00:03:30.760> practice<00:03:31.210> overtones

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
word of caution as we practice overtones

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.690 
word of caution as we practice overtones
there<00:03:32.350> may<00:03:32.500> be<00:03:32.530> some<00:03:32.860> really<00:03:33.100> disgusting

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
there may be some really disgusting

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.820 
there may be some really disgusting
sounds<00:03:34.120> that<00:03:34.300> you<00:03:34.390> get<00:03:34.600> as<00:03:34.780> maybe<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.560> miss

sounds that you get as maybe you miss

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.680 
sounds that you get as maybe you miss
overtones<00:03:36.460> and<00:03:36.970> you're<00:03:37.090> kind<00:03:37.270> of<00:03:37.360> splitting

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
overtones and you're kind of splitting

overtones and you're kind of splitting
your<00:03:37.900> sound<00:03:38.110> a<00:03:38.260> little<00:03:38.470> bit<00:03:38.620> those<00:03:39.250> are<00:03:39.430> very

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610

very natural and you have to be patient
and<00:03:41.410> work<00:03:41.680> through<00:03:41.980> that<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.850> best<00:03:43.030> advice
