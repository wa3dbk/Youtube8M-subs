00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 welcome to my new column 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.700
 entirely dedicated to the tarot cards in 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.350
 especially to all but on 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.050
 modern tarot cards that are 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.460
 catching on in europe and america e 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.929
 first race in qualities that are little 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.849
 known and that I hope to make you 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.849
 to know that I collect them 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.250
 in this episode I would like to talk about the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 chef scripps a beautiful bouquet that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.090
 in my opinion currently 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 love of beauty in circulation this is 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.030
 the size of the cards are 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.010
 very soft on one side and comfortable to 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.140
 handle but on the other could 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.850
 being a little fragile therefore a use 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.640
 continuous and spasmodic of the cards 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.769
 could risk ruining that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.350
 who say silvio I am not of no 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.600
 use them but always put them away from 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.370
 almost like a box and keep them with more 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.649
 possible care so that you can 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.600
 start making the most of it 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.190
 this deck is great for those who already have 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.800
 some reading experience at 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.780
 shoulders while I don't recommend it much to 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.160
 beginners or whatever you are 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.380
 now facing the tarot world 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.979
 because the illustrations are really 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.660
 very very detailed have so many 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.920
 details which recipe the size 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.840
 reduced cards does not help 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.670
 perceive all the details until later 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.210
 an in-depth study of each 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.280
 cannes 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.800
 maybe I recommend more to those who have some 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.020
 experience or who has none and wants it 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.490
 already buy and to be able to study the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.369
 very well the same number for the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 readings be a little careful maybe 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 imparted by a traditional deck are 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.520
 from rocchi excellent for the preparation 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.270
 of the altars especially those 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.340
 spring summers for example 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.350
 used for an altar of life and me 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.030
 I am very happy 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.909
 I advise you to become familiar with 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.799
 this deck often handling it for 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.600
 daily consultations or to make us 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.679
 photos to set up altars 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.149
 in conclusion 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.039
 get familiar with the cards 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.659
 designed for an in the area choose one 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.959
 different so that it will be much more 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.090
 easy then to memorize your own thing 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.819
 appreciated of this deck are the hd 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.289
 minor have meanwhile very strong visual and 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.690
 they really leave you breathless 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.120
 suspended for their beauty are 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.829
 distinguished by colors and by lovers of 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.870
 animals and I really enjoyed the 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:19.030
 presence of them in the representation 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.340
 of the arcana the shepherds learn from one 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.200
 yellow color to an orange 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.140
 seem almost set in a 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.230
 beautiful amber sunset on the sticks 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.280
 they cost the fire element then 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.410
 it has everything that is energy 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.090
 primordial energy within 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.069
 each of us then at the base 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 of our decisions and ours 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.940
 chosen by a kind of pride 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.450
 especially within these dogs 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.819
 those safe and recurrent precisely the 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 figure of the fox in these arcana the 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.359
 fox is known has always been considered 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.209
 cunning smart almost mean 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.220
 we say that there are many superstitions 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.660
 that rotate around 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.760
 this animal that comes instead 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.100
 redeemed in this deck because it's true 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.920
 so that the smart fox of curve but it is 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.470
 even in the evil able to create find 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.360
 a harmony with one's environment e 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.490
 this denotes a great strength of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.550
 spirit that no characteristic of the 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.960
 instead the signs of fire are 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.790
 marked by the color blue and not a 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.800
 case the cups represent the signs 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.650
 water so you will find yourself in 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.990
 minor attacks on many marine figures 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.670
 sirente the tones animal sea creatures 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.520
 marine such as golden fish and 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.800
 turtles and golden fish are symbol 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.350
 auspicious and represent one 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.270
 wealth and also a freedom of 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.490
 movement that precisely symbolized 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.959
 from the book motorcycles the turtles instead 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.060
 have been considered animals for centuries 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.630
 endowed with a great strength of 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.890
 spirit of great spirituality 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.530
 feature all of them signs 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.750
 of water the swords are considered the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.670
 sign is more dangerous than the four e 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.980
 they have a purple hue inside 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.070
 this March no one is recurring five 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.780
 tenths and ravens the first could be 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.019
 a risky choice considered the 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.390
 intrinsic violence of the seed but if then 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.700
 let's go see so delicate near 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.140
 it is not true that he is sick together that 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.209
 should represent violence 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.180
 because in reality it is the symbol of 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:18.180
 grace and elegance as death wants 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.400
 destiny await us all from behind 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.260
 the balance cards are in fact in 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.410
 very little so that the dough 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.090
 budgets and in fact represents the signs 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.430
 air that are the most prepared 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.230
 to change to conflicts and to 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.180
 battles 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.430
 in fact many figures like the 75 the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.430
 knight of swords are armed with everything 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.200
 point ready for battle details 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.780
 of this brand instead can be 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.730
 considered the mythological for the numerous 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.860
 presence of dragons the other stay 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.900
 ancestral the money are placed next to 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.030
 symbol of the earth and in fact have one 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.140
 green shade and there is a very large one 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.430
 presence of trees and forests inside 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.430
 these arcana in particular can 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:01.020
 be used for set-ups 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.670
 of the altars of the people they are 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.890
 solid work with the small people 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.840
 with the fairies the thing that has me 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.150
 positively impressed with these arcana 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.890
 to the detachment from tradition the money yes 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.210
 sa are always the representation of 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.900
 financial power of possessions 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.420
 materials of the circle of money but in 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.720
 instead these arcane come off a little 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.310
 from this role of possession of power 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.470
 financial and are going to place 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.750
 within the universe of shadows 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.240
 games in the original role that is 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.640
 reflect the light of the sun 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.440
 therefore they become closed elements i 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.330
 bearers of light that seems unnatural 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.900
 in a setting that all of it 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.240
 natural 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.639
 stay instead take on a role 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.830
 brilliant good wonderful yes 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.360
 fits perfectly with the message 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:49.060
 that the author of these tarot cards then 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.130
 he wants to send with the hope of having you 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.370
 intrigued this little time in the 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.500
 comparisons of this March I invite you to 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.870
 look for other images on the internet if 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.850
 you are curious to buy it to find it 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.919
 to test it and then eventually come to 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.840
 leave a comment served for in 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.120
 gold all next month with a new one 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.199
 I don't have a bunch of modern tarot cards 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.199
 that wish you good reading
