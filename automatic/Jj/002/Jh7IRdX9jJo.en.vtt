00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.300 
original xbox controllers that were like
afterglow<00:02:00.510> style<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:01.110> had<00:02:01.560> two<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.800> those<00:02:02.040> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
afterglow style I had two of those and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.100 
afterglow style I had two of those and
then<00:02:02.400> when<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.120> 360<00:02:03.570> came<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.870> they<00:02:04.020> had

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
then when the 360 came out they had

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.110 
then when the 360 came out they had
nothing<00:02:04.200> like<00:02:04.470> that<00:02:04.650> for<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> while<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.880> these

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
nothing like that for a while and these

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.700 
nothing like that for a while and these
came<00:02:06.330> out<00:02:06.420> i'm<00:02:06.600> pretty<00:02:06.780> sure<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.530> like

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
came out i'm pretty sure it's like

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.649 
came out i'm pretty sure it's like
really<00:02:08.069> these<00:02:08.369> afterglow<00:02:09.209> controllers<00:02:09.569> are

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
really these afterglow controllers are

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:11.390 
really these afterglow controllers are
just<00:02:09.810> as<00:02:09.929> expensive<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.500> has<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.860> gamestop

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
just as expensive it has like gamestop

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.330 
just as expensive it has like gamestop
brands<00:02:11.909> so<00:02:12.780> i<00:02:12.810> wouldn't<00:02:13.590> know<00:02:13.620> why<00:02:13.860> not<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.220> buy

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
brands so i wouldn't know why not to buy

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.610 
brands so i wouldn't know why not to buy
these<00:02:14.989> getting<00:02:15.989> in<00:02:16.080> my<00:02:16.170> hands<00:02:16.349> for<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.560> first

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
these getting in my hands for the first

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.250 
these getting in my hands for the first
time<00:02:17.040> here<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:18.390> doesn't<00:02:18.659> feel<00:02:18.750> bad<00:02:18.900> I<00:02:19.080> mean

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
time here just doesn't feel bad I mean

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.740 
time here just doesn't feel bad I mean
compared<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:20.060> regular<00:02:21.060> controller<00:02:21.540> which

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
compared to the regular controller which

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.990 
compared to the regular controller which
I'll<00:02:21.900> bring<00:02:22.050> up<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.350> second<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.790> feels

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
everything is obviously the start and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.680 
everything is obviously the start and
select<00:02:42.980> buttons<00:02:43.490> are<00:02:43.640> it<00:02:43.880> slightly<00:02:44.390> different

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
select buttons are it slightly different

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.030 
select buttons are it slightly different
place<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:44.990> they<00:02:45.080> would<00:02:45.230> normally<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.770> but

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
place and they would normally be but

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.360 
place and they would normally be but
still<00:02:46.700> feels<00:02:46.970> pretty<00:02:47.150> good<00:02:48.070> alright<00:02:49.070> let's

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
still feels pretty good alright let's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.340 
still feels pretty good alright let's
see<00:02:49.550> if<00:02:49.640> we<00:02:49.760> can<00:02:49.940> get<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.330> out<00:02:50.540> of<00:02:50.570> here<00:02:50.690> I'll

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
see if we can get this out of here I'll

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.840 
see if we can get this out of here I'll
bet<00:02:51.530> it's<00:02:51.680> already<00:02:51.950> ripped<00:02:52.280> on<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.520> inside

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
bet it's already ripped on the inside

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.080 
bet it's already ripped on the inside
that's<00:02:53.000> always<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.360> good<00:02:53.840> omen<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:55.340> yeah<00:02:55.790> like

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
that's always a good omen but yeah like

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.700 
that's always a good omen but yeah like
I<00:02:56.180> said<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.420> can<00:02:56.450> order<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:56.810> off<00:02:56.960> amazon<00:02:57.470> I

depends where you live right see the
inside<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.360> control<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:05.720> kind<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.870> nice

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020 
inside the control it's kind of nice

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.830 
inside the control it's kind of nice
seeing<00:03:06.290> the<00:03:06.350> inside<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.590> controller<00:03:06.980> I<00:03:07.840> feel

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
seeing the inside of controller I feel

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.910 
seeing the inside of controller I feel
like<00:03:08.930> it<00:03:09.020> the<00:03:09.110> less<00:03:09.260> chance<00:03:09.290> of<00:03:09.530> getting<00:03:09.740> dirty

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
like it the less chance of getting dirty

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.830 
like it the less chance of getting dirty
if<00:03:10.070> you're<00:03:10.190> someone<00:03:10.430> who<00:03:10.580> gets<00:03:11.360> controllers

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
if you're someone who gets controllers

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.450 
if you're someone who gets controllers
dirty<00:03:12.050> like<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.320> white<00:03:12.530> xbox<00:03:12.710> controller<00:03:13.280> and

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:13.460 
dirty like the white xbox controller and

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:15.730 
dirty like the white xbox controller and
you<00:03:13.550> like<00:03:13.730> get<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.030> dirty<00:03:14.180> somehow<00:03:14.740> there's

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
you like get it dirty somehow there's

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.370 
you like get it dirty somehow there's
the<00:03:15.980> instruction<00:03:16.910> manual<00:03:16.940> which<00:03:17.900> no<00:03:18.140> one<00:03:18.170> ever

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
the instruction manual which no one ever

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.860 
the instruction manual which no one ever
reads<00:03:18.590> anymore<00:03:19.060> can't<00:03:20.060> blame<00:03:20.210> them<00:03:20.390> but<00:03:20.570> i

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
reads anymore can't blame them but i

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.050 
reads anymore can't blame them but i
guess<00:03:21.260> if<00:03:21.350> ever<00:03:21.500> needed<00:03:21.680> something<00:03:22.130> yeah<00:03:22.790> plug

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
guess if ever needed something yeah plug

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.020 
guess if ever needed something yeah plug
into<00:03:23.210> your<00:03:23.300> xbox<00:03:23.630> 360<00:03:24.290> and<00:03:24.590> it<00:03:25.430> glows<00:03:25.670> like

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
into your xbox 360 and it glows like

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.720 
into your xbox 360 and it glows like
magic<00:03:26.600> I<00:03:26.690> think<00:03:26.930> that's<00:03:27.050> all<00:03:27.140> there<00:03:27.290> is<00:03:27.320> to<00:03:27.380> it

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
magic I think that's all there is to it

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.770 
magic I think that's all there is to it
hmm<00:03:28.730> looks<00:03:28.970> like<00:03:29.030> there's<00:03:29.240> some<00:03:29.300> options

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
hmm looks like there's some options

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.460 
hmm looks like there's some options
actually<00:03:29.990> did<00:03:30.380> maybe<00:03:30.860> turn<00:03:31.070> it<00:03:31.220> on<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.430> off<00:03:31.550> I

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
actually did maybe turn it on and off I

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.270 
actually did maybe turn it on and off I
guess<00:03:33.470> I'll<00:03:33.560> find<00:03:33.590> out<00:03:33.800> by<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:33.950> end<00:03:34.070> of<00:03:34.190> this

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
you can tell the star buttons are a

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:18.489
