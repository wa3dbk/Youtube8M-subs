00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
basically what the program does is your

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.610 
basically what the program does is your
computer<00:01:58.610> runs<00:01:59.150> lots<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.200> things<00:02:00.260> in<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
computer runs lots of things in the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.180 
computer runs lots of things in the
background<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.160> don't<00:02:01.460> know<00:02:01.610> about<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:03.190> this

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
background you don't know about and this

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.540 
background you don't know about and this
basically<00:02:04.580> just<00:02:05.090> keeps<00:02:05.420> everything<00:02:05.690> in<00:02:06.050> order

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
basically just keeps everything in order

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.780 
basically just keeps everything in order
so<00:02:07.550> if<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:07.760> keep<00:02:07.910> saying<00:02:08.090> basically<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.690> lot<00:02:09.790> so

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
so if I keep saying basically a lot so

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
and then advanced and now this is

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.400 
and then advanced and now this is
basically<00:04:01.480> if<00:04:01.660> you<00:04:01.780> want<00:04:01.930> to<00:04:02.020> use<00:04:02.140> hotkeys

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
basically if you want to use hotkeys

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.470 
basically if you want to use hotkeys
like<00:04:02.950> if<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.640> want<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.880> use<00:04:03.970> keys<00:04:04.240> on<00:04:04.390> your

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
like if you want to use keys on your

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.300 
like if you want to use keys on your
keyboard<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:05.080> make<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.800> come<00:04:05.950> into<00:04:06.100> gaming

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
keyboard to make it come into gaming

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.790 
keyboard to make it come into gaming
mode<00:04:06.610> rather<00:04:06.820> than<00:04:07.060> opening<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.080> program<00:04:08.560> and

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
mode rather than opening the program and

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.740 
mode rather than opening the program and
clicking<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.790> through<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.120> way<00:04:10.270> so<00:04:10.690> you

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
clicking it through that way so you

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.510 
clicking it through that way so you
still<00:04:10.870> need<00:04:11.110> the<00:04:11.260> program<00:04:11.560> running<00:04:11.770> but<00:04:12.430> you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
still need the program running but you

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.890 
still need the program running but you
can<00:04:12.700> just<00:04:12.730> exit<00:04:13.630> in<00:04:15.420> enter<00:04:16.420> gaming<00:04:16.750> mode
