it we can also use any type of Buu
because<00:01:32.400> every<00:01:32.939> Buu<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.329> there<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.900> him

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
because every Buu in there was him

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.569 
because every Buu in there was him
basically<00:01:34.409> getting<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:34.920> power<00:01:35.189> whether<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
basically getting more power whether it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.190 
basically getting more power whether it
be<00:01:35.670> absorbing<00:01:36.150> people<00:01:36.450> whatever<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
be absorbing people whatever so if you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.740 
be absorbing people whatever so if you
even<00:01:37.439> want<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.770> boo<00:01:38.250> with<00:01:38.759> piccolo<00:01:39.509> and
