00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
have to try to get on the ball in this

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
have to try to get on the ball in this

all this time it's kind of seemed like

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.850 
all this time it's kind of seemed like
Indians<00:02:32.040> stuck<00:02:32.310> by<00:02:32.490> China's<00:02:32.970> side<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:34.080> we'll

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
Indians stuck by China's side but we'll

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.130
