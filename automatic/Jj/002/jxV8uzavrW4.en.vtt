00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello, it 's the sandra finzel 

00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:06.629
 holistic horses health experts 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.680
 and trainer of the horses inside.com and 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.559
 I would like to join one today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.110
 ask from one of our youtube channels 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.870
 employ subscribers and that of the 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.060
 rursee the rosi asks if it makes sense 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.300
 in half so for chains or in general 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.289
 keep chains and if so 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.580
 Why 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.580
 or if not why not 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.960
 background is andy roach receiver 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.860
 a bit fierce is on the 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.300
 lead paddock 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.540
 and what I do then more often 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.180
 trying to break loose and make trouble 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.970
 yes, most people use it over 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.750
 the chains or some use too 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.580
 border 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.070
 I would not use both because 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.900
 If I recommend a limit lead and 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.790
 then you have to tear it in constantly 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.010
 it even stays here then yes takes 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.910
 just the mouth big hurt and that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.800
 of course, mouth is a whole 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.990
 sensitive area and me personally 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.060
 try my horses really fine and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.850
 sensitive and therefore would 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.580
 I never take a break so to speak 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.690
 punish or cause disobedience 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.550
 use horses 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.460
 Personally, I would not care for either 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:24.100
 use chain I have now stop 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.869
 prepared for a chain just like you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.670
 Usually these are snowed for chain 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.680
 as a man for practically her the chain 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.780
 then swing around two times three times 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.910
 just take this nasal strap from the halter 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.160
 and then you usually hang it here 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.960
 on the other side in the round ring 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.340
 on 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.960
 Of course you can also chain directly 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.360
 go through here without you now 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.700
 great here these deviations 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.020
 Power is background when you pull the chain 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.030
 just just without 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.710
 cleanseings then it is 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.570
 therefore much sharper for the horse 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 So you really have the chain 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.369
 right on the relatively fine 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.650
 nasal skin and, of course, that is the 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.970
 very very sharp and intense 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.710
 I would not personally now 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.500
 definitely recommend it so if i have it 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.600
 as previously wrapped just so 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.130
 used but I just use this 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.959
 skills no longer because of the big one 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.700
 disadvantage is if I really now the 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.709
 have to say clearly horse okay 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 then stay with me and me 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.610
 yes that may be 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.070
 just possible if you have the horse 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 trying to break free or something like that 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.430
 puts me in danger yes then pulls 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.010
 So here as you can see 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.299
 the chain together but the problems 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.040
 At the moment where the horse is right 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.209
 reacts and then is quiet again and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.160
 just not trying anymore 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.440
 I can not give way 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.630
 and quite an important principle in the 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.760
 So horse training is also possible 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.760
 ever make a pulse and you 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.750
 Of course , you also have to have signals so you can 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.610
 with the horse, too 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.800
 communicate by just signaling 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.320
 yes, but if you give a signal 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.970
 has and the horse reacts correctly so 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.590
 in that case if not in a small jerk 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.240
 have done and the horse is to 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.460
 example then stopped and yes 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.200
 did not run away then I would have to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.510
 actually immediately give in to this pressure 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.880
 you have to say the chain loser 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.170
 and in the end so yes this would have 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:12.140
 chain immediately without pressure on 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.120
 nosebone, so to speak, have just lie 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.830
 the problem is just when we are here 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.900
 A jerk do it together 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.420
 I have to stay that way all the time 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.700
 solve the chain so to speak so that 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.870
 they're running out of steam for that 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:29.390
 I absolutely not recommended as 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:31.130
 training equipment because you 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.830
 just too slow with that 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.410
 Immediate yielding help me 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.640
 personally use 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.010
 I have another video too 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.200
 already explained why and what big ones 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.200
 Benefits of simply having dollars is that 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.280
 I've had my favorite now 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.330
 I have been using it for a long time 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.709
 scary happy 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.350
 and it's really suitable now 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.150
 in addition to that, if you really want that 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:55.070
 it has to pay attention and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.870
 listen or just no nonsense and 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.400
 have really relax 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.890
 but the advantage is making the 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.770
 return and can follow up immediately so 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.750
 that will be very fast and can be just like that 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.330
 really a fine communication 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.489
 promote with the horse because you just the 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.070
 signal he gives the horse responds 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.830
 positive and you can immediately pressure 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.380
 give in to knit loose yes and 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:20.900
 that would immediately feedback the okay 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.850
 was the right thing you did and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.350
 the signal has been accepted and that 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.530
 Horse has learned if I correct 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.270
 React the pressure goes away immediately so 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.280
 That's what's important, I hope 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.139
 the video did you like if so 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.469
 I'm happy about it 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.550
 So I like comments and also 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.310
 maybe one or the other 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.080
 shared content necessarily subscribed 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.249
 Also you could use our youtube channel 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.840
 also times a question 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.759
 I always try to do it in the long term 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.110
 not everything is always answered 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.759
 immediately because we ask a lot 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.099
 but I'm happy about yours 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.509
 ask the comments and I am also very 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:54.199
 happy if next time again 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.939
 his 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.939
 see you soon your sandra
