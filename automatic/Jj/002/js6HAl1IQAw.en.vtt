00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.770 
remember it was a while ago so I don't
remember<00:04:07.170> all<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:08.210> questions<00:04:09.210> they<00:04:09.330> asked

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
remember all the questions they asked

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
remember all the questions they asked
but<00:04:09.930> I<00:04:10.380> just<00:04:10.650> remember<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.640> were<00:04:11.790> it

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
but I just remember that they were it

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.320 
but I just remember that they were it
was<00:04:12.090> very<00:04:12.270> short<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.840> they<00:04:13.200> weren't<00:04:13.470> very

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
was very short and they weren't very

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.520 
was very short and they weren't very
picky<00:04:15.330> I<00:04:15.420> think<00:04:15.630> they<00:04:15.720> really<00:04:15.960> needed<00:04:16.170> someone

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
picky I think they really needed someone

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.659 
picky I think they really needed someone
at<00:04:16.650> the<00:04:16.769> time<00:04:16.980> so<00:04:18.830> what<00:04:19.830> set<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.190> apart<00:04:20.520> from

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
at the time so what set you apart from

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.050 
at the time so what set you apart from
other<00:04:20.910> candidates<00:04:22.460> well<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.490> think<00:04:23.610> through

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
other candidates well I think through

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.300 
other candidates well I think through
one<00:04:24.330> NIDA<00:04:24.720> interest<00:04:25.410> in<00:04:25.560> pharmacy<00:04:26.040> I<00:04:26.070> was

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
one NIDA interest in pharmacy I was

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.430 
one NIDA interest in pharmacy I was
going<00:04:26.460> to<00:04:26.550> school<00:04:26.730> to<00:04:26.790> be<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> pharmacist<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:28.080> I

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
going to school to be a pharmacist so I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.900 
going to school to be a pharmacist so I
think<00:04:28.740> they<00:04:28.890> really<00:04:29.160> liked<00:04:29.370> that<00:04:29.400> you<00:04:29.760> know<00:04:29.880> I

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
think they really liked that you know I

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.580 
think they really liked that you know I
was<00:04:30.060> they're<00:04:30.180> interested<00:04:30.780> in<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.080> job<00:04:31.290> I

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
was they're interested in the job I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:36.650 
was they're interested in the job I
think<00:04:32.160> also<00:04:33.050> having<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.740> good<00:04:35.490> prior<00:04:36.360> working

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
think also having a good prior working

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.470 
think also having a good prior working
experience<00:04:36.810> like<00:04:37.560> they<00:04:38.070> didn't<00:04:38.430> I<00:04:39.030> didn't

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
experience like they didn't I didn't

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.960 
experience like they didn't I didn't
really<00:04:39.660> have<00:04:39.810> any<00:04:40.020> times<00:04:40.770> where<00:04:41.040> like<00:04:41.220> I<00:04:41.490> was

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
really have any times where like I was

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.820 
really have any times where like I was
fired<00:04:42.210> from<00:04:42.390> any<00:04:42.690> job<00:04:42.930> or<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.290> didn't<00:04:43.560> have<00:04:43.650> any

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
fired from any job or I didn't have any

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.159 
fired from any job or I didn't have any
blemishes<00:04:44.400> on<00:04:44.910> my<00:04:44.940> work<00:04:45.180> record<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.080> think

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
blemishes on my work record so I think

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:47.900 
blemishes on my work record so I think
they<00:04:46.680> wanted<00:04:47.010> they<00:04:47.100> needed<00:04:47.400> someone<00:04:47.610> that<00:04:47.700> was

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
they wanted they needed someone that was

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.630 
they wanted they needed someone that was
reliable<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.810> had<00:04:49.770> good<00:04:50.010> references

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
reliable and had good references

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.540 
reliable and had good references
so<00:04:51.030> yeah<00:04:51.660> what<00:04:52.590> other<00:04:52.770> advice<00:04:53.190> would<00:04:53.400> you<00:04:53.460> give
