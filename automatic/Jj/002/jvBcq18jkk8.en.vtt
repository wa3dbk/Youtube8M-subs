00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:59.560 

you<00:00:49.880> hit<00:00:50.030> a<00:00:50.060> tree

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.020 

oh<00:00:59.600> there<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:00.500> is

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.890 

oh<00:01:05.299> here<00:01:06.299> we<00:01:06.330> go

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
oh here we go

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
oh here we go
no<00:01:07.680> harm<00:01:07.979> done<00:01:08.040> looks<00:01:08.850> great<00:01:09.150> let's<00:01:09.330> do<00:01:09.600> it

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
no harm done looks great let's do it

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.070 
no harm done looks great let's do it
again<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:10.159> did<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> bunch<00:01:11.670> of<00:01:11.759> rolls<00:01:12.090> yeah<00:01:13.020> you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
again I did do a bunch of rolls yeah you

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:27.810 
again I did do a bunch of rolls yeah you
did<00:01:13.290> some<00:01:13.440> aerobatic<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.400> cool

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.640 

it<00:01:28.820> flies<00:01:29.060> very<00:01:29.240> well<00:01:29.480> for<00:01:29.780> what<00:01:29.870> it<00:01:29.990> is<00:01:30.020> it's

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
it flies very well for what it is it's

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.200 
it flies very well for what it is it's
not<00:01:30.740> the<00:01:30.860> most<00:01:31.100> efficient<00:01:31.550> glider<00:01:31.730> but<00:01:32.060> it's

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
not the most efficient glider but it's

00:01:32.210 --> 00:02:33.420 
not the most efficient glider but it's
certainly<00:01:32.510> capable<00:01:32.690> some<00:01:33.200> nice<00:01:33.350> long<00:01:33.620> flights

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:03:32.410 

perfect

here<00:04:16.019> are<00:04:16.139> the<00:04:16.230> measurements<00:04:16.709> if<00:04:16.799> you're

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
here are the measurements if you're

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.819 
here are the measurements if you're
interested<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.400> building<00:04:17.579> your<00:04:17.760> own

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
interested in building your own

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.509 
interested in building your own
thanks<00:04:20.549> for<00:04:20.669> watching<00:04:21.090> bye
