00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.360
 so I exist 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.550
 with these famous words, the french philosopher bernard officially asserted himself 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.809
 down like this professional 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.769
 the tricks and we don't go ice in one night and the butcher one more 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:13.689
 night out 

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:15.879
 about four hundred years after the go-kart 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.609
 scientists can have a look into the brain 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.340
 and they discover that our rational choices are sad 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.759
 the ecological way in which they already choose 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.029
 have been the days of a 36 server 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.490
 this is making a decision 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.690
 how is it possible to consciously make rational choices 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's just way too complicated 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.060
 processed per second arose at 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.520
 take half a million times more information than consciously 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.210
 our minds only come to know when all decisions have already been made 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.999
 neuroscientist victor lamme 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.419
 plays in the brain for years but how and why of our choices 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.510
 he prefers to talk about people like us to 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.620
 and as reasoning and arguing the woman was dressed up in infrabel box 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.760
 this involves a structured approach 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.540
 we did not think that things would arrive seven hours a week 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.640
 and the motivational rational motivation skewed as today 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 yes, what the language is not the way it is 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.820
 therefore a bit differentiating you in a different way 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.400
 of course that comes talking but it also comes to expand 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.200
 the first thing i'm trying to do there is that it is not a good representation of 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.240
 all things that determine why I do things change why there we know that 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.060
 we don't like the records 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.680
 that talking thing in my head that is severely disturbed commentator on the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.880
 grandstand that is actually the most important point 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.320
 6 benefits in a fraction of a second are guided by our fear 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 a legal opinion in our brain even before they know about it 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 now we are responsible for our decision 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.740
 yes almost then you are doing your own site 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.590
 you are answer flop last year there were then on other working days 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.750
 answer what you are doing 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.610
 this what you can say 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.750
 First of all, don't put too much value on what people say about it 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.490
 why they do things
