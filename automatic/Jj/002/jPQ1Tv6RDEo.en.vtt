blazer
um<00:03:25.340> I<00:03:26.090> think<00:03:26.690> it<00:03:26.780> almost<00:03:27.140> works<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
um I think it almost works because the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.610 
um I think it almost works because the
shorts<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:30.049> black<00:03:31.030> so<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.420> think<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.440> can<00:03:33.530> get

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
shorts are black so I think you can get

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.750 
shorts are black so I think you can get
