00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:08.429
 hey people here and i think i had 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.960
 just a good idea but it could also be one 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.340
 That's why I thought 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.360
 I just make comments and 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.790
 ask your advice 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 it's about controller sizes there are yes 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.570
 always just a controller an xbox 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.460
 360 controller and a ps3 controller 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.300
 and the next generation will 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.099
 be the same 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.630
 and I just thought of the ps3 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.189
 yes, many of the controllers say a lot 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.140
 too small and fragile i have 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.699
 played ps3 for years and I thought 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 not really, but since then 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.090
 now i can play xbox player 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.580
 Do not touch the ps3 controller anymore 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.140
 that really a lot smaller and it 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.390
 really a bit flexible components 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.040
 for xbox 360 controller is easy 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.410
 bigger and more stable and that feels 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.360
 just better on the hands and sooner 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.610
 I had mine in the ps3 or 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.570
 ps2 controller thought so I can 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.920
 just do not play 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.050
 I was still small and turn 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.790
 played and louder as polished are the 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 were still all 2d games with two 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.660
 level and then bugs bunny came 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920
 That was one of the first 3D games 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.390
 I played that and I did 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.280
 just could not do with my thumbs 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 to a 5 ticks come to the sticks 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 but could not come I had to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.929
 move with these directional keys 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.030
 I liked that but if I did 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.829
 that would have come to the sticks 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 everything went a lot easier and 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.039
 I has to be done has 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.630
 really liked and the time 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.609
 In between, that hurt really 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 because I have so brutally tried to 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:20.639
 controllers together to squeeze that 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.439
 I'm just getting there 

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:24.630
 So it will be the kids in any case 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 be better if it's just smaller 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.659
 controller would go and as well 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.609
 I would not say that now I'm off 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.679
 normal big dealers around what's up with the 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.409
 The really big merchants are the ones who do it 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.819
 really big male banks have something 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.350
 do that then that must be extreme 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:38.999
 to be unhealthy with that too 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.170
 play and then if you play a lot 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:40.829
 that can be really bad for 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.299
 the hands are 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.219
 I just think what if it is 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.719
 Give controllers in different sizes 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.039
 if there was a small playstation 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.869
 controller would go one 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.939
 medium sized and big that already exactly 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.009
 just have different sizes 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.329
 that would be extremely cool just come 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.100
 then some problems on 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.569
 for example, in competitive gaming 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.740
 or generally online if you have it 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:00.779
 wants to take a bit more serious 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.130
 then come the whole pro player and 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.749
 then play with this mini controller 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.969
 only that they can trigger faster 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.770
 just for example with the fvl from 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.450
 black ops 2 to shoot faster 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.009
 That can then be quite accident 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.870
 but otherwise nothing strikes me 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.920
 and I do not understand why that 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.540
 I'm not sure that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.440
 the first one that has a field of 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.570
 probably already tuned 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.340
 Eight and both companies have to be both sony 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.930
 as well as microsoft any point 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.730
 be retracted why the on 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.350
 could not make a case, it could be he 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.640
 It is only in production 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.320
 that it may be a bit too expensive 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
 I think that would be but not me 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.770
 Of course I do not know that well 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.750
 if any of you know about it 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.950
 or any idea would have why 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.420
 can not work write me 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.490
 that necessarily in the comments 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.990
 think about it and when he says 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.370
 it works and that would be great 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.810
 they also write that in me 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.160
 comments i hope i have the video 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.960
 fell and I wanted to say a few words 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 now get out cool kids games 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.040
 For example, this infiniti is like that 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.170
 littlebigplanet just with the disney 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.010
 Figures and the 3d must necessarily 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.300
 let's see 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.590
 even if it is most of us 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.120
 probably will not play 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.950
 It's nice to see that again 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.630
 a good kids games comes out because 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.490
 we noticed what happens when 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.230
 growing up with this shooter 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.850
 there are quite strange creatures 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.290
 but that is a completely different topic 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.090
 I hope I liked the video 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.380
 if you liked it and the degut 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.180
 then finds my thumb up 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.190
 maybe recommend it to your friends 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.690
 I'll continue that for the first time 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.130
 say three people and we are 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.130
 Definitely in the next video
