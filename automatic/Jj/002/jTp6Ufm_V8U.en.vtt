00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.170
 but we had said in the previous one a cobresol that his defense 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.710
 that has a good technician who has experienced people in the field of 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.169
 mouth court after 

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:12.799
 made debut to the arquero admitted that the play perhaps was the controversy of 0 45 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.069
 to the goal of luis romero 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.720
 before him he is not in the advanced position 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.029
 tasir and cut of lines and tricia stage 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.499
 patricia pérez never raises the philosophical flag to run for the royal jaén 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.099
 I want to return 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.599
 miami flo zelmira achieving the goal 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.589
 so it ended maybe 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.659
 image of the prisoners 45 minutes to the second time after rekindling in the 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.650
 second time 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 it appears everything was that had entered accompanied to fibula 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.760
 but the mouth and I finished a bit tacky the archer recovers 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.760
 sitel expulsion one of the virtues 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 first red card unaccustomed value the change fleitas 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.130
 sorry I had change coast for yesterday to make a change for this one 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.690
 finish with red card and cear 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 the cost plans 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.710
 despite the best of the night I think 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.740
 a good center 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.910
 by the band ended up taking the lead without better save from the goalkeeper albil 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.760
 there the repetition the previous one repeats 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.580
 and buccal for the archer and it is very clear that he eats it fleitas 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.900
 and that too 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.270
 latino velar that is pulled 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.720
 over the heart man 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 that was the other fusion also in that play 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.150
 debuted today in the championship 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.670
 he had a very good performance he responded fundamentally in the second half in 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.500
 the one who has developed the sun in his bow 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.450
 10 Dec 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.560
 comparsa like humberto arbulú 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.789
 a ccm no 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.229
 after making his debut in the championship against a rival as a Lima alliance and 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.300
 university and November 2 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.530
 perera can be figured 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.730
 sheen has taken away nor does it get a little complicated said 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 I had to go back then personal problems in late all 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.280
 and got them to just delay and let you go 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.490
 and well we must get a good result 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.310
 I know there's pressure that he 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.249
 fair 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:09.799
 I believe that simón match 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:11.119
 and simon match 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:15.559
 of alliance on their court I commented my person said we dealt with handles the 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.309
 ball 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.309
 the best possible treated to have options but good d 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:23.779
 he got tired the team ran a lot put a lot of the heavy court and the truth to a 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.779
 win a remarkable draw with us víctor accept it 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.449
 and it is here 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:34.529
 it was after librarian wolf stitches the court but quiet the 

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.749
 protocol was where mates because with nine 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.299
 created more occasions than they were sincere until the end and observes the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.569
 tie in a signature the tie is made what the equator does not accept suddenly so 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.399
 dare they will not be able to see what they are looking for 

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:52.149
 the tip is maintained sometimes this type of matches is better to tie it than 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:53.099
 let's waste time 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.499
 can you say other sectors 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:58.900
 two weeks ago the batán although the most important but rescued reactors 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.569
 atomic bayer of the entire upper cycle 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.479
 busts to the full 

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:07.139
 they spent the rest playing in Lima alliance for this side said Gaddafi 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.939
 shipping ordered 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:10.550
 well maybe what happened all 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.699
 the match 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:12.809
 of shame 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.890
 but that's just not for now I'm just going to tell you more about that 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.879
 shortly after the party ended up distorting 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:20.529
 of clan 12 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:24.479
 because listening for them because why not just from a goal to us 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.849
 now one of the canceled 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.159
 as I say he 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:31.159
 efe in the goal and the referee 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.379
 then he approached the athletes of the mules or in my neighborhood that happens 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:38.789
 why be strengthened terrible 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.519
 shock thanks 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.900
 now but in reality I think the two defendants were badly expelled from 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.669
 council 

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:49.829
 because if expelled by alliance for the goal that had annulled actors or 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:50.789
 Business 

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:54.509
 the pp you want and ketamine a law of compensation for the goal nullified to 

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:57.639
 it seems to me that the defendants were miniaturized more quiet 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.459
 under a disputed play of the poorly annulled muse goal some are 300 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.779
 not only in the play of the canceled goal is what happens next 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:08.009
 aquila n 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:10.559
 the interference miss assistant 

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:14.979
 percent on mars was scoring the goal the referee scores the goal and then 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.680
 despite starting from the claims are underway ongoing appointment 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.720
 the stumble back and the seat empty but does not raise the flag in any 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.140
 moment touched me from the center of the field good the numbers of the match pal 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.599
 the opposition statistics 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.770
 the statistics of the party arrive funny 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.039
 support for 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.039
 best ingredients best pitching 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.210
 the numbers of the four direct match for leanza uno for cobresol 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.070
 5 diverted by alliance 7 for cobresol 17 fouls alliance 12 cobresol one 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.670
 yellow in alliance five red waldo goals to ask olympics and the 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.319
 Argentine alliance 

00:04:55.319 --> 00:05:00.169
 11 corner kicks an offside had it more alliance fundamentally by 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.169
 what he did from the second half but the match 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.689
 coulis in the minute bag 623 minute for leanza has not added yet 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:13.120
 cobresol despite having in the bank there expand the sources the son 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.729
 different
