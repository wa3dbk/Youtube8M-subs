00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.980 
finally coming to call of duty and last
we<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.040> reflex<00:01:44.579> which<00:01:44.790> helps<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.360> swap

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
we have reflex which helps you swap

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.859 
we have reflex which helps you swap
weapons<00:01:46.799> faster<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.700> think<00:01:47.909> there<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.119> pro

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
weapons faster and I think there was pro

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.450 
weapons faster and I think there was pro
perk<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.350> think<00:01:49.710> lightweight<00:01:50.159> pro<00:01:50.310> or

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
perk I think lightweight pro or

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
perk I think lightweight pro or
something<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.880> allowed<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.840> to<00:01:51.960> swap

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
something like that allowed you to swap

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200 
something like that allowed you to swap
weapons<00:01:52.590> faster<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.100> modern<00:01:53.399> warfare<00:01:53.549> 2<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.090> it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
weapons faster on modern warfare 2 so it

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.510 
weapons faster on modern warfare 2 so it
doesn't<00:01:54.450> make<00:01:54.540> any<00:01:54.869> surprises<00:01:55.680> for<00:01:55.920> me<00:01:55.979> then

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
doesn't make any surprises for me then

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.010 
doesn't make any surprises for me then
we're<00:01:56.640> seeing<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> park<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.600> call<00:01:57.990> of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
we're seeing a park like this in call of

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.350 
we're seeing a park like this in call of
duty<00:01:58.140> ghosts<00:01:58.560> stealth<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> next<00:01:59.880> subset

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
duty ghosts stealth is the next subset

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.330 
duty ghosts stealth is the next subset
and<00:02:00.540> includes<00:02:00.990> blind<00:02:01.320> eye<00:02:01.560> dead<00:02:01.860> silence

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
and includes blind eye dead silence

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.200 
and includes blind eye dead silence
cold-blooded<00:02:03.180> takedown<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.810> off<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.649> grid

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
cold-blooded takedown and off the grid

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
cold-blooded takedown and off the grid
takedown<00:02:06.210> allows<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> kill<00:02:07.110> enemies

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
takedown allows you to kill enemies

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.650 
takedown allows you to kill enemies
without<00:02:07.740> revealing<00:02:08.520> their<00:02:08.819> death<00:02:09.030> location

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
without revealing their death location

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.880 
without revealing their death location
so<00:02:09.810> this<00:02:09.959> means<00:02:10.140> when<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.410> kill<00:02:10.619> an<00:02:10.739> enemy

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
so this means when you kill an enemy

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.460 
so this means when you kill an enemy
their<00:02:11.430> skull<00:02:11.879> will<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.330> pop<00:02:12.629> up<00:02:12.900> for

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
their skull will not pop up for

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.770 
their skull will not pop up for
or<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.680> enemy<00:02:14.100> team<00:02:14.370> okay<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.540> kill

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
or the enemy team okay so you kill

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.450 
or the enemy team okay so you kill
someone<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> skull<00:02:16.560> pops<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:17.040> normally<00:02:17.400> you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
someone the skull pops up normally you

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.710 
someone the skull pops up normally you
can<00:02:17.580> look<00:02:17.610> that<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.060> be<00:02:18.120> like<00:02:18.240> hey<00:02:18.420> there's<00:02:18.630> an

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
can look that and be like hey there's an

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.660 
can look that and be like hey there's an
enemy<00:02:18.960> over<00:02:19.140> there<00:02:19.290> that<00:02:19.770> will<00:02:19.950> not<00:02:20.190> pop<00:02:20.460> up

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
enemy over there that will not pop up

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.430 
enemy over there that will not pop up
for<00:02:20.820> them<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.120> they<00:02:21.240> will<00:02:21.390> not<00:02:21.420> know<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.960> are

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
for them and they will not know you are

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.800 
for them and they will not know you are
over<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.490> next<00:02:23.820> new<00:02:23.940> perk<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.330> off<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
over there the next new perk is off the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.590 
over there the next new perk is off the
grid<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.440> makes<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:26.030> undetectable<00:02:27.030> by

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
grid and it makes you undetectable by

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.350 
grid and it makes you undetectable by
SATCOM<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:28.710> motion<00:02:29.430> sensors<00:02:29.610> so<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.000> means

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
SATCOM and motion sensors so that means

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.630 
SATCOM and motion sensors so that means
UAV<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.230> things<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.620> will<00:02:31.980> not<00:02:32.280> pick

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
UAV and things like that will not pick

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.630 
UAV and things like that will not pick

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
that sounds like a really cool part for

that sounds like a really cool part for
team<00:02:51.690> game<00:02:51.900> modes<00:02:52.170> but<00:02:52.350> i<00:02:52.440> wonder<00:02:52.590> how<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.830> work

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
team game modes but i wonder how to work

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.580 
team game modes but i wonder how to work
in<00:02:53.190> free-for-all<00:02:53.700> just<00:02:54.360> just<00:02:54.690> wondering<00:02:55.140> you

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
what you think will that work and

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
what you think will that work and
free-for-all<00:02:59.520> how<00:02:59.610> will<00:02:59.730> that<00:02:59.820> work<00:02:59.880> and<00:03:00.180> the

free-for-all how will that work and the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.810 
free-for-all how will that work and the
next<00:03:01.020> part<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:01.440> new<00:03:01.590> is<00:03:01.709> wiretap<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:02.640> we

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
next part that's new is wiretap but we

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.640 
next part that's new is wiretap but we
do<00:03:03.030> not<00:03:03.240> know<00:03:03.300> what<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.020> do<00:03:04.230> at<00:03:04.410> this<00:03:04.590> time

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
do not know what it will do at this time

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.710 
do not know what it will do at this time
I'm<00:03:05.430> speculating<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.270> I<00:03:06.330> think<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.570> would<00:03:06.690> be

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
I'm speculating and I think it would be

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.420 
I'm speculating and I think it would be
really<00:03:07.050> cool<00:03:07.170> if<00:03:07.410> we<00:03:07.620> could<00:03:07.800> listen<00:03:08.010> in<00:03:08.280> on

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
really cool if we could listen in on

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.210 
really cool if we could listen in on
enemy<00:03:08.850> team<00:03:09.060> communications<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.650> a<00:03:10.950> lot<00:03:11.190> of

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
enemy team communications but a lot of

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.280 
enemy team communications but a lot of
people<00:03:11.670> don't<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.270> know<00:03:12.300> communicate<00:03:13.020> in<00:03:13.230> the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
people don't you know communicate in the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.960 
people don't you know communicate in the
game<00:03:13.770> this<00:03:14.010> would<00:03:14.130> really<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.370> only<00:03:14.550> effective

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
game this would really be only effective

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.910 
game this would really be only effective
for<00:03:15.000> search<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.360> destroy<00:03:15.540> maybe<00:03:16.530> it'll<00:03:16.709> tell

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
for search and destroy maybe it'll tell

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.229 
for search and destroy maybe it'll tell
you<00:03:16.980> when<00:03:17.130> enemy<00:03:17.400> kill<00:03:17.640> streaks<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.060> things

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
you when enemy kill streaks and things

purchase lot that gambler takes actually

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.080 
purchase lot that gambler takes actually
is<00:05:10.590> and<00:05:10.860> that's<00:05:10.979> how<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.190> actually<00:05:11.550> you<00:05:11.970> know

is and that's how that actually you know

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.180 
is and that's how that actually you know
pays<00:05:12.479> for<00:05:12.840> itself<00:05:12.990> or<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.560> could<00:05:13.710> or<00:05:13.919> couldn't

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
pays for itself or it could or couldn't

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:16.219 
pays for itself or it could or couldn't
you<00:05:14.340> know<00:05:14.430> what<00:05:14.580> really<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:15.449> depends<00:05:15.690> but<00:05:16.139> it

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
you know what really just depends but it

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.140 
you know what really just depends but it
gives<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.470> random<00:05:16.860> Park<00:05:17.310> each<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.850> every

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
gives you a random Park each and every

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.750 
gives you a random Park each and every
time<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.360> respawn<00:05:18.870> ping<00:05:19.590> allows<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.490> to

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
time you respawn ping allows you to

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.360 
time you respawn ping allows you to
reveal<00:05:21.180> enemies<00:05:21.750> nearby<00:05:22.199> after<00:05:22.979> you<00:05:23.130> get<00:05:23.340> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
reveal enemies nearby after you get a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.969 
reveal enemies nearby after you get a
kill<00:05:23.699> so<00:05:23.910> for<00:05:24.090> example<00:05:24.180> if<00:05:24.810> I<00:05:25.020> care<00:05:25.289> kill<00:05:25.650> enemy

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 
kill so for example if I care kill enemy

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:27.980 
kill so for example if I care kill enemy
a<00:05:26.099> and<00:05:26.550> enemy<00:05:27.120> be<00:05:27.300> is<00:05:27.449> in<00:05:27.570> the<00:05:27.630> building<00:05:27.840> right

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
a and enemy be is in the building right

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.290 
a and enemy be is in the building right
next<00:05:28.259> to<00:05:28.470> me<00:05:28.560> enemy<00:05:28.919> be<00:05:29.130> will<00:05:29.370> show<00:05:29.610> up<00:05:29.849> on<00:05:30.030> my

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
next to me enemy be will show up on my

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.700 
next to me enemy be will show up on my
mini<00:05:30.539> map<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:30.990> I<00:05:31.020> think<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.349> pretty<00:05:31.470> cool

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
mini map so I think that's pretty cool

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.920 
mini map so I think that's pretty cool
and<00:05:31.949> it<00:05:32.580> kind<00:05:32.789> of<00:05:32.940> takes<00:05:33.120> away<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.539> need<00:05:33.660> for<00:05:33.900> a

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
and it kind of takes away the need for a

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.050 
and it kind of takes away the need for a
UAV<00:05:34.169> all<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.590> time<00:05:34.770> which<00:05:34.949> I<00:05:35.130> don't<00:05:35.190> like<00:05:35.729> so

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
UAV all the time which I don't like so

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.450 
UAV all the time which I don't like so
yeah<00:05:36.810> that's<00:05:37.169> a<00:05:37.380> thing<00:05:37.560> and<00:05:37.800> last<00:05:38.190> but<00:05:38.280> not

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
yeah that's a thing and last but not

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.920 
yeah that's a thing and last but not
least<00:05:38.520> we<00:05:38.849> have<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.030> Deadeye<00:05:39.360> and<00:05:39.720> this

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
least we have a Deadeye and this

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.680 
least we have a Deadeye and this
increases<00:05:40.620> your<00:05:41.370> chances<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.120> inflict<00:05:42.479> more

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
increases your chances to inflict more

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.629 
increases your chances to inflict more
damage<00:05:42.750> with<00:05:43.260> each<00:05:43.620> consecutive<00:05:44.039> kill<00:05:44.460> you

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
damage with each consecutive kill you

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.370 
damage with each consecutive kill you
get<00:05:44.849> so<00:05:45.060> that<00:05:45.210> means<00:05:45.419> if<00:05:45.690> you're<00:05:45.990> going<00:05:46.169> for

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
get so that means if you're going for

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.050 
get so that means if you're going for
kill<00:05:46.590> streaks<00:05:46.830> or<00:05:46.979> something<00:05:47.370> like<00:05:47.520> that<00:05:47.580> you

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
kill streaks or something like that you

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.930 
kill streaks or something like that you
will<00:05:48.240> want<00:05:48.539> to<00:05:48.659> use<00:05:48.810> dead<00:05:49.500> I<00:05:49.530> this<00:05:50.370> perk<00:05:50.699> will

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
will want to use dead I this perk will

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.879 
will want to use dead I this perk will
you<00:05:51.240> know<00:05:51.360> if<00:05:51.449> you<00:05:51.539> get<00:05:51.630> one<00:05:51.840> kill<00:05:52.050> your<00:05:52.409> second

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
you know if you get one kill your second

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.820 
you know if you get one kill your second
kill<00:05:53.070> may<00:05:53.669> do<00:05:54.090> more<00:05:54.360> damage<00:05:54.659> than<00:05:55.349> your<00:05:55.620> first

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
kill may do more damage than your first

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.200 
kill may do more damage than your first
kill<00:05:56.070> them<00:05:56.190> by<00:05:56.280> that<00:05:56.430> means<00:05:56.639> you<00:05:56.789> know<00:05:56.909> bullet

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
kill them by that means you know bullet

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.820 
kill them by that means you know bullet
damage<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.630> things<00:05:57.780> like<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:57.960> I<00:05:58.349> think<00:05:58.740> this

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
damage and things like that I think this

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.230 
damage and things like that I think this
will<00:05:58.949> be<00:05:59.010> very<00:05:59.310> very<00:05:59.400> interesting<00:06:00.030> and<00:06:00.150> it's

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
will be very very interesting and it's

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.460 
will be very very interesting and it's
almost<00:06:00.449> like<00:06:00.750> the<00:06:00.840> new<00:06:00.960> stopping<00:06:01.349> power

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
almost like the new stopping power

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:02.839 
almost like the new stopping power
