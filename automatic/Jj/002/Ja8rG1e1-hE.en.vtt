00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
it completely stays the same nothing

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.110 
it completely stays the same nothing
changes<00:00:53.590> but<00:00:54.590> in<00:00:54.890> greater<00:00:55.430> rifts<00:00:55.879> that's

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
changes but in greater rifts that's

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.850 
changes but in greater rifts that's
that's<00:00:56.600> where<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.199> might<00:00:57.410> want<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.739> switch

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
that's where you might want to switch

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.150

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.349 
things up a little bit alright so in
greater<00:01:01.399> rifts<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:01.910> could<00:01:02.059> have<00:01:02.180> the

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
greater rifts you could have the

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.210 
greater rifts you could have the
frenzied<00:01:02.750> variation<00:01:03.350> in<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:03.530> ground<00:01:03.890> stomp

need but you want the most damage you
could<00:04:37.500> have<00:04:37.680> always<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.120> want<00:04:39.390> enough

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
could have always but you want enough

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.740 
could have always but you want enough
defense<00:04:40.230> to<00:04:40.470> get<00:04:40.650> through<00:04:41.160> most<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.450> rift

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
defense to get through most of the rift

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.680 
defense to get through most of the rift
levels<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.560> don't<00:04:43.770> want<00:04:44.040> so<00:04:44.850> much<00:04:45.090> defense

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
levels you don't want so much defense

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.380 
levels you don't want so much defense
that<00:04:45.930> you<00:04:46.080> can<00:04:46.230> never<00:04:46.380> die<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.940> want<00:04:48.240> just

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
that you can never die you want just

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.930 
that you can never die you want just
that<00:04:48.840> bare<00:04:49.320> minimum<00:04:49.920> amount<00:04:50.250> of<00:04:50.340> defense<00:04:50.730> that

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
that bare minimum amount of defense that

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.390 
that bare minimum amount of defense that
if<00:04:51.390> you<00:04:51.870> play<00:04:52.110> right<00:04:52.380> you<00:04:52.680> will<00:04:52.860> stay<00:04:53.130> alive

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
if you play right you will stay alive

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.220 
if you play right you will stay alive
that's<00:04:54.210> what<00:04:54.480> you're<00:04:54.630> aiming<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:55.230> and<00:04:56.150> then

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
that's what you're aiming for and then

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:59.780 
that's what you're aiming for and then
by<00:04:58.230> doing<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.740> you<00:04:59.040> could<00:04:59.190> have<00:04:59.370> the<00:04:59.520> most

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
by doing that you could have the most

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.940 
by doing that you could have the most
possible<00:05:00.480> damage<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.080> could<00:05:01.230> possibly<00:05:01.680> have

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
possible damage you could possibly have

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.760 
possible damage you could possibly have
and<00:05:02.220> then<00:05:02.400> when<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.300> get<00:05:03.510> even<00:05:04.170> even<00:05:04.500> higher

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
and then when you get even even higher

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.350 
and then when you get even even higher
and<00:05:05.010> higher<00:05:05.040> and<00:05:05.400> greater<00:05:05.460> rifts<00:05:05.940> you<00:05:06.030> have<00:05:06.210> to

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
and higher and greater rifts you have to

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.090 
and higher and greater rifts you have to
sacrifice<00:05:06.600> some<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.230> that<00:05:07.410> defense<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.010> you

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
sacrifice some of that defense so you

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.490 
sacrifice some of that defense so you
have<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.370> even<00:05:08.550> take<00:05:08.880> away<00:05:09.240> from<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.080> damage

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
have to even take away from the damage

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.560 
have to even take away from the damage
the<00:05:10.620> defense<00:05:11.040> you<00:05:11.190> feel<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.640> need<00:05:11.940> and<00:05:12.240> try<00:05:12.510> to

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
the defense you feel you need and try to

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.470 
the defense you feel you need and try to
survive<00:05:13.110> with<00:05:13.530> less<00:05:13.920> damage<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.820> so<00:05:15.419> you

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
survive with less damage just so you

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.540 
survive with less damage just so you
could<00:05:15.750> have<00:05:15.960> high<00:05:16.290> enough<00:05:16.620> damage<00:05:17.040> to<00:05:17.280> get

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
could have high enough damage to get

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.810 
could have high enough damage to get
through<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.000> greater<00:05:18.240> rift<00:05:18.510> clear<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.820> it's

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
through the greater rift clear and it's

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.810 
through the greater rift clear and it's
all<00:05:21.180> these<00:05:21.570> little<00:05:21.810> adjustments<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:22.950> like<00:05:23.700> I

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
all these little adjustments and like I

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.750 
all these little adjustments and like I
said<00:05:23.880> it's<00:05:24.390> its<00:05:25.140> individual<00:05:25.830> its<00:05:26.160> individual

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
said it's its individual its individual

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.540 
said it's its individual its individual
I<00:05:26.940> could<00:05:27.180> not<00:05:27.419> give<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.930> an<00:05:28.140> exact<00:05:28.830> filled

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
I could not give you an exact filled

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.600 
I could not give you an exact filled
because<00:05:30.270> it's<00:05:30.660> going<00:05:30.750> to<00:05:30.870> be<00:05:30.960> different<00:05:31.200> for

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
because it's going to be different for

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.100 
because it's going to be different for
444<00:05:32.610> it's<00:05:32.850> going<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.030> be<00:05:33.150> different<00:05:33.360> for<00:05:33.660> 48

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
444 it's going to be different for 48

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:35.900 
444 it's going to be different for 48
it's<00:05:34.290> going<00:05:34.350> to<00:05:34.500> be<00:05:34.590> different<00:05:34.770> for<00:05:35.070> 50<00:05:35.400> gonna

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
it's going to be different for 50 gonna

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.900 
it's going to be different for 50 gonna
be<00:05:36.030> different<00:05:36.210> for<00:05:36.480> 52<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.669> that's<00:05:38.669> how

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:38.910 
be different for 52 it's that's how

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.969 
be different for 52 it's that's how
these<00:05:39.090> things<00:05:39.120> kind<00:05:39.600> of<00:05:39.720> work<00:05:39.870> you<00:05:40.440> may<00:05:40.650> want

grouping like I said for playing in a

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.270 
grouping like I said for playing in a
regular<00:06:20.870> group<00:06:21.140> your<00:06:21.440> builds<00:06:21.770> pretty<00:06:22.010> much

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
regular group your builds pretty much

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.640 
regular group your builds pretty much
the<00:06:22.580> same<00:06:22.820> there's<00:06:23.270> really<00:06:23.510> nothing<00:06:24.020> going<00:06:24.200> on

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:24.650 
the same there's really nothing going on

nothing going on there um as her gear
you<00:06:29.630> know<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:29.810> switch<00:06:30.140> your<00:06:30.170> unity<00:06:30.680> for<00:06:30.950> a

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
you know you switch your unity for a

crown for more cooldown reduction so you

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:37.690
