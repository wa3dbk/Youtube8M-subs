00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
if you use the shoes more and more the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
work so over time the shoes actually

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.449 
work so over time the shoes actually
cushion<00:04:19.109> better<00:04:19.320> there's<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:20.040> tendency<00:04:20.280> for

the<00:04:24.900> shoes<00:04:25.110> will<00:04:25.320> actually<00:04:25.650> cushion<00:04:26.040> better

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
the shoes will actually cushion better
