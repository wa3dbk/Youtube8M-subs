we're going to do a little video about
pruning<00:00:10.219> now<00:00:11.219> everybody's<00:00:11.940> opinion<00:00:12.330> on

pruning now everybody's opinion on
pruning<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.990> different<00:00:13.610> of<00:00:14.610> course<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.059> guys

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
pruning is different of course the guys

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.689 
pruning is different of course the guys
that<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.900> those<00:00:16.080> peach<00:00:16.800> orchards<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that have those peach orchards and

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.189 
that have those peach orchards and
orange<00:00:17.940> orchards<00:00:18.330> they<00:00:18.480> got<00:00:18.630> a<00:00:18.660> way<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.900> prune

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
orange orchards they got a way to prune

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.410 
orange orchards they got a way to prune
things<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.800> maximize<00:00:20.430> production<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.300> not

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
things to maximize production we're not

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
things to maximize production we're not
worried<00:00:21.660> about<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:22.920> permaculture

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
worried about that I'm in a permaculture

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.580 
worried about that I'm in a permaculture
forest<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.720> want<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> be<00:00:25.199> able<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.470> see

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
forest and I want to be able to see

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.550 
forest and I want to be able to see
snakes<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.220> things<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:26.880> basically<00:00:27.840> i<00:00:27.990> want<00:00:28.380> my

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
snakes and things so basically i want my

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.830 
snakes and things so basically i want my
tree<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:28.830> clear<00:00:29.310> from<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.179> they<00:00:30.330> sort

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
tree is clear from where they sort

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.630 
tree is clear from where they sort
should<00:00:31.019> be<00:00:31.080> productive<00:00:31.800> which<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> above<00:00:32.460> this

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
should be productive which is above this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.010 
should be productive which is above this
major<00:00:33.440> portion<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.500> branches<00:00:35.630> all<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.899> way

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
major portion of branches all the way

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530 
major portion of branches all the way
down<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.950> way<00:00:38.100> i<00:00:38.129> can<00:00:38.250> see<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.090> notice<00:00:39.420> of

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
down that way i can see you notice of

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.680 
down that way i can see you notice of
course<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> part<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.440> woods<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> not

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
course this part of the woods is not

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.910 
course this part of the woods is not
really<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.780> manicured<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.559> should<00:00:43.739> because

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
really as manicured as it should because

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850 
really as manicured as it should because
my<00:00:44.340> machine<00:00:44.670> broke<00:00:45.050> but<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.170> any<00:00:46.289> case<00:00:46.379> we're

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
my machine broke but in any case we're

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.110 
my machine broke but in any case we're
going<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.010> show<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.309> with<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.789> tree<00:00:48.090> right

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
going to show you with this tree right

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.569 
going to show you with this tree right
here<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.020> prune<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.620> tree<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.520> do

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
here how I prune a tree first thing I do

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.209 
here how I prune a tree first thing I do
now<00:00:50.969> always<00:00:51.239> carry<00:00:51.719> my<00:00:52.520> Gerber<00:00:53.960> scissors<00:00:55.219> and

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
now always carry my Gerber scissors and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.700 
now always carry my Gerber scissors and
my<00:00:56.850> Gerber<00:00:57.210> pruners<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.899> me<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.410> I've<00:00:58.500> got

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
my Gerber pruners on me and I've got

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.099 
my Gerber pruners on me and I've got
about<00:00:58.890> three<00:00:59.309> or<00:00:59.340> four<00:00:59.430> pairs<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> these<00:01:00.149> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
about three or four pairs of these and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.049 
about three or four pairs of these and
three<00:01:01.500> or<00:01:01.590> four<00:01:01.739> scissors<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.879> only

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
three or four scissors but the only

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.219 
three or four scissors but the only
reason<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> carry<00:01:03.510> these<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.840> because<00:01:04.110> they

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
reason I carry these is because they

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.399 
reason I carry these is because they
came<00:01:04.439> with<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:05.960> will<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.020> call<00:01:07.260> these

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
holsters and my sweet call fiskars
fiskars<00:01:14.070> don't<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.880> holsters<00:01:15.330> oh<00:01:15.450> I<00:01:15.509> don't

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fiskars don't have holsters oh I don't

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.530 
fiskars don't have holsters oh I don't
carry<00:01:15.869> them<00:01:15.960> with<00:01:15.990> me<00:01:16.220> but<00:01:17.220> you'll<00:01:17.549> always<00:01:17.759> use

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
carry them with me but you'll always use

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.359 
carry them with me but you'll always use
the<00:01:18.810> with<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> curve<00:01:19.470> down<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.860> because

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
the with the curve down and because

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.560 
the with the curve down and because
mostly<00:01:20.670> things<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.119> locking<00:01:21.390> mechanism

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
mostly things have a locking mechanism

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.450 
mostly things have a locking mechanism
if<00:01:22.170> you<00:01:22.259> try<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.470> use<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.830> like<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
if you try to use it like that just the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
if you try to use it like that just the
gravity<00:01:23.850> feeds<00:01:24.119> set<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.720> little<00:01:24.840> lock<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.950> then

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
gravity feeds set a little lock and then

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.749 
gravity feeds set a little lock and then
you<00:01:26.250> can't<00:01:26.520> open<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:26.939> again<00:01:27.200> so<00:01:28.610> loppers<00:01:29.610> are

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you can't open it again so loppers are

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
you can't open it again so loppers are
meant<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> be<00:01:30.030> used<00:01:30.619> printers<00:01:31.619> are<00:01:31.740> meant<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
meant to be used printers are meant to

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.850 
meant to be used printers are meant to
be<00:01:32.009> used<00:01:32.340> like<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.530> first<00:01:34.710> thing

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
be used like this and the first thing

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.960 
be used like this and the first thing
I'm<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.700> things<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
I'm going to do you see these things I

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.520 
I'm going to do you see these things I
don't<00:01:36.060> have<00:01:36.270> leaves<00:01:36.509> those<00:01:37.439> are<00:01:37.590> dead<00:01:37.770> limbs

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
don't have leaves those are dead limbs

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
don't have leaves those are dead limbs
so<00:01:40.530> just<00:01:40.799> cut<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> dead<00:01:41.189> limbs<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:41.670> nothing

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so just cut the dead limbs off nothing

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.240 
so just cut the dead limbs off nothing
else<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:42.840> cut<00:01:43.170> dead<00:01:43.380> limbs<00:01:43.619> off<00:01:43.860> until

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
else just cut dead limbs off until

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
else just cut dead limbs off until
you're<00:01:44.369> done<00:01:44.490> cutting<00:01:44.759> dead<00:01:45.000> limbs<00:01:45.240> off<00:01:45.590> then

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
you're done cutting dead limbs off then

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.760 
you're done cutting dead limbs off then
you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> take<00:01:47.040> a<00:01:47.070> look<00:01:47.250> at<00:01:47.430> your<00:01:47.549> tree<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:49.500> see

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
you can take a look at your tree and see

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:57.660 
you can take a look at your tree and see
what's<00:01:50.040> what's<00:01:50.759> next
