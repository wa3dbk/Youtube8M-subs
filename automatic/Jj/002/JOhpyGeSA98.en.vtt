00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.420
 and then we go 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.799
 so for those who know this game 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.509

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.540
 little things little things 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.460
 little tips that are super good at 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.810
 know in the game with lots of little ones 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.080
 hints of stuff are a little hidden 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.850
 for cars like bugatti like 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.520
 the UFO like the stuff of the 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.890
 that the aliens hiding 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.770
 the secret caves 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.610
 what else is bayal and there are the 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.990
 drizzles all kinds of things and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.920
 then, of course, the names are 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.990
 treasure so I'm going back to 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.990
 the place so there is down there 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:03.860
 and then we'll dive right before 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:07.159
 to be there to better identify places 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.179
 So here I am showing you where 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.459
 it's on the map 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.760
 so that should be towards the 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:19.160
 normally if he advances me a little so we 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:22.370
 will jump called and magic magic you 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.950
 have a plane finally a plane that has 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.690
 crashed and we're going to have everything 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.150
 just find the right place because 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.269
 that there is a good place where there is the 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.579
 famous treasure has recovered so must 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.109
 open the eye we must look well so 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.030
 normally he's there so that's where 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.760
 this a company of the finally it is a 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 airline plane fly or six so 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.070
 the famous ones that the famous company of 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.549
 Grand Theft Auto 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.410
 so we will go to the boat and there is a 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.209
 briefcase with about seventeen 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.980
 thousand of money and after I you 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.310
 explain the technique to see it in 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.769
 unlimited so we go there we go we dive 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.630
 so you're going to have a good apnea thing 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.400
 that I do not have so 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.470
 there's a whole trick after for for 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 see it and we'll come right after 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.140
 so there on the map we see the debris 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.950
 they are marked on the map a 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.960
 once you're there 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.230
 and there we go simply ben 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:21.780
 go down and find this treasure so hop 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.860
 I'm going back up I know pretty much where 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.720
 he is hop 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.830
 he should call it the magnifying glass and 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.440
 so it should be right there down I 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.360
 still do not see it at I see it the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.370
 joystick so you're going down 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:43.530
 December ash descent you 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.180
 take the briefcase 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.670
 and once these effect you go 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.720
 change character that's hyper 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.910
 important what you see that there I 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.010
 lost all my apnea then this trick 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.040
 there will allow you to go back 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.709
 on the character and at the same time he 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.510
 will just get back his apnea and 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.989
 at the same time the at the joystick goes 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:06.540
 reappear this and that's it all 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.390
 the technique of this trick for those 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.590
 who want to do it here is to have 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.050
 money easily 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.910
 so it's not a very big cheat 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.380
 because anyway you can 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.680
 very well fall back to a moment or a 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.269
 other 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.880
 on when you found it 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.440
 many so there you will see that we 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.880
 will come back on michael and who is going to be 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.830
 still in the ocean with all his life and 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.630
 that I judge tarbes we advanced a whole 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:32.160
 little bit swam a little bit and that 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:34.800
 will be good so here we are hop ahead 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.140
 under water and there you see I'm going 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.720
 look for the briefcase so I'm going 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:44.400
 have to search of course that's what 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:47.880
 is vigilante again and I the 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.770
 recover and I still have twelve thousand and 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.110
 you can do that so on 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.990
 every time you get your money 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.000
 your briefcase and then your breath 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.200
 so here's listening I hope this 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.020
 video will have pleased you 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.700
 in any case I was delighted to find 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.479
 this technique so it's not marked 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.280
 found the technique 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.479
 finally that it's not me who found this 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.210
 treasure there but it's me who found 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.919
 the technique of changing character I 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.760
 I had been told that with a few possibilities 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.990
 I noticed a lot of things 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.940
 two characters that everything came back from 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.710
 time so I wanted to try and that's 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.540
 true that it works so that's so 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.250
 do not hesitate to put a layman if this 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.510
 video you liked and you're interested 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.160
 see that the boom I will not recover 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.610
 direct 12000 because I was already 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.170
 above 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:28.900
 so that's not bad you can stay 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.310
 in moonwalk on finally here so 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.900
 thank you to put a little comment if 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.950
