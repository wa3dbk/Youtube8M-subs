00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 korfball there is a sport of traditions so the season is still ending 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.230
 with the famous books country final kinne already beautiful 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.340
 but there is also the korfball sport that is doing the innovation 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.399
 for example, four best teams from the korfball league playoffs 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.189
 they can quite a loss in the coveted paper in the Rotterdam 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.740
 sports temple one play against four and twice against 3 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.509
 I surprised Drenthe Dos 46 as fourth in the friend and competition 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:32.490
 defeat enemy but leader dalto on foreign soil 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.770
 in the extra time 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.550
 last night as twitter 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.190
 you become an island class board 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.300
 This goal shop then the Sun by last week 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.300
 a tie after regular playing time and then 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.900
 Dennis the Great 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.450
 a great talent and prints 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 dalto gets the ball again, those are the rules but it is allowed 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.460
 don't help 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.790
 no trace 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.270
 holly the 46 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.059
 wind that match the first play off match 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.480
 in the lion's den 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.709
 with the city golden goal of 

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:05.980
 kenny is too big 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.980
 that's for sure the previous week 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.180
 dennis is the big one in the return full house in nijeveen and that means 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.930
 fourteen hundred people in the stands 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.200
 and with last week's results in mind 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.200
 can finish forests in-house 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.920
 m or the duvel is playing who made the first goal 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.530
 the groin the ground 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.150
 a 0 for dos 46 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.750
 the mood is immediately there 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.360
 in neville 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.520
 it is therefore about a place in the finals best of friends 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.910
 20 dos 46 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.910
 in short, dalto must wager 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
 Bob de Jong remained the equalizer 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.689
 it must be possible for dalto the team of this coach eric wolsing 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.759
 two matches in the competition almost the entire one went 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.759
 with a goal difference is a joke 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.820
 and here again in the first half it was forgotten 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.220
 then 46 ahead and then dalto again 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.220
 until finally a tie of 5 5 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:14.719
 and now a head start 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.559
 panic 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.559
 dalto 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:23.589
 So club competition ended as a leader, but you still have to finish it in 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.659
 the playoffs 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.849
 casper tree 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.169
 from the side 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:31.969
 riba countryman peter lageweg 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:33.399
 and no further 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:36.519
 in short, it is crazy with a private upstairs 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.319
 as far as we know know nothing 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.459
 7 5 in favor of the home team 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:47.269
 7 they live carpenter 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:49.039
 search for under the basket 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.299
 bob the young but 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.299
 the ball is intercepted by jan a little too big 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:56.929
 jan de kleijn 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:59.709
 and casper tree 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.969
 the battle 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.459
 she is at stake a lot 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 noticeable by the small irritations in the field 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:11.079
 look here sietske van de sande and all that not far 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.339
 interesting duel between the two 

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:14.599
 andré coopers 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.889
 that goes for a walk-through ball 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.799
 harold clubhouse 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.939
 beautiful assist from coopers and nicely finished 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:24.489
 and the audience feels it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.309
 the home team is running out of steam 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:29.339
 sietske of the sande 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:32.789
 lost his approval and can shoot 

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:35.789
 but was able to rebuild Peter Lageweg 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:38.989
 I don't know too, says Sietske van de Sande 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.249
 the man gym on the assembly line 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:44.729
 but now there is no running in that box 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.599
 but in a class 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.649
 and the newest big takes it from distance 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.879
 Coopers with his own rebounds 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.249
 and then mancini is the ground 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:59.150
 wouter the lead from the rest position 14 11 for dos 46 

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:03.879
 especially with the women of forest who make the difference 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.789
 Dennis the Great 

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:08.809
 and annemic ferrara 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:13.989
 before the break already for 4 out of 5 and that is winning beautifully nice ending and here already 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.769
 ask 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:18.769
 goal number five 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.370
 toseland rulings four points ahead 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.870
 it is one of the countries 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.870
 Jan van Dijk tries it himself 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.090
 and again sietske van de sande 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.210
 now plan the margin there is still hope to buy a dagger 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.969
 three points with about twenty minutes left in the second half 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:47.870
 Jos Roseboom is wanted 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.370
 and then arjan van dijk 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.279
 who lives roseboom 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.300
 charim chance 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.649
 two points difference once again dalto must in here 

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.749
 but then the thresher starts real turning 

00:05:04.749 --> 00:05:06.409
 casper tree 

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:09.189
 almost from the center line 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:13.319
 a meter or ten distances would be enough and then this action plan 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.930
 andré coopers 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.930
 block out cancers 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.849
 don't even count it to be his man 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:23.509
 away with that ball 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.139
 andré coopers 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:28.900
 I have respect again, too 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.520
 and then had learned the game from dalto 

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:35.669
 peter lageweg 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.629
 the team from nijeveen succeeded in everything 

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:43.400
 it seems that the shape of the final in it, the car was also skipped 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.419
 he gave 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.199
 also his goal 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.020
 evaporating a maximum lead of the six goals for dos 46 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.930
 and what to think certainly happened last year 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.180
 miss the final as a leader 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.199
 that goes now lives totally unfounded 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.479
 anniek ter haar 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.319
 you don't believe it 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.409
 no more than two per match 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.520
 the matchwinner the audience counts down 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.169
 27 22 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.659
 the number fourteen points surprisingly the leader 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:17.240
 the playoffs 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.689
 to ahoy instead of dalto 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.689
 Heracles took difficult moments in this competition 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:25.849
 just before the play off 2 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.379
 That would really be the upward trend in the number of this page that is two 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:32.839
 competitions have just been very good we are ready for it 

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:35.229
 really played no tasking season and 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.499
 actually quite rightly grabbed the lead at the end of the season 

00:06:38.499 --> 00:06:40.990
 the vvd has in the playoffs 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.779
 how could that happen 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.399
 I may have had to call you the P2 to put all their stocks 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.460
 but the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.460
 but i know i got this and i gave away last week 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:55.099
 that announced president of the best three 

00:06:55.649 --> 00:06:56.779
 the 

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:59.709
 if your child from lisse should be able to finish the second room in the second room 

00:06:59.709 --> 00:07:01.759
 you don't fall asleep young people
