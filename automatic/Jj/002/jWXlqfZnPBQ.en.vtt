00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
tamas hi Leslie hi Katie yes I want to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
tamas hi Leslie hi Katie yes I want to
take<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.500> want<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.859> to<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> look<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.670> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
take it I want you to take a look at the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.910 
take it I want you to take a look at the
long<00:00:18.119> mega<00:00:18.390> time<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.990> the<00:00:19.080> tray<00:00:19.350> here

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
long mega time is in the tray here

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.970 
long mega time is in the tray here
they're<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.699> unusual<00:00:20.970> shape<00:00:21.900> they<00:00:22.800> are

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
they're a very unusual shape they are

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.710 
they're a very unusual shape they are
drop<00:00:23.340> beads<00:00:23.670> but<00:00:24.000> they<00:00:24.119> have<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> unique

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
drop beads but they have a unique

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.900 
drop beads but they have a unique
architecture<00:00:25.529> about<00:00:25.800> them<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.519> makes<00:00:26.580> them

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
architecture about them that makes them

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.750 
architecture about them that makes them
very<00:00:27.660> interesting<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.560> play<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.039> mm-hmm

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
very interesting to play with mm-hmm

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.089 
very interesting to play with mm-hmm
over<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.869> strung<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.410> randomly<00:00:31.830> on

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
over here I just strung them randomly on

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
over here I just strung them randomly on
a<00:00:32.130> piece<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.460> wire<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> great

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
a piece of wire and they have a great

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.729 
a piece of wire and they have a great
texture<00:00:34.380> but<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.550> figured<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.750> they're

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
texture but I figured out that they're

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.889 
texture but I figured out that they're
like<00:00:37.950> little<00:00:38.129> parallelograms<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.629> holes

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
like little parallelograms and the holes

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
like little parallelograms and the holes
actually<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.680> direction<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.520> once<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
actually have a direction and once I

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.600 
actually have a direction and once I
realized<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.050> saw<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> could<00:00:44.190> develop

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
realized that I saw that I could develop

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
realized that I saw that I could develop
this<00:00:44.969> really<00:00:45.570> cool<00:00:45.780> structure<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
this really cool structure and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
this really cool structure and
architectural<00:00:47.399> pattern<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> applied<00:00:48.840> them

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
architectural pattern so I applied them

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.220 
architectural pattern so I applied them
to<00:00:49.079> tubular<00:00:49.739> peyote<00:00:49.920> which<00:00:50.820> is<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.239> worked

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
to tubular peyote which is on worked

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.260 
to tubular peyote which is on worked
around<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> rod<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:53.370> help<00:00:53.579> give<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.940> structure

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
around a rod to help give it structure

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.740 
around a rod to help give it structure
and<00:00:54.719> you<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.289> see<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:56.210> geometry<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and you can see the geometry and the

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
and you can see the geometry and the
foundation<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.399> very

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
foundation of them is a very

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.330 
foundation of them is a very
architectural<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.829> cool<00:01:02.160> effect

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
architectural it's a really cool effect

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.340 
architectural it's a really cool effect
it<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:03.120> works<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.539> great<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it really works out great and then I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.679 
it really works out great and then I
just<00:01:04.680> went<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.100> just<00:01:05.339> using<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> mags<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.479> some

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just went to just using the mags as some

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.230 
just went to just using the mags as some
people<00:01:06.990> call<00:01:07.020> them<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.369> again<00:01:08.700> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:08.880> still

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
people call them and again you can still

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.260 
people call them and again you can still
see<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.450> rhythm<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> foundation<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.010> it

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
see the rhythm and the foundation of it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.810 
see the rhythm and the foundation of it
so<00:01:12.270> once<00:01:12.990> i<00:01:13.140> realized<00:01:13.320> that<00:01:13.680> i<00:01:14.070> could<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.670> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
so once i realized that i could see that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.370 
so once i realized that i could see that
I<00:01:14.880> could<00:01:15.119> have<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> regular<00:01:15.780> pattern<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.290> I'm

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
I could have a regular pattern and I'm

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350 
I could have a regular pattern and I'm
going<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.650> show<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.920> how<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.340> do<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> what

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
going to show you how I do that and what

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.719 
going to show you how I do that and what
to<00:01:18.479> pay<00:01:18.630> attention<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.610> have

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
to pay attention to I like that you have

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.480 
to pay attention to I like that you have
the<00:01:20.850> tricks<00:01:21.090> I'll<00:01:21.270> figure<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.689> well<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.560> did

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the tricks I'll figure it out well I did

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
the tricks I'll figure it out well I did
all<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.729> work<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.659> perfectly<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
all the work for you perfectly like that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.300 
all the work for you perfectly like that
okay<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.909> see<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.560> I<00:01:29.009> am

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
okay so you can see here that I am

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.600 
okay so you can see here that I am
stringing<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.939> bead<00:01:30.920> actually<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.189> top<00:01:32.579> to

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
stringing the bead actually from top to

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.240 
stringing the bead actually from top to
bottom<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.750> holes<00:01:34.020> are<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.530> diagonal

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
bottom the holes are at the diagonal

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.940 
bottom the holes are at the diagonal
when<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.240> tubular<00:01:36.840> peyote<00:01:37.020> I've<00:01:37.470> strung

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
when you do a tubular peyote I've strung

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.480 
when you do a tubular peyote I've strung
it<00:01:38.130> around<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:39.090> piece<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.509> paper<00:01:39.840> here<00:01:40.490> whatever

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
it around a piece of paper here whatever

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.030 
it around a piece of paper here whatever
bead<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.970> come<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.750> that's<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.890> bead

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
bead you come out of that's the bead

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.859 
bead you come out of that's the bead
you're<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> pick<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.360> I've<00:01:45.600> picked

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
you're going to pick up so I've picked

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.249 
you're going to pick up so I've picked
up<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.110> maggot<00:01:46.560> ama<00:01:47.509> I've<00:01:48.509> come<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.200> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
up the maggot ama I've come out of a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
up the maggot ama I've come out of a
maggot<00:01:49.560> ama<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> skip<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.970> black

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
maggot ama I'm going to skip one black

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.620 
maggot ama I'm going to skip one black
and<00:01:51.630> go<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.710> next<00:01:52.860> black<00:01:53.570> just<00:01:54.570> like

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and go through the next black just like

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
want to use a needle that's going to fit

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.809 
want to use a needle that's going to fit
through<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> bees<00:02:19.140> okay<00:02:20.140> so<00:02:20.920> coming<00:02:21.580> over

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
through the bees okay so coming over

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.059 
through the bees okay so coming over
here<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.209> i<00:02:22.330> also<00:02:22.569> have<00:02:22.959> cylinder<00:02:23.560> beads<00:02:23.770> in

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
here and i also have cylinder beads in

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.610 
here and i also have cylinder beads in
size<00:02:24.459> 10<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.330> works<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.080> faster

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
size 10 so it works up a little faster

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.460 
size 10 so it works up a little faster
okay<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.430> i've<00:02:27.610> done<00:02:27.910> some<00:02:28.239> stitching<00:02:28.810> mm-hmm

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
okay so i've done some stitching mm-hmm

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.370 
okay so i've done some stitching mm-hmm
and<00:02:29.620> you<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.310> see<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:31.030> i<00:02:31.750> would<00:02:31.870> come

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
and you can see that i would come

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.470 
and you can see that i would come
through<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.709> bead<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.400> pick<00:02:33.700> up<00:02:33.850> that<00:02:34.000> bead<00:02:34.239> and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
through a bead and pick up that bead and

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.270 
through a bead and pick up that bead and
go<00:02:34.600> through<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.930> next<00:02:35.140> bead<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.860> creates

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
go through the next bead and it creates

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.350 
go through the next bead and it creates
that<00:02:36.610> same<00:02:37.120> kind<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:38.610> regularity<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
that same kind of regularity and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.720 
that same kind of regularity and
architectural<00:02:41.260> foundation<00:02:41.580> almost<00:02:42.580> like<00:02:42.700> a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
architectural foundation almost like a

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.840 
architectural foundation almost like a
circular<00:02:43.269> staircase<00:02:44.010> really<00:02:45.010> if<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.519> look<00:02:45.550> at

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
circular staircase really if you look at

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.750 
circular staircase really if you look at
it<00:02:45.940> like<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.989> and<00:02:47.410> to<00:02:48.130> me<00:02:48.310> that's<00:02:48.580> the

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
it like that right and to me that's the

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.620 
it like that right and to me that's the
appeal<00:02:49.180> of<00:02:49.450> doing<00:02:49.959> it<00:02:50.140> um<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.850> can<00:02:52.330> show<00:02:52.570> you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
appeal of doing it um so I can show you

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.390 
appeal of doing it um so I can show you
a<00:02:52.750> little<00:02:52.959> more<00:02:53.230> here<00:02:53.709> yeah<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.370> looks

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
a little more here yeah and it looks

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.190 
a little more here yeah and it looks
like<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.850> by<00:02:55.239> using<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.690> black<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.050> white

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
like it by using the black and white

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.990 
like it by using the black and white
you're<00:02:56.590> also<00:02:56.830> really<00:02:57.190> reinforcing<00:02:57.940> that

you're also really reinforcing that

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.600 
you're also really reinforcing that
pattern<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.780> spiral<00:02:59.200> staircase<00:02:59.440> pad<00:02:59.860> exactly

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
pattern the spiral staircase pad exactly

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.570 
pattern the spiral staircase pad exactly

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
following the angle of the size of the

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.000 
following the angle of the size of the
beads<00:03:28.570> so<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:29.709> going<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.920> have

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.759 
which is a white bead and go through the
next<00:03:48.040> white<00:03:48.340> bead<00:03:48.640> oh<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:50.230> does<00:03:50.410> make<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.709> a

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
next white bead oh that does make it a

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:52.140 
next white bead oh that does make it a
lot<00:03:50.920> easier<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.340> figure<00:03:51.609> out<00:03:51.820> where<00:03:52.000> you<00:03:52.120> are

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
lot easier to figure out where you are

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.599 
lot easier to figure out where you are
in<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:52.510> pattern<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.500> really<00:03:53.560> does<00:03:54.160> and

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
in the pattern so it really does and

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.780 
in the pattern so it really does and
then<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.150> can<00:03:55.329> see<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.720> new<00:03:56.230> bead<00:03:56.579> sits<00:03:57.579> and

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
then you can see that new bead sits and

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.069 
then you can see that new bead sits and
you'll<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.150> right<00:03:58.180> away<00:03:58.390> if<00:03:58.780> you're<00:03:58.900> picking

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
you'll know right away if you're picking

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.240 
you'll know right away if you're picking
the<00:03:59.290> beat<00:03:59.440> up<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.709> wrong<00:03:59.859> way<00:03:59.920> because

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
the beat up the wrong way because

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.890 
the beat up the wrong way because
they're<00:04:00.609> gonna<00:04:00.730> sit<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.420> share<00:04:01.600> each

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
they're gonna sit can you share each

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.990 
they're gonna sit can you share each
other<00:04:02.230> like<00:04:02.500> if<00:04:02.680> you<00:04:02.799> did<00:04:03.010> pick<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.370> absolutely

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
other like if you did pick I absolutely

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.330 
other like if you did pick I absolutely
let's<00:04:07.000> see<00:04:07.359> ok<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.260> here<00:04:08.620> I'm<00:04:08.739> picking<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.220> up

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
let's see ok so here I'm picking it up

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.030 
let's see ok so here I'm picking it up
from<00:04:09.489> high<00:04:09.730> to<00:04:09.760> low<00:04:10.260> mm-hmm<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.410> I'm<00:04:11.859> going<00:04:12.010> to

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
from high to low mm-hmm and I'm going to

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.670 
from high to low mm-hmm and I'm going to
go<00:04:12.220> through<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.640> next<00:04:12.910> bead<00:04:13.090> ok<00:04:13.900> normally<00:04:14.650> I

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
go through the next bead ok normally I

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.740 
go through the next bead ok normally I
would<00:04:14.890> be<00:04:15.010> picking<00:04:15.310> up<00:04:15.430> one<00:04:15.609> of<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.850> smaller

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
would be picking up one of the smaller

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.289 
would be picking up one of the smaller
cylinder<00:04:17.169> beads<00:04:17.500> to<00:04:17.709> go<00:04:17.859> here<00:04:18.130> ok<00:04:18.580> all<00:04:19.090> right

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
cylinder beads to go here ok all right

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.800 
cylinder beads to go here ok all right
but<00:04:19.840> if<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.080> pick<00:04:20.260> up<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.620> wrong<00:04:20.769> way

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
but if you pick up the wrong way

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.060 
but if you pick up the wrong way
and<00:04:22.810> you're<00:04:23.020> working<00:04:23.170> on<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> drinking<00:04:23.860> straw

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
and you're working on a drinking straw

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.130 
and you're working on a drinking straw
it<00:04:24.250> doesn't<00:04:24.520> really<00:04:24.610> matter<00:04:24.820> what<00:04:25.240> surface

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
it doesn't really matter what surface

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.690 
it doesn't really matter what surface
you<00:04:26.290> put<00:04:26.470> inside<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.920> right<00:04:27.100> thing<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.520> bring

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
you put inside that right thing to bring

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.670 
you put inside that right thing to bring
off<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.630> can<00:04:28.840> bring<00:04:29.020> up<00:04:29.170> something<00:04:29.410> that

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
off that you can bring up something that

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.980 
off that you can bring up something that
fits<00:04:29.980> when<00:04:30.520> I<00:04:30.550> start<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.240> start<00:04:31.330> with<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.720> rolled

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
fits when I start I start with a rolled

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.840 
fits when I start I start with a rolled
piece<00:04:32.260> of<00:04:32.410> paper<00:04:32.590> because<00:04:33.010> it'll<00:04:33.250> expand<00:04:33.730> to

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
piece of paper because it'll expand to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.760 
piece of paper because it'll expand to
fit<00:04:34.060> what<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.240> need<00:04:34.510> a<00:04:34.540> good<00:04:34.810> idea<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.290> can<00:04:35.470> see

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
fit what I need a good idea you can see

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.070 
fit what I need a good idea you can see
right<00:04:35.800> away<00:04:36.130> oh<00:04:36.520> yeah<00:04:36.820> that<00:04:37.210> this<00:04:37.450> is<00:04:37.630> gonna<00:04:37.900> be

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
right away oh yeah that this is gonna be

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.200 
right away oh yeah that this is gonna be
a<00:04:38.110> little<00:04:38.350> wonky<00:04:38.650> you'll<00:04:39.640> notice<00:04:40.000> right<00:04:40.060> away

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
a little wonky you'll notice right away

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.690 
a little wonky you'll notice right away
when<00:04:40.600> it's<00:04:40.750> out<00:04:40.900> of<00:04:40.930> pattern<00:04:41.560> and<00:04:42.220> actually

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
when it's out of pattern and actually

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.340 
when it's out of pattern and actually
some<00:04:43.060> of<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.240> other<00:04:43.480> finished<00:04:43.870> pieces<00:04:44.230> I

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
some of the other finished pieces I

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.700 
some of the other finished pieces I
brought<00:04:44.700> show<00:04:45.700> when<00:04:46.690> it's<00:04:46.840> randomly<00:04:47.290> so<00:04:47.440> let's

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
brought show when it's randomly so let's

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.310 
brought show when it's randomly so let's
take<00:04:47.890> a<00:04:47.950> look<00:04:48.190> at<00:04:48.310> those<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.630> this<00:04:49.840> is<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:50.020> memory

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
take a look at those so this is a memory

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.320 
take a look at those so this is a memory
wire<00:04:50.620> bracelet<00:04:51.370> or<00:04:51.550> necklace<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:52.060> you<00:04:52.090> made

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
wire bracelet or necklace that you made

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.940 
wire bracelet or necklace that you made
here<00:04:52.510> that's<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.840> bracelet<00:04:53.080> or<00:04:53.410> memory<00:04:53.740> wire

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
here that's a bracelet or memory wire

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.340 
here that's a bracelet or memory wire
and<00:04:54.370> I<00:04:54.610> just<00:04:54.910> went<00:04:55.150> willy-nilly<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.870> didn't<00:04:56.230> pay

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
and I just went willy-nilly I didn't pay

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.960 
and I just went willy-nilly I didn't pay
attention<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.980> how<00:04:57.100> they<00:04:57.310> were<00:04:57.340> strung<00:04:57.700> the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
attention to how they were strung the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.090 
attention to how they were strung the
holes<00:04:58.180> are<00:04:58.330> nice<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.780> large<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.380> uniform<00:04:59.890> so

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
holes are nice and large and uniform so

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.800 
holes are nice and large and uniform so
they<00:05:00.220> fit<00:05:00.460> nicely<00:05:00.700> on<00:05:00.880> memory<00:05:01.300> wire<00:05:01.450> and<00:05:01.720> what

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
they fit nicely on memory wire and what

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.480 
they fit nicely on memory wire and what
about<00:05:01.900> your<00:05:02.140> color<00:05:02.380> choices<00:05:02.710> here<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.100> notice

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
about your color choices here I notice

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
you have a little bit of graduation I

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.580 
you have a little bit of graduation I
loved<00:05:06.580> some<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.270> the<00:05:07.450> mat<00:05:07.600> surfaces<00:05:08.230> then

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
loved some of the mat surfaces then

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.520 
loved some of the mat surfaces then
these<00:05:08.770> are<00:05:08.950> available<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:10.240> i<00:05:10.270> did<00:05:10.660> a<00:05:10.990> third

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
these are available in so i did a third

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.260 
these are available in so i did a third
of<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.680> bracelet<00:05:11.920> in<00:05:12.160> one<00:05:12.340> color<00:05:12.610> a<00:05:12.730> third<00:05:13.090> in

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
of the bracelet in one color a third in

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.630 
of the bracelet in one color a third in
in<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.810> second<00:05:14.200> and<00:05:14.320> the<00:05:14.410> third<00:05:14.650> and<00:05:14.950> just<00:05:15.460> for

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:15.640 
in a second and the third and just for

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.330 
in a second and the third and just for
variation<00:05:16.270> i<00:05:16.420> added<00:05:16.810> some<00:05:16.840> little<00:05:17.230> dangles<00:05:17.770> so

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
variation i added some little dangles so

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.070 
variation i added some little dangles so
you<00:05:18.400> can<00:05:18.610> kind<00:05:18.820> of<00:05:18.880> see<00:05:19.120> the<00:05:19.300> color<00:05:19.510> changing

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
you can kind of see the color changing

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.590 
you can kind of see the color changing
this<00:05:20.170> yes<00:05:20.410> am<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.860> put<00:05:21.160> and<00:05:21.430> I<00:05:21.550> spaced<00:05:21.910> out<00:05:22.180> with

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:22.600 
this yes am I put and I spaced out with

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.220 
this yes am I put and I spaced out with
um<00:05:23.400> beads<00:05:24.400> in<00:05:24.640> between<00:05:24.700> them<00:05:25.450> so<00:05:25.810> it<00:05:25.990> really

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.230 
um beads in between them so it really

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.650 
um beads in between them so it really
has<00:05:26.560> this<00:05:26.770> nice<00:05:27.100> on<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.430> leafy<00:05:28.030> effect<00:05:28.420> now

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
has this nice on this leafy effect now

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.690 
has this nice on this leafy effect now
what<00:05:28.900> size<00:05:29.080> are<00:05:29.110> these<00:05:29.380> in<00:05:29.710> between<00:05:30.070> their

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
what size are these in between their

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.000 
what size are these in between their
size<00:05:30.970> tens<00:05:31.360> because<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:32.200> a<00:05:32.320> nice<00:05:32.500> scale<00:05:32.830> to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
size tens because it's a nice scale to

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.880 
size tens because it's a nice scale to
work<00:05:33.190> with<00:05:33.460> the<00:05:33.610> Maggs<00:05:33.820> um<00:05:34.480> you<00:05:34.870> can<00:05:35.050> use<00:05:35.200> 11s

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:35.890 
work with the Maggs um you can use 11s

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.980 
work with the Maggs um you can use 11s
but<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.220> tens<00:05:36.460> also<00:05:36.820> fit<00:05:37.120> on<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.510> memory<00:05:37.720> wire

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
but the tens also fit on the memory wire

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.740 
but the tens also fit on the memory wire
better<00:05:38.350> and<00:05:38.890> so<00:05:39.400> that's<00:05:39.640> something<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.090> keep

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
better and so that's something to keep

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.930 
better and so that's something to keep
in<00:05:40.900> mind<00:05:40.960> that<00:05:41.320> you<00:05:41.440> always<00:05:41.710> want<00:05:42.040> to<00:05:42.100> use<00:05:42.160> your

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
in mind that you always want to use your

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.490 
in mind that you always want to use your
stringing<00:05:43.420> material<00:05:43.870> whether<00:05:44.020> it's<00:05:44.260> wire

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
stringing material whether it's wire

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.500 
stringing material whether it's wire
thread<00:05:45.010> that<00:05:45.250> midst<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.940> whole<00:05:46.120> of<00:05:46.420> your

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
thread that midst the whole of your

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.360 
thread that midst the whole of your
beads<00:05:46.750> well<00:05:47.140> and<00:05:47.350> especially<00:05:47.410> with<00:05:47.890> these<00:05:48.070> I

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
beads well and especially with these I

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.190 
beads well and especially with these I
could<00:05:48.700> see<00:05:48.850> if<00:05:48.940> you<00:05:49.060> had<00:05:49.210> a<00:05:49.240> really<00:05:49.450> small<00:05:49.870> seed

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
could see if you had a really small seed

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.660 
could see if you had a really small seed
bead<00:05:50.410> it<00:05:50.560> might<00:05:50.740> fall<00:05:50.980> inside<00:05:51.310> the<00:05:51.490> hole

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
bead it might fall inside the hole

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.100 
bead it might fall inside the hole
because<00:05:51.970> the<00:05:52.120> Maggs<00:05:52.330> do<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.750> that's<00:05:52.960> a

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
because the Maggs do have that's a

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.350 
because the Maggs do have that's a
really<00:05:53.380> good<00:05:53.530> point<00:05:53.770> it<00:05:54.100> could<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:55.060> you<00:05:55.150> could

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
really good point it could so you could

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.940 
really good point it could so you could
use<00:05:55.540> anything<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:56.080> between<00:05:56.200> there<00:05:56.650> you<00:05:56.800> could

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
use anything in between there you could

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.100 
use anything in between there you could
make<00:05:57.100> beaded<00:05:57.340> spacers<00:05:58.030> or<00:05:58.240> use<00:05:58.390> other<00:05:58.540> larger

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
make beaded spacers or use other larger

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.320 
make beaded spacers or use other larger
beads<00:05:59.290> if<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.590> like<00:05:59.860> but<00:06:00.340> these<00:06:00.580> really<00:06:00.940> set

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
beads if you like but these really set

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:03.570 
beads if you like but these really set
off<00:06:01.540> the<00:06:02.320> leaf<00:06:02.560> eNOS<00:06:02.920> they<00:06:03.070> look<00:06:03.250> like<00:06:03.400> they're

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
off the leaf eNOS they look like they're

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.580 
off the leaf eNOS they look like they're
coming<00:06:03.910> out<00:06:04.000> of<00:06:04.060> stem<00:06:04.450> yeah<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.230> it's<00:06:05.410> almost

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
coming out of stem yeah so it's almost

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.260 
coming out of stem yeah so it's almost
like<00:06:05.830> a<00:06:05.860> natural<00:06:06.400> architecture<00:06:07.090> that's

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
like a natural architecture that's

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.940 
like a natural architecture that's
formed<00:06:07.720> with<00:06:07.930> that<00:06:08.170> well<00:06:08.500> that's<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.740> really

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
formed with that well that's a really

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.410 
formed with that well that's a really
pretty<00:06:09.130> piece<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.670> then<00:06:09.730> tell<00:06:09.940> us<00:06:10.060> about<00:06:10.180> your

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
pretty piece and then tell us about your

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.500 
pretty piece and then tell us about your
earrings<00:06:10.750> here<00:06:10.960> and<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.410> earrings<00:06:11.680> so<00:06:12.610> fast<00:06:13.090> i

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
earrings here and the earrings so fast i

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.030 
earrings here and the earrings so fast i
put<00:06:14.020> jump<00:06:14.290> rings<00:06:14.530> through<00:06:14.770> them<00:06:14.920> again

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
put jump rings through them again

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.420 
put jump rings through them again
because<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:16.150> holes<00:06:16.330> are<00:06:16.510> large<00:06:16.750> enough<00:06:16.840> and<00:06:17.430> i

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
because the holes are large enough and i

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.400 
because the holes are large enough and i
just<00:06:18.940> hung<00:06:19.150> them<00:06:19.360> on<00:06:19.450> the<00:06:19.600> chain<00:06:19.810> and<00:06:20.020> there

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
just hung them on the chain and there

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.020 
just hung them on the chain and there
you<00:06:20.560> go<00:06:20.710> they're<00:06:21.040> so<00:06:21.250> pretty<00:06:21.430> well<00:06:21.670> thank<00:06:21.880> you
