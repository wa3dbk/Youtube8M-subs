00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
well done mod the textures are seem to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.890 
well done mod the textures are seem to
be<00:00:20.160> reused<00:00:20.609> from<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:21.180> killing<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.660> already

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.470 

it<00:00:29.099> works<00:00:29.310> basically<00:00:29.550> like<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.119> would<00:00:30.240> assume

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
it works basically like you would assume

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.500 
it works basically like you would assume
it's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:32.360> well<00:00:34.489> it's<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> street<00:00:35.969> suite<00:00:36.239> Bruce

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.069 
shotgun it's not much more to be said
about<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.399> reloads<00:00:39.030> index<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
about that reloads index just like the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:01:33.569 
about that reloads index just like the
shotgun<00:00:40.379> should

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:33.579 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.559 

got<00:01:34.579> some<00:01:34.850> rare<00:01:35.149> things<00:01:35.899> on<00:01:36.259> sale<00:01:36.789> stranger<00:01:37.789> as

00:01:38.559 --> 00:01:38.569 
got some rare things on sale stranger as

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.179 
got some rare things on sale stranger as
you<00:01:38.719> probably<00:01:38.959> noticed<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.530> said<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.920> turn<00:01:40.069> it

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
you probably noticed it said to turn it

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.429 
you probably noticed it said to turn it
from<00:01:40.280> semi<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:40.729> full<00:01:40.909> auto<00:01:41.149> when<00:01:41.569> I<00:01:41.600> decided<00:01:42.289> to

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
from semi to full auto when I decided to

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.120 
from semi to full auto when I decided to
use<00:01:42.469> his<00:01:42.679> foot<00:01:42.859> function<00:01:43.219> for<00:01:43.399> this<00:01:43.520> gun<00:01:43.789> um<00:01:44.750> it

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
use his foot function for this gun um it

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.559 
use his foot function for this gun um it
technically<00:01:46.130> is<00:01:46.250> full<00:01:46.729> auto<00:01:46.939> but<00:01:47.329> it

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
technically is full auto but it

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.740 
technically is full auto but it
technically<00:01:48.409> isn't<00:01:48.709> at<00:01:49.069> the<00:01:49.220> same<00:01:49.489> time<00:01:49.909> now

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
technically isn't at the same time now

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.139 
technically isn't at the same time now
what<00:01:51.020> do<00:01:51.079> I<00:01:51.140> mean<00:01:51.200> by<00:01:51.349> that<00:01:51.469> well<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.489> the<00:01:53.000> rate

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
what do I mean by that well it the rate

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:54.609 
what do I mean by that well it the rate
of<00:01:53.179> fire<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:53.719> slow<00:01:54.049> when<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.289> turn<00:01:54.439> it<00:01:54.469> on

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
of fire is so slow when you turn it on

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.899 
of fire is so slow when you turn it on
full<00:01:54.799> auto<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.219> might<00:01:55.369> as<00:01:55.459> well<00:01:55.549> be<00:01:55.670> shooting

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
full auto you might as well be shooting

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:08.080 
full auto you might as well be shooting
at<00:01:56.000> semi<00:01:56.149> automatic<00:01:56.539> anyway<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:06.789> the<00:02:07.789> reload

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
at semi automatic anyway and the reload

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.680 
at semi automatic anyway and the reload
is<00:02:08.329> painfully<00:02:09.019> slow<00:02:09.049> as<00:02:09.500> you<00:02:09.679> would<00:02:09.799> expect

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.119 

also<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.810> spread<00:02:15.140> seems<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.650> be<00:02:15.769> the

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129 
also the spread seems to be the

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:18.640 
also the spread seems to be the
equivalent<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.239> KSG<00:02:17.630> spread<00:02:18.170> when<00:02:18.530> you

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
equivalent of the KSG spread when you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.000 
equivalent of the KSG spread when you
put<00:02:18.829> it<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.100> widespread<00:02:20.530> so<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:21.829> is<00:02:21.980> uh

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
put it to widespread so it is uh

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.330 
put it to widespread so it is uh
definitely<00:02:22.579> very<00:02:23.510> very<00:02:23.799> it's<00:02:24.799> a<00:02:24.920> close-range

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
definitely very very it's a close-range

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.789 
definitely very very it's a close-range
shot<00:02:25.430> gun<00:02:25.730> it<00:02:25.850> doesn't<00:02:26.060> have<00:02:26.150> much<00:02:26.299> range

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
shot gun it doesn't have much range

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.710 
shot gun it doesn't have much range
which<00:02:27.799> is<00:02:27.920> funny<00:02:28.099> that<00:02:28.370> this<00:02:29.060> gun<00:02:29.299> not<00:02:29.480> having

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
which is funny that this gun not having

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.660 
which is funny that this gun not having
much<00:02:29.840> range<00:02:30.079> is<00:02:30.230> pretty<00:02:30.440> much<00:02:30.560> having<00:02:31.430> way

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
much range is pretty much having way

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.069 
much range is pretty much having way
more<00:02:31.700> range<00:02:32.150> than<00:02:32.269> shotguns<00:02:32.569> in<00:02:32.780> most<00:02:32.959> other

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
more range than shotguns in most other

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.750 
more range than shotguns in most other
games<00:02:33.290> I<00:02:33.590> love<00:02:33.920> killing<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.400> for<00:02:34.579> having

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
games I love killing for for having

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.699 
games I love killing for for having
shotguns<00:02:35.120> that<00:02:35.239> actually<00:02:35.540> reached<00:02:35.750> past<00:02:36.079> 10

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
shotguns that actually reached past 10

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:48.280 
shotguns that actually reached past 10
feet

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.710 

and<00:02:49.610> when<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:50.700> aim<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:50.880> spread<00:02:51.360> doesn't<00:02:51.600> seem

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
and when you aim the spread doesn't seem

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.120 
and when you aim the spread doesn't seem
to<00:02:51.840> change<00:02:54.230> although<00:02:55.230> as<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:55.440> was<00:02:55.680> saying<00:02:55.920> about

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
to change although as I was saying about

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.890 
to change although as I was saying about
thankfully<00:02:56.910> killing<00:02:57.180> four<00:02:57.330> shotguns<00:02:57.569> have
