watercraft racing comm and I want to

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.099 
watercraft racing comm and I want to
tell<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.220> guys<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.699> about<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.240> new<00:00:21.420> sponsor<00:00:21.960> we

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
tell you guys or about a new sponsor we

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.720 
tell you guys or about a new sponsor we
have<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.710> our<00:00:23.640> new<00:00:24.210> Blaster<00:00:25.050> sponsor<00:00:25.920> now

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
have it's our new Blaster sponsor now

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.820 
have it's our new Blaster sponsor now
you'll<00:00:27.000> see<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.660> sponson<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> little

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you'll see that this sponson is a little

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.380 
you'll see that this sponson is a little
bit<00:00:28.949> different<00:00:29.279> than<00:00:29.400> your<00:00:29.519> normal<00:00:29.699> one<00:00:30.090> we

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
bit different than your normal one we

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.049 
bit different than your normal one we
have<00:00:30.539> integrated<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.740> lip<00:00:32.550> here<00:00:32.850> which

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
have integrated in a lip here which

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.700 
have integrated in a lip here which
we're<00:00:33.239> calling<00:00:33.360> sort<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:33.930> mimic<00:00:34.350> bond

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
we're calling sort of a mimic bond

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
we're calling sort of a mimic bond
flange<00:00:35.100> which<00:00:35.969> will<00:00:36.440> fit<00:00:37.520> about<00:00:38.520> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
flange which will fit about this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.110 
flange which will fit about this
position<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.440> ski<00:00:40.770> now<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> reason<00:00:42.090> for

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
position on the ski now the reason for

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.930 
position on the ski now the reason for
this<00:00:42.480> bond<00:00:42.780> flange<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:44.070> we've<00:00:44.250> seen<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.820> this

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
this bond flange that we've seen on this

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
this bond flange that we've seen on this
especially<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.840> water<00:00:46.260> prop<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
especially this water prop is that the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.150 
especially this water prop is that the
stock<00:00:48.030> barn<00:00:48.329> flinch<00:00:48.660> curves<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.950> what

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
stock barn flinch curves up so what

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
stock barn flinch curves up so what
happens<00:00:50.640> there<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.170> into<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
happens there is when you get into a

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.010 
happens there is when you get into a
turn<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.340> bond<00:00:53.640> times<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.270> catching<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
turn this bond times is not catching the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.680 
turn this bond times is not catching the
water<00:00:55.230> enough<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:55.890> create<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.489> stability<00:00:56.699> so

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
water enough to create the stability so

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.180 
water enough to create the stability so
you<00:00:57.750> can<00:00:57.930> go<00:00:58.020> fast<00:00:58.379> in<00:00:58.649> those<00:00:58.770> rougher

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you can go fast in those rougher

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000 
you can go fast in those rougher
conditions<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.000> designing<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.170> sponson<00:01:01.829> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
conditions so designing the sponson we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.030 
conditions so designing the sponson we
integrated<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.789> this<00:01:02.969> mimic<00:01:03.570> bond<00:01:03.840> flange<00:01:04.229> so

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
integrated in this mimic bond flange so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
integrated in this mimic bond flange so
you<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> stability<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> grip

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
you can get that stability in that grip

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
you can get that stability in that grip
sooner<00:01:07.710> in<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.950> term<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.270> to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
sooner in the term which is going to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.990 
sooner in the term which is going to
give<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.689> more<00:01:09.990> turning<00:01:10.380> grip<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.000> more

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
give you more turning grip and more

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.179 
give you more turning grip and more
stability<00:01:12.330> while<00:01:12.750> you're<00:01:12.900> racing<00:01:13.409> you'll<00:01:14.040> be

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
stability while you're racing you'll be

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.520 
stability while you're racing you'll be
amazed<00:01:14.490> on<00:01:14.909> how<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.720> works<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> we're<00:01:16.409> going

Tommy Bonacci and some of the other guys

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.490 
Tommy Bonacci and some of the other guys
are<00:01:26.880> riding<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:27.630> sponsons<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
are riding with these sponsons and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.069 
are riding with these sponsons and
they're<00:01:29.009> loving<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.759> let's<00:01:30.210> get<00:01:30.360> into<00:01:30.659> how

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
they're loving it so let's get into how

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.100 
they're loving it so let's get into how
we<00:01:31.140> install<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:35.729> first<00:01:36.000> step<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.479> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
we install it the first step is to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.730 
we install it the first step is to
measure<00:01:37.409> from<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.759> hole<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
measure from the back of the hole to the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.069 
measure from the back of the hole to the
position<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> back<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.880> sponson<00:01:42.450> you

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
position of the back of the sponson you

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.399 
position of the back of the sponson you
want<00:01:43.259> to<00:01:43.350> have<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.680> at<00:01:43.920> 35<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.299> half

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
want to have this at 35 and a half

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.620 
want to have this at 35 and a half
inches<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:47.310> back<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.270> hole<00:01:48.450> so

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
inches from the back of the hole so

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.270 
inches from the back of the hole so
you're<00:01:48.780> measuring<00:01:48.960> for<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.320> very<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.220> if

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
you're measuring for the very back so if

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
you're measuring for the very back so if
you<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.490> full<00:01:50.880> extensions<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.570> want<00:01:51.750> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
you have full extensions you want to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.240 
you have full extensions you want to
measure<00:01:51.930> from<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> original<00:01:52.770> back<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
measure from the original back of the

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
measure from the original back of the
hole<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> sponson<00:01:57.060> so

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
hole to the back of the sponson so

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.950 
hole to the back of the sponson so
you'll<00:01:57.420> mark<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> pen

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.860 

so<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.650> got<00:02:01.800> 35<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> half<00:02:02.490> now<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.330> want<00:02:03.840> to

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
so we got 35 and a half now you want to

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.560 
so we got 35 and a half now you want to
come<00:02:04.110> from<00:02:04.470> underneath<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.150> want<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> go

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
come from underneath and you want to go

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.440 
come from underneath and you want to go
an<00:02:06.720> inch<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> half<00:02:07.380> down<00:02:08.250> from<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
an inch and a half down from the

so<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.960> have<00:03:42.110> my<00:03:42.230> sponsons<00:03:42.800> screwed<00:03:43.220> on<00:03:43.400> it's<00:03:43.790> a

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
so I have my sponsons screwed on it's a

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.960 
so I have my sponsons screwed on it's a
pre<00:03:44.090> fit<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.690> next<00:03:44.960> step<00:03:45.200> is<00:03:45.490> we<00:03:46.490> want<00:03:46.520> to<00:03:46.700> tape

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
pre fit the next step is we want to tape

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.810 
pre fit the next step is we want to tape
off<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.540> sponson<00:03:48.080> so<00:03:48.380> we<00:03:48.560> silicone<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.610> this

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:49.820 
off the sponson so we silicone so this

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.360 
off the sponson so we silicone so this
is<00:03:49.970> thanks<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.480> Garriott<00:03:51.050> jet<00:03:51.410> rim<00:03:51.620> his<00:03:51.950> idea

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
is thanks to Garriott jet rim his idea

is thanks to Garriott jet rim his idea
thanks<00:03:52.730> Kerry<00:03:56.350> I'm<00:03:57.350> just<00:03:57.580> doing<00:03:58.580> a<00:03:58.670> little<00:03:58.700> bit

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
thanks Kerry I'm just doing a little bit

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.140 
thanks Kerry I'm just doing a little bit
so<00:03:59.540> there's<00:03:59.750> like<00:03:59.900> an<00:04:00.170> eighth<00:04:00.800> inch<00:04:00.830> on<00:04:01.670> each

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
so there's like an eighth inch on each

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
so there's like an eighth inch on each
sponson<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.890> in<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.760> hole<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.240> when<00:04:06.050> we

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
sponson and and in the hole so when we

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.810 
sponson and and in the hole so when we
do<00:04:06.320> silicone<00:04:06.800> we<00:04:06.920> pull<00:04:07.130> off<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.340> tape<00:04:07.550> and

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
do silicone we pull off the tape and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.820 
do silicone we pull off the tape and
it's<00:04:07.940> super<00:04:08.390> easy<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.720> clean<00:04:09.170> so<00:04:09.500> it's<00:04:09.650> a

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
it's super easy and clean so it's a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:20.869 
it's super easy and clean so it's a
great<00:04:10.220> idea

00:04:20.869 --> 00:04:20.879 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.450 

the<00:04:21.879> sponsors<00:04:22.389> been<00:04:22.569> pre-fitted<00:04:23.199> we<00:04:23.889> taped<00:04:24.250> it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
the sponsors been pre-fitted we taped it

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.920 
the sponsors been pre-fitted we taped it
so<00:04:24.610> we<00:04:24.729> know<00:04:24.879> exactly<00:04:25.000> where<00:04:25.599> it's<00:04:25.720> going<00:04:25.840> to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
so we know exactly where it's going to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.350 
so we know exactly where it's going to
go<00:04:26.020> back<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:27.669> now<00:04:27.759> we're<00:04:27.849> going<00:04:27.939> to<00:04:28.000> pull<00:04:28.210> the

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
go back and now we're going to pull the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.899 
go back and now we're going to pull the
sponson<00:04:28.840> off<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.229> we<00:04:29.349> can<00:04:29.530> run<00:04:30.039> a<00:04:30.069> silicon<00:04:30.729> bead

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
sponson off so we can run a silicon bead

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.390 
sponson off so we can run a silicon bead
all<00:04:31.240> the<00:04:31.270> way<00:04:31.539> around<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.259> edge<00:04:32.409> around<00:04:33.009> each

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
all the way around the edge around each

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.209 
all the way around the edge around each
hole<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:34.150> each<00:04:34.780> hole<00:04:35.110> is<00:04:35.289> got<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:35.770> little<00:04:35.919> bit<00:04:36.129> of

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219 
hole so each hole is got a little bit of

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.909 
hole so each hole is got a little bit of
silicone<00:04:36.669> in<00:04:36.879> it<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.539> it<00:04:37.659> goes<00:04:37.840> on<00:04:38.139> it<00:04:38.319> seals<00:04:38.710> on

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
silicone in it so it goes on it seals on

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.520 
silicone in it so it goes on it seals on
really<00:04:39.310> well<00:04:39.479> this<00:04:40.479> is<00:04:40.659> a<00:04:40.689> supplied<00:04:41.289> silicone

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
really well this is a supplied silicone
