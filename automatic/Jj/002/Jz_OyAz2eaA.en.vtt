00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
this one is typing in a bunch of code

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.380 
this one is typing in a bunch of code
the<00:00:16.440> easier<00:00:16.830> way<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.310> to<00:00:17.940> follow<00:00:18.150> my

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
the easier way is to follow my

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
the easier way is to follow my
directions<00:00:18.690> which<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.199> right<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:19.529> because

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
directions which is right here because

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.480 
directions which is right here because
we<00:00:20.970> have<00:00:21.090> made<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> PL<00:00:21.900> list<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.220> going<00:00:23.430> to

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
we have made a PL list which is going to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
we have made a PL list which is going to
be<00:00:23.550> much<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.119> easier<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.840> do<00:00:25.560> much<00:00:25.800> more

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
be much more easier to do much more

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.070 
be much more easier to do much more
simple<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.550> we're<00:00:26.730> fast<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.660> first<00:00:27.930> I'll

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
simple much we're fast so first I'll

you start shooting all the dots and I
you<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.719> from<00:00:49.230> turret<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.710> turret<00:00:50.070> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
do right now he code will have a bunch

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.770 
do right now he code will have a bunch
of<00:03:42.769> seven<00:03:43.130> days<00:03:43.250> um<00:03:43.690> seven<00:03:44.690> bees<00:03:46.180> some<00:03:47.180> sixes
