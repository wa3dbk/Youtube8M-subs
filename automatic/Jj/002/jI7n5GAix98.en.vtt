presentation in this presentation we

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.990 
presentation in this presentation we
will<00:02:39.440> outline<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:40.190> general<00:02:40.580> history<00:02:40.910> of

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
will outline the general history of

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.210 
will outline the general history of
video<00:02:41.420> games<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.110> industry<00:02:42.590> as<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.100> is

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
video games and the industry as it is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.000 
video games and the industry as it is
pertinent<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.760> physics<00:02:44.180> engines<00:02:44.890> we<00:02:45.890> will

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
pertinent to physics engines we will

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.710 
pertinent to physics engines we will
then<00:02:46.190> discuss<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.730> current<00:02:46.940> trends<00:02:47.420> in<00:02:47.450> the

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
then discuss the current trends in the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.860 
then discuss the current trends in the
use<00:02:47.840> of<00:02:48.020> physics<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:48.590> video<00:02:48.890> burners<00:02:49.280> and

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
use of physics and video burners and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.150 
use of physics and video burners and
finally<00:02:50.870> we<00:02:51.080> will<00:02:51.230> explore<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:51.830> current

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
finally we will explore the current

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.070 
finally we will explore the current
industry<00:02:52.459> landscape<00:02:52.820> and<00:02:53.390> state<00:02:53.630> of<00:02:53.750> physics

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
industry landscape and state of physics

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.600 
industry landscape and state of physics
engines<00:02:56.200> now<00:02:57.200> Chelsea<00:02:57.860> will<00:02:58.010> discuss<00:02:58.340> video

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
engines now Chelsea will discuss video

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.030
