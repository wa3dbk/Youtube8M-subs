00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
difficult for me to chop the sample I
couldn't<00:01:30.900> chop<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.110> sample<00:01:31.650> directly<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.400> FL<00:01:32.880> I

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
couldn't chop a sample directly in FL I

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179 
couldn't chop a sample directly in FL I
had<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> use<00:01:33.840> Adobe<00:01:34.229> Audition<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.740> think<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.040> was

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
had to use Adobe Audition I think I was

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.710 
had to use Adobe Audition I think I was
using<00:01:35.220> import<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.119> audio<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.450> Adobe

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
using import the audio and Adobe

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
using import the audio and Adobe
Audition

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
Audition

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.690 
Audition
I<00:01:37.320> would<00:01:37.650> chop<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> sample<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.579> would

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I would chop the sample and then I would

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.880 
I would chop the sample and then I would
greet<00:01:38.909> him<00:01:39.060> for<00:01:39.299> all<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.570> sample<00:01:39.930> slices<00:01:40.350> into

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
greet him for all the sample slices into

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.190 
greet him for all the sample slices into
FL<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.880> chop<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.390> any<00:01:42.540> sample<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
FL and chop it or any sample and so I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.600 
FL and chop it or any sample and so I
was<00:01:43.350> working<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.770> for<00:01:44.100> awhile<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
was working with that for awhile but I

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
was working with that for awhile but I
felt<00:01:45.149> very<00:01:45.659> limited<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.259> didn't<00:01:46.500> really<00:01:46.710> like

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
felt very limited I didn't really like

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.039 
felt very limited I didn't really like
the<00:01:47.220> workflow<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.479> got<00:01:48.600> introduced

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
the workflow then I got introduced

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
the workflow then I got introduced
Ableton<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.770> I<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> figured

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
Ableton and I got into that and figured

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.030 
Ableton and I got into that and figured
out<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.420> okay<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.840> can<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.680> can<00:01:52.710> chop

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
out that okay I can do this I can chop

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
out that okay I can do this I can chop
samples<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> lot<00:01:53.640> quicker<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> do<00:01:54.180> this<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.570> the

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
samples a lot quicker and do this on the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
samples a lot quicker and do this on the
box<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.799> what<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.009> do<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.670> take<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.240> tracks

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
box and for what I do I take the tracks

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.480 
box and for what I do I take the tracks
that<00:01:57.630> I'm<00:01:57.750> making<00:01:58.110> from<00:01:58.320> my<00:01:58.530> thought<00:01:58.950> process

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
that I'm making from my thought process

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.120 
that I'm making from my thought process
and<00:01:59.700> live<00:01:59.880> creative<00:02:00.450> flow<00:02:00.799> Ableton<00:02:01.799> works

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
and live creative flow Ableton works

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.240 
and live creative flow Ableton works
great<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.820> other

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
great but for other

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.560 
great but for other
they<00:02:03.400> open<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.760> up<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.030> they're<00:02:04.120> like<00:02:04.270> I<00:02:04.390> don't

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
they open it up and they're like I don't

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.730 
they open it up and they're like I don't
really<00:02:04.690> even<00:02:04.810> know<00:02:04.900> how<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.050> get<00:02:05.260> started<00:02:05.620> with

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
really even know how to get started with

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.880 
really even know how to get started with
this<00:02:05.860> versus<00:02:06.430> using<00:02:07.240> an<00:02:07.420> FL<00:02:07.810> sequence<00:02:08.229> or<00:02:08.410> some

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
this versus using an FL sequence or some

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.380 
this versus using an FL sequence or some
other<00:02:09.070> software<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:09.820> again<00:02:10.090> like<00:02:10.240> I<00:02:10.360> mentioned

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
other software so again like I mentioned

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.690 
other software so again like I mentioned
in<00:02:10.929> that<00:02:11.050> video<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.710> just<00:02:11.890> start<00:02:12.490> with

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
in that video is just start with

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.280 
in that video is just start with

my my recommendation will be the master
in<00:02:16.540> that<00:02:16.570> particular<00:02:17.080> software<00:02:17.770> because<00:02:18.130> you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
in that particular software because you

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.850 
in that particular software because you
can<00:02:18.550> have<00:02:18.850> great<00:02:19.330> music<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.500> in<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.709> most

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
simple software application I mean you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.690 
simple software application I mean you
hear<00:02:23.440> a<00:02:23.500> lot<00:02:23.740> of<00:02:23.890> dope<00:02:24.100> tracks<00:02:24.490> those

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
hear a lot of dope tracks those

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.400 
hear a lot of dope tracks those
producers<00:02:25.150> online<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.810> are<00:02:25.840> making<00:02:26.080> beats

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
producers online that are making beats

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.290 
producers online that are making beats
they<00:02:26.890> use<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.400> wide<00:02:27.730> array<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.120> different

look<00:02:39.820> at<00:02:39.940> some<00:02:40.090> tutorial<00:02:40.600> in<00:02:40.690> this<00:02:40.810> particular

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
look at some tutorial in this particular

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.229 
look at some tutorial in this particular
software<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:41.920> master<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:43.000> me<00:02:43.120> it

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
software and master this to me it

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.520 
software and master this to me it
doesn't<00:02:43.420> matter<00:02:43.690> like<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.260> doesn't

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
doesn't matter like it really doesn't

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.199 
doesn't matter like it really doesn't
matter<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.860> end<00:02:45.070> result<00:02:45.550> is<00:02:45.700> what<00:02:45.940> matters

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
matter the end result is what matters

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.330 
matter the end result is what matters
and<00:02:46.570> so<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.959> second<00:02:47.260> part<00:02:47.470> was<00:02:47.680> asking<00:02:48.250> about

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
and so the second part was asking about

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.610 
and so the second part was asking about
purchasing<00:02:49.239> hardware<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:49.959> an<00:02:50.080> MPC<00:02:50.410> or

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
purchasing hardware like an MPC or

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.229 
purchasing hardware like an MPC or
synthesizer<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.670> for<00:02:51.850> those<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.120> guys

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
I'm getting a 32 controller I've got

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.660 
I'm getting a 32 controller I've got
another<00:03:01.900> electric<00:03:02.770> piano<00:03:03.100> over<00:03:03.250> here<00:03:03.430> which<00:03:03.580> I

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
another electric piano over here which I

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.400 
another electric piano over here which I
use<00:03:03.850> as<00:03:03.970> a<00:03:04.030> MIDI<00:03:04.209> controller<00:03:04.690> it's<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:04.989> sample

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
use as a MIDI controller it's all sample

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.229 
use as a MIDI controller it's all sample
base<00:03:05.590> in<00:03:05.890> it's<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.190> virtual<00:03:06.430> instruments<00:03:07.150> so

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
base in it's all virtual instruments so

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.060 
base in it's all virtual instruments so
currently<00:03:07.660> today<00:03:08.080> I've<00:03:08.470> never<00:03:08.739> personally

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
currently today I've never personally

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.880 
currently today I've never personally
used<00:03:09.580> any<00:03:09.910> hardware<00:03:10.450> like<00:03:10.810> an<00:03:10.989> MPC<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.739> that's

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
used any hardware like an MPC and that's

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.890 
used any hardware like an MPC and that's
a<00:03:12.040> misconception<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.730> lot<00:03:12.880> of<00:03:12.940> people<00:03:13.150> make<00:03:13.660> is

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
a misconception a lot of people make is

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.710 
a misconception a lot of people make is
they<00:03:13.930> see<00:03:14.110> this<00:03:14.610> if<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.880> need<00:03:16.120> this

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
they see this if you need this

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.449 
they see this if you need this
controller<00:03:17.230> because<00:03:17.680> it's<00:03:17.799> made<00:03:18.010> by<00:03:18.160> a<00:03:18.190> guy

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
controller because it's made by a guy

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.940 
controller because it's made by a guy
that<00:03:18.790> looks<00:03:18.970> maybe<00:03:19.330> similar<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.170> PC<00:03:20.769> and

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
that looks maybe similar to a PC and

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.800 
that looks maybe similar to a PC and
they<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.160> automatically<00:03:21.610> assume<00:03:22.000> because

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
they just automatically assume because

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.940 
they just automatically assume because
of<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:22.989> sound<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.500> that's<00:03:23.560> another<00:03:23.830> thing

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
of the sound and that's another thing

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.160 
of the sound and that's another thing
that<00:03:24.400> there's<00:03:24.910> a<00:03:25.090> misconception<00:03:25.420> I<00:03:25.900> feel<00:03:26.080> like

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
that there's a misconception I feel like

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.500 
that there's a misconception I feel like
to<00:03:26.410> with<00:03:26.680> you<00:03:27.310> seeing<00:03:27.610> some<00:03:27.880> maybe<00:03:28.150> order

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
to with you seeing some maybe order

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.509 
to with you seeing some maybe order
producers<00:03:28.989> or<00:03:29.140> producers<00:03:29.530> that<00:03:29.739> particularly

producers or producers that particularly

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.789 
producers or producers that particularly
use<00:03:30.730> an<00:03:30.910> MPC<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:31.840> look<00:03:32.079> at<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.350> light<00:03:32.590> if

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
use an MPC and you look at that light if

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:34.500 
use an MPC and you look at that light if
I<00:03:32.920> want<00:03:33.160> this<00:03:33.310> type<00:03:33.519> of<00:03:33.549> sound<00:03:33.790> I've<00:03:33.970> got<00:03:34.299> to

I want this type of sound I've got to

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.170 
I want this type of sound I've got to
use<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.720> piece<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.290> hardware<00:03:35.530> and<00:03:36.040> yes<00:03:36.910> where

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
use that piece of hardware and yes where

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.090 
use that piece of hardware and yes where
there<00:03:37.329> is<00:03:37.510> some<00:03:38.079> warmth<00:03:38.560> in<00:03:38.769> some<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.040> these

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
there is some warmth in some of these

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.020

that<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.829> know<00:03:44.920> if<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.130> want<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.370> MPC<00:03:45.850> swing<00:03:46.120> I

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
that you know if I want to MPC swing I

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.750 
that you know if I want to MPC swing I
can<00:03:46.450> emulate<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.959> in<00:03:47.079> Ableton<00:03:47.650> or<00:03:48.040> if<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.400> want

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
can emulate that in Ableton or if I want

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.819 
can emulate that in Ableton or if I want
to<00:03:49.000> create<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.420> certain<00:03:49.720> type<00:03:49.930> of<00:03:49.959> sound<00:03:50.380> I<00:03:50.620> can

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
to create a certain type of sound I can

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.250 
to create a certain type of sound I can
pretty<00:03:51.100> much<00:03:51.190> be<00:03:51.760> able<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> do<00:03:52.209> that<00:03:52.390> in<00:03:52.660> in<00:03:52.930> a

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
pretty much be able to do that in in a

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.440 
pretty much be able to do that in in a
machine<00:03:53.650> or<00:03:54.010> some<00:03:54.489> other<00:03:54.730> type<00:03:54.910> of<00:03:55.060> software

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.350 
machine or some other type of software
or<00:03:55.570> works

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
or works

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.610 
or works

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
remember when I first started making

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.590 
remember when I first started making
beats<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:27.890> I<00:04:27.950> had<00:04:28.130> FL<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.000> was<00:04:29.150> using<00:04:29.330> an

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
beats and I had FL and I was using an

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.420 
beats and I had FL and I was using an
audio<00:04:29.960> trigger<00:04:30.440> finger<00:04:30.830> which<00:04:31.010> is<00:04:31.040> about<00:04:31.370> I

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
audio trigger finger which is about I

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.090 
audio trigger finger which is about I
think<00:04:31.880> at<00:04:32.120> the<00:04:32.240> time<00:04:32.450> was<00:04:32.750> about<00:04:32.960> $100<00:04:33.530> its<00:04:33.800> new

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
think at the time was about $100 its new

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.580 
think at the time was about $100 its new
and<00:04:34.790> I<00:04:34.850> might<00:04:35.330> have<00:04:35.419> got<00:04:35.540> it<00:04:35.660> used<00:04:35.900> even<00:04:36.320> just<00:04:36.500> a

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
and I might have got it used even just a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.409 
and I might have got it used even just a
basic<00:04:37.010> run<00:04:37.220> pad<00:04:37.430> and<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:37.970> I<00:04:38.000> actually

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
basic run pad and then I actually

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.920 
basic run pad and then I actually
borrowed<00:04:38.900> a<00:04:39.440> 49<00:04:40.250> key<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:41.090> wasn't<00:04:41.450> even<00:04:41.630> a

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
borrowed a 49 key it wasn't even a

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.530 
borrowed a 49 key it wasn't even a
designated<00:04:42.800> MIDI<00:04:43.400> keyboard<00:04:44.150> he<00:04:44.270> just<00:04:44.419> had

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
designated MIDI keyboard he just had

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.270 
designated MIDI keyboard he just had
mini<00:04:44.810> capabilities<00:04:45.500> it<00:04:45.590> was<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.740> very<00:04:45.950> cheap

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
mini capabilities it was a very cheap

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.310 
mini capabilities it was a very cheap
keyboard<00:04:46.850> that<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.090> borrowed<00:04:47.510> from<00:04:47.540> I<00:04:48.020> think<00:04:48.230> a

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
keyboard that I borrowed from I think a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.930 
keyboard that I borrowed from I think a
friend<00:04:48.620> a<00:04:48.770> family<00:04:48.950> member<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.580> wasn't<00:04:49.850> the

friend a family member it wasn't the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.090 
friend a family member it wasn't the
best<00:04:50.180> controller<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:50.990> at<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.200> time<00:04:51.440> I<00:04:51.830> was<00:04:52.010> on

software<00:04:54.260> I<00:04:54.560> was<00:04:54.770> good<00:04:55.010> and<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.250> could<00:04:55.310> do<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.580> lot

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
software I was good and I could do a lot

software I was good and I could do a lot
of<00:04:55.790> stuff<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.090> like<00:04:56.270> I<00:04:56.360> said<00:04:56.510> before<00:04:56.690> when<00:04:56.900> I

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.610 
started feeling limited and constrained
within<00:04:59.000> the<00:04:59.270> setup<00:04:59.480> that<00:04:59.690> I<00:04:59.720> had<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.320> when<00:05:00.560> I

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
within the setup that I had is when I
