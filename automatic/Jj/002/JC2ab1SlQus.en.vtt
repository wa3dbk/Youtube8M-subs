00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.070 
speak Virginia as a whole was got a rich
heritage<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.750> cattle<00:01:57.050> business

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
heritage in the cattle business

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.900 
heritage in the cattle business
especially<00:01:57.830> the<00:01:57.920> Angus<00:01:58.220> business<00:01:58.580> so<00:01:58.730> we've

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
especially the Angus business so we've

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.290 
especially the Angus business so we've
had<00:01:59.060> some<00:01:59.120> of<00:01:59.360> the<00:01:59.450> premier<00:01:59.930> breeders<00:02:01.030> in<00:02:02.030> this

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
had some of the premier breeders in this

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.650 
had some of the premier breeders in this
area<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.690> have<00:02:02.870> come<00:02:03.350> from<00:02:03.470> Virginia<00:02:03.980> and<00:02:04.010> I

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
area that have come from Virginia and I

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.109 
area that have come from Virginia and I
think<00:02:05.660> it's<00:02:05.810> about<00:02:06.110> 18th<00:02:06.650> or<00:02:06.890> 19th<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.580> beef

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
think it's about 18th or 19th and beef

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.690 
think it's about 18th or 19th and beef
cow<00:02:08.330> production<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.950> it's<00:02:10.130> not<00:02:10.250> quite<00:02:10.490> like

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
cow production so it's not quite like

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.970 
cow production so it's not quite like
the<00:02:10.880> Midwest<00:02:11.060> but<00:02:11.480> do<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.380> lot<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.620> a<00:02:12.740> lot<00:02:12.950> of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
real I think a real consciousness of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.830 
real I think a real consciousness of
where<00:02:39.890> your<00:02:40.100> food<00:02:40.310> comes<00:02:40.550> from<00:02:40.730> so<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.360> we<00:02:41.690> get

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
where your food comes from so we we get

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.660 
where your food comes from so we we get
a<00:02:41.870> lot<00:02:42.020> of<00:02:42.110> people<00:02:42.350> out<00:02:42.500> here<00:02:42.530> and

a lot of people out here and

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.449 
a lot of people out here and
a place<00:02:44.300> like<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.660> is<00:02:44.900> just<00:02:45.770> important<00:02:46.250> it's

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
a place like this is just important it's

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.059 
a place like this is just important it's
a<00:02:46.670> it's<00:02:47.000> an<00:02:47.150> avenue<00:02:47.360> for<00:02:47.480> those<00:02:47.810> people<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.200> to

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
a it's an avenue for those people to to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:50.320 
a it's an avenue for those people to to
see<00:02:49.250> those<00:02:49.459> things<00:02:49.670> that<00:02:49.880> they<00:02:50.030> probably

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
see those things that they probably

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.970 
see those things that they probably
wouldn't<00:02:50.720> see<00:02:50.870> if<00:02:51.020> they<00:02:51.170> were<00:02:51.230> in<00:02:51.440> Richmond<00:02:51.830> or

if they were in the Charlottesville or

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.140 
if they were in the Charlottesville or
something<00:02:53.690> like<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.870> all<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> time

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
something like that all the time

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.870 
something like that all the time
smaller<00:02:56.150> numbers<00:02:56.569> allow<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:57.530> more<00:02:58.400> time<00:02:58.610> to

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
smaller numbers allow you more time to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.809 
smaller numbers allow you more time to
manage<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.599> time<00:02:59.810> to<00:03:00.400> scheme<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.610> dream

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
manage and more time to scheme and dream

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.180 
manage and more time to scheme and dream
as<00:03:02.000> I<00:03:02.120> say<00:03:02.330> I<00:03:02.750> think<00:03:03.110> I've<00:03:03.260> got<00:03:03.410> time<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.680> to

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
as I say I think I've got time to to

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
as I say I think I've got time to to
study<00:03:04.459> each<00:03:04.700> individual<00:03:05.330> cow<00:03:05.480> kind<00:03:05.930> of<00:03:05.989> know

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
study each individual cow kind of know

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.280 
study each individual cow kind of know
how<00:03:06.319> she<00:03:06.380> performs<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.959> after<00:03:08.959> I've<00:03:09.050> seen<00:03:09.260> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
how she performs and after I've seen a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.020 
how she performs and after I've seen a
cap<00:03:09.560> or<00:03:09.709> two<00:03:09.860> from<00:03:10.069> her<00:03:10.220> or<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.580> ones<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.910> we

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
cap or two from her or the ones that we

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.680 
cap or two from her or the ones that we
have<00:03:12.069> identity<00:03:13.069> or<00:03:13.280> visor<00:03:13.730> profiles<00:03:14.300> on<00:03:14.510> we've

have identity or visor profiles on we've

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.410 
have identity or visor profiles on we've
got<00:03:14.810> some<00:03:15.050> grymps<00:03:15.650> into<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.010> future<00:03:16.340> and<00:03:16.580> I

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
got some grymps into the future and I

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.650 
got some grymps into the future and I
think<00:03:18.110> you<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.860> can<00:03:19.100> manage<00:03:19.910> what<00:03:20.510> you
