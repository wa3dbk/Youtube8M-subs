 I eat in other previous activities 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.280
 to present to you today concretely what 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.710
 that are little hearts for halloween 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.960
 can be used at any time 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.210
 of the year but we have wanted 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.430
 locate them in halloween because good and 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.739
 you are seeing the decoration 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.470
 that is very very very destined 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.060
 to this wonderful and good date 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.649
 then we can use it as a 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.660
 necklace then to hang on the tree 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.719
 halloween or so to hang ore as 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.920
 made me in this case that pretty to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.420
 even for slopes we have seen the 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.370
 possibility the other day we did not 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 this activity for slopes and stays 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.050
 superbly right these dates 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 Well, tell us what they need 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.829
 Well, this activity is very simple 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.960
 like all those that we propose and always 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:55.690
 Well with recycled materials in this 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.670
 good case then we propose the role of 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.699
 gift to make it look nice on the outside 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.020
 orange scissors a marker or 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.910
 marker pen 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.400
 to be able to remember it then do the 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.740
 eyes the sequins mouth is the 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.700
 decoration that we propose and a 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:16.140
 needle and thread to be able to set 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.140
 later and be able to make the necklace 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:23.500
 we started dale activity 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.150
 this is very simple guys and girls 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.420
 we are talking a corner 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 and then superimposing it with the 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.960
 following 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.530
 is always maintaining what is the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.570
 horizontality 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.180
 ask even 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.180
 and we continue to double command 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.100
 well we are already reaching the end of 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.340
 this activity so beautiful the corazoncito 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:58.670
 well I want you to not forget to tell you 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.619
 boys and girls that we are going to leave almost 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.740
 we are not going to fold is this last strip 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:06.770
 and I want to tell you guys and girls that the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 normally the paper strips have 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.120
 to have a relationship is to say that yes 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.690
 we make the width the width of the 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.510
 strip 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.970
 in this case the width of the two strip 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.590
 centimeters multiply by 10 220 if 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.180
 we would choose 3 centimeters 30 440 this 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.480
 kind of relationship always multiplying 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.580
 by 10 clear then there is the thickness that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 we want to give the activity that is 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.700
 if we want to give much more thickness to the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.130
 heart 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.950
 therefore give it more laps we have 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.269
 that make the strip much longer the 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.340
 quality of the paper because we 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.170
 We propose quality paper 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.290
 gift because it is a ductile paper is a 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.730
 Thin paper and it is very easy to handle 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.930
 work can be done with a folio 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:56.170
 but good 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 and this is as simple as this fatty 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.650
 apply 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.590
 cut the flap a little shorter 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.060
 and I do the tabs a tab for 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.560
 here and another here and just not 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:15.260
 very easy and just in the last flap 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.150
 Then I see you is as simple as 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.599
 is now 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.290
 eye friends here comes the question 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.640
 important and that is that we now press 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 we take like that we press just by the 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.120
 part of inside 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.420
 the half of the form is being made 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.550
 heart 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.350
 here 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.740
 by the two corners the two with successes 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.819
 to be able to do now the part of the 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.920
 heart let's go let's do 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.540
 remembering on the edges his and 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.540
 edges so that it is rounded 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.850
 and you see that it is remaining redondito 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.260
 we have something more symmetrical so that 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.260
 be more proportionate 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.139
 next step or it ensues good better 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.019
 said first one decorates that is to say 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.700
 he paints his eyes, his mouth and so on and 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.700
 then it is passed to the goose 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.590
 I believe that the best thing to be able to decorate 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.200
 we're going to crush him and finally 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.450
 then what 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.820
 we return it we give it the form 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.670
 okay so let's paint it then 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.550
 what do I know then triangular eyes 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.420
 for example one is worth a typical here of 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.740
 the pumpkin the tail before the American 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.740
 correct and then the mouth then 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.310
 Well nothing if you think of the design as 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.689
 as if we try to clear that yes and no 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.969
 doubt that it looks graphic is going to teach you 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:52.069
 the next step to be able to shape 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.169
 and turn it into a necklace, we have 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:55.580
 integrated the needle and the thread with the lo 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.129
 that we want in this case is a fat one 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.399
 can be one in this case we have chosen 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:05.389
 well this is thick left we take 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:07.039
 our heart the needle and now 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.130
 we are simply going to introduce the needle 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:15.310
 by the center as you can see here 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.480
 we are going to go and we are going to do here 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:26.080
 a little because it costs love shape 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:28.480
 If you want to leave here we will give you the 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:30.310
 serious matter has returned to us 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.020
 so nothing as you say you take the 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.150
 machine and right in the center and 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.860
 we introduce a little perfect and already 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.229
 we have set 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.659
 our necklace we can add water 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:44.389
 it would be like we finally have the 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:48.770
 it shows so you do not have to 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:51.770
 say that if the width of the heart is 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.300
 2 and therefore 20 330 is going out to 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.740
 heart or bigger to an action and it's 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.800
 according to the measure that we want to give 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.710
 logically for the neck ornament is 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.139
 say for a necklace then we will put the 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:09.969
 thicker more colorful in the center already 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:09.969
 the sides then this scary halloween 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.800
 bye
