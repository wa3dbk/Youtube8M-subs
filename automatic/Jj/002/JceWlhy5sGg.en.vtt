00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.609
 It's a good night, I'm speaking now, add 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.609
 to understand china better 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.980
 elsade to 60 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.990
 It's one thing I noticed is that the sound 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.300
 free with the best you can not 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.070
 demonstrate this because my son who 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 Are you doing here? It's not what I'm doing. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.359
 seeing that you can not speak more 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.539
 so the difference will be as if a 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:35.329
 person if some of the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.489
 I need to know why I have that fifusa 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:41.820
 that movie terry gou janota sing 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.940
 chilling everything and only had a mouth and 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.879
 in the best quality from 17.11 to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.059
 study 11 and this fact is that these point 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.750
 1 and so the film was 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 music is called again ps next to 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.270
 first the difference being that had 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.210
 in audio 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.990
 I do not know, I can not say it was 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.580
 that sound comes out of your sony is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.070
 lack of but compared tracinho 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.890
 to warm sheet that of the fair that I 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:26.659
 considered enough 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:26.659
 from here much better 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.340
 he went to china is following this was the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.290
 crash net 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:41.880
 but it is not a copy mount is a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.049
 Chinese own brand by addiction 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.200
 of quality 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:54.390
 so at least usb points from it to sd 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.490
 I 'm here to record the audio to be 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.960
 one more way of testing like I can not 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.860
 show that toinho 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.070
 But you can see what I'm talking about. 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.070
 It 's quite enough here. 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.070
 padded 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.740
 there is another 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.060
 I would start a cereal this side 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.820
 joao da case with the same 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.190
 specifications that it 300 people react 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:35.970
 or more 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:45.900
 He thinks he gave it cheaper than 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:49.130
 I'll be the top brand and it looks like I am 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:54.900
 more life when recording more graphic be and 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.230
 of the best femsa in us and year comment 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.140
 those phone still cheng 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:16.490
