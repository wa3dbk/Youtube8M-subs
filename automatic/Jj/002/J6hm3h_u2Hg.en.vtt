00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
becomes better with two strikes because

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.520 
becomes better with two strikes because
he<00:03:47.950> doesn't<00:03:48.160> try<00:03:48.579> to<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.909> too<00:03:49.150> much<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.720> can

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
he doesn't try to do too much you can

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.319 
he doesn't try to do too much you can
sometimes<00:03:50.799> get<00:03:51.250> him<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.489> over<00:03:51.670> swing<00:03:51.910> early<00:03:52.209> in

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
sometimes get him to over swing early in

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.319 
sometimes get him to over swing early in
the<00:03:52.450> count<00:03:52.629> but<00:03:52.959> rarely<00:03:53.410> when<00:03:53.590> he's<00:03:53.920> behind<00:03:54.329> so

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
the count but rarely when he's behind so

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.360 
the count but rarely when he's behind so
we're<00:03:55.480> runner<00:03:55.660> on<00:03:55.780> first<00:03:56.170> with<00:03:56.470> one<00:03:56.739> out<00:03:56.769> now

Votto on the move his Phillips and
nobody's<00:04:06.310> home<00:04:06.519> it's<00:04:06.910> a<00:04:07.030> base<00:04:07.269> hit<00:04:07.299> and<00:04:08.819> the

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
nobody's home it's a base hit and the

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.400 
nobody's home it's a base hit and the
throw<00:04:10.060> will<00:04:10.209> come<00:04:10.359> in<00:04:10.510> quickly<00:04:10.750> from<00:04:10.930> Center

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:11.410
