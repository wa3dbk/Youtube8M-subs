ingredients<00:00:52.350> as<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.980> saw<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.629> the<00:00:54.739> method<00:00:55.739> is

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
ingredients as you saw and the method is

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.240 
ingredients as you saw and the method is
also<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.280> simple<00:00:56.850> take<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> pan<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.250> first
