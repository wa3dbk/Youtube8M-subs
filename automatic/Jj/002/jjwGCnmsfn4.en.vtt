well<00:00:04.680> we've<00:00:04.830> made<00:00:04.859> some<00:00:05.220> choices<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.330> shop

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
well we've made some choices in the shop

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.320 
well we've made some choices in the shop
I<00:00:07.020> have<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:07.920> small<00:00:08.309> panel<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.540> blew<00:00:09.719> up<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:11.330> couple

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
I have a small panel to blew up a couple

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.740 
I have a small panel to blew up a couple
of<00:00:12.420> pieces<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.869> salvaged<00:00:13.530> oak<00:00:14.420> they<00:00:15.420> they

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
of pieces of salvaged oak they they

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.590 
of pieces of salvaged oak they they
basically<00:00:16.170> match<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.980> we've<00:00:17.970> played<00:00:18.240> with<00:00:18.420> it

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
basically match and we've played with it

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000 
basically match and we've played with it
to<00:00:18.720> decide<00:00:19.020> how<00:00:19.260> they<00:00:19.290> ought<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.830> together

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to decide how they ought to go together

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.220 
to decide how they ought to go together
and<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.060> basically<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.810> we've<00:00:21.990> come<00:00:22.200> up

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
and this is basically what we've come up

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.890 
and this is basically what we've come up
with<00:00:22.910> now<00:00:23.910> they<00:00:24.030> have<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.420> glued<00:00:24.630> together

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
with now they have to be glued together

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.529 
with now they have to be glued together
and<00:00:25.370> you<00:00:26.370> can<00:00:26.550> see<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.850> gap<00:00:27.000> between<00:00:27.240> those

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and you can see the gap between those

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.229 
and you can see the gap between those
boards<00:00:27.960> you<00:00:28.650> can't<00:00:28.890> fill<00:00:29.100> that<00:00:29.280> with<00:00:29.460> glue

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.279 

what<00:00:33.239> we've<00:00:33.390> got<00:00:33.539> to<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.110> got<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
what we've got to do is we've got to

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.530 
what we've got to do is we've got to
make<00:00:34.620> those<00:00:34.829> edges<00:00:36.590> perfectly<00:00:37.590> match<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
make those edges perfectly match so that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.620 
make those edges perfectly match so that
this<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.870> glued<00:00:40.140> together<00:00:41.120> now<00:00:42.120> for<00:00:42.149> short

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
this can be glued together now for short

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.040 
this can be glued together now for short
pieces<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.140> wood<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:44.960> there's<00:00:45.960> really

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
pieces of wood like this there's really

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.530 
pieces of wood like this there's really
a<00:00:46.290> wonderful<00:00:46.620> way<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.700> that's<00:00:48.210> to

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
a wonderful way to do that and that's to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.000 
a wonderful way to do that and that's to
use<00:00:48.720> a<00:00:48.750> hand<00:00:49.110> plane<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:51.000> shooting<00:00:51.239> board

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
use a hand plane on the shooting board

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.229 
use a hand plane on the shooting board
Cherie<00:00:53.010> boards<00:00:53.340> just<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.550> couple<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.880> pieces<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
Cherie boards just a couple of pieces of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.280 
Cherie boards just a couple of pieces of
scrap<00:00:54.950> this<00:00:55.950> is<00:00:56.130> just<00:00:56.340> scrap<00:00:56.670> plywood<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.630> you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
scrap this is just scrap plywood and you

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.110 
scrap this is just scrap plywood and you
can<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.590> have<00:00:58.860> one<00:00:59.100> pieces

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
can see I have one pieces

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170 
can see I have one pieces
that's<00:01:00.360> quite<00:01:01.020> wide<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.610> second<00:01:02.610> narrow<00:01:02.790> piece

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
that's quite wide a second narrow piece

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.929 
that's quite wide a second narrow piece
and<00:01:03.360> fastened<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.140> top<00:01:04.469> a<00:01:04.769> little<00:01:05.460> stop<00:01:05.729> on

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
and fastened on the top a little stop on

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.809 
and fastened on the top a little stop on
the<00:01:06.090> end<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> why<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.429> can<00:01:08.429> take<00:01:08.639> the

00:01:08.809 --> 00:01:08.819 
the end and this is why I can take the

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:12.679 
the end and this is why I can take the
board<00:01:09.060> push<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.139> against<00:01:10.880> that<00:01:11.880> stop<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.509> not

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
board push it against that stop is not

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.319 
board push it against that stop is not
gonna<00:01:12.840> go<00:01:13.020> anywhere<00:01:15.229> take<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.259> hand<00:01:16.530> plane

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:17.329 
gonna go anywhere take a hand plane

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:20.719 
gonna go anywhere take a hand plane
adjust<00:01:18.329> the<00:01:18.509> cutter<00:01:18.749> so<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.049> it's<00:01:19.729> cut

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
adjust the cutter so that it's cut

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.429 
adjust the cutter so that it's cut
square<00:01:21.859> put<00:01:22.859> the<00:01:22.979> plane<00:01:23.219> on<00:01:23.429> its<00:01:23.579> side<00:01:24.200> so<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
square put the plane on its side so this

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.719 
square put the plane on its side so this
is<00:01:25.619> something<00:01:25.950> different<00:01:26.039> we<00:01:26.340> haven't<00:01:26.639> done

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
is something different we haven't done

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.910 
is something different we haven't done
this<00:01:27.590> here<00:01:29.779> so<00:01:30.779> all<00:01:30.959> we<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.349> hold<00:01:31.499> the<00:01:31.649> board

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
this here so all we do is hold the board

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.859 
this here so all we do is hold the board
down<00:01:32.329> take<00:01:33.329> plane<00:01:35.179> you<00:01:36.179> hear<00:01:36.389> the<00:01:36.509> distinct

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
down take plane you hear the distinct

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:57.620 
down take plane you hear the distinct
sound<00:01:37.099> that's<00:01:38.099> because<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.549> plane<00:01:38.789> only<00:01:39.029> cuts

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:13.690 

do<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.720> same<00:01:58.960> with<00:01:59.200> the<00:01:59.320> up<00:01:59.440> poor

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:22.339 

let's<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.849> how<00:02:15.000> close<00:02:15.180> we've<00:02:15.510> come

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.809 

we're<00:02:22.950> waiting<00:02:23.249> for<00:02:23.280> glue<00:02:25.730> remember<00:02:26.730> the

we're waiting for glue remember the
shooting<00:02:26.999> board<00:02:27.329> see<00:02:28.049> is<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:28.530> much<00:02:28.879> heartache

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
shooting board see is so much heartache

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.940 
shooting board see is so much heartache
