slide this back and I got a really broad
flood<00:01:18.240> beam<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.659> perfect<00:01:19.080> circle<00:01:19.439> there

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
flood beam a perfect circle there

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
flood beam a perfect circle there
there's<00:01:19.770> none<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.009> those<00:01:20.100> dark<00:01:20.670> spots<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
light spots that you associate with a

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
light spots that you associate with a
lot<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> focusing<00:01:23.430> flashlights<00:01:23.939> there's<00:01:24.720> also

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
lot of focusing flashlights there's also

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.320 
lot of focusing flashlights there's also
three<00:01:25.200> brightness<00:01:25.860> levels<00:01:26.280> or<00:01:26.729> three<00:01:26.970> light

three brightness levels or three light

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.090 
three brightness levels or three light
settings<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> should<00:01:28.110> say<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.950> high

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
settings I should say this is the high

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
settings I should say this is the high
beam<00:01:29.340> just<00:01:29.610> over<00:01:29.880> 200<00:01:30.299> lumens<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.530> one

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
beam just over 200 lumens give it one

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.260 
beam just over 200 lumens give it one
click<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.130> get<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:32.369> strobe<00:01:32.759> which<00:01:32.790> probably

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
click and I get my strobe which probably

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.870 
click and I get my strobe which probably
messed<00:01:33.689> up<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.990> camera<00:01:34.320> there<00:01:34.500> but<00:01:34.920> also

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
messed up your camera there but also

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.630 
messed up your camera there but also
there's<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.900> high<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.439> strobe<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.100> my<00:01:38.430> low

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
there's my high my strobe and my low

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.100 
there's my high my strobe and my low
beam<00:01:38.850> so<00:01:39.090> if<00:01:39.150> I'm<00:01:39.299> reading<00:01:39.570> you're<00:01:39.930> doing

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
beam so if I'm reading you're doing

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.450 
beam so if I'm reading you're doing
something<00:01:40.290> up<00:01:40.439> close<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.799> got<00:01:40.920> my<00:01:41.100> low<00:01:41.250> beam

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
something up close I got my low beam

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.969 
something up close I got my low beam
right<00:01:41.670> there<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.390> focusable<00:01:42.990> again<00:01:43.409> with<00:01:43.590> one

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
right there and focusable again with one
