00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 very good guys here we are in others 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.430
 gta 5 languages online and in this case 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.200
 I bring you a trick in which I am going to 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.910
 teach how to be inside a 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.349
 UFO in GTA 5 online if indeed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 guys, the truth is that it's something 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.620
 pretty amazing since good now 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.299
 you will see that when I complete what I do 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.859
 all the steps of the trick then you go to 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.650
 see how he takes helicopter and I can 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.970
 put and transfer the UFO and see how it is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.980
 the UFO inside what really does not 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.570
 It has a great deal but it can be seen 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.160
 how is the texture inside the UFO not 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.300
 well you can work a trick 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.619
 pretty pretty amazing that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.150
 love with the villares with a piece 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.380
 of like and nothing, so let's start with 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.669
 the trick that is pretty enough 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 facilitated the truth itself has come out to the 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.329
 first and in guys first we have 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.070
 to be in campaign mode and 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.649
 we have to give the start to go to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 departure and we will repeat mission and we have 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.520
 that repeat the mission of someone said I 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 It was called that way if someone said yoga 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.309
 so then nothing if you have not 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.870
 After that mission, then, no 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.160
 you can do the trick but with this 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.420
 mission was from one of the first 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.890
 I guess everyone would 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.480
 it will have happened and nothing because we give 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.800
 someone said yoga and we entered the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.870
 mission at the beginning of the mission 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.820
 we will have to do one or the other 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.140
 some other yoga figurine and such and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 Well, you are going to see that all this happened already 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.620
 that is a long enough mission and nothing 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570
 then we have what 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.310
 we do not have to go back to our house to 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.480
 the house of michael and suddenly when 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.880
 we are seeing the house of michael 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.290
 michael like you start getting dizzy and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 then the screen gets a 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.080
 little unclear the truth that the effect is 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.490
 quite pretty well done and then 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.440
 well it would be called a lot seems to be 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.140
 faints and suddenly appears in a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.120
 kind of soil surrounded by monkeys 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.820
 jumping and up there is a kind of 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.470
 UFO not well then you will see that in the 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.060
 mission what happens basically is that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.640
 the UFO is just up and 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.560
 then the UFO is going to abduct 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 maikel is to say that he is going to swallow it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
 so to speak, emitting the clear 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.950
 so then nothing as soon as the UFO is 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 swallow maikel so to speak how weird 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.980
 it's true that one says I bring a 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.420
 good person for that when the UFO is 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.980
 try michael then we have 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.110
 what to give to pause and super fast we have 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.970
 that we go to game and we give to load 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.530
 game is worth we will load game and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.050
 we have to overwrite that is to say good 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.730
 you have to choose the first action with 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.170
 the voucher lets you load the game and you give it 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.910
 to the first short option and then 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.980
 overwrite is the game that this is 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.229
 now he is playing in the previous no 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.670
 so then you give nothing to that and in 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.960
 how much do you automatically give him the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.490
 game will put you back into the mode 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.690
 campaign and once you're in mode 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.440
 campaign what you have to do is go 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.150
 to mode 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.740
 to a game by invitation a game 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.210
 normal to the game that you want 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.680
 I recommend that you leave a game 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.240
 invitation since the connection goes a lot 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.040
 better then then nothing once 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.780
 you are there we have to catch a kind 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.490
 from a helicopter an airplane I recommend you 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.050
 to take a helicopter so you can 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.760
 better appreciate what comes next the UFO 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 inside and such and nothing then take a 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.550
 helicopter that in this case I left 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.080
 to the heliport and one of these normal and 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.280
 josh and what we have to do is go 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.960
 to the location that you are seeing now 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520
 same on the screen, it is valid throughout the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.770
 basically the map of the saints basically 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.330
 and nothing because we have to go there and we have 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.950
 to ascend a lot we have to leave 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.920
 a lot of high is worth where they are 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.390
 the clouds roughly 50 100 meters 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.460
 above the tallest building in gta 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.990
 5 and nothing because we ascend a lot with 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.310
 the helicopter and as soon as we are here 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.840
 up then let's see what if 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.910
 effectively there we have one of the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.740
 UFOs that come out in gta 5 and we'll have it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.600
 there in gta 5 online and best of all 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.250
 is that it will not have walls is totally 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.170
 transparent and is saying that good 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.360
 it's amazing, it does not have any tube to 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.680
 down the wta that is something strange and you go 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.330
 to see that I can transfer them but 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 perfectly I can see everything for 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.970
 the truth is that quite pretty well 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.170
 and you are seeing how good it is 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.370
 pretty amazing I guess what 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.990
 You will be flipping like me when 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.220
 I saw it for the first time a guys for 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.380
 to work a trick is worth 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.040
 discovered of this trick is that if 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.829
 we take 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.239
 and you give the screen at first 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.650
 that is to say , you already know that there is 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.060
 four different cameras that when 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.140
 you take a helicopter one that is very 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.459
 near the helicopter one that is a 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.140
 little bit farther another one that is super 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.430
 away and exiled again because it puts you 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.750
 in first person say it seems that it is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.340
 a camera as if it were in all the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.200
 helicopter nose, you are going to see 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.790
 that if we give that camera we can see 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.319
 perfectly what is going to be the UFO 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.180
 inside how it would be inside is worth what 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.230
 we can see perfectly perfectly and what 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.489
 you'll see how good that is a trick 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.319
 pretty cool to imagine how 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.909
 what would it be like to drive a mill 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.200
 ignasi as basically this has been 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:47.400
 all the truth that a pretty trick 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.079
 pretty cool and I hope you pinch it 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.310
 and with a term of like and a gray pose 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.420
 more trick of this follows in super plan 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.159
 curious as nothing to put blog can 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.180
 put it for the comments nothing then 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.500
 basically this has been all after 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.579
 result this video you can leave a law 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.200
 who was for all and results 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.120
 subscribe to the channel but not country and we 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.470
 we see the next goodbye and well then I 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.230
 throw parachute from the helicopter 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.790
 to try to get on top of the UFO 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.790
 but the helicopter fell on me
