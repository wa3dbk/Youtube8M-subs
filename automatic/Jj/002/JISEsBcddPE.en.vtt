00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030 

okay<00:00:00.690> so<00:00:00.750> today<00:00:01.199> on<00:00:01.290> my<00:00:01.410> video<00:00:01.620> blog<00:00:01.829> we'll<00:00:01.949> be

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
okay so today on my video blog we'll be

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.320 
okay so today on my video blog we'll be
unboxing<00:00:02.280> the<00:00:02.669> OCZ

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
unboxing the OCZ

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.320 
unboxing the OCZ
vertex<00:00:03.990> series<00:00:04.350> 60<00:00:04.770> gig<00:00:04.980> drive<00:00:05.250> now<00:00:05.520> ocz<00:00:06.089> has

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
vertex series 60 gig drive now ocz has

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.440 
vertex series 60 gig drive now ocz has
about<00:00:07.140> a<00:00:07.170> million<00:00:07.589> and<00:00:07.710> one<00:00:07.980> different<00:00:08.450> SSD

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
about a million and one different SSD

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.540 
about a million and one different SSD
drives<00:00:09.750> but<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> vertex<00:00:10.650> series<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.309> their

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
drives but the vertex series was their

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.669 
drives but the vertex series was their
first<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> really<00:00:12.420> take<00:00:12.719> off<00:00:12.900> because

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
first one to really take off because

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.829 
first one to really take off because
unlike<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.099> old<00:00:14.429> J<00:00:14.730> micron<00:00:15.150> based<00:00:15.360> ones<00:00:15.630> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
unlike the old J micron based ones you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.390 
unlike the old J micron based ones you
don't<00:00:16.020> get<00:00:16.230> any<00:00:16.470> stuttering<00:00:16.890> issues<00:00:17.250> with

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
don't get any stuttering issues with

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.179 
don't get any stuttering issues with
these<00:00:17.580> because<00:00:18.090> they<00:00:18.539> do<00:00:18.600> feature<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
these because they do feature and in the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.580 
these because they do feature and in the
Lynx<00:00:20.520> controller<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.720> what<00:00:21.900> that<00:00:22.080> means<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
Lynx controller so what that means is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.349 
Lynx controller so what that means is
that<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:23.010> always<00:00:23.279> get<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.789> best<00:00:24.180> performance

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
that you always get the best performance

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.679 
that you always get the best performance
possible<00:00:24.960> from<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:25.769> SSD<00:00:26.160> drive<00:00:26.580> even<00:00:27.210> when

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
possible from your SSD drive even when

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.109 
possible from your SSD drive even when
you're<00:00:27.930> undergoing<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.740> lot<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.070> random<00:00:29.460> write

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
you're undergoing a lot of random write

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
you're undergoing a lot of random write
operations<00:00:30.810> which<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.199> what<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.470> earlier

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
operations which for what the earlier

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.069 
operations which for what the earlier
SSDs<00:00:32.340> suffered<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.969> now<00:00:33.510> there's<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> couple

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
SSDs suffered on now there's a couple

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.990 
SSDs suffered on now there's a couple
different<00:00:34.530> versions<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.219> vertex<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
different versions of the vertex one of

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.330 
different versions of the vertex one of
which<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> turbo<00:00:36.870> version<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> that's

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
which is a turbo version and that's

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.060 
which is a turbo version and that's
basically<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:39.030> slightly<00:00:39.480> faster<00:00:39.690> clocked<00:00:40.500> in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
basically a slightly faster clocked in

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.069 
basically a slightly faster clocked in
the<00:00:41.219> Lynx<00:00:41.460> controller<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.930> also

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
the Lynx controller and then it also

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
the Lynx controller and then it also
comes<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.620> bunch<00:00:43.739> of<00:00:43.890> different<00:00:43.950> capacities

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
comes in a bunch of different capacities

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
comes in a bunch of different capacities
so<00:00:44.850> I<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.180> 60<00:00:45.510> gig<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.899> today<00:00:46.200> now<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
so I have the 60 gig one today now the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.979 
so I have the 60 gig one today now the
30<00:00:47.340> gig<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.700> 60<00:00:48.120> gig<00:00:48.300> drive<00:00:48.510> both<00:00:48.750> have<00:00:48.960> a

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
30 gig in the 60 gig drive both have a

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.670 
30 gig in the 60 gig drive both have a
64<00:00:49.649> Meg<00:00:49.829> cache<00:00:50.160> as<00:00:50.430> opposed<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.480> 128<00:00:52.379> Meg

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
64 Meg cache as opposed to the 128 Meg

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.060 
64 Meg cache as opposed to the 128 Meg
cache<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.940> 128<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> 250<00:00:55.559> gig<00:00:55.770> drives

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
cache on the 128 and the 250 gig drives

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.970 
cache on the 128 and the 250 gig drives
and<00:00:56.399> they<00:00:56.910> also<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.539> slightly<00:00:58.140> lower<00:00:58.530> specs

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and they also have slightly lower specs

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
and they also have slightly lower specs
in<00:00:59.160> terms<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.489> reading<00:00:59.760> right<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.300> reads

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
in terms of reading right so the reads

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.569 
in terms of reading right so the reads
on<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> are<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> 230<00:01:01.920> megabytes<00:01:02.489> per

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
on this are up to 230 megabytes per

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.570 
on this are up to 230 megabytes per
second<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> up<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.949> 135<00:01:04.949> megabytes<00:01:05.489> per

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
second and up to 135 megabytes per

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
second and up to 135 megabytes per
second<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> writes<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.350> not

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
second for the writes now that is not

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.270 
second for the writes now that is not
actually<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.150> important<00:01:10.049> thing<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.560> an<00:01:10.890> SSD

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
actually the important thing for an SSD

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.520 
actually the important thing for an SSD
drive<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.299> important<00:01:12.780> thing<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> something

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
drive the important thing is something

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.340 
drive the important thing is something
that<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:14.250> don't<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.450> spec<00:01:15.869> sheet<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
that you don't see on a spec sheet and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.940 
that you don't see on a spec sheet and
that<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.369> random<00:01:17.869> write<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.140> random<00:01:19.740> read

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
that is the random write and random read

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.410 
that is the random write and random read
performance<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.909> you'll<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> check

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
performance so you'll have to check

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
performance so you'll have to check
benchmarks<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.320> because<00:01:22.500> surprisingly

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
benchmarks for that because surprisingly

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
benchmarks for that because surprisingly
they<00:01:23.369> don't<00:01:23.610> come<00:01:23.850> spec<00:01:24.210> for<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.049> anyway

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
they don't come spec for it but anyway

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
they don't come spec for it but anyway
let's<00:01:25.500> find<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.799> what<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:25.979> get<00:01:26.220> inside<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
let's find out what you get inside the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.310 
let's find out what you get inside the
box<00:01:26.790> here<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.180> first<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.540> all<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.049> get<00:01:28.229> an

drive<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.899> year<00:01:46.049> warranty<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.310> open

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
drive one year warranty and then we open

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
drive one year warranty and then we open
it<00:01:47.700> up<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.030> find<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> drive<00:01:48.659> itself<00:01:49.020> embedded

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it up to find the drive itself embedded

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.560 
it up to find the drive itself embedded
in<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> nice<00:01:49.890> little<00:01:50.610> foam<00:01:50.850> there<00:01:51.090> let's<00:01:51.299> get<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
in a nice little foam there let's get it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.550 
in a nice little foam there let's get it
right<00:01:51.720> side<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.799> comes<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> little

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
right side up so it comes in a little

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.590 
right side up so it comes in a little
anti-static<00:01:55.560> baggie<00:01:56.009> ok<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.820> let's<00:01:57.270> take<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
anti-static baggie ok so let's take the

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
anti-static baggie ok so let's take the
drive<00:01:57.810> itself<00:01:58.140> up<00:01:58.380> now<00:01:58.799> most<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.759> in

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
drive itself up now most of the in

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.060 
drive itself up now most of the in

drives<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.820> market<00:02:03.299> come<00:02:03.899> with<00:02:04.079> these

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
drives on the market come with these

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.039 
drives on the market come with these
kind<00:02:04.560> of<00:02:04.680> metallic<00:02:05.270> casings<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.689> OCZ

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
kind of metallic casings but the OCZ

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.109 
kind of metallic casings but the OCZ
drives<00:02:07.590> come<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.369> like<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> matte<00:02:08.879> black

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
drives come with like a matte black

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
drives come with like a matte black
finish<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.750> them<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> actually<00:02:10.349> really

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
finish on them that I actually really

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.370 
finish on them that I actually really
like<00:02:11.099> so<00:02:11.400> at<00:02:11.700> the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
like so at the

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.290 
like so at the
at<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.650> drive<00:02:12.860> you'll<00:02:13.070> find<00:02:13.310> a<00:02:13.400> standard<00:02:13.850> SATA

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
at the drive you'll find a standard SATA

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.890 
at the drive you'll find a standard SATA
power<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:15.080> SATA<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:16.100> data<00:02:16.670> there's<00:02:17.420> a<00:02:17.510> jumper

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
power and SATA to data there's a jumper

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.420 
power and SATA to data there's a jumper
there<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.110> believe<00:02:18.410> that's<00:02:18.860> only<00:02:19.160> for

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
there I believe that's only for

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.280 
there I believe that's only for
diagnostic<00:02:20.060> purposes<00:02:20.480> or<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.840> might<00:02:20.960> take<00:02:21.170> it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
diagnostic purposes or it might take it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.590 
diagnostic purposes or it might take it
back<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.590> say<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.220> compatibility<00:02:23.120> not

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
back to say to one compatibility not

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.780 
back to say to one compatibility not
100%<00:02:24.230> sure<00:02:24.260> but<00:02:24.680> on<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.010> bottom<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.580> drive

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
100% sure but on the bottom of the drive

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.730 
100% sure but on the bottom of the drive
you'll<00:02:26.270> find<00:02:26.570> four<00:02:26.870> mounting<00:02:27.230> holes<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.590> this

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
you'll find four mounting holes so this

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.530 
you'll find four mounting holes so this
is<00:02:27.890> useful<00:02:28.070> if<00:02:28.370> you're<00:02:28.520> using<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.880> vertex<00:02:29.240> in

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
is useful if you're using the vertex in

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.750 
is useful if you're using the vertex in
a<00:02:29.900> laptop<00:02:30.170> sort<00:02:30.770> of<00:02:30.860> configuration<00:02:31.130> which<00:02:31.730> is

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
a laptop sort of configuration which is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.150 
a laptop sort of configuration which is
highly<00:02:32.420> recommended<00:02:32.990> because<00:02:33.110> an<00:02:33.530> SSD<00:02:33.830> is<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
highly recommended because an SSD is the

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.190 
highly recommended because an SSD is the
best<00:02:34.400> thing<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.790> can<00:02:34.940> do<00:02:35.150> for<00:02:36.110> your

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
best thing you can do for your

best thing you can do for your
computer's<00:02:36.620> performance<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:37.370> better<00:02:37.610> even

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
computer's performance it's better even

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.460 
computer's performance it's better even
than<00:02:38.030> around<00:02:38.270> upgrade<00:02:38.720> at<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> certain<00:02:39.200> level

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
than around upgrade at a certain level

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.740 
than around upgrade at a certain level
or<00:02:39.530> even<00:02:39.620> CPU<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.460> then<00:02:41.000> on<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.270> sides<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.520 
or even CPU and then on the sides of the
drive<00:02:41.870> you've<00:02:42.500> got<00:02:42.740> one<00:02:42.950> two<00:02:43.190> three<00:02:44.260> four<00:02:45.260> more

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
drive you've got one two three four more

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.650 
drive you've got one two three four more
mounting<00:02:45.980> adapters<00:02:46.430> or<00:02:46.760> mounting<00:02:47.240> holes<00:02:47.450> and

mounting adapters or mounting holes and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.450 
mounting adapters or mounting holes and
you<00:02:47.720> can<00:02:47.900> use<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.680> mount<00:02:48.860> to<00:02:48.950> either<00:02:49.220> to

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
you can use that to mount to either to

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.960 
you can use that to mount to either to

so<00:02:53.270> thank<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.870> for<00:02:53.990> checking<00:02:54.140> out<00:02:54.320> my

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
so thank you for checking out my

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.040 
so thank you for checking out my
unboxing<00:02:54.680> oh<00:02:55.190> oh<00:02:55.580> no<00:02:55.730> no<00:02:55.940> I<00:02:56.150> almost<00:02:56.570> forgot

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
unboxing oh oh no no I almost forgot

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.080 
unboxing oh oh no no I almost forgot
okay<00:02:57.380> the<00:02:57.740> biggest<00:02:57.950> thing<00:02:58.310> about<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.730> vertex

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
okay the biggest thing about the vertex

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.810 
okay the biggest thing about the vertex
series<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.690> they<00:03:00.140> already<00:03:00.680> support<00:03:01.280> trim

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
series is that they already support trim

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940 
series is that they already support trim
so<00:03:02.330> trim<00:03:02.540> is<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.870> feature<00:03:03.170> of<00:03:03.410> Windows<00:03:03.710> 7

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
so trim is that feature of Windows 7

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.340 
so trim is that feature of Windows 7
that<00:03:04.250> allows<00:03:04.520> you<00:03:04.820> to<00:03:04.870> not<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.200> the

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
that allows you to not have the

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.810 
that allows you to not have the
performance<00:03:06.650> degradation<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.640> see

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
performance degradation that you see

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.880 
performance degradation that you see
with<00:03:07.970> almost<00:03:08.180> every<00:03:08.600> other<00:03:08.720> SSD<00:03:09.230> drive<00:03:09.500> on<00:03:09.740> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
with almost every other SSD drive on the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.620 
with almost every other SSD drive on the
market<00:03:10.310> so<00:03:10.760> it<00:03:10.880> means<00:03:11.060> that<00:03:11.210> your<00:03:11.450> drive

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
market so it means that your drive

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.260 
market so it means that your drive
always<00:03:12.020> performs<00:03:12.830> at<00:03:12.950> about<00:03:13.160> 99<00:03:13.670> percent<00:03:13.700> of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
always performs at about 99 percent of

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.240 
always performs at about 99 percent of
new<00:03:14.690> performance<00:03:15.680> you<00:03:15.830> need<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.070> make<00:03:16.220> sure

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
new performance you need to make sure

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.250 
new performance you need to make sure
you<00:03:16.490> update<00:03:16.670> to<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.060> latest<00:03:17.330> firmware<00:03:17.510> but<00:03:18.170> if

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
you update to the latest firmware but if

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260 
you update to the latest firmware but if
you<00:03:18.350> get<00:03:18.500> a<00:03:18.530> vertex<00:03:18.920> drive<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.550> do<00:03:19.730> get<00:03:19.940> trim

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
you get a vertex drive you do get trim

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.850 
you get a vertex drive you do get trim
support<00:03:20.660> thank<00:03:21.110> you<00:03:21.200> for<00:03:21.380> checking<00:03:21.530> out<00:03:21.800> my
