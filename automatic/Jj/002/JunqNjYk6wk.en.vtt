I wonder how Naru would hope to

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.620 
I wonder how Naru would hope to
resurrect<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:32.920> being<00:01:33.310> as<00:01:33.640> powerful<00:01:34.330> as<00:01:34.479> a

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630

resurrect that being as powerful as a
mom<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.520> think<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.880> hybrid<00:01:37.330> or<00:01:37.479> key<00:01:37.780> they

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
mom I think the hybrid or key they

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.550 
mom I think the hybrid or key they
gather<00:01:38.860> psionic<00:01:39.490> energy<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:41.020> where<00:01:41.289> would

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
gather psionic energy but where would

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.910 
gather psionic energy but where would
they<00:01:41.680> get<00:01:41.830> enough<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.399> resurrect<00:01:42.880> a<00:01:43.060> dead<00:01:43.330> God

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
they get enough to resurrect a dead God

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.490 
they get enough to resurrect a dead God

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.290 
something in that lab in the roads mind
I<00:02:55.220> saw<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.450> Monde<00:02:57.520> older<00:02:58.520> than<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> universe

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
I saw a Monde older than the universe

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.810 
I saw a Monde older than the universe
more<00:02:59.630> powerful<00:03:00.290> than<00:03:00.380> I<00:03:00.500> can<00:03:00.680> understand<00:03:01.130> and

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
more powerful than I can understand and

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.930 
more powerful than I can understand and
now<00:03:02.180> he's<00:03:02.569> alive<00:03:02.900> again<00:03:02.959> then<00:03:03.800> he<00:03:04.190> shall<00:03:04.520> fall

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
now he's alive again then he shall fall

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.470 
now he's alive again then he shall fall
before<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.750> swarm<00:03:06.140> duck<00:03:06.770> all<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.370> rest<00:03:07.640> we

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
before the swarm duck all the rest we

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.960 
before the swarm duck all the rest we
don't<00:03:08.660> even<00:03:08.900> know<00:03:09.050> where<00:03:09.290> he<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.700> we<00:03:10.700> must

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
don't even know where he is we must

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.449 
don't even know where he is we must
prepare<00:03:11.209> for<00:03:11.450> his<00:03:11.780> coming<00:03:12.050> but<00:03:12.920> I<00:03:12.950> have<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.190> few

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
prepare for his coming but I have a few

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.360 
prepare for his coming but I have a few
scores<00:03:13.760> to<00:03:14.090> settle<00:03:14.239> first

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.449 

when<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.000> see<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.630> stars<00:03:18.989> arrayed<00:03:19.650> before<00:03:20.250> me

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
when I see the stars arrayed before me

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.970 
when I see the stars arrayed before me
like<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.330> think<00:03:21.900> of<00:03:22.319> Earth

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
like this I think of Earth

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.260 
like this I think of Earth
I<00:03:23.270> remember<00:03:24.270> its<00:03:24.450> green<00:03:24.780> hills<00:03:25.730> you<00:03:26.730> can't<00:03:27.030> go

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
I remember its green hills you can't go

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.580 
I remember its green hills you can't go
home<00:03:27.480> again<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:28.130> know<00:03:29.130> I<00:03:29.720> have<00:03:30.720> no<00:03:30.959> place<00:03:31.260> on

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
home again I know I have no place on

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.880 
home again I know I have no place on
earth<00:03:31.650> now<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.580> mean<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.180> won't<00:03:33.390> let<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.900> your

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
earth now I mean I won't let you your

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.170 
earth now I mean I won't let you your
return<00:03:35.250> would<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.519> noticed<00:03:36.030> by<00:03:36.150> the

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
return would be noticed by the

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.360 
return would be noticed by the
government<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.780> Earth<00:03:36.930> they<00:03:37.920> might<00:03:38.160> consider

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
government of Earth they might consider

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.400 
government of Earth they might consider
another<00:03:38.819> expedition<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.720> our<00:03:39.840> little<00:03:40.019> corner

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
another expedition to our little corner

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.640 
another expedition to our little corner
of<00:03:40.530> space<00:03:41.150> they<00:03:42.150> will<00:03:42.450> come<00:03:42.780> back<00:03:43.019> someday<00:03:43.440> you

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
of space they will come back someday you

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.559 
of space they will come back someday you
know<00:03:43.950> I<00:03:44.220> do<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:46.290> will<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.620> ready<00:03:46.830> for<00:03:46.920> them

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
know I do and I will be ready for them

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.530 
know I do and I will be ready for them
here<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.840> are<00:03:49.080> at<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.680> enemy's<00:03:50.280> doorstep<00:03:50.970> it

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
here you are at the enemy's doorstep it

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.559 
here you are at the enemy's doorstep it
is<00:03:51.780> almost<00:03:51.989> over<00:03:52.650> I<00:03:52.950> don't<00:03:53.730> think<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.330> will<00:03:54.420> be

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
is almost over I don't think it will be

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:55.309 
is almost over I don't think it will be
that<00:03:54.600> simple

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
that simple

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.580 
that simple
it<00:03:56.100> never<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.519> without<00:03:57.090> Taurus<00:03:57.510> he<00:03:58.319> thinks

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
around you that one he knows where you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.339 
around you that one he knows where you
walk<00:04:01.470> before<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:02.069> do<00:04:02.660> but<00:04:03.660> you've<00:04:03.870> been<00:04:04.049> part
