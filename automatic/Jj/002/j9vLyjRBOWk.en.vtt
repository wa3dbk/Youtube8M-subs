00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.519 
it work at the best level that it can
and<00:00:27.580> then<00:00:27.850> the<00:00:27.940> emotional<00:00:28.359> side<00:00:28.570> kicks<00:00:28.869> in<00:00:29.109> and

part of it all I think being a mom not

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.380 
part of it all I think being a mom not
necessarily<00:00:39.760> makes<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.030> a<00:00:40.059> better

necessarily makes you a better
pediatrician<00:00:41.200> but<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.350> more<00:00:41.530> understanding

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
pediatrician but a more understanding

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.740 
pediatrician you're more empathetic with
other<00:00:44.710> moms<00:00:44.950> that<00:00:45.160> come<00:00:45.399> in<00:00:45.610> even<00:00:46.239> the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
other moms that come in even the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.900 
other moms that come in even the
simplest<00:00:47.079> things<00:00:47.500> that<00:00:47.829> first<00:00:48.340> child<00:00:48.670> that

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
simplest things that first child that

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.840 
simplest things that first child that
walks<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:50.290> mom<00:00:50.590> walks<00:00:50.860> in<00:00:51.070> and<00:00:51.340> they're

walks you the mom walks in and they're
close<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.239> tears<00:00:52.480> because<00:00:52.809> they<00:00:52.960> don't<00:00:53.140> know

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
close to tears because they don't know

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.170

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
is this normal is this not normal on my

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.420 
is this normal is this not normal on my
okay<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:56.440> being<00:00:56.649> able<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.920> say<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.190> know

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
okay just being able to say you know

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.880 
okay just being able to say you know
it's<00:00:58.120> okay<00:00:58.270> and<00:00:58.840> give<00:00:59.500> your<00:00:59.620> own<00:00:59.739> little

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 
it's okay and give your own little

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.420 
it's okay and give your own little
tippet<00:01:00.879> on<00:01:01.059> not<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.289> from<00:01:02.440> doctor<00:01:03.129> to<00:01:03.280> mom

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
tippet on not just from doctor to mom

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.760 
tippet on not just from doctor to mom
but<00:01:03.640> mom<00:01:03.879> to<00:01:04.119> mom<00:01:04.270> I<00:01:04.539> think<00:01:04.629> really<00:01:05.020> helps<00:01:05.379> so<00:01:05.740> I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
but mom to mom I think really helps so I

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.100 
but mom to mom I think really helps so I
tend<00:01:06.039> to<00:01:06.100> have<00:01:06.250> a<00:01:06.310> more<00:01:06.610> relaxed<00:01:07.180> approach<00:01:07.630> I

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
tend to have a more relaxed approach I

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.350 
tend to have a more relaxed approach I
don't<00:01:08.289> wear<00:01:08.410> a<00:01:08.440> lab<00:01:08.680> coat<00:01:09.039> in<00:01:09.459> to<00:01:09.819> see<00:01:10.240> the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
don't wear a lab coat in to see the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.910 
don't wear a lab coat in to see the
children<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:11.050> think<00:01:11.259> that<00:01:11.380> makes<00:01:11.679> them<00:01:11.830> a

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
children I think that makes them a

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.820 
children I think that makes them a
little<00:01:12.009> bit<00:01:12.160> more<00:01:12.250> standoffish<00:01:12.759> and<00:01:13.119> scared

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
little bit more standoffish and scared

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.680 
little bit more standoffish and scared
so<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:15.190> tend<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.580> like<00:01:15.759> that<00:01:16.000> more<00:01:16.209> kind<00:01:16.569> of

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
so I tend to like that more kind of

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.600 
so I tend to like that more kind of
let's<00:01:17.170> just<00:01:17.229> talk<00:01:17.590> and<00:01:17.860> see<00:01:18.009> what's<00:01:18.220> going<00:01:18.459> on

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
let's just talk and see what's going on

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.609 
let's just talk and see what's going on
play<00:01:19.479> with<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.720> child<00:01:19.899> maybe<00:01:20.080> while<00:01:20.470> we're

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
play with the child maybe while we're

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.130 
play with the child maybe while we're
discussing<00:01:20.860> things<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.729> tend<00:01:22.420> to<00:01:22.479> talk<00:01:22.750> first

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
discussing things I tend to talk first

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.410 
discussing things I tend to talk first
and<00:01:23.440> then<00:01:23.649> examine<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.250> child<00:01:24.520> versus<00:01:25.030> jumping
