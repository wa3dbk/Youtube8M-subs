and<00:06:10.440> relax<00:06:11.340> muscles<00:06:11.730> are<00:06:11.880> fun<00:06:12.180> and<00:06:12.360> they<00:06:12.480> flow

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
and relax muscles are fun and they flow

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.360 
and relax muscles are fun and they flow
but<00:06:13.020> they're<00:06:13.170> not<00:06:13.290> engaged<00:06:13.680> or<00:06:13.800> not<00:06:13.920> working

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
energy so if we engage everything as we

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.900 
energy so if we engage everything as we
go<00:06:19.170> through<00:06:19.440> it<00:06:19.590> looks<00:06:19.920> better<00:06:20.130> and<00:06:20.400> it's<00:06:20.730> more
