00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.069
 but 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.589
 hello everyone guys are ok facebook anyone i am 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.589
 the posts of the third video list of the spot 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.569
 let's start immediately recognized 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:29.939
 these 5 compressed mortal silence that we confirmed confirmed that it means that not 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.819
 there is confirmed in the wine and text base that 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 let's start right away with the chosen shooter and basic marksman allows us to 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.820
 identify 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.210
 the enemy the goal of the record lengthens of state which means that we see ourselves a 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.520
 little man running away edeweiss is a cicchino we see him as low god 300 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.100
 we see our 9 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.930
 it preserves the hace que somos that an enemy and therefore 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.699
 maximum brotherhood maybe mind 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.120
 but we see a little something running 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.780
 let's take care we don't show the red name and so I thought it's a 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.400
 copanello to stay at 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.030
 what does the shooter select for the shooter chosen for today allows to retain 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.050
 simply the longer breath so probably this is a very bonus 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.240
 useful for the ciccini 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.360
 if I were you, who will win 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.030
 the sniper class 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.050
 I would use it 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 we can forward sixth cher stokke recchia 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.700
 I know why they put it 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.990
 in the cannelloni wine 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.730
 anyway for what is enough that allows us to move 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.520
 b move 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.090
 faster when we probably drink the character without 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.300
 stolker when we are turning moves 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.840
 quite slowly while placed at the cart 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.940
 if not running while aiming it will be one thing you can walk a lot 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 quickly 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.229
 the sport delays the outbreak of the friendly claiborne that you want it to mean 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:17.269

 let's walk we notice the sharkscope cream though 

00:02:24.779 --> 00:02:29.009
 mom to spend less time running away because water cream would immediately play 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.009
 turned off with scooter trough so much we are 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:35.889
 walking forward avoid telling me about a thousand pieces 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.089
 yes maybe a thousand pieces 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:43.129
 ah well meridian to explode because it costs that then delays the outbreak 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.459
 of the cream we avoid of

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:09.519
 pro report 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.820
 report pro is a mix between 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.169

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.580

 increases the noise of the crazy gods 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.139

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.370
 pressure of our weapon when we are jumping then by the child 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.219

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:08.989
 one time 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.489
 then unlocked yours 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.539
 stable aim will allow us 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:15.219
 d for 

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:16.849
 to increase 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.289
 the availability of the weapon after the race which means if we fool it with 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.289
 verb is the weapon obviously there is fantastic animation 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.439
 the character who runs 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:29.720

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.930
 so far for now let's say timeline the low version and reduce the day sound 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:01.409
