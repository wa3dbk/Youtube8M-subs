the picture went into text that it's
optimal<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:47.010> iOS<00:00:47.399> 7.1<00:00:48.000> also

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
optimal to do that now iOS 7.1 also

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270

improves<00:00:48.809> touch<00:00:49.110> ID<00:00:49.440> recognition<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
improves touch ID recognition and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.799 
improves touch ID recognition and
there's<00:00:50.640> plenty<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.000> other<00:00:51.120> smaller<00:00:51.510> tweaks

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
there's plenty of other smaller tweaks

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.290 
there's plenty of other smaller tweaks
so<00:00:52.620> far<00:00:52.949> I'd<00:00:53.219> say<00:00:53.250> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> definitely<00:00:54.149> worth

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so far I'd say this is definitely worth

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.180 
so far I'd say this is definitely worth
the<00:00:54.420> update<00:00:54.750> but<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.379> most<00:00:55.530> annoying<00:00:55.920> feature

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
the update but the most annoying feature

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.220 
the update but the most annoying feature
is<00:00:56.520> how<00:00:56.789> they<00:00:56.940> change<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.600> coloring<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is how they change the coloring of the

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.709 
is how they change the coloring of the
caps<00:00:58.680> locks<00:00:58.980> button<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.910> might<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.359> stupid

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
caps locks button and I might be stupid

but<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.649> actually<00:01:01.920> just<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.309> confusing

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
but it's actually just more confusing

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
but it's actually just more confusing
try<00:01:03.390> typing<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.840> sentence<00:01:04.199> that<00:01:04.290> has
