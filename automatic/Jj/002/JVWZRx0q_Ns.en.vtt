the middle like that and that will hold
it<00:00:49.870> open<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.229> then<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:51.010> tie<00:00:51.670> it<00:00:51.699> around<00:00:51.909> you

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
it open and then you tie it around you

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.939

bigger ones that are holding perfectly
still<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:57.310> one's<00:01:57.550> for<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.790> largest<00:01:58.120> fist

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
still this one's for the largest fist

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.310 
still this one's for the largest fist
fish<00:01:58.960> on<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:01.479> will<00:02:01.600> get<00:02:01.690> the<00:02:01.840> bigger<00:02:02.050> ones

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
fish on that will get the bigger ones

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.740 
fish on that will get the bigger ones
and<00:02:02.590> then<00:02:03.130> this<00:02:03.280> is<00:02:03.340> for<00:02:03.460> medium<00:02:04.000> ones<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.450> I

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and then this is for medium ones and I

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.270 
and then this is for medium ones and I
think<00:02:04.960> this<00:02:05.049> one's<00:02:05.260> also<00:02:05.409> more<00:02:05.710> effective<00:02:06.130> and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
think this one's also more effective and

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.369 
think this one's also more effective and
you<00:02:06.790> can<00:02:06.909> also<00:02:07.090> lash<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.450> third<00:02:07.840> stick<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.289> the

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
you can also lash a third stick in the

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.490 
you can also lash a third stick in the
middle<00:02:08.560> now<00:02:09.340> go<00:02:09.580> in<00:02:09.700> there<00:02:09.849> like<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.500> that's

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
middle now go in there like that that's

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.850 
middle now go in there like that that's
also<00:02:11.769> effective<00:02:12.700> for<00:02:13.299> catching<00:02:13.599> fish<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.470> now

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
also effective for catching fish so now

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.590 
also effective for catching fish so now
most<00:02:15.130> states<00:02:15.400> probably<00:02:15.760> for<00:02:15.940> bated<00:02:16.300> using

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
most states probably for bated using

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.720 
most states probably for bated using
these<00:02:16.720> time<00:02:16.959> with<00:02:17.140> weapons<00:02:17.500> but<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.580> should

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
these time with weapons but you should

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.130 
these time with weapons but you should
only

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
only

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.230 
only
in<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.380> survival<00:02:19.710> situation<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.610> what<00:02:21.210> I

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
in a survival situation and what I

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
basically did to make all these was a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.820 
basically did to make all these was a
pocket<00:02:22.950> knife<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.550> some<00:02:24.090> rope<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:25.709> pretty

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
pocket knife and some rope that's pretty

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.240 
pocket knife and some rope that's pretty
much<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:27.530> those<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.800> three<00:02:28.860> things
