Northlight studio which is the second

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.720 
Northlight studio which is the second
set<00:00:26.150> of<00:00:26.180> studios<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.349> that<00:00:28.160> we<00:00:28.279> built<00:00:28.520> when

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
set of studios that that we built when

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.440 
set of studios that that we built when
we<00:00:28.880> came<00:00:29.060> out<00:00:29.210> here<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.630> the<00:00:29.720> first<00:00:29.989> set

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
we came out here so the first set

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.040 
we came out here so the first set
unfortunately<00:00:32.450> we<00:00:32.509> weren't<00:00:32.689> here<00:00:32.989> to

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
unfortunately we weren't here to

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.920 
unfortunately we weren't here to
supervise<00:00:33.440> and<00:00:34.190> so<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.550> wasn't<00:00:34.880> true<00:00:35.630> north

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
supervise and so it wasn't true north

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.600 
supervise and so it wasn't true north
which<00:00:36.320> is<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:36.770> had<00:00:36.890> actually<00:00:37.250> asked<00:00:37.550> for

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
which is what we had actually asked for

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.270 
which is what we had actually asked for
so<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.540> was<00:00:38.630> slightly<00:00:38.809> north<00:00:39.230> west<00:00:39.680> which

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
so it was slightly north west which

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.389 
so it was slightly north west which
means<00:00:40.670> that<00:00:40.940> we<00:00:41.030> were<00:00:41.149> getting<00:00:41.329> Sun<00:00:41.960> in<00:00:42.350> in<00:00:42.680> the

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
means that we were getting Sun in in the

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.000 
means that we were getting Sun in in the
afternoon<00:00:43.550> in<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.390> summers<00:00:44.929> which<00:00:45.260> was<00:00:45.530> quite

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
afternoon in the summers which was quite

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.579 
afternoon in the summers which was quite
annoying<00:00:46.429> because<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.230> could<00:00:48.379> actually

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:48.589 
annoying because you could actually

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.160 
annoying because you could actually
paint<00:00:49.510> until<00:00:51.100> 7:00<00:00:52.100> or<00:00:52.219> 7:30<00:00:52.399> at<00:00:52.940> night<00:00:53.170> except

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
paint until 7:00 or 7:30 at night except

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.419 
paint until 7:00 or 7:30 at night except
for<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:54.469> fact<00:00:54.679> that<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.010> Sun<00:00:55.249> came<00:00:55.519> in<00:00:55.550> at

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
for the fact that the Sun came in at

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.489 
for the fact that the Sun came in at
3:30<00:00:58.429> in<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.640> afternoon<00:00:58.730> so<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.079> what<00:01:00.230> we<00:01:00.379> did

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:00.499 
3:30 in the afternoon so so what we did

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.210 
3:30 in the afternoon so so what we did
is<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:00.679> built<00:01:01.010> new<00:01:01.219> studios<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.600> are<00:01:03.070> 24<00:01:04.070> by

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
is we built new studios that are 24 by

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.480 
is we built new studios that are 24 by
30<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:04.879> they're<00:01:05.810> oriented<00:01:06.170> about<00:01:06.740> 10<00:01:07.310> degrees

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
30 and they're oriented about 10 degrees

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.380 
30 and they're oriented about 10 degrees
east<00:01:08.360> of<00:01:09.010> true<00:01:10.010> north<00:01:10.310> and<00:01:10.760> so<00:01:10.880> what<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.060> does

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
east of true north and so what that does

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.090 
east of true north and so what that does
is<00:01:11.450> it<00:01:11.870> makes<00:01:12.280> it<00:01:14.229> so<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.380> we<00:01:15.470> get<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> little

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
is it makes it so that we get a little

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.010 
is it makes it so that we get a little
bit<00:01:16.220> of<00:01:16.340> Sun<00:01:16.580> in<00:01:16.760> in<00:01:16.910> the<00:01:17.000> morning<00:01:17.390> but<00:01:17.840> that's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
bit of Sun in in the morning but that's

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.620 
bit of Sun in in the morning but that's
not<00:01:18.350> usually<00:01:18.680> when<00:01:18.800> we're<00:01:18.950> painting<00:01:19.370> and<00:01:19.670> we

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
not usually when we're painting and we

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.420 
not usually when we're painting and we
don't<00:01:20.810> get<00:01:20.930> any<00:01:20.990> Sun<00:01:21.530> in<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.830> rest<00:01:21.980> of<00:01:22.160> the<00:01:22.280> day

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
don't get any Sun in the rest of the day

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.510 
don't get any Sun in the rest of the day
so<00:01:22.490> that's<00:01:22.910> that's<00:01:23.390> a<00:01:23.600> really<00:01:23.750> lovely<00:01:24.080> thing

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
so that's that's a really lovely thing

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.110 
so that's that's a really lovely thing
we've<00:01:25.520> been<00:01:26.060> here<00:01:26.510> about<00:01:26.960> 18<00:01:27.740> years<00:01:28.460> moved

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
we've been here about 18 years moved

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:36.760 
we've been here about 18 years moved
here<00:01:29.600> probably<00:01:30.080> in<00:01:30.490> 1992<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:34.960> had<00:01:35.960> at<00:01:36.410> first

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
here probably in 1992 and had at first

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.910 
here probably in 1992 and had at first
we<00:01:36.980> hated<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.520> house<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.800> but<00:01:39.800> have

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
we hated the house and but have

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.580 
we hated the house and but have
continued<00:01:40.490> to<00:01:40.520> remodel<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:41.420> build<00:01:41.660> on<00:01:41.960> until

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
continued to remodel and build on until

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.230 
continued to remodel and build on until
finally<00:01:43.870> we<00:01:45.160> we<00:01:46.160> we<00:01:46.490> really<00:01:46.670> love<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.090> house

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
finally we we we really love the house

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.650 
finally we we we really love the house
so<00:01:47.570> we've<00:01:47.750> we've<00:01:48.230> really<00:01:48.740> expanded<00:01:49.160> it<00:01:49.660> this

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
so we've we've really expanded it this

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:52.360 
so we've we've really expanded it this
color<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:51.200> kind<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.500> evolved<00:01:52.010> over<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.280> years

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
color is kind of evolved over the years

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.440 
color is kind of evolved over the years
because<00:01:53.120> we<00:01:53.300> have<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:55.640> Art<00:01:55.850> Students<00:01:56.270> League

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
because we have the Art Students League

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.380 
because we have the Art Students League
there's<00:01:56.990> an<00:01:57.110> old<00:01:57.320> tradition<00:01:58.010> of<00:01:58.130> having<00:01:58.430> the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
there's an old tradition of having the

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.000 
there's an old tradition of having the
walls<00:01:59.630> painted<00:02:00.050> dark<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.560> reason<00:02:00.860> for

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
walls painted dark and the reason for

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.220 
walls painted dark and the reason for
that<00:02:01.070> is<00:02:01.310> that<00:02:01.340> no<00:02:01.910> matter<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.840> artist

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
that is that no matter what the artist

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.090 
that is that no matter what the artist
is<00:02:03.440> that<00:02:03.500> is<00:02:04.210> teaching<00:02:05.210> in<00:02:05.300> the<00:02:05.420> studio<00:02:06.100> darker

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
is that is teaching in the studio darker

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.219 
is that is teaching in the studio darker
walls<00:02:07.370> make<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.149> that<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.690> strong

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
walls make it so that you have strong

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.550 
walls make it so that you have strong
light<00:02:09.500> and<00:02:09.649> shadow<00:02:10.720> so<00:02:11.720> that's<00:02:11.930> um

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
light and shadow so that's um

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.589 
light and shadow so that's um
that<00:02:12.830> was<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.129> main<00:02:13.310> reason<00:02:13.670> for<00:02:14.300> so<00:02:14.480> the

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
that was the main reason for so the

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.360 
that was the main reason for so the
color<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:14.900> kind<00:02:15.200> of<00:02:15.260> evolved<00:02:15.769> it<00:02:15.860> started<00:02:16.190> with

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
color is kind of evolved it started with

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.099 
color is kind of evolved it started with
the<00:02:16.670> GN<00:02:17.330> 25<00:02:17.959> benjamin<00:02:18.620> moore<00:02:18.800> jian<00:02:19.160> 25<00:02:19.640> and<00:02:20.109> it

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.109 
the GN 25 benjamin moore jian 25 and it

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:23.660 
the GN 25 benjamin moore jian 25 and it
kind<00:02:21.499> of<00:02:21.560> has<00:02:21.739> evolved<00:02:22.280> over<00:02:22.489> the<00:02:22.519> years<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
kind of has evolved over the years and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.320 
kind of has evolved over the years and
right<00:02:24.630> now<00:02:24.930> we<00:02:25.800> were<00:02:26.520> when<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:26.760> painted<00:02:27.240> our

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
right now we were when we painted our

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.930 
right now we were when we painted our
Studios<00:02:27.900> we<00:02:28.110> were<00:02:28.230> painting<00:02:28.500> at<00:02:28.709> Mohegan<00:02:29.489> sage

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
Studios we were painting at Mohegan sage

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.940 
Studios we were painting at Mohegan sage
Benjamin<00:02:30.630> Moore<00:02:30.810> Moore<00:02:31.260> Mohican<00:02:31.860> sage<00:02:32.160> and

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
Benjamin Moore Moore Mohican sage and

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.790 
Benjamin Moore Moore Mohican sage and
now<00:02:34.950> they've<00:02:35.220> changed<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.819> formula<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:36.870> no

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
now they've changed that formula so no

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.250 
now they've changed that formula so no
we<00:02:38.640> were<00:02:38.760> doing<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.270> little<00:02:39.569> bit<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.870> fix-up

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
we were doing a little bit of fix-up

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.370 
we were doing a little bit of fix-up
work<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> now<00:02:40.830> we're<00:02:41.090> we're<00:02:42.110> trying<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.200> match

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
work and now we're we're trying to match

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.979 
work and now we're we're trying to match
that<00:02:43.680> color<00:02:43.890> again<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.700> value<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:45.810> also

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
that color again so value but it's also

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.040 
that color again so value but it's also
that<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.380> color<00:02:46.650> is<00:02:46.739> very<00:02:47.239> neutral<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.959> a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
that the color is very neutral so it's a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.500 
that the color is very neutral so it's a
very<00:02:49.260> neutral<00:02:49.680> and<00:02:49.890> this<00:02:50.040> particular<00:02:50.510> Mohegan

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
very neutral and this particular Mohegan

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.199 
very neutral and this particular Mohegan
sage<00:02:51.810> had<00:02:52.230> some<00:02:52.739> red<00:02:53.010> in<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.700> so<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.000> made

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
sage had some red in it and so it made

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.509 
sage had some red in it and so it made
it<00:02:54.360> less<00:02:54.750> green<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> little<00:02:55.860> more<00:02:55.950> neutral

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
it less green and a little more neutral

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.850 
it less green and a little more neutral
and<00:02:56.730> just<00:02:56.910> like<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.420> beautiful<00:02:57.720> color<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
and just like a beautiful color so that

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.920 
and just like a beautiful color so that
everything<00:02:59.519> looks<00:02:59.550> good<00:02:59.910> against<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.540> which

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
everything looks good against it which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.080 
everything looks good against it which
is<00:03:01.110> actually<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.560> mane<00:03:01.769> and<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.610> get<00:03:02.760> strong

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
is actually the mane and you get strong

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.050 
is actually the mane and you get strong
light<00:03:03.480> and<00:03:03.630> shadow<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.739> as<00:03:04.830> you<00:03:04.950> can<00:03:05.069> see<00:03:05.130> you

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
light and shadow so as you can see you

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.420 
light and shadow so as you can see you
know<00:03:06.209> we<00:03:06.390> have<00:03:06.660> these<00:03:06.930> slanted<00:03:07.620> walls<00:03:07.950> so

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
know we have these slanted walls so

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.009 
know we have these slanted walls so
that's<00:03:08.610> the<00:03:08.760> other<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:09.269> other<00:03:09.420> idea<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.900> that

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
that's the other the other idea is that

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.740 
that's the other the other idea is that
the<00:03:10.170> light<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.799> coming<00:03:11.190> more<00:03:11.459> from<00:03:11.730> on<00:03:11.940> top

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the light is coming more from on top

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.479 
the light is coming more from on top
you<00:03:13.140> know<00:03:13.260> when<00:03:13.440> hitting<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.860> object<00:03:14.340> more

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
you know when hitting the object more

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.479 
you know when hitting the object more
from<00:03:14.760> on<00:03:14.910> top<00:03:15.180> rather<00:03:15.480> than<00:03:15.750> from<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.140> side<00:03:16.489> so

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
from on top rather than from the side so

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.340 
from on top rather than from the side so
that's<00:03:17.610> why<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.880> have<00:03:18.060> very<00:03:18.299> high<00:03:18.600> you<00:03:19.230> know

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
that's why we have very high you know

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.910 
that's why we have very high you know
North<00:03:19.650> lights<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.750> they're<00:03:21.750> slanted<00:03:22.110> by

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
North lights and they're slanted by

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.780 
North lights and they're slanted by
about<00:03:23.220> I<00:03:23.819> think<00:03:24.360> 10<00:03:24.600> degrees<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:26.340> know<00:03:26.459> so

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
about I think 10 degrees you know so

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.569 
about I think 10 degrees you know so
that<00:03:27.560> so<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.650> just<00:03:28.829> makes<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.160> very<00:03:29.370> dramatic

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
that so it just makes a very dramatic

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:31.520 
that so it just makes a very dramatic
light<00:03:30.120> and<00:03:30.420> beautiful<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:31.109> have<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.350> light

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
light and beautiful to have the light

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.000 
light and beautiful to have the light
coming<00:03:31.890> from<00:03:31.920> on<00:03:32.220> top<00:03:32.959> we<00:03:33.959> do<00:03:34.320> get<00:03:34.530> some<00:03:34.739> great
