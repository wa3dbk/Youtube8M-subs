Jamaica<00:01:54.719> and<00:01:55.079> in<00:01:55.889> the<00:01:56.100> 17th<00:01:56.850> century<00:01:56.880> as<00:01:57.149> you

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
Jamaica and in the 17th century as you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.510 
Jamaica and in the 17th century as you
know<00:01:57.389> the<00:01:57.840> height<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.469> sugar<00:01:58.859> was<00:01:59.009> king<00:01:59.249> and

period of the sugar the rum the slavery
and<00:02:04.469> all<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:04.829> has<00:02:05.359> is<00:02:06.359> a<00:02:06.420> story<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> has

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and all of that has is a story that has

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.070 
and all of that has is a story that has
yet<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.709> be<00:02:07.829> told<00:02:08.130> in<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.459> very<00:02:08.720> sensitive<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
yet to be told in a very sensitive and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.280 
yet to be told in a very sensitive and
tasteful<00:02:10.500> way<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.649> we

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
tasteful way and we

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.890 
tasteful way and we
we're<00:02:11.409> making<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.860> attempt<00:02:12.159> to<00:02:12.400> to<00:02:13.150> hair<00:02:13.780> is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
we're making that attempt to to hair is

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.740 
we're making that attempt to to hair is
this<00:02:14.049> very<00:02:14.260> historic<00:02:14.439> port<00:02:14.980> where<00:02:15.750> majority

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
this very historic port where majority

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.390 
this very historic port where majority
of<00:02:17.109> the<00:02:17.680> slaves<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.040> were<00:02:18.159> brought<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
of the slaves that were brought to

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.800 
of the slaves that were brought to
Jamaica<00:02:18.819> were<00:02:18.939> actually<00:02:19.239> brought<00:02:19.420> into<00:02:19.599> this

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
Jamaica were actually brought into this

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.220 
Jamaica were actually brought into this
port<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.730> majority<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.269> rum<00:02:22.510> molasses

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
port the majority of the rum molasses

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.780 
port the majority of the rum molasses
and<00:02:23.349> so<00:02:23.469> on<00:02:23.560> that<00:02:23.650> was<00:02:23.769> exported<00:02:24.280> came<00:02:24.489> out<00:02:24.640> of

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and so on that was exported came out of

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.740 
and so on that was exported came out of
this<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.680> significance<00:02:27.400> of<00:02:27.489> itself<00:02:27.939> makes

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
this so the significance of itself makes

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.920 
this so the significance of itself makes
a<00:02:28.959> good<00:02:29.700> center<00:02:30.700> point<00:02:30.909> from<00:02:31.390> which<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.810> begin

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
a good center point from which to begin

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.990 
a good center point from which to begin
that<00:02:32.260> journey<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:33.370> we<00:02:33.489> feel<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.700> with<00:02:33.970> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
that journey so we feel that with the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.149 
that journey so we feel that with the
ships<00:02:34.269> coming<00:02:34.510> in<00:02:34.720> we<00:02:35.349> would<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:35.650> able<00:02:35.829> to<00:02:35.920> take

we would say about twenty percent of the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.569 
we would say about twenty percent of the

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:24.930 
going to go through restoration we've
we've<00:03:23.709> done<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.979> right<00:03:24.010> at<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.400> very<00:03:24.430> edge<00:03:24.760> of

Kirby<00:03:55.449> well<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.079> think<00:03:56.229> with<00:03:56.799> the<00:03:56.889> other<00:03:57.010> ports

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
Kirby well I think with the other ports

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.640 
Kirby well I think with the other ports
we<00:03:57.669> have<00:03:57.849> two<00:03:58.239> very<00:03:58.479> well-established<00:03:58.900> ports

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
we have two very well-established ports

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.080 
we have two very well-established ports
and<00:03:59.799> they're<00:03:59.889> highly<00:04:00.099> recognized<00:04:00.669> for<00:04:00.849> devil

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
and they're highly recognized for devil

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.399 
and they're highly recognized for devil

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
creating a board that doesn't exist that

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.809 
creating a board that doesn't exist that
I<00:04:11.139> mean<00:04:11.319> it's<00:04:11.530> a<00:04:11.590> brand<00:04:11.859> that<00:04:11.979> has<00:04:12.609> never

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
I mean it's a brand that has never

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.220 
I mean it's a brand that has never
existed

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
existed

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.550 
existed
did<00:04:13.349> before<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.310> we<00:04:14.459> think<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.239> all<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.470> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
did before but we think that all that it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.110 
did before but we think that all that it
has<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.769> offer<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.370> the<00:04:17.459> surrounding<00:04:17.880> areas

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
has to offer and the surrounding areas

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.650 
has to offer and the surrounding areas
has<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.359> offer<00:04:18.600> is<00:04:19.049> in<00:04:19.440> itself<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.950> draw<00:04:20.329> with<00:04:21.329> a

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
has to offer is in itself a draw with a

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.420 
has to offer is in itself a draw with a
couple<00:04:22.049> to<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.230> fact<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.590> the<00:04:23.130> port

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
couple to the fact that the port

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.370 
couple to the fact that the port
actually<00:04:23.850> sits<00:04:24.150> somewhere<00:04:24.540> in<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.050> region<00:04:25.169> of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
actually sits somewhere in the region of

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.110 
actually sits somewhere in the region of
about<00:04:25.620> half<00:04:25.860> way<00:04:26.100> between<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.580> two<00:04:26.760> existing

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
about half way between the two existing

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.590 
about half way between the two existing
ports<00:04:27.660> so<00:04:28.560> even<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:30.000> those<00:04:30.120> vessels<00:04:30.510> that
