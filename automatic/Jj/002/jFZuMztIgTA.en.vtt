or<00:05:16.319> something<00:05:16.620> and<00:05:16.770> saved<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:17.069> fake-out<00:05:17.430> but<00:05:17.789> I

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
or something and saved a fake-out but I

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.339 
or something and saved a fake-out but I
didn't<00:05:18.180> you<00:05:18.569> know<00:05:18.690> what<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:18.840> didn't<00:05:19.110> want<00:05:19.169> to
