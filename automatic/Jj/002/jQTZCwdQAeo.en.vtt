00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.730
 and 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.950
 i swear to second member i set last 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.849
 so if i finish last then i dont 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.849
 I am not ashamed of myself 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.670
 he caresses a win there 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.150
 go do it now 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.510
 People also fly the runway in this feel 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.399
 very nice to keep traveling 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.399
 set the tredgold to maximum 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.499
 I am me already 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.610
 more our fifth now I check again 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.610
 doctors start spun and now I am 50 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.180
 and immediately the first light that lies ours 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.180
 could form 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.549
 yes you are older 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.549
 very difficult 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 you belong to 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.509
 I really enjoyed the game 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.520
 to play 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.109
 so close to reality comes us too 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.119
 and I actually have no idea what it is 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.159
 but I have the idea that I have a formula 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.100
 1 car control that's begins 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.590
 real heating responded very globally 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.329
 it is the same if you continue 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
 then there are also many things 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.289
 who were not good in the old game or 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.979
 not calculated properly are actually 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.229
 to be resolved 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.539
 it has come even closer to that time 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.670
 I already feel the worse 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.479
 that literally means victory 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.780
 you lie 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.760
 how cold seeing 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.210
 but you can't touch it i have 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.210
 don't smell it 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810
 for me 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 the difference a half seconds in stores 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.070
 my image has also improved for a moment 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.720
 in 2000 something very clear how far the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.540
 genes in front are behind you like a big one 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.750
 complaint the previous game that they would look like 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.290
 much better 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.290
 a warm up 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.940
 sometimes better than the one we have in 2010 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.040
 seen multiplayer but no 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.320
 split screen no coal 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.550
 safetycar new we also not seen and 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.770
 so that makes it a bit tricky to get one 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.420
 to give my opinion about the game 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.850
 well we have seen a lot of what 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 you also had a 2010 and that was a better one 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.750
 but all those headline features that are new 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.260
 we have not seen anything of it yet 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.260
 it is a pity 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.670
 but who you where the 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.670
 all fantastic game is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.670
 so 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.130
 View this steering wheel 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.130
 this one 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.400
 fitness center 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.250
 very sorry, I really liked the 2010 version 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.840
 cold well we saw that if you have one 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.550
 contest won or you were the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.200
 race team becomes the car jumps the 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.490
 very happy here am not just 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.590
 always send a shame but you do it 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.980
 for the party allah 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.780
 but buy yes 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.790
 I am very curious about those things 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.690
 who have come to that improved 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.790
 to be 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.060
 I think it's worth that game 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.060
 to buy
