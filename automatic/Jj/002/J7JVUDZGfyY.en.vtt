00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.250
 hello to all and well here is a first salvo of blows that is carried 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.359
 badly is done 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.749
 these are copies the coco itself 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.079
 so to realize 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.779
 the user 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:15.650
 we'll have to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.150
 this is the meaning 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.740
 10 grams of brown sugar so it's very compact sugar in general if we 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.810
 can use brown sugar abbas during the phase 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.660
 and patatras with great fan of normal juices 100 grams of coconut 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.239
 grated children of 18 the backlash a little thick whether in store 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:33.940
 organic 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.930
 but if not grated coconut after that we must do well 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.360
 once again 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.040
 e vanilla extracts worse effect kids a lot of the year 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.280
 whole to give really good to win 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.100
 it will also require 150 5 grams of 150 grams of flour grams of salt 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 a little bit of bicarbonate 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.600
 let's be clear it will keep the blue everyday 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.240
 and she will sell well to start this recipe 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.570
 we go 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 mix things up the sugar site 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.280
 such a case ap 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 here is a very compact policeman a year since it is harmful 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.510
 with the grail 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.580
 picard of the troop to see so that represents 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 it represents a good teaspoon 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.960
 then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 dishes 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.970
 I am proud 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 his reply 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.530
 I'm very small I think in the previous version of Monday 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 his training club 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
 in his daddy cops 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.650
 Warning 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.690
 however without much suffering from 190 kiln 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.690
 bright red call 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.990
 fitch 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.489
 now he has added 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.489
 Why 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.699
 keystone photo with his friends 

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:31.699
 so a good spoon 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.439
 the vanilla bean also 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:39.339
 so as usual 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:40.879
 in the meaning 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.879
 of a length 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.049
 full length 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.309
 then the cards ati 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.509
 but with the blade of the knife the flat of the knife you scratched 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.159
 see all the beautiful black teeth 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 I use the preparation 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.329
 simon cftc and unsa 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.759
 the pipes one of the vehicles 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.689
 because reveals what you pay so decrease in the end that 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.099
 just do not look too bake slightly brown on the sides 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.439
 much less 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.169
 and in fact that makes it possible to have costs that would be wrong 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:20.949
 and for his life 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.949
 frank dancevic lithium and its borders 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:30.989
 this distribution then we reject imperial they have flour 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:35.409
 a spokesperson 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.409
 at this point i will continue ap 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:40.539
 humanist 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:43.399
 its status we do not tell you 

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:46.399
 then you mix well the busy 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.719
 and finally 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:53.719
 the note still head 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.069
 here 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.859
 so with these flake points 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.069
 coconut many third countries 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.449
 very crispy special funds 

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:06.279
 but again coconut 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.909
 traditional 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.909
 why do you see in a mixture nicely 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.889
 all are well integrated and then it's good to do it 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.009
 a little girl 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.009
 with this paste so no need to pass it to the fridge 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.029
 politicize directly 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.029
 it's almost a story that lasts 

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:31.270
 prepare it 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.270
 a beach 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.240
 whistle and music 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.960
 patrick janssens 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.330
 either using a teaspoon and I join in my senses we have to do 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.740
 more 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.330
 the nudge that targets facts in kinshasa 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.330
 atallah I'm going format 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.330
 what moves 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.449
 for the woman that poutine 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.650
 that they all have the same size 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.650
 we wanted to erase because they are of course this year 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.490
 so I'm going to prepare all the little steps 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.990
 bake nationals 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.580
 at 180 degrees we would be inclined 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.580
 and then by day 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:21.550
 that's just for my pleasure the continent 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.550
 only have to go back about ten minutes 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:29.680
 after ten minutes since its bursting look at the putschists 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.639
 for the homeland then the military parade and on the sides are the 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.650
 people to die 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.370
 for her it's perfect it's amazing like what's wrong 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.370
 in the health section 

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.520
 it was the party 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.319
 your work plan 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:45.030
 we'll leave them for three minutes 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.710
 you will see elsewhere 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.099
 they hardened would not arrive and could then 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:52.419
 the strongest progression of the groups 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.419
 since it's over three years so we'll say a little delusion 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.590
 but then it is of course to keep them in a hermetic box 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.740
 some days 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.779
 you offer them to boxes and 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:03.150
 very very nice 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.310
 that's where they will have a tendency to flatten a non-European ten years this is 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.409
 normal 

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:12.050
 to see it is a very very good appetite with his girlfriends in 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.990
 a statement 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.009
 and I find you on the kitchen for others of accomplices 

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:17.219
 very much everything is going well
