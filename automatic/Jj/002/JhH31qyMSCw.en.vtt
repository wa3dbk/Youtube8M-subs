 Hello everyone, everything good

 Today I'm here to show you some more. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.140
 What did you do there in Japan? 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.960
 this time showing the most 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.650
 different zones and weird ones that I 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.520
 to get on vacation when we go 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.829
 over there 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.469
 The first item I have here for 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.050
 show you this product here on the board 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 shop that you have in Japan also now 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 also here in Brazil to sell 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.010
 even for a very good progressive process 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.969
 if I bought this line that calls 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 frutech cranberry which is a special 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.820
 Christmas is the end of the year and this product 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.660
 that I have here is a b 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.710
 dl I looked in the pot so I think 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.820
 it looked like a jelly really and look at the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.960
 What is a soap like soap? 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 liquid only it has a texture well 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.350
 different 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:26.780
 I'll show you close to see 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.780
 How is the texture? 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.640
 You see, it's very consistent. 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:40.590
 5 is not a liquid soap 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.070
 but if that my thick consistency 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.170
 almost a gel of the type CVT 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:57.450
 human 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:02:02.149
 otto venom is a ball and has a 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.170
 Very tasty tattoo, has 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.429
 difference then I bought there in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.500
 Japan were the soaps in powder and I have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.560
 here of that mark that I think speaks 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.349
 funkel 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.450

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:24.709
 I have this one that are mini 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:26.690
 soap of the brand sui comes out 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.610

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.380

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.080
 to note that the marina has already done 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.739
 I did not do my nail so do not fix it 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:50.000

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:52.310
 people open here the little thing that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.049
 works that neither the other just look 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.660
 to foam and wash my face I love it 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.580
 I think it's very cool, very different. 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.890
 It works fine, I bought it too. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:09.290
 these handkerchiefs here and the bioware 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:14.239
 Can you read it? 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.190
 oils and even if the refreshing and 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:25.519
 think ours are two different months 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:30.079
 it 's not all in one shot at 5 on that side 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:33.190
 blue here it is oiliness remover 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.140
 that we use that way so 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:41.510
 remove oil from the face and from this side 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:43.690
 from here it's time for you to cool down 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.690
 in the heat 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.670

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.180
 I did not arrive with the skin super well. 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.569
 oily and shining and not the sugar 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:05.420

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:09.109
 item that these Japanese Japanese 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.840
 They like very much those masks with the 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.459
 face and that people here in Brazil do not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.970
 It has a lot of custom to use, I think 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.430
 nor is it right to sell the house she 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.070
 gave me a lot of these masks here I 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.940
 I bought another so much and today I'll open 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.460
 That 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.400
 to show you I have not yet used it 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.990
 She 'll break then I'll open it for you. 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.870
 Show 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.690
 there already wet everything else was so use 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.150
 this mask at night leaves the 15 20 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.240
 minutes on the face then take off the mask 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.880
 plays the game and then passes the 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.950
 face spreading aguinha that creminho 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.150
 and left on the skin as a 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.840
 treatment 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.550
 let's see how it is that here is black 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:05:00.070
 same as imagining well wet well 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.070
 wet but I did not like doing melek 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:07.190
 It did not smell bad and there was no one there. 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.260
 I'm not full of rhythm products 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.230
 beauty will see how I open here 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:21.170
 not to tear 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:29.300
 It's a wet money and you went in 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:33.140
 face and stay with her in the 15 minutes 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.360
 with the treatment this here I do not know 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.650
 say what treatment she does in 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.470
 skin because there is nothing at all nothing at all 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:48.220
 nothing nothing written in english here 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:51.140
 Someone can translate for us to tell 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.970
 How do we get after wearing 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:59.210
 this mask becomes rejuvenated type 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:01.520
 you're ten years younger than me 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.620
 to know what is the benefit of it one thing 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.490
 that it is very common to find it in the 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.490
 Japan 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.700
 are these masks put on the face 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:12.620
 they warm up by themselves 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.710
 the Japanese think that this is a 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.260
 relaxing mask and I have the habit of 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:24.370
 use them to rest and just like you 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.460
 even the handle to put on the face and 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.560
 Oh, by the time it starts to grow alone 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.290
 I do not know what the magic is not in 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.310
 contact with the air what happens 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:39.280
 the mask begins to warm up and 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:45.870
 it does not get hot but it's super cool 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:50.770
 see if you can get the globe machine 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:53.470

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:55.720
 here in the face 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.790

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.620
