00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
to be a bit different did come here with

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.620 
to be a bit different did come here with

training<00:00:16.049> before<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> mood<00:00:16.920> slow<00:00:17.550> faster

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
training before the mood slow faster

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.429 
training before the mood slow faster
here<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.210> mean<00:00:18.449> everything<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:19.109> need<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
I get faster decisions on the eyes like

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.480 
I get faster decisions on the eyes like
putting<00:00:21.960> on<00:00:22.020> passing<00:00:22.529> everything<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.460> that

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
putting on passing everything like that

putting on passing everything like that
so<00:00:24.080> more<00:00:25.189> intensively<00:00:26.269> from<00:00:27.269> practice<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.720> do

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so more intensively from practice we do

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
so more intensively from practice we do
with<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.439> European<00:00:28.890> players<00:00:29.130> there's<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.460> bit

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
with your European players there's a bit

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.980 
with your European players there's a bit
of<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> learning<00:00:29.880> curve<00:00:30.060> in<00:00:30.510> regards<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
of a learning curve in regards to the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.720 
of a learning curve in regards to the
size<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> ice<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.920> things<00:00:32.279> happening<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
size of the ice and things happening a

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.400 
size of the ice and things happening a
little<00:00:32.850> bit<00:00:33.059> quicker<00:00:33.300> here<00:00:33.600> but<00:00:33.780> Henrik<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.200> i

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
little bit quicker here but Henrik I i

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.830 
little bit quicker here but Henrik I i
think<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.070> fit<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.370> very<00:00:35.520> well<00:00:35.670> one<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
think is fit in very well one of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.330 
think is fit in very well one of the
reasons<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.710> he<00:00:37.860> came<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.219> great

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
reasons for it was he came in great

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.459 
reasons for it was he came in great
shape<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.790> count<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> really<00:00:39.390> wanted<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.780> make

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
shape to count you really wanted to make

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
shape to count you really wanted to make
this<00:00:40.680> human<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.610> not<00:00:41.760> just<00:00:41.940> make<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.210> to<00:00:42.420> play

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this human and not just make it to play

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.240 
this human and not just make it to play
an<00:00:42.690> important<00:00:43.050> role<00:00:43.110> line<00:00:43.379> so<00:00:43.680> far<00:00:43.950> he's<00:00:44.070> done

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
an important role line so far he's done

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.190 
an important role line so far he's done
not<00:00:44.489> goals<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.390> been<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> little<00:00:45.780> hard<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
sometimes the puck just doesn't go in

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
scared for this points is probably

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.410 
scared for this points is probably
setting<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.310> guy<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.610> for<00:01:11.820> failure<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.299> know

strong skaters the line has developed
some<00:01:33.970> nice<00:01:34.149> chemistry<00:01:34.479> and<00:01:35.080> both<00:01:35.320> those

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
some nice chemistry and both those

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.560

players<00:01:35.830> are<00:01:36.130> often<00:01:36.460> good<00:01:36.610> starts<00:01:37.060> they're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
players are often good starts they're

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.300 
players are often good starts they're
still<00:01:37.840> together<00:01:38.020> we<00:01:38.409> I<00:01:38.440> mean<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.740> shuffle<00:01:39.190> them

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
still together we I mean we shuffle them

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.889 
still together we I mean we shuffle them
a<00:01:39.399> little<00:01:39.520> bit<00:01:39.700> on<00:01:39.789> this<00:01:39.909> last<00:01:40.119> road<00:01:40.390> trip<00:01:40.420> but

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
a little bit on this last road trip but

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.550 
a little bit on this last road trip but
Frank<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.680> Hank<00:01:41.860> and<00:01:42.070> Ben<00:01:42.159> together

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
Frank and Hank and Ben together

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.420 
Frank and Hank and Ben together
basically<00:01:44.560> from<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:44.799> beginning<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.310> year

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
basically from the beginning of the year

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.590 
basically from the beginning of the year
and<00:01:45.580> I<00:01:45.610> think<00:01:45.820> they<00:01:45.880> do<00:01:45.939> have<00:01:46.210> a<00:01:46.240> little<00:01:46.360> bit<00:01:46.509> of

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
and I think they do have a little bit of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.870 
and I think they do have a little bit of
chemistry<00:01:46.780> there<00:01:47.200> they<00:01:48.100> are<00:01:48.250> back<00:01:48.460> with<00:01:48.640> ryan

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
chemistry there they are back with ryan

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.760 
chemistry there they are back with ryan
right<00:01:49.180> now<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:49.630> hopefully<00:01:49.810> they<00:01:50.140> can<00:01:50.320> continue

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
right now so hopefully they can continue

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.170 
right now so hopefully they can continue
to<00:01:50.830> develop<00:01:51.039> together<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.700> keep<00:01:51.939> getting

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180 
to develop together and keep getting

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.350
