00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
changes I've made I added this filter

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.630 
changes I've made I added this filter
because<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.809> could<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.170> find<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:17.160> sponge<00:00:17.460> filter

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
because I could not find a sponge filter

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.599 
because I could not find a sponge filter
anywhere<00:00:18.420> not<00:00:18.600> even<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> Petco<00:00:19.320> Petsmart<00:00:19.920> you

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
anywhere not even a Petco Petsmart you

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
anywhere not even a Petco Petsmart you
know<00:00:20.699> local<00:00:20.970> fish<00:00:21.689> stores<00:00:21.960> I<00:00:22.230> could<00:00:22.619> not<00:00:22.769> find

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
know local fish stores I could not find

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.150 
know local fish stores I could not find
one<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.390> what<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
one but this is what I have it's this

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.099 
one but this is what I have it's this
homemade<00:00:26.550> filter<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.000> made<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.050> is

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
homemade filter that I made and this is

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.790 
homemade filter that I made and this is
like<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> three<00:00:29.279> gallon<00:00:29.460> filter<00:00:30.080> it<00:00:31.080> has<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.289> foam

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
like a three gallon filter it has a foam

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.920 
like a three gallon filter it has a foam
has<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.669> hole<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.270> there's<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.600> sponge

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
has a hole in it and there's a sponge

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.410 
has a hole in it and there's a sponge
that<00:00:34.230> filters<00:00:34.559> through<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> bottom<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:36.180> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that filters through the bottom at the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
that filters through the bottom at the
bottom<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:37.020> closed<00:00:37.440> up<00:00:37.680> with<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:39.559> so<00:00:40.559> water

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
bottom is closed up with this so water

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
bottom is closed up with this so water
can<00:00:41.340> get<00:00:41.489> through<00:00:41.730> but<00:00:42.030> no<00:00:42.690> fish<00:00:42.930> it's<00:00:43.140> really

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
can get through but no fish it's really

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
can get through but no fish it's really
small<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.190> really<00:00:44.250> fine

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
small and really fine

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.360 
small and really fine
so<00:00:45.180> nothing<00:00:45.660> can<00:00:45.690> really<00:00:46.079> go<00:00:46.200> through<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> I'm

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
so nothing can really go through it I'm

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950 
so nothing can really go through it I'm
gonna<00:00:47.640> give<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:47.820> an<00:00:47.879> update<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.420> since<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> had

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
like a you know almost 150 you know fry

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.619 
like a you know almost 150 you know fry
not<00:00:54.350> any<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.469> fraction<00:00:56.039> made<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> alive<00:00:56.760> there's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
not any a fraction made it alive there's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
not any a fraction made it alive there's
only<00:00:57.809> like<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.199> least<00:00:58.379> I've<00:00:58.920> counted<00:00:59.160> at<00:00:59.399> least

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
only like at least I've counted at least

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.500 
only like at least I've counted at least
10<00:01:00.090> fry<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.350> are<00:01:02.120> free-swimming<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.420> are

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
10 fry that are free-swimming that are

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.020 
10 fry that are free-swimming that are
fine<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> think<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.040> can<00:01:05.220> see<00:01:05.460> some<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.729> them

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
fine I think you can see some of them

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
fine I think you can see some of them
right<00:01:06.990> there<00:01:08.299> roughly<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.540> couple<00:01:09.750> centimeters

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
right there roughly a couple centimeters

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.130 
right there roughly a couple centimeters
long<00:01:10.790> they<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.270> good<00:01:12.390> condition<00:01:12.570> because

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
long they are in good condition because

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.990 
long they are in good condition because
I<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.439> feed<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.890> every<00:01:14.010> day<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> do<00:01:14.460> change<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
I do feed them every day I do change the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.789 
I do feed them every day I do change the
water<00:01:15.210> every<00:01:15.330> day<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:16.049> change<00:01:16.409> at<00:01:16.560> least<00:01:16.710> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
water every day I change at least a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.310 
water every day I change at least a
quarter<00:01:16.979> every<00:01:17.369> day<00:01:17.580> I<00:01:18.140> don't<00:01:19.140> know<00:01:19.200> whether

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they just feed them a lot of branch and

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.080 
they just feed them a lot of branch and
that's<00:01:49.920> what<00:01:50.099> I've<00:01:50.219> been<00:01:50.340> doing<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
that's what I've been doing I'm just

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.289 
that's what I've been doing I'm just
being<00:01:51.299> fitting<00:01:51.599> them<00:01:51.780> every<00:01:52.530> three<00:01:53.209> three<00:01:54.209> to

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
being fitting them every three three to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.429 
being fitting them every three three to
four<00:01:54.539> hours<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:55.200> feed<00:01:55.500> them<00:01:55.770> baby<00:01:56.280> brine<00:01:56.520> shrimp

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
four hours I feed them baby brine shrimp

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.209 
four hours I feed them baby brine shrimp
so<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> they<00:02:00.539> can<00:02:00.689> get<00:02:00.840> bigger<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:01.920> would

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
so so they can get bigger so that would

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.709 
so so they can get bigger so that would
be<00:02:02.340> all<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.579> today<00:02:02.909> guys<00:02:03.179> I'm<00:02:03.420> gonna<00:02:03.509> give
