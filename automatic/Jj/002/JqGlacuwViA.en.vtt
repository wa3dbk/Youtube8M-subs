association series of lectures on fiber

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.860 
association series of lectures on fiber
optics<00:00:07.319> this<00:00:08.130> one<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.460> about<00:00:08.610> visual<00:00:09.389> testing

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
optics this one is about visual testing

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.220 
optics this one is about visual testing
of<00:00:10.260> fiber<00:00:10.590> optics

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.050 

seeing<00:00:17.230> what<00:00:17.529> goes<00:00:17.740> on<00:00:17.980> in<00:00:18.190> fiber<00:00:18.430> optics<00:00:18.910> can

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
seeing what goes on in fiber optics can

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.150 
seeing what goes on in fiber optics can
be<00:00:19.180> difficult<00:00:19.689> because<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.619> human<00:00:20.950> eye<00:00:21.099> is

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.160 
be difficult because the human eye is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.700 
be difficult because the human eye is
not<00:00:21.520> sensitive<00:00:22.060> to<00:00:22.360> the<00:00:22.779> infrared<00:00:23.110> light<00:00:23.500> that

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
not sensitive to the infrared light that

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.339 
not sensitive to the infrared light that
we<00:00:23.830> use<00:00:24.040> for<00:00:24.279> transmission<00:00:25.000> it's<00:00:25.930> invisible

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
we use for transmission it's invisible

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.499 
we use for transmission it's invisible
to<00:00:26.619> most<00:00:26.890> people<00:00:27.340> although<00:00:27.610> some<00:00:28.000> can<00:00:28.180> see<00:00:28.360> out

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
in the 850 nanometer range so what we do

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.650 
in the 850 nanometer range so what we do
is<00:00:32.559> we<00:00:32.739> use<00:00:32.949> visible<00:00:33.519> light<00:00:33.699> sources<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.269> view

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
is we use visible light sources to view

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.189 
is we use visible light sources to view
fibers<00:00:35.199> or<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:36.250> use<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> unique<00:00:37.180> tool<00:00:37.540> that

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
use it with pre polish splice connectors

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.370 
use it with pre polish splice connectors
to<00:02:29.400> optimize<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.150> splice<00:02:30.510> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.960> connector

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.640 
to optimize the splice in the connector
itself<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.940> simply<00:02:33.420> attach<00:02:33.540> a<00:02:33.990> visual<00:02:34.380> fault

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
itself you simply attach a visual fault
