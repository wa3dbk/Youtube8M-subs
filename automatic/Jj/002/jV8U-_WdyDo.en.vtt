too<00:00:35.940> much<00:00:36.210> oil<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.739> this<00:00:38.640> thing<00:00:38.879> runs

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
too much oil in it and this thing runs

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.840 
too much oil in it and this thing runs
at<00:00:39.629> 5,000<00:00:40.260> rpm<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> runs<00:00:41.010> at<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> hundred<00:00:41.640> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
at 5,000 rpm it runs at a hundred and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
at 5,000 rpm it runs at a hundred and
fifteen<00:00:42.210> pounds<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.780> pressure<00:00:43.670> to<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> oil<00:00:45.890> so

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
fifteen pounds of pressure to the oil so

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.270 
fifteen pounds of pressure to the oil so
it's<00:00:47.100> got<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.309> decent<00:00:48.020> oil<00:00:49.020> pressure<00:00:49.289> we're

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
it's got some decent oil pressure we're

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:09.950 
it's got some decent oil pressure we're
gonna<00:00:50.399> do<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> cold<00:00:50.879> start<00:00:51.180> here

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.969 

that's<00:01:10.560> always<00:01:10.710> good

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.139 

oh<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:17.479> actually<00:01:17.780> running<00:01:17.930> without<00:01:18.259> Oh

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
oh it's actually running without Oh

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.080 
oh it's actually running without Oh
usually<00:01:20.149> takes<00:01:20.450> five<00:01:20.689> minutes<00:01:20.869> plus<00:01:21.320> around

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
usually takes five minutes plus around

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.070 
usually takes five minutes plus around
running<00:01:23.090> without<00:01:23.270> choke

the<00:01:26.620> world

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.390 

from<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.850> head<00:01:38.030> gasket<00:01:41.920> most<00:01:42.920> likely<00:01:43.220> from

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
from that head gasket most likely from

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.300 
from that head gasket most likely from
the<00:01:43.490> head<00:01:43.640> gasket<00:01:45.010> since<00:01:46.010> it's<00:01:46.190> flown<00:01:46.780> well<00:01:47.780> I

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
the head gasket since it's flown well I

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.590 
the head gasket since it's flown well I
never<00:01:49.310> really<00:01:49.760> torqued<00:01:50.119> down<00:01:50.180> the<00:01:50.450> head

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
never really torqued down the head

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.859 
never really torqued down the head
gaskets<00:01:51.430> though<00:01:52.430> that<00:01:52.700> could<00:01:52.940> probably<00:01:53.240> have

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
gaskets though that could probably have

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.880 
gaskets though that could probably have
been<00:01:54.590> why<00:01:54.830> I<00:01:55.869> just<00:01:56.869> kind<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:57.110> hand<00:01:57.440> tightened

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
been why I just kind of hand tightened

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.030 
been why I just kind of hand tightened
it<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.100> there<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.930> felt<00:01:59.930> 480<00:02:00.320> foot-pounds

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
it on there and felt 480 foot-pounds

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.920 
it on there and felt 480 foot-pounds
it's<00:02:01.190> probably<00:02:01.580> a<00:02:01.610> little<00:02:01.759> bit<00:02:01.940> too<00:02:02.090> tight<00:02:02.330> and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
it's probably a little bit too tight and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.800 
it's probably a little bit too tight and
it's<00:02:03.409> probably<00:02:03.710> squishing<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.460> wrong<00:02:04.610> way

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
it's probably squishing it the wrong way

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.100 
it's probably squishing it the wrong way
so<00:02:05.810> I<00:02:05.840> got<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.409> old<00:02:06.440> head<00:02:06.770> gaskets<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:08.509> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
so I got the old head gaskets and the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.749 
so I got the old head gaskets and the
valve<00:02:09.440> cover<00:02:09.649> gasket<00:02:10.130> so<00:02:10.250> I'll<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.550> change

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
valve cover gasket so I'll just change

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:19.050 
valve cover gasket so I'll just change
them<00:02:10.880> out

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.710 

yes<00:02:20.060> I<00:02:20.510> put<00:02:21.380> sixty<00:02:22.340> nine<00:02:22.520> point<00:02:22.910> four<00:02:23.120> miles<00:02:23.390> on

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
yes I put sixty nine point four miles on

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.770 
yes I put sixty nine point four miles on
it<00:02:23.870> in<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.080> past<00:02:24.290> four<00:02:24.800> days

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270 

and<00:02:28.290> she's<00:02:28.470> brought<00:02:28.710> an<00:02:28.860> oil<00:02:29.040> like<00:02:29.250> a

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:45.860 
and she's brought an oil like a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.840 

yeah<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:48.760> leads<00:02:48.970> me<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.180> believe<00:02:49.390> that

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
yeah so that leads me to believe that

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.240 
yeah so that leads me to believe that
there's<00:02:51.850> oil<00:02:52.330> getting<00:02:52.810> into<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
there's oil getting into the

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.750 
there's oil getting into the
head<00:02:54.760> gasket<00:02:55.390> urn<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.560> head

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
head gasket urn to the head

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.420 
head gasket urn to the head
not<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.450> head<00:02:59.659> I'm<00:02:59.900> sorry<00:03:00.170> it's<00:03:00.980> been<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.190> long

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
not the head I'm sorry it's been a long

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.699 
not the head I'm sorry it's been a long
day<00:03:01.900> leads<00:03:02.900> me<00:03:03.049> to<00:03:03.080> believe<00:03:03.230> there's<00:03:03.500> oil

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
day leads me to believe there's oil

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.339 
day leads me to believe there's oil
getting<00:03:04.069> into<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.940> cylinder<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.659> it's

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 
getting into the cylinder and it's

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:09.250 
getting into the cylinder and it's
burning<00:03:06.769> it<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.760> sitting<00:03:08.330> overnight<00:03:08.629> it<00:03:09.140> was

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
burning it so sitting overnight it was

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.860 
burning it so sitting overnight it was
leaking<00:03:09.849> into<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:13.000> yeah<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:14.269> not<00:03:14.360> running<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
leaking into it yeah it's not running it

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:23.709 
leaking into it yeah it's not running it
now<00:03:15.080> so<00:03:15.549> that's<00:03:16.549> has<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.819> be<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> problem

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:23.719 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.720 

still<00:03:24.170> have<00:03:24.319> to<00:03:24.379> put<00:03:24.590> all<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.069> plastics<00:03:25.549> back

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
still have to put all the plastics back

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.160 
still have to put all the plastics back
on<00:03:25.939> but<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:26.239> trying<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:26.510> fix<00:03:26.689> all<00:03:26.840> these<00:03:26.959> oil

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
on but I'm trying to fix all these oil

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.120 
on but I'm trying to fix all these oil
leaks<00:03:27.439> first

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.630 

transmission<00:03:31.130> shifts<00:03:31.640> and<00:03:31.790> runs<00:03:32.300> perfect

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
transmission shifts and runs perfect

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.850
