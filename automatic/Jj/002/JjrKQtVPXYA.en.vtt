vibration in addition to that we looked
at<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.600> blocks<00:02:06.870> what<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.710> did<00:02:07.980> was<00:02:08.010> we<00:02:08.310> took

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
at the blocks what we did was we took

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.720 
at the blocks what we did was we took
the<00:02:08.610> factory<00:02:09.210> style<00:02:09.660> blocks<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.920> we<00:02:11.460> just

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
the factory style blocks and we just

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.410
