a player on the line of scrimmage down
near<00:00:24.429> almost<00:00:25.419> looks<00:00:25.599> like<00:00:25.659> they're<00:00:25.899> off<00:00:26.050> sides

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
near almost looks like they're off sides

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.099 
near almost looks like they're off sides
and<00:00:26.769> they<00:00:26.949> seemingly<00:00:27.189> just<00:00:27.429> come<00:00:27.909> through<00:00:28.269> the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
and they seemingly just come through the

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.679 
and they seemingly just come through the
a<00:00:29.409> gap<00:00:29.769> untouched<00:00:30.399> whenever<00:00:31.149> you<00:00:31.300> snap<00:00:31.539> the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
a gap untouched whenever you snap the

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.470 
a gap untouched whenever you snap the
ball<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:33.430> of<00:00:33.550> looks<00:00:33.700> something<00:00:33.910> like<00:00:34.060> that

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
ball kind of looks something like that

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.380 
ball kind of looks something like that
and<00:00:35.050> I'm<00:00:35.950> sure<00:00:36.160> your<00:00:36.490> first<00:00:36.790> instinct<00:00:37.330> is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
and I'm sure your first instinct is

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
and I'm sure your first instinct is
going<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.810> block<00:00:38.080> the<00:00:38.260> running<00:00:38.560> back<00:00:38.740> and<00:00:40.410> i'm

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
going to block the running back and i'm

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.940 
going to block the running back and i'm
sure<00:00:41.710> you've<00:00:41.860> also<00:00:42.040> noticed<00:00:42.700> that<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.950> does

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
sure you've also noticed that that does

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.810 
sure you've also noticed that that does
not<00:00:45.130> really<00:00:45.640> help<00:00:45.940> as<00:00:46.240> well<00:00:46.510> as<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.550> running

with<00:00:51.460> me<00:00:51.640> i'm<00:00:51.730> not<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.940> best<00:00:52.150> turbo<00:00:52.450> Blitzer

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
with me i'm not the best turbo Blitzer

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.640 
with me i'm not the best turbo Blitzer
in<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.079> world<00:00:53.290> because<00:00:53.800> i<00:00:54.010> don't<00:00:54.220> use<00:00:54.550> it<00:00:55.650> as

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
in the world because i don't use it as

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.170 
in the world because i don't use it as
you<00:00:56.800> can<00:00:56.920> see<00:00:57.040> they<00:00:57.220> pretty<00:00:57.370> much<00:00:57.460> just<00:00:57.790> stand

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
you can see they pretty much just stand

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.010 
you can see they pretty much just stand
there<00:00:58.329> and<00:00:58.690> watch<00:00:59.110> as<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:01.030> guy<00:01:01.180> come<00:01:01.540> through

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
there and watch as the guy come through

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.730 
there and watch as the guy come through
the<00:01:02.590> middle<00:01:02.950> seemingly<00:01:03.430> untouched<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:07.740> takes

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
the middle seemingly untouched so takes

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.130 
the middle seemingly untouched so takes
away<00:01:08.979> your<00:01:09.009> under<00:01:09.399> center<00:01:09.670> offense<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.390> shock

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
away your under center offense and shock

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.719 
away your under center offense and shock
on<00:01:11.319> the<00:01:11.469> running<00:01:11.649> backs<00:01:11.920> not<00:01:12.159> really<00:01:12.429> blocking

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
on the running backs not really blocking

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.580 
on the running backs not really blocking
so<00:01:13.450> what<00:01:13.749> can<00:01:13.780> you<00:01:14.020> do<00:01:14.350> to<00:01:14.380> stop<00:01:14.829> this<00:01:15.299> now<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:21.239 --> 00:01:21.249 
way that i would try to stop it is to go

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:25.739 
way that i would try to stop it is to go
simply<00:01:21.729> to<00:01:22.450> a<00:01:22.479> play-action<00:01:23.200> play<00:01:23.679> and<00:01:24.749> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
the edge the running bag does a good job

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.900

and makes the block and yes I know

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.730 
and makes the block and yes I know
there's<00:02:19.300> still<00:02:19.450> a<00:02:19.570> free<00:02:19.900> rusher<00:02:20.230> coming<00:02:20.560> into

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
there's still a free rusher coming into

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.050 
there's still a free rusher coming into
the<00:02:20.860> backfield<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:21.520> you're<00:02:21.670> running<00:02:21.790> back

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the backfield and you're running back

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.510 
the backfield and you're running back
has<00:02:22.240> to<00:02:22.300> pick<00:02:22.600> somebody<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.530> given<00:02:24.400> the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
has to pick somebody up but given the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.070 
has to pick somebody up but given the
choice<00:02:24.700> wouldn't<00:02:25.060> you<00:02:25.240> rather<00:02:25.480> have<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
choice wouldn't you rather have the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.750 
choice wouldn't you rather have the
player<00:02:26.320> coming<00:02:26.620> off<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.010> edge<00:02:27.190> rather<00:02:27.520> than

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
player coming off the edge rather than

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.210 
player coming off the edge rather than
straight<00:02:28.150> down<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> middle<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:28.960> know<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.190> I

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
straight down the middle I know that I

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.740 
straight down the middle I know that I
would<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.590> advise<00:02:33.070> is<00:02:33.520> to<00:02:33.580> find<00:02:34.210> a<00:02:34.390> very

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
would so what I advise is to find a very

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.740 
would so what I advise is to find a very
good<00:02:35.050> play<00:02:35.320> action<00:02:35.560> play<00:02:36.000> so<00:02:37.000> one<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.630> you

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
good play action play so one that you

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.650 
good play action play so one that you
can<00:02:37.930> really<00:02:38.260> build<00:02:38.560> around<00:02:38.770> given<00:02:39.490> that<00:02:40.000> turbo

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
can really build around given that turbo

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.830 
can really build around given that turbo
Blitzers<00:02:41.080> or<00:02:41.760> seemingly<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:43.030> abundance<00:02:43.600> this

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
using bump-and-run coverage if I can set

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.220 
using bump-and-run coverage if I can set
up<00:03:27.970> my<00:03:28.090> defense<00:03:28.510> correctly<00:03:29.080> here<00:03:32.250> there<00:03:33.250> we<00:03:33.460> go

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
up my defense correctly here there we go

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.950 
up my defense correctly here there we go
okay<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.290> now<00:03:35.620> we've<00:03:35.830> got<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.130> set<00:03:36.160> up<00:03:36.960> offense

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:37.960 
okay so now we've got it set up offense

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.650 
okay so now we've got it set up offense
looks<00:03:38.110> like<00:03:38.350> this<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:39.150> you<00:03:40.150> should<00:03:40.330> have<00:03:40.450> some

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
looks like this and you should have some

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.420 
looks like this and you should have some
good<00:03:40.810> crossing<00:03:41.320> patterns<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.800> will<00:03:42.160> allow

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
good crossing patterns that will allow

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.630 
good crossing patterns that will allow
you<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.640> be<00:03:42.880> me<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.360> coverage<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.460> there<00:03:45.460> with

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
you to be me and coverage so there with

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.120 
you to be me and coverage so there with
music<00:03:45.970> sup<00:03:46.150> the<00:03:46.300> turbo<00:03:46.600> blitz<00:03:46.840> and<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.920> heat

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
music sup the turbo blitz and the heat

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.740 
music sup the turbo blitz and the heat
just<00:03:51.370> does<00:03:51.610> not<00:03:51.790> come<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.270> same<00:03:52.450> and

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
just does not come in the same and

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.030 
just does not come in the same and
you're<00:03:52.840> able<00:03:53.080> to<00:03:53.140> make<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.470> throw<00:03:53.740> to<00:03:53.800> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
you're able to make this throw to the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.860 
you're able to make this throw to the
nice<00:03:54.220> little<00:03:54.520> angled<00:03:54.940> slant<00:03:55.270> route<00:03:55.510> /<00:03:55.750> in<00:03:55.810> the

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
nice little angled slant route / in the

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.180 
nice little angled slant route / in the
middle<00:03:56.140> so<00:03:57.070> I<00:03:57.780> know<00:03:58.780> it's<00:03:59.080> a<00:03:59.140> pain<00:03:59.170> but<00:04:00.010> it's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
middle so I know it's a pain but it's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.350 
middle so I know it's a pain but it's
better<00:04:00.370> than<00:04:00.550> the<00:04:00.610> heat<00:04:00.850> coming<00:04:01.060> straight

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
better than the heat coming straight

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.180 
better than the heat coming straight
through<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.690> middle<00:04:01.720> a<00:04:02.200> lot<00:04:02.710> of<00:04:02.740> people<00:04:02.830> been

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
through the middle a lot of people been

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.620 
through the middle a lot of people been
wondering<00:04:03.580> if<00:04:03.700> there's<00:04:03.910> a<00:04:03.970> counter<00:04:04.360> for<00:04:04.540> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
wondering if there's a counter for the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.420 
wondering if there's a counter for the
turbo<00:04:04.960> blitz<00:04:05.230> and<00:04:05.500> this<00:04:05.740> is<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.010> closest

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
turbo blitz and this is the closest

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.250 
turbo blitz and this is the closest
thing<00:04:06.640> that<00:04:06.700> there<00:04:07.270> really<00:04:07.450> is<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.720> a<00:04:07.960> true

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
thing that there really is to a true

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.930 
thing that there really is to a true
counter<00:04:08.710> at<00:04:08.860> least<00:04:09.100> until<00:04:09.340> there's<00:04:09.640> a<00:04:09.700> patch
