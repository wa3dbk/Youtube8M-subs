00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.390
 hit by a truck that 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.820
 mismanaged after going over a 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.640
 unmanned culverts the truck passed the

 tire through the hole lost control and was 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.980
 to top of us I saw it all in 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.649
 slow motion and I was sure it would 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.630
 die, said the artist who suffered only 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.360
 minor injuries 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:59.160
 Eduardo still complained about the lack of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.620
 care on the road 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 it's absurd to have a manhole open one 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.479
 via express citizenship our city 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.319
 deserves better roads and care 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.139
 larger 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:12.630
 besides low quality asphalt we are 

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:14.850
 treated with a poorly done job I 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.149
 I'm ashamed of this country and treat your 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.139
 people with abusive taxes and so 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:25.889
 neglect, the artist says rightly 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:28.139
 of the world because this is a big fright 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:30.270
 I think I'm a big fan of 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:34.159
 panic people in the band I had a 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.659
 scare this Thursday afternoon 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.960
 Thank God nothing happened. 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.689
 I'm an artist, I'm very fan of him. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.569
 very funny but fortunately not 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.310
 nothing worse has happened with an artist and 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:48.719
 nor with the businessman who was also 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.880
