00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello everyone today we will show you very much 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:14.280
 original recipe scrambled eggs to be not 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:21.830
 over original Yushchenko turns out yes 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:24.689
 just awesome japanese only prostrate and 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.119
 So it turns out that's it for 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.789
 to cook this cherry is necessary 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.350
 exactly bamboo sticks on let's say 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.640
 and chopsticks 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.850
 what else can any other 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.820
 wooden sticks no spoon no fork 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 nothing suits the most important thing 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 melt butter correctly butter not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.620
 should boil 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.050
 butter should melt arrange but 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.289
 should not boil therefore bring something 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.320
 the pan on the fire then clean up 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.980
 here is literally 2 seconds butter 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.980
 melted away 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:12.890
 and now we need this stump 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:17.930
 a little bit gone of course best 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.200
 cooking caissar oil is best 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.080
 will be if the oil will be homemade or 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.850
 very good non peasant that is 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.250
 which does not normally contain 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 butter is not peasant which 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:44.090
 does not contain rober will not hold moisture in 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:48.320
 imagine we all are now driving eggs 3 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:54.950
 it is enough so pans immediately 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:57.170
 we can salt it then there is all that 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.840
 anything but I do not now go and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.909
 now the most important thing now is to do it and 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.690
 juicy 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:08.360
 mix well with oil 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.390
 do it yourself or conveniently very 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.610
 conveniently exactly 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:19.190
 sticks's like whipped egg itself 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.670
 together with the oil, that is, the mixture turned out 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 the sea is not just an egg fried in butter 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:31.820
 namely this is such a mixture now we 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:33.290
 move the pan on the fire and here 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.140
 look here she stayed that way 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.150
 Uneven somewhere squirrels have somewhere 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.040
 yolk but all mixed with 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.329
 in pieces but from say so to say with 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.670
 dripping butter now the pan will be 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.680
 heat 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.680
 starts to thicken below 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:56.660
 the egg and we will start mixing it 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:02.239
 there is unusual that is not so that water 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:06.140
 put the frying pan and all 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:09.430
 below begins to thicken and here are 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.790
 that's how flakes form and here 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.430
 on how much you hold how are you 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:18.730
 will move let's say hand 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.159
 This mixture turns out let's say 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.680
 I will call and so different granularity or something 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:27.280
 itself yashenka here look formed 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.879
 These are the flakes you can call 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.090
 not fine-grained can do 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:36.519
 coarse that is such here 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.409
 warmed up the griddle and we we collect 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.389
 these flakes are easy 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:47.530
 who are soft gentle and we are all the time 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:49.859
 here we mix that is inside and how 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.609
 would be fluid 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.609
 such here 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:09.719
 green and flakes now we leave it 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:13.989
 to form a good bottom such 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:16.739
 brown crust yes here it will be necessary 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:20.320
 wrap unfortunately I do not know how to work 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.030
 chopsticks well japanese and chinese they just 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.639
 take and wrap me here 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.520
 also he decided I was unable to unfortunately 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.620
 I must learn to do so I will turn 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:40.360
 ordinary shovel favorite 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:45.669
 metal that's gone like a volcano cheek 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:49.050
 such and the top should be a little bit more 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.050
 be liquid 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:05:09.960
 let's wait a little more 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:09.960
 wait does not work 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:27.300
 the pan should already be changed of course already 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:34.080
 non - stick coating is not very good 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:36.270
 so a little bit of rivet idea well 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.340
 I hope it is clear that you look outside 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.680
 get more liquid to stand side 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.220
 she went a little warm from the bottom 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:47.150
 now we take and wrap her about like this 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.240
 Here we wrap it up like it was in chic and 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:53.940
 let them move and more towards the center 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.370
 pan and let it now here 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.110
 here here in these places secure now 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.150
 it will pass here later 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.900
 turn over fry on the other side and 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:06.810
 turn the outside but we have a 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.180
 tanned piece and inside it still 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:11.130
 very tasteless energy by forgot to say 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.090
 that you can still add all sorts of stuffing 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.160
 you can go there 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:15.900
 up inside before wrapping 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.610
 add some stuff 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:24.020
 but I love thats just now we are now 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.020
 let's take it upside down 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.810
 This side is already ready here. 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.600
 until it will reach 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:40.100
 all this is filmed in real time 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:50.669
 no acceleration so you can 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:55.610
 see how much we lay out our and shimko 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:58.530
 on the dish in 8 seconds will be all minutes 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.840
 new it turned out yes that is to cook 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:05.820
 This delicious egg takes us 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:09.630
 just until the end of 7 minutes and all seven minutes 

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:12.660
 what else do I advise the bar the bar 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:18.289
 spread butter on delicious homemade 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:18.289
 oiled and all listen to health
