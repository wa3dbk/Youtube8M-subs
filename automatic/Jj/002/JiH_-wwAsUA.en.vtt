the<00:02:26.489> only<00:02:26.519> down<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.709> of<00:02:28.920> right<00:02:28.950> now

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
the only down I can think of right now

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.069 
the only down I can think of right now
is<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.769> he<00:02:32.640> does<00:02:32.819> not<00:02:33.090> they<00:02:33.569> don't<00:02:33.750> have

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
is that it he does not they don't have

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.069 
is that it he does not they don't have
the<00:02:34.409> at<00:02:34.620> Kylie<00:02:35.519> a<00:02:35.640> grunt<00:02:36.030> work<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.959> move

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
the at Kylie a grunt work you can move

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.949 
the at Kylie a grunt work you can move
the<00:02:37.200> upper<00:02:37.500> body<00:02:37.709> but<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.459> in<00:02:39.180> my<00:02:39.390> opinion<00:02:39.690> it

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the upper body but I in my opinion it

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.130 
the upper body but I in my opinion it
makes<00:02:40.140> it<00:02:40.319> look<00:02:40.409> so<00:02:40.470> much<00:02:41.190> better<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.180> it's<00:02:42.750> a

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
makes it look so much better and it's a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.589 
makes it look so much better and it's a
lot<00:02:43.560> cooler<00:02:43.799> to<00:02:44.069> me<00:02:44.329> so<00:02:45.329> that's<00:02:46.290> pretty<00:02:46.530> cool

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
lot cooler to me so that's pretty cool

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:52.069 
lot cooler to me so that's pretty cool
just<00:02:48.599> rubber<00:02:48.870> unruh<00:02:49.440> banded<00:02:50.099> that<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.120> they

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
just rubber unruh banded that so they

00:02:52.079 --> 00:03:03.740 
just rubber unruh banded that so they
said<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.500> take<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:52.829> off

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750

it<00:04:03.099> like<00:04:03.640> all<00:04:03.819> the<00:04:03.970> clone<00:04:04.390> pilots<00:04:04.870> has<00:04:05.079> a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
it like all the clone pilots has a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.160 
it like all the clone pilots has a
little<00:04:05.470> overlapping<00:04:05.950> things<00:04:06.760> it's<00:04:07.299> like<00:04:07.569> as

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
little overlapping things it's like as

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.910 
little overlapping things it's like as
far<00:04:09.069> as<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.340> helmet<00:04:09.790> goes<00:04:09.970> I'd<00:04:10.329> say<00:04:10.930> it's<00:04:10.959> a

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.620 

almost<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.069> repaint<00:04:15.489> of<00:04:15.609> matchsticks<00:04:16.209> helmet

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
almost a repaint of matchsticks helmet

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.599 
almost a repaint of matchsticks helmet
actually<00:04:17.560> I<00:04:17.620> take<00:04:17.769> that<00:04:17.829> back<00:04:17.979> because<00:04:18.160> you

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
actually I take that back because you

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.590 
actually I take that back because you
could<00:04:18.760> take<00:04:18.910> that<00:04:19.090> one<00:04:19.239> off<00:04:19.560> but<00:04:20.609> so<00:04:21.609> I<00:04:21.940> guess

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
could take that one off but so I guess

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.290 
could take that one off but so I guess
it's<00:04:22.630> a<00:04:22.870> pretty<00:04:23.050> new<00:04:23.229> scope<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:25.030> it's<00:04:25.210> a

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
it's a pretty new scope and it's a

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.440 
it's a pretty new scope and it's a
really<00:04:25.600> cool<00:04:25.870> figure<00:04:26.289> like<00:04:27.250> I<00:04:27.400> said<00:04:27.639> the<00:04:27.850> DC<00:04:28.240> I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
really cool figure like I said the DC I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.930 
really cool figure like I said the DC I
mean<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.110> Gatling<00:04:29.860> gun<00:04:30.039> foots<00:04:30.370> in<00:04:30.460> his<00:04:30.550> hands

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.090 
mean the Gatling gun foots in his hands
real<00:04:31.180> well<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.539> got<00:04:31.690> to<00:04:31.780> solve<00:04:31.960> that<00:04:32.139> and<00:04:32.410> it

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
real well you got to solve that and it

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.060 
real well you got to solve that and it
fired<00:04:33.340> a<00:04:33.460> missile<00:04:33.580> and<00:04:34.210> his<00:04:34.510> blaster<00:04:34.990> gun<00:04:35.070> puts

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
fired a missile and his blaster gun puts

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.120 
fired a missile and his blaster gun puts
in<00:04:36.190> his<00:04:36.280> hand<00:04:36.960> probably<00:04:37.960> yeah<00:04:38.200> like<00:04:38.740> every
