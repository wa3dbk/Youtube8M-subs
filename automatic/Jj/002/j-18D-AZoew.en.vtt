board sides first I learned switch board
slides<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.960> regular<00:00:38.350> that<00:00:38.830> helped<00:00:39.070> me<00:00:39.160> learn

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
slides to regular that helped me learn

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.490 
slides to regular that helped me learn
switch<00:00:39.790> people<00:00:40.000> grind<00:00:40.269> irregular<00:00:40.900> that's<00:00:41.410> a

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:41.500 
switch people grind irregular that's a

switch people grind irregular that's a
lot<00:00:41.650> easier<00:00:42.010> because<00:00:42.190> it's<00:00:43.150> just

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
lot easier because it's just

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:44.700 
lot easier because it's just
automatically<00:00:43.870> gonna<00:00:44.080> kind<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.350> like<00:00:44.470> switch

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
automatically gonna kind of like switch

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.000 
automatically gonna kind of like switch
front<00:00:44.980> 180<00:00:45.129> and<00:00:45.809> put<00:00:46.809> you<00:00:46.960> out<00:00:46.989> going<00:00:47.470> regular
