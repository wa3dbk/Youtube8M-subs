00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.280

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.410
 constructors and the first will be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.410
 review attacked running from the company Lego 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.410
 drove 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:39.720
 and in my hands field ebb in 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.460
 which will be necessary parts for 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.280
 buildings and 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.770
 instruction in the form of a booklet but let's obo 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.020
 all in order from the front on the packaging and 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.309
 Naturally there is the logo of the company Lego 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.890
 star wars logo a little further 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.739
 worn and blurred attack aircraft helmet 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.629
 which is present on all sets 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.540
 2015 dedicated to such a universe 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.240
 like star wars in the center and naturally 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.870
 shows all-terrain and defensive 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 empire platform abbreviated bob next to 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:18.000
 him age restrictions from 6 to 12 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.549
 article 30 274 and names go d.p. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.310
 well and in the bottom corner is the disney logo and 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.750
 the name of the new cartoon series star 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.150
 wars insurgents 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.250
 inside as i said will be 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.520
 instruction which is made as 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.070
 booklet and this is the usual format of the scheme 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.190
 assembly for poly bugs instructions in the form of 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.230
 books in the field and I do not put 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.660
 Naturally in the bag you will find the details 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.540
 of which build such a walker 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.140
 empire and after all construction work 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.550
 you still have three details 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.760
 mini model these d.p. 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.220
 outwardly only remotely looks like his 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.400
 real prototype and on the shelf with others 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.740
 mini models 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.770
 It will probably look very even 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.530
 not bad but nothing more, I generally think 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.619
 that such things are strictly on lovers 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.070
 star wars and they are unlikely to please others 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.750
 lego fans yes it seems to me even 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.820
 Star Wars fans won't be in 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.040
 delighted with this all-terrain 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.500
 defensive platform now 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.380
 I will try to explain why the first and 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.720
 the main disappointment is a moving sheaf 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.480
 she is absolutely useless 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.670
 but it is only in a certain 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.610
 leg position and all the rest 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.950
 possible articulation points to nothing 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.080
 intelligibly mu do not lead here 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.600
 please take some photos of examples 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.600
 was capable of these deaths 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.880
 so play with this model is not 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.930
 succeeds here and it turns out that except 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.900
 similarity 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.960
 it is doubtful before moving said 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.270
 guns this model could have nothing 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.910
 at least some figure cram 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.550
 for example the pilot of this walker 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.790
 I think then you would not be polyps 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.490
 worthless new in general most likely 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.160
 This unit will go to the details for 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.470
 no aesthetic value given 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.020
 model for me do not represent and this 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.690
 this year's first polybag which me 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.240
 disappointed but she is this slightly sad 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.850
 note let's finish thank you 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.370

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.830
