00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 and then doing another personal beauty 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.269
 video of the aquarium pump hb or gabriel 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.849
 300 and I discovered something that still 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 I did not know, I bought this little bomb. 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.880
 Little bomb now to make a 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.070
 project 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.080
 You have already seen the previous videos in 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.090
 two videos the pump model 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.890
 I bought this pump to make a 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.630
 little project and it did not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.149
 What happened was to search and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.070
 discover an interesting thing that is is 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.290
 when you go shopping pump there has 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.469
 quantity of liters per hour it 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.350
 moves and has the quantity and has the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.750
 height of the water column that she 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.660
 then movement also imagined 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.360
 this column of water that she moved 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.329
 was that when you put a bomb in the 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 water without hoses on nothing she played 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 this column of water at a certain height 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.650
 but it 's not that bomb in the advertisement she she 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.600
 shows that she has to play a column 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.180
 water of 50 centimeters 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.689
 if I'm not mistaken I think that's it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.759
 even 50 centimeters and I tested here in 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 house was not just the bombinha she did not play 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.180
 at that time I researched with the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.450
 salesman 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.080
 he explained that she plays that height is 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.030
 with the hose not already engaged the pump 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 so make this video just for 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 clarify and show you how it is 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.439
 operation have here the hose 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.920
 coupled in the butt is rising here in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.810
 And I'm going to call you and see how 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.590
 It works here. The bomb already looks there. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.149
 rose water until the ball lies until 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.250
 making noise because she is already 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.729
 trying hard to throw water to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.729
 me so much 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:07.030
 You heard me there but she's doing it. 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:09.400
 the course of the water here up to here I 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.030
 I'm with a ruler that 50 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.030
 centimeters 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.790
 feel with the 50-cm ruler and I 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.900
 I'll put the rule there at the base of the bomb 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.220
 at the base of the pump 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:32.070
 now I'm going to pull here is difficult with a 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.070
 Hand only, I pulled it here. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.870
 this 57 year rule here came to 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.900
 end of the ruler 50 centimeters 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:50.170
 water is passing from this she is coming 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:52.180
 O here so she will not only understood to 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.990
 50 centimeters in fact it spends more 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.170
 or about 15 centimeters more or 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.170
 any less 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:06.550
 looks already marked almost at the end of 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.959
 the top of the screen where my 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.520
 final ruler hand 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.800
 So this is it for doubts if 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.980
 someone has a doubt about that then 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:22.050
 this column of water is with the hose is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:25.050
 the pump is connected to the pump 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.050
 thank you
