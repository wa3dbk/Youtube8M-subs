 very simple method nothing but that if 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.100
 we need help from a friend of a 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.650

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:23.580
 very simple and I hope you like it 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.740
 to take advantage of it before the 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.720
 rockstar points the patches 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.120

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.680
 doing these the bastards and a 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.160
 constitution I forgot if someone was 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.260
 Question 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.150
 because because that's a woman because I have 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.220
 a woman's character because if it is 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.930
 very easy on the other character 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.310
 I have the three garages full with cars 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.070
 personal not that I like me 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.900
 so then what I did and I hope 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.240
 that some of you do is not 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.660

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:57.080

00:02:53.660 --> 00:03:00.320

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.180
 that the dough is dedicated doubles and not 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.940
 they do not have to be selling their 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.560
 cars or losing those or having to be 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.480
 passing cars from here to there to 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.780

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.970

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.850
