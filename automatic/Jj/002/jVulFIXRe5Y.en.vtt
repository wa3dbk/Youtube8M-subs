00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.760
 we are here with one more problem 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.260
 phenomenon ufo by the much larger tv today 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 keeping the joy of telling you again 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.520
 with a friend edson 90 lasts 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 we will continue the interview of the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.369
 last week 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.830
 There's a lot more stuff for us. 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.290
 Let's talk Edson sure goes. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 coming back next year is because the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.030
 then we can continue in this area 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.570
 fascinating that the research was the logical 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 involving military is edson week 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.149
 Last we are not talking and and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.649
 we will go into certain details of the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.570
 operation for me to ask you to 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.880
 to ensure that there would be no 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.820
 comment I think it's very important 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.649
 So that we are just one pass to not 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.589
 we will have to enter a larger 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:07.020
 operation depth for chilling 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.899
 presence in the region 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.190
 curiously agents of the extinct inss 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.720
 were also present along with the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.759
 aeronautics team 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.649
 we have a team from the globe that was 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.810
 behind the phenomenon ended up having some 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.420
 Problems a reporter ended up having 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.750
 a personal nervous crisis swore standing 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.340
 together no more and behind no, because much 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.990
 People think this is a joke and the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.830
 It's no joke, it's a big deal. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.240
 very serious 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.789
 the dish operation what else we 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.220
 we can address is the whole operation 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.520
 What are you doing recently? 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.490
 yes it's several several hundred sheets of 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.310
 documentation sheets were released 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.259
 by the Brazilian government in the case of force 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.020
 Brazilian air traffic but it is still 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.849
 a lot is missing some photos 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.130
 is missing videos in the sound videos and a 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:02.789
 landmark in edilson is a thing a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.470
 addendum 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.840
 A lot of people think that the dish operation 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.810
 ended in the 70's this actually 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:14.280
 not yet extended by a few 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.140
 years it's officially when it started 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.000
 the operation plate and when it is 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.579
 ended up being insecure ex 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.819
 then it would have started in September 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:27.599
 77 closed in December 1977 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:31.709
 only that we have reports from 78 of 80 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:33.030
 and 81 of 82 for example is in the program 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:38.400
 previous to the people already spoken of 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:41.250
 document of 82 which is dated from the day 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.799
 20 October 82 October 26 82 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.730
 account two cases one happened in 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.530
 Manacapuru 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
 there in the Amazon region and another 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.810
 neighborhood of manaus called japim 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.090
 interesting from the document in a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.030
 certain part he speaks thus in the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.069
 port of manacapuru quoted above in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.790
 company of three civilians and an agent 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.829
 US military john we observed 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.439
 in two moments of what follows he counts 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.989
 that the luminous triangular object that was 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.260
 seen another mass another body 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.599
 bright with intense brightness 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.549
 that focused the water of the river by 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.310
 twice and disappeared on high 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.980
 speed, or what proves this 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.959
 document that the operation plate had a 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.430
 second moment after iran has left 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:30.930
 and that US military personnel 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.750
 possibly been involved in this 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.840
 research is a question that I can not 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.810
 stop making edson iran g left 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.799
 operation or take the brightness of the operation 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.139
 in your opinion 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.720
 took him out of the operation because when 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.970
 he started to have the most 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.090
 coming with the phenomenon even arrived 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:55.859
 until he saw beings and he came very 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.259
 I'm very excited about the contact I 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.129
 he had had with the crew of the 

00:03:58.259 --> 00:04:04.109
 objects 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:05.759
 then his superior did not speak 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.590
 nothing on that day that he told 

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:08.909
 The next day he said great and brings 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.489
 material that you have delivered 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.219
 Brigadier Protásio the case that the 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.709
 the Provisional Tribunal and closed 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:20.400
 theoretically, they did not 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:23.400
 the gospel was very frustrated but 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:26.130
 how good was he? 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.400
 obedient to the standards so he complied 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.740
 It's just that what few people know is 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.460
 that he continued to research on account 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.510
 own 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.250
 The phenomenon is so much so that John Flavio 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.460
 was the sergeant who did most of the 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:44.400
 movies of the photographs is it continues 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:47.130
 generating reports and reports 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.320
 they went to the house of Raphael without 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:52.949
 a researcher has died 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.349
 I was at his house in 2002 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.919
 before going to do some research on the 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:00.779
 and he pointed me to a 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.969
 another military man who participated who was a 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.919
 contact from there in maranhão in são luís do 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.800
 who provided me with these 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:10.380
 documents and 82 which prove that the 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.969
 operation num num is over and a 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:19.320
 also interesting that I wanted to 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:21.389
 show here is that it is in 1999 until 2004 that I 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.400
 I visited the comdabra several times. 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:26.150
 and there I had contact with some 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.010
 the military and they 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:32.159
 reports and some photographs of these 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:34.380
 little ones that are pictures taken in the 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:37.800
 time of the practical operation and has 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.729
 other people's photos, too. 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.150
 season were attacked were marked with 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:47.490
 of burns on their bodies and the 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:53.070
 interesting of all this is also that the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:57.300
 phenomenon did not stop in 1994 in the 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:06:00.150
 good view of the branches the police are military 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:04.199
 beyond the region is collected a case of a 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:08.099
 young girl of 22 years old that she was 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.570
 attacked and even on the webos 

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:11.669
 occurrence of the military police 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.789
 he cites that what caused the burns 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:17.039
 and bruises were lights from the 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:20.430
 unidentified flying object and I know 

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:23.279
 I have if this report passed passed 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:25.259
 passed step I'm with him us here 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.779
 can show afterwards certainly not 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.490
 Because I'm talking to Serginho da 

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:32.610
 Military police here in São Paulo 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.310
 he was on the alert that in the 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.219
 fernão days for guarulhos and a ship 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.029
 flew over the car with him a soldier 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.890
 new and lives on the day until the boy was 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:45.570
 boldly he opened the glass of the car and 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.680
 Looked up and talk I do not see killed 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.880
 blind 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.380
 the light is so intense that it failed 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.440
 and the object ended up in the 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.320
 direction is cumbica 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.240
 then the vehicle that would replace them was 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.010
 very funny that the two pms also 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.320
 they quoted saying you do not have 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.510
 idea of what we saw a paper object 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.740
 village and you and if we did not speak 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:08.080
 so we saw that he was standing at 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.840
 the top of our car and even 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:13.930
 to run high but what I find curious is 

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:17.400
 the next when he arrived at the post 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:21.790
 officer he spoke to make a report 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:23.230
 the shift officer the file succeeded 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.540
 get into the next phase, let it go 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.100
 I believe in your word, I know that 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.450
 Are not you kidding what things are? 

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.540
 always was but do not make a report and me 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:34.210
 Give your head no headache, contact 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.490
 so great is that we see that I 

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.470
 I asked because many did not 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:42.670
 want to know this can compromise the 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.350
 name can hinder the career is not it 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.140
 part of a series later better then 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.130
 You know, I think I 'm everything. 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.600
 Nevermind 

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.700
 interesting that you're talking about this 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.730
 military police involved in this 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.610
 she has researched been involved in 

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:59.380
 several classic cases up to Brazilian I 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.050
 I'll just ask it is also clear that we 

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.200
 let us not forget the range of 94 

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:07.060
 then in 94 the case of pedro toledo pedro 

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.230
 toledo then let's go to our first 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.230
 range have already returned
