00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:18.349 
other side as house we film this at the

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.540 
other side as house we film this at the
beginning<00:06:18.590> here<00:06:18.860> we<00:06:18.889> didn't<00:06:19.129> know<00:06:19.250> where<00:06:19.370> he

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:19.550 
beginning here we didn't know where he

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:26.320 
beginning here we didn't know where he
was<00:06:21.580> so<00:06:22.580> there's<00:06:22.789> either<00:06:24.370> four<00:06:25.370> or<00:06:25.400> five<00:06:25.610> I

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
was so there's either four or five I

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.089 
was so there's either four or five I
think<00:06:26.539> there<00:06:26.779> was<00:06:26.870> just<00:06:26.900> five<00:06:27.349> this<00:06:27.590> time

00:06:28.089 --> 00:06:28.099 
think there was just five this time

00:06:28.099 --> 00:06:31.440 
think there was just five this time
or<00:06:28.699> four

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:31.450 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.220 

actually<00:06:32.450> you<00:06:32.510> know<00:06:32.570> there<00:06:32.720> was<00:06:32.840> five<00:06:33.050> yeah

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:33.230 
actually you know there was five yeah

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.660 
actually you know there was five yeah
there's<00:06:33.440> that<00:06:33.530> that<00:06:33.950> usually<00:06:34.280> there's<00:06:34.430> four

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
there's that that usually there's four

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.700 
there's that that usually there's four
though<00:06:34.850> I<00:06:34.880> think<00:06:35.050> that<00:06:36.050> guy<00:06:36.200> was<00:06:36.290> just<00:06:36.350> a<00:06:36.530> fluke

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
though I think that guy was just a fluke

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.140 
though I think that guy was just a fluke
sometimes<00:06:37.130> it's<00:06:37.310> a<00:06:37.370> little<00:06:37.550> random<00:06:37.850> like<00:06:38.000> that

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 
sometimes it's a little random like that

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:39.400 
sometimes it's a little random like that
