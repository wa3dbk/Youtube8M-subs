 Brazilian transit 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:05.930

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.660

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.219
 the measure had nowhere to go for more information call 1 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:02.940
 there are two sectors interconnected in the equipment 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.159
 one after the retention range 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.380

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.340
 yellow sign 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.010
 and attention 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.290
 3 to 0 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.490
 to streamline 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.490
