00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.800 
did it all using my brand new VI
controller<00:01:55.450> from<00:01:55.630> alesis<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.230> the<00:01:56.290> IO<00:01:56.410> dock<00:01:56.680> -

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
controller from alesis in the IO dock -

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.550 
controller from alesis in the IO dock -
now<00:01:58.810> we're<00:01:58.960> going<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.140> do<00:01:59.230> is<00:01:59.320> we're<00:01:59.410> going<00:01:59.500> to

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
now we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.740 
now we're going to do is we're going to
use<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.890> hardware<00:02:00.400> to<00:02:00.790> actually<00:02:01.270> control

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
use the hardware to actually control

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.170 
use the hardware to actually control
some<00:02:01.990> parameters<00:02:02.410> inside<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.250> iPad<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:03.880> you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
some parameters inside the iPad so you

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.510 
some parameters inside the iPad so you
can<00:02:04.450> hear<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.720> my<00:02:04.840> note<00:02:05.050> here<00:02:05.520> pretty

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
can hear I have my note here pretty

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
can hear I have my note here pretty

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.420 

I<00:02:11.629> hear<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> note<00:02:12.709> come<00:02:12.980> through<00:02:13.159> a<00:02:13.189> little<00:02:13.340> bit

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.270 
better
changed<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:16.410> parameters

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.150 

add<00:02:19.700> some<00:02:20.000> noise<00:02:20.150> in<00:02:20.450> there

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.100
