piggies of the bunch that is most of the
food<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:33.000> still<00:00:33.180> got<00:00:33.300> some<00:00:33.480> real<00:00:33.690> small<00:00:33.960> ones

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
nine months when these guys become plate

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.670 
nine months when these guys become plate
size<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.540> start<00:00:39.780> harvesting<00:00:39.989> some<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.559> the

size and we start harvesting some of the
fish<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.120> little<00:00:42.390> guys<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.860> have

haven't received as much food as the big

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.420 
haven't received as much food as the big
guys<00:00:48.360> will<00:00:48.600> start<00:00:48.809> getting<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.410> food<00:00:50.219> and

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
guys will start getting more food and

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.689 
guys will start getting more food and
will<00:00:50.550> grow<00:00:50.760> very<00:00:51.059> fast<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.309> these<00:00:53.309> guys<00:00:53.489> are

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
will grow very fast so these guys are

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.029 
will grow very fast so these guys are
doing<00:00:53.879> really<00:00:54.059> really<00:00:54.180> nice<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:55.440> very<00:00:55.530> happy

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
doing really really nice very very happy

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
doing really really nice very very happy
they're<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.489> healthy<00:00:56.820> haven't<00:00:57.239> had<00:00:57.329> any

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
they're very healthy haven't had any

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.560 
they're very healthy haven't had any
fish<00:00:57.870> deaths<00:00:58.460> I've<00:00:59.460> heard<00:00:59.789> that<00:01:00.000> until<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
fish deaths I've heard that until you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.650 
fish deaths I've heard that until you
kill<00:01:00.870> 200<00:01:01.500> fish<00:01:01.680> in<00:01:01.829> aquaponics<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:03.390> are<00:01:03.510> not

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
kill 200 fish in aquaponics you are not

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.260 
kill 200 fish in aquaponics you are not
an<00:01:03.780> expert<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:05.250> clearly<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.880> an<00:01:05.970> expert

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
an expert so I'm clearly not an expert

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.670 
an expert so I'm clearly not an expert
because<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.600> not<00:01:06.750> had<00:01:06.900> any<00:01:07.140> fish<00:01:07.409> deaths

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
because I have not had any fish deaths

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.350 
because I have not had any fish deaths
hopefully<00:01:08.460> I'm<00:01:08.580> learning<00:01:08.939> from<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> wisdom

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
hopefully I'm learning from the wisdom

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.950 
hopefully I'm learning from the wisdom
from<00:01:09.659> others<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.280> we're<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.960> great

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
from others and we're going to do great

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.380 
from others and we're going to do great
so<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.830> guys<00:01:14.040> will<00:01:14.400> eventually<00:01:15.000> be<00:01:15.119> very

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
so these guys will eventually be very

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
so these guys will eventually be very
very<00:01:15.630> big<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.380> may<00:01:16.530> have<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.770> get<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> second

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
very big and I may have to get a second

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
very big and I may have to get a second
fish<00:01:17.520> tank<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.600> well<00:01:18.960> probably<00:01:19.229> what

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
fish tank which is well probably what

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.440 
fish tank which is well probably what
I'll<00:01:19.500> start<00:01:19.710> using<00:01:19.830> my<00:01:20.040> sump<00:01:20.280> tank<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.729> as<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I'll start using my sump tank for as a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.380 
I'll start using my sump tank for as a
second<00:01:21.930> fish<00:01:22.049> tank<00:01:22.290> let's<00:01:22.799> start<00:01:23.009> over<00:01:23.100> here

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
second fish tank let's start over here

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.520 
second fish tank let's start over here
actually<00:01:24.390> today<00:01:24.570> rained<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.930> little<00:01:25.020> bit<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.409> is

actually today rained a little bit it is
a<00:01:25.560> tad<00:01:25.799> cloudy<00:01:26.130> out<00:01:27.560> as<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:29.040> here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a tad cloudy out as you can see here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.609 
a tad cloudy out as you can see here
these<00:01:29.400> are<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> broccoli<00:01:30.030> plants<00:01:30.390> and

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
these are the broccoli plants and

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.499 
these are the broccoli plants and
they're<00:01:31.619> really<00:01:32.159> coming<00:01:32.400> along<00:01:32.700> now<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.240> very

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
they're really coming along now I'm very

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.999 
they're really coming along now I'm very
happy<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> growth<00:01:34.350> they're<00:01:34.680> really

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
happy with the growth they're really

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.460 
happy with the growth they're really
starting<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.310> grow<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.610> fast<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.350> which<00:01:37.350> is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
starting to grow very fast and which is

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.810 
starting to grow very fast and which is
a<00:01:37.500> good<00:01:37.740> sign<00:01:37.979> meaning<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> we<00:01:38.700> will

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
a good sign meaning that we will

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.420 
a good sign meaning that we will
probably<00:01:39.030> start<00:01:39.270> seeing<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:40.430> broccoli

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
probably start seeing some broccoli

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.980 
probably start seeing some broccoli

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
maybe two weeks these are the cucumber

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
maybe two weeks these are the cucumber
plants<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> planted<00:01:47.549> from<00:01:47.820> seedlings

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
plants that I planted from seedlings

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
green bell pepper to see what we could

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.350 
green bell pepper to see what we could
do<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.570> we<00:02:06.719> see<00:02:06.960> some<00:02:07.229> some<00:02:07.950> lettuce

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and we have harvested some of it already

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.070

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
actually looking for some more recipes

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.370 
actually looking for some more recipes
right<00:02:23.670> now<00:02:23.880> where<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.780> really<00:02:24.959> use<00:02:25.080> some

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
right now where we can really use some

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.860 
right now where we can really use some
basil<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:26.190> um<00:02:26.459> it's<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.030> doing<00:02:27.390> great

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
basil because um it's just doing great

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.920 
basil because um it's just doing great
as<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:29.010> can<00:02:29.190> see<00:02:29.370> here<00:02:29.790> actually<00:02:30.330> right<00:02:30.600> here

as you can see here actually right here

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.570 
as you can see here actually right here
if<00:02:31.050> you<00:02:31.140> can<00:02:31.319> peek<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:31.800> in<00:02:31.920> here<00:02:32.310> where<00:02:32.459> I'm

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
if you can peek right in here where I'm

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.080 
if you can peek right in here where I'm
pointing

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
pointing

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.240 
pointing
that's<00:02:33.420> actually<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> development<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
that's actually the development of a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.170 
that's actually the development of a
corn<00:02:35.580> stalk<00:02:36.530> actually<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> I<00:02:38.400> don't<00:02:38.940> think<00:02:39.090> it's

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
corn stalk actually a I don't think it's

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.570 
corn stalk actually a I don't think it's
the<00:02:39.270> stock<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.930> know-how<00:02:40.770> what<00:02:41.430> they

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
the stock it's the know-how what they

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.240 
the stock it's the know-how what they
call<00:02:41.819> the<00:02:42.120> husk<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.780> guess<00:02:43.260> yeah<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.709> corn<00:02:43.980> husk

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
call the husk I guess yeah the corn husk

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.020 
call the husk I guess yeah the corn husk
so<00:02:45.170> actually<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> lot<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.650> these<00:02:46.769> corn<00:02:47.130> stocks

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
so actually a lot of these corn stocks

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.930 
so actually a lot of these corn stocks
have<00:02:48.690> husks<00:02:49.380> being<00:02:50.130> developed<00:02:50.580> right<00:02:50.760> now

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
have husks being developed right now

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.270 
have husks being developed right now
they're<00:02:51.930> getting<00:02:52.080> wider<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.800> bottoms

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
they're getting wider on the bottoms

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.160 
they're getting wider on the bottoms
like<00:02:54.000> down<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.239> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.690> see<00:02:54.840> it's<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.080> little

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
like down here you can see it's a little

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.340 
like down here you can see it's a little
bit<00:02:55.290> wider<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.720> what<00:02:57.720> happened<00:02:58.050> let's<00:02:58.200> see<00:02:58.260> if

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
bit wider and what happened let's see if

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.580 
bit wider and what happened let's see if
I<00:02:58.380> can<00:02:58.500> find<00:02:58.680> another<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.160> here<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:01.470> on

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
here that that's actually a corn being

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.900 
here that that's actually a corn being
developed<00:03:07.560> I'll<00:03:08.069> try<00:03:08.190> to<00:03:08.280> get<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> better<00:03:08.610> shot

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
developed I'll try to get a better shot

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.420 
developed I'll try to get a better shot
on<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.120> other<00:03:09.150> side<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:10.470> tomato<00:03:10.830> plant<00:03:11.100> here

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
on the other side the tomato plant here

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.180 
on the other side the tomato plant here
this<00:03:11.760> one<00:03:11.940> is<00:03:12.269> doing<00:03:12.870> good<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.560> plant<00:03:13.860> itself

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
this one is doing good the plant itself

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.000

they<00:03:45.780> were<00:03:45.959> going<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.530> seed<00:03:46.799> so<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.519> wasn't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
they were going to seed so it wasn't

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460 
they were going to seed so it wasn't
really<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.329> plant<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.810> could<00:03:49.019> harvest<00:03:49.230> a

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
really a plant that I could harvest a

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.170 
really a plant that I could harvest a
lot<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.709> stevia<00:03:50.070> from<00:03:50.370> I<00:03:50.579> was<00:03:50.760> going<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.970> juice

problem<00:04:32.520> that<00:04:32.819> I<00:04:32.849> had<00:04:33.030> to<00:04:33.120> really<00:04:33.300> battle<00:04:33.720> the

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
problem that I had to really battle the

answer for bringing in Athens they farm

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.770 
answer for bringing in Athens they farm
Athens<00:04:37.919> into<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.280> plants<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:38.940> they

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
Athens into the plants and they

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.719 
Athens into the plants and they
basically<00:04:40.020> it's<00:04:40.949> kind<00:04:41.160> of<00:04:41.190> gross<00:04:41.400> but<00:04:41.430> they

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
basically it's kind of gross but they

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.809 
basically it's kind of gross but they
basically<00:04:42.000> eat<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:43.139> waste<00:04:43.410> that<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.400> aphids

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
basically eat the waste that the aphids

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:46.939 
basically eat the waste that the aphids
leave<00:04:45.030> behind<00:04:45.410> actually<00:04:46.410> you<00:04:46.500> see<00:04:46.680> right<00:04:46.860> it

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
leave behind actually you see right it

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.640 
leave behind actually you see right it
is<00:04:47.069> a<00:04:47.099> little<00:04:47.310> bee<00:04:47.750> that's<00:04:48.750> all<00:04:48.990> pollinating

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
is a little bee that's all pollinating

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.659 
is a little bee that's all pollinating
which<00:04:49.830> is<00:04:49.949> a<00:04:49.979> good<00:04:50.190> thing<00:04:50.870> yes<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.289> ants

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
which is a good thing yes of the ants

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.790 
which is a good thing yes of the ants
farm<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.819> aphids<00:04:54.120> up<00:04:54.300> for<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:55.349> sole<00:04:55.560> purpose

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
farm the aphids up for the sole purpose

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.290

of<00:04:56.039> eating<00:04:56.430> the<00:04:56.580> waste<00:04:56.789> that<00:04:57.000> they<00:04:57.120> leave

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
of eating the waste that they leave

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.240 
of eating the waste that they leave
behind<00:04:57.479> so<00:04:58.319> I<00:04:58.349> had<00:04:58.560> to<00:04:58.650> do<00:04:58.770> at<00:04:58.889> the<00:04:58.949> ant<00:04:59.099> problem

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
behind so I had to do at the ant problem

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.210 
behind so I had to do at the ant problem
it<00:04:59.460> took<00:04:59.550> me<00:04:59.669> about<00:04:59.789> a<00:04:59.849> week<00:04:59.909> we<00:05:00.300> were<00:05:00.449> spraying

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
I started spraying with a worm tea which

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.570 
I started spraying with a worm tea which
is<00:05:12.990> basically<00:05:13.289> worm<00:05:13.590> castings<00:05:14.159> soaked<00:05:14.430> in

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
is basically worm castings soaked in

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.649 
is basically worm castings soaked in
water<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.229> then<00:05:16.229> I<00:05:16.560> eventually<00:05:16.889> I<00:05:17.370> was<00:05:18.300> making

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:18.659 
water and then I eventually I was making

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:19.909 
water and then I eventually I was making
some<00:05:18.870> ground<00:05:19.110> but<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:19.319> wasn't<00:05:19.560> fast<00:05:19.710> enough

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
some ground but it wasn't fast enough

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.800 
some ground but it wasn't fast enough
and<00:05:20.340> they<00:05:20.490> were<00:05:20.550> destroying<00:05:21.090> my<00:05:21.300> some<00:05:21.599> of<00:05:21.630> my

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
and they were destroying my some of my

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
I had a shade cloth on here for a couple

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.780 
I had a shade cloth on here for a couple
weeks<00:07:29.900> but<00:07:30.110> took<00:07:30.380> it<00:07:30.470> down<00:07:30.650> because<00:07:30.830> the

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
weeks but took it down because the

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.120 
weeks but took it down because the
plants<00:07:32.120> needed<00:07:32.330> some<00:07:32.540> more<00:07:32.660> Sun<00:07:32.930> but<00:07:33.890> I<00:07:33.950> got<00:07:34.100> a

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.130 
plants needed some more Sun but I got a

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.430 
plants needed some more Sun but I got a
chicken<00:07:34.460> wire<00:07:34.610> at<00:07:34.760> the<00:07:34.820> top<00:07:34.880> we<00:07:35.870> have<00:07:35.900> strings

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 
chicken wire at the top we have strings

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.510 
chicken wire at the top we have strings
ran<00:07:37.510> connected<00:07:38.510> to<00:07:39.170> all<00:07:39.290> the<00:07:39.440> plants<00:07:39.710> tied<00:07:40.340> on

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:40.520 
ran connected to all the plants tied on

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.480 
ran connected to all the plants tied on
to<00:07:40.670> the<00:07:40.790> chicken<00:07:40.940> wire<00:07:41.240> and<00:07:41.830> for<00:07:42.830> the<00:07:42.980> self

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.490 
to the chicken wire and for the self

to the chicken wire and for the self
pollinated<00:07:43.940> plants<00:07:43.970> like<00:07:44.330> tomatoes<00:07:44.360> I<00:07:44.840> tapped

the<00:07:45.260> PVC<00:07:45.710> pipe<00:07:45.950> which<00:07:46.790> causes<00:07:47.210> vibrations

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 
the PVC pipe which causes vibrations

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.120 
the PVC pipe which causes vibrations
which<00:07:48.050> helps<00:07:48.380> it's<00:07:48.680> a<00:07:48.950> self<00:07:49.190> pollinate<00:07:49.660> so

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.130 
which helps it's a self pollinate so

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:53.470 
which helps it's a self pollinate so
this<00:07:52.130> is<00:07:52.310> Mike<00:07:52.520> coming<00:07:53.030> from<00:07:53.240> Mike's
