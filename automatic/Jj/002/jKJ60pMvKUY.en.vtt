lesson are the elementary ones the first

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.310 
lesson are the elementary ones the first
step<00:00:29.310> is<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.240> where<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> notes<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
step is to know where the notes are and

what they're called and the easiest way

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.389 
what they're called and the easiest way
to<00:00:36.420> do<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.680> have<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> good<00:00:38.010> look<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.309> the

to do this is to have a good look at the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.459 
to do this is to have a good look at the
keyboard<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.020> keyboard

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
keyboard you will see that the keyboard

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.860 
keyboard you will see that the keyboard
has<00:00:40.649> many<00:00:41.190> white<00:00:41.489> notes<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.059> less<00:00:42.510> black

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
notes the black notes are arranged into

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.430 
notes the black notes are arranged into
groups<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> threes<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.140> twos<00:00:48.110> at<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> left

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:07.120 
one semitone below the groups of two and

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.630 
one semitone below the groups of two and
each<00:01:07.330> one<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.600> these<00:01:07.840> C's<00:01:08.200> is<00:01:08.560> one<00:01:09.130> octave

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
each one of these C's is one octave

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.020 
each one of these C's is one octave
apart<00:01:10.290> an<00:01:11.290> octave<00:01:11.680> is<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.860> term<00:01:12.220> meaning<00:01:12.610> eighth

apart an octave is a term meaning eighth

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.810 
apart an octave is a term meaning eighth
notes<00:01:13.860> similarly<00:01:14.860> an<00:01:15.040> octopus<00:01:15.520> has<00:01:15.790> eight

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
notes similarly an octopus has eight

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.890 
notes similarly an octopus has eight
legs<00:01:16.570> but<00:01:17.080> that's<00:01:17.290> quite<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.560> tenuous<00:01:18.100> link<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
legs but that's quite a tenuous link the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
legs but that's quite a tenuous link the
number<00:01:20.200> of<00:01:20.350> C<00:01:20.590> notes<00:01:20.860> on<00:01:21.070> your<00:01:21.220> keyboard

number of C notes on your keyboard

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.930 
number of C notes on your keyboard
depends<00:01:22.479> on<00:01:22.570> the<00:01:22.690> size<00:01:22.930> of<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.229> keyboard<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.880> a

Hammond b3 all of c3 organ there are 261
no<00:01:28.660> manuals<00:01:29.170> so<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.800> have<00:01:29.979> plenty<00:01:30.220> of<00:01:30.430> C's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
no manuals so you have plenty of C's

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.140 
no manuals so you have plenty of C's
once<00:01:31.750> we<00:01:31.930> found<00:01:32.170> our<00:01:32.350> C<00:01:32.590> on<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.890> keyboard<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
once we found our C on the keyboard it's

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.270 
once we found our C on the keyboard it's
time<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.570> play<00:01:34.750> something<00:01:35.259> you<00:01:35.830> have<00:01:36.009> five

time to play something you have five

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.460 
time to play something you have five
fingers<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.270> we<00:01:37.450> need<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.690> play<00:01:37.900> five<00:01:38.200> notes

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
fingers and we need to play five notes

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.270 
fingers and we need to play five notes
starting<00:01:39.369> from<00:01:39.550> C<00:01:40.080> all<00:01:41.080> white<00:01:41.500> notes<00:01:41.800> very

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
starting from C all white notes very

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.020 
starting from C all white notes very
straightforward<00:01:43.170> until<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.259> try<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.619> do<00:01:44.770> it

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
straightforward until you try and do it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
the aim of these five fingered exercises

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.490 
the aim of these five fingered exercises
is<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.729> connect<00:01:49.119> the<00:01:49.330> brain<00:01:49.570> to<00:01:50.320> each

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
is to connect the brain to each

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.040 
is to connect the brain to each
individual<00:01:51.190> finger<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.479> can<00:01:52.690> put<00:01:52.899> each

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
individual finger so you can put each

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.749 
individual finger so you can put each
finger<00:01:53.530> where<00:01:53.950> you<00:01:53.979> need<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.430> be<00:01:54.550> on<00:01:54.670> the

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
finger where you need to be on the

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.480 
finger where you need to be on the
keyboard<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.649> art<00:01:56.800> of<00:01:56.979> playing<00:01:57.190> five

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
keyboard and the art of playing five

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.820 
keyboard and the art of playing five
finger<00:01:57.850> exercises<00:01:58.570> is<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.229> make<00:01:59.410> sure<00:01:59.440> they

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
finger exercises is to make sure they

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.899 
finger exercises is to make sure they
are<00:01:59.890> very<00:01:59.950> even<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.970> very<00:02:01.180> smooth<00:02:02.040> I'm<00:02:03.040> sure

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
are very even and very smooth I'm sure

evenly then try it with your left hand
you<00:02:44.299> will<00:02:44.420> probably<00:02:44.629> find<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.110> more<00:02:45.230> difficult

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
you will probably find it more difficult
