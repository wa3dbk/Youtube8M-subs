any<00:00:01.310> technical<00:00:01.760> artist<00:00:02.240> and<00:00:02.590> so<00:00:03.590> the<00:00:03.709> intro

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:03.979 
any technical artist and so the intro

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:05.740 
any technical artist and so the intro
was<00:00:04.070> made<00:00:04.310> to<00:00:04.490> touch<00:00:04.670> via<00:00:04.850> simulation<00:00:05.600> or

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:05.750 
was made to touch via simulation or

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.720 
was made to touch via simulation or
cloth<00:00:05.990> and<00:00:06.350> here<00:00:06.710> I<00:00:06.740> have<00:00:06.890> some<00:00:06.919> particle<00:00:07.580> work

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:07.730 
cloth and here I have some particle work

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.930 
cloth and here I have some particle work
I<00:00:07.850> did<00:00:08.060> with<00:00:08.180> XO<00:00:08.660> cortex<00:00:09.730> basically<00:00:10.730> took

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
I did with XO cortex basically took

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.420 
I did with XO cortex basically took
their<00:00:11.240> experimental<00:00:12.080> plugin<00:00:12.650> and<00:00:12.830> I<00:00:13.190> was

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:13.430 
their experimental plugin and I was

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.450 
their experimental plugin and I was
tasked<00:00:14.420> with<00:00:14.630> creating<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:15.440> workflows<00:00:16.100> and

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
tasked with creating the workflows and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.630 
tasked with creating the workflows and
programming<00:00:17.060> to<00:00:17.150> go<00:00:17.240> behind<00:00:17.570> it<00:00:17.660> in<00:00:17.810> ice

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
programming to go behind it in ice

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.820 
programming to go behind it in ice
here's<00:00:19.640> some<00:00:20.240> real<00:00:20.449> flow<00:00:20.660> work<00:00:20.839> I<00:00:20.960> did<00:00:21.140> try<00:00:21.769> and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
here's some real flow work I did try and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.730 
here's some real flow work I did try and
gain<00:00:22.009> a<00:00:22.039> contract<00:00:22.669> and<00:00:23.199> following<00:00:24.199> it<00:00:24.320> is<00:00:24.470> the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
gain a contract and following it is the

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.640 
gain a contract and following it is the
actual<00:00:25.039> simulation<00:00:25.699> did<00:00:25.999> for<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.140> project<00:00:27.560> so

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
actual simulation did for the project so

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.849 
actual simulation did for the project so
there's<00:00:28.159> a<00:00:28.220> character<00:00:29.019> multiple<00:00:30.019> water<00:00:30.230> jets

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
there's a character multiple water jets

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.610 
there's a character multiple water jets
on<00:00:31.130> him<00:00:31.400> and<00:00:31.579> here's<00:00:32.270> his<00:00:32.480> walk<00:00:32.810> cycle<00:00:33.350> with<00:00:33.590> a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
on him and here's his walk cycle with a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.360 
on him and here's his walk cycle with a
bit<00:00:34.040> of<00:00:34.240> just<00:00:35.240> like<00:00:35.330> a<00:00:35.360> simple<00:00:35.890> walking<00:00:36.890> loop

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
bit of just like a simple walking loop

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.280 
bit of just like a simple walking loop
and<00:00:37.760> basically<00:00:38.120> did<00:00:38.480> all<00:00:38.630> of<00:00:38.660> his<00:00:38.840> animations

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
and basically did all of his animations

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.100 
and basically did all of his animations
this<00:00:39.410> way<00:00:40.000> here's<00:00:41.000> just<00:00:41.450> a<00:00:41.540> show<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.810> I<00:00:41.900> also

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110 
this way here's just a show that I also

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.540 
this way here's just a show that I also
know<00:00:42.260> how<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.440> do<00:00:42.560> compositing<00:00:43.190> as<00:00:43.400> the

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
know how to do compositing as the

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.920 
know how to do compositing as the
technical<00:00:43.910> artists<00:00:44.240> I<00:00:44.300> had<00:00:44.480> know<00:00:44.660> many

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
technical artists I had know many

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.820 
technical artists I had know many
aspects<00:00:45.770> of<00:00:45.830> the<00:00:45.950> 3d<00:00:46.250> pipeline<00:00:46.970> including

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
aspects of the 3d pipeline including

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.770 
aspects of the 3d pipeline including
compositing<00:00:48.830> and<00:00:48.950> editing<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:50.360> can<00:00:50.570> also

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
compositing and editing and I can also

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.960 
compositing and editing and I can also
animate<00:00:51.500> in<00:00:51.740> a<00:00:51.830> pinch<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:52.550> here's<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.850> few

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
animate in a pinch so here's a few

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.500 
animate in a pinch so here's a few
animations<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:53.480> did<00:00:54.790> this<00:00:55.790> next<00:00:56.120> character<00:00:56.270> is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
animations I did this next character is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.510 
animations I did this next character is
actually<00:00:56.750> for<00:00:56.900> an<00:00:56.990> iPhone<00:00:57.380> project<00:00:57.800> I<00:00:57.860> did<00:00:58.040> so

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
actually for an iPhone project I did so

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.810 
actually for an iPhone project I did so
I<00:00:58.640> modeled<00:00:59.480> rigged<00:00:59.950> animated<00:01:00.950> I<00:01:01.160> also<00:01:01.610> do

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
I modeled rigged animated I also do

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.359 
I modeled rigged animated I also do
procedural<00:01:02.330> animations<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.040> also<00:01:04.159> my

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
procedural animations this is also my

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.840 
procedural animations this is also my
rendering<00:01:04.699> as<00:01:05.030> well<00:01:05.239> as<00:01:05.420> animation<00:01:06.549> this<00:01:07.549> next

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
rendering as well as animation this next

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.910 
rendering as well as animation this next
project<00:01:08.030> is<00:01:08.270> also<00:01:08.539> rendering<00:01:08.990> again<00:01:09.079> so<00:01:09.530> as<00:01:09.859> a

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
project is also rendering again so as a

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.919 
project is also rendering again so as a
technical<00:01:10.399> artist<00:01:10.640> I'm<00:01:10.759> experienced<00:01:11.509> in<00:01:11.630> many

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
technical artist I'm experienced in many

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.830 
technical artist I'm experienced in many
different<00:01:12.200> aspects<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.070> 3d<00:01:13.460> I'm<00:01:14.390> usually

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
different aspects of 3d I'm usually

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.330 
different aspects of 3d I'm usually
expected<00:01:15.170> to<00:01:15.259> do<00:01:15.409> many<00:01:16.310> different<00:01:16.700> things

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.580 

as<00:01:23.340> well<00:01:23.549> as<00:01:23.700> modeling<00:01:24.179> so<00:01:24.719> here's<00:01:25.049> just<00:01:25.350> an

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
as well as modeling so here's just an

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
as well as modeling so here's just an
example<00:01:25.829> of<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.130> quick<00:01:26.579> model<00:01:27.030> turn<00:01:27.210> around

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
example of a quick model turn around

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.819 
example of a quick model turn around
here<00:01:28.429> so<00:01:29.429> modeling<00:01:30.329> lighting<00:01:30.810> rendering<00:01:31.380> all

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
here so modeling lighting rendering all

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.520 
here so modeling lighting rendering all
parts<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.759> being<00:01:32.969> a<00:01:33.149> technical<00:01:33.569> artist<00:01:33.929> here's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
parts of being a technical artist here's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.370 
parts of being a technical artist here's
some<00:01:34.920> tools<00:01:35.219> now<00:01:35.569> I've<00:01:36.569> written<00:01:36.869> various

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
some tools now I've written various

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.999 
some tools now I've written various
tools<00:01:37.890> for<00:01:38.479> torque<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.719> iPhone<00:01:40.319> exporting

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
tools for torque and iPhone exporting

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.069 
tools for torque and iPhone exporting
this<00:01:41.459> is<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> torque<00:01:42.209> exporter<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.659> wrote<00:01:42.929> which

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
this is a torque exporter I wrote which

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.940 
this is a torque exporter I wrote which
does<00:01:43.350> batch<00:01:44.009> exports<00:01:45.049> so<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.409> selected

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
does batch exports so I just selected

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
does batch exports so I just selected
three<00:01:47.250> objects<00:01:47.670> here<00:01:47.819> and<00:01:47.850> just<00:01:48.060> explored

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
three objects here and just explored

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
three objects here and just explored
them<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:49.200> real<00:01:49.469> trick<00:01:50.069> here<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.520> I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
them the real trick here is that I

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.330 
them the real trick here is that I
basically<00:01:51.060> turn<00:01:51.359> Maya<00:01:51.689> into<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.289> more<00:01:52.979> flexible

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
basically turn Maya into a more flexible

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.330 
basically turn Maya into a more flexible
world<00:01:53.880> editor<00:01:54.470> for<00:01:55.470> torque<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.890> example<00:01:56.220> had

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
world editor for torque for example had

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.919 
world editor for torque for example had
a<00:01:56.369> data<00:01:56.729> block<00:01:57.030> which<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> would<00:01:57.630> have<00:01:57.810> to

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
a data block which you would have to

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.589 
a data block which you would have to
manually<00:01:58.380> create<00:01:58.819> massive<00:01:59.819> amounts<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.149> text

00:02:00.589 --> 00:02:00.599 
manually create massive amounts of text

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:04.130 
manually create massive amounts of text
data<00:02:01.280> positions<00:02:02.280> rotations<00:02:03.000> etc<00:02:03.569> and<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
data positions rotations etc and here I

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.740 
data positions rotations etc and here I
basically<00:02:04.409> wrote<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> tool<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.360> would<00:02:06.360> gather

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
basically wrote a tool that would gather

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.719 
basically wrote a tool that would gather
all<00:02:07.049> that<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.409> export<00:02:07.739> it<00:02:07.799> for<00:02:08.009> you<00:02:08.129> here<00:02:08.670> I

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
all that and export it for you here I

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.580 
all that and export it for you here I
have<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.030> volume<00:02:09.360> detection<00:02:10.110> I<00:02:10.170> used<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.560> my

here's a follicle tool it's good for

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.339 
here's a follicle tool it's good for
creating<00:02:35.850> things<00:02:36.209> like<00:02:36.359> buttons<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:36.989> horns

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
creating things like buttons or horns

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.809 
creating things like buttons or horns
and<00:02:37.530> things<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.859> stick<00:02:38.099> out<00:02:38.190> of<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.400> character

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
and things I stick out of a character

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.089 
and things I stick out of a character
that<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.930> want<00:02:40.079> to<00:02:40.170> follow<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.620> character

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that you want to follow the character

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.400 
that you want to follow the character
but<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.519> this<00:02:42.030> way<00:02:42.180> it'll<00:02:42.359> automatically<00:02:43.139> set

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
but and this way it'll automatically set

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.140 
but and this way it'll automatically set
the<00:02:43.500> connections<00:02:43.889> for<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:44.519> it'll<00:02:45.000> follow

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
the connections for you and it'll follow

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.930 
the connections for you and it'll follow
the<00:02:45.420> normal<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.019> base<00:02:46.440> as<00:02:46.620> well<00:02:46.940> there's

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
the normal of the base as well there's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.000 
the normal of the base as well there's
just<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.420> quick<00:02:49.109> showing<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:49.769> rig<00:02:49.980> that's

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
just a quick showing of a rig that's

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.240 
just a quick showing of a rig that's
both<00:02:50.579> fka<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.569> I<00:02:52.380> K<00:02:52.440> at<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> same<00:02:53.010> time

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
both fka and I K at the same time

it's<00:02:55.530> more<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.919> an<00:02:55.980> eye<00:02:56.069> case<00:02:56.310> blind<00:02:57.169> but<00:02:58.169> as

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
it's more of an eye case blind but as

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.559 
it's more of an eye case blind but as
well<00:02:58.620> as<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:59.010> course<00:02:59.040> rotates<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.060> translates
