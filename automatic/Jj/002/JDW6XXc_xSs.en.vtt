00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
was trying to figure out ways that we

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.120 
was trying to figure out ways that we
could<00:00:27.300> practice<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> would<00:00:28.680> actually<00:00:28.859> be

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
could practice that it would actually be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.160

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
every time you have someone who makes an

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.729 
every time you have someone who makes an
errand<00:00:47.940> pass<00:00:48.149> they're<00:00:48.870> eliminated<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> go

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
errand pass they're eliminated you go

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.439 
errand pass they're eliminated you go
down<00:00:49.920> until<00:00:50.219> there's<00:00:50.340> one<00:00:50.520> person<00:00:50.820> left<00:00:51.270> all

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
down until there's one person left all

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:51.590 
down until there's one person left all

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
right

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
right
this<00:00:52.140> helps<00:00:52.440> with<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.739> different<00:00:53.010> things

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
this helps with two different things

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.180 
this helps with two different things
first<00:00:54.059> you're<00:00:54.329> passing<00:00:54.750> accuracy<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.500> second

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
first you're passing accuracy and second

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.790 
first you're passing accuracy and second
moving<00:00:56.520> moving<00:00:57.420> away<00:00:57.539> from<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.199> puck<00:00:58.410> making

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
moving moving away from the puck making

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.900 
moving moving away from the puck making
sure<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.129> you're<00:00:59.280> going<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.760> right

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
sure that you're going in the right

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.639 
sure that you're going in the right
direction<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.170> see<00:01:01.320> some<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
direction as you can see some of the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.840 
direction as you can see some of the
times<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.070> know<00:01:02.160> we're<00:01:02.309> not<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> perfect

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
times you know we're not in a perfect

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.450 
times you know we're not in a perfect
circle<00:01:03.300> players<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.780> drifting<00:01:04.140> off<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.309> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
circle players are drifting off so it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.250 
circle players are drifting off so it's
two<00:01:05.670> things<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.299> about<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.960> have<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> be

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
two things to think about you have to be

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.170 
two things to think about you have to be
accurate<00:01:07.560> with<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:07.950> passes<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.909> then<00:01:09.090> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
accurate with your passes but then you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.580 
accurate with your passes but then you
also<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> be<00:01:09.810> aware<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.320> player

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
also have to be aware of your player

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
also have to be aware of your player
away<00:01:11.070> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.520> puck<00:01:11.700> when<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.210> have

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
away from the puck when you don't have

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.450 
away from the puck when you don't have
the<00:01:12.600> puck<00:01:12.810> all<00:01:13.229> right<00:01:13.409> it's<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.890> quite

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
the puck all right it's it's quite

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.920 
the puck all right it's it's quite
interesting<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.090> quite<00:01:15.299> fun<00:01:15.600> you<00:01:15.780> know<00:01:15.900> and
