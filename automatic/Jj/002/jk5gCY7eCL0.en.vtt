00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.890
 Specialist for travel and 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.890
 holiday homes in norway 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.320
 at tropical temperatures around 30 degrees 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 became the second test match in austria 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.800
 due to the high training load in 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.690
 the past days to the character test 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 against the series champion of 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.649
 Azerbaijan enter the black and yellow 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 to the joy of stefan bürger after one 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.100
 early backlog lot so 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.670
 Today I do not have the technology 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.079
 complain because I think I'm fine 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 can assess what the boys the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.790
 what must have done in the past few days 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.040
 they were under strain and under this 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.699
 prerequisite for such a heart game 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.129
 deliver 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.409
 The compels him respect from that I need 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.540
 Let's say big praise to the team 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:04.739
 I think it already noticed that the 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.189
 team was pretty tired 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.780
 after the hard days and who 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 must be thrown in full I think opponents 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 he already has a certain quality but 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.229
 I think fight always come in 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.810
 I think that even the eleven also 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.820
 arrivals are made today and top 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.590
 if you also serve we results 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.270
 Of course you also got the boys 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.040
 noted that today it is extremely difficult 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.530
 was with the with the whole topic 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.409
 here and on the parcours, too 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.939
 a very good team is and you 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.749
 has left in the beginning already seen that 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.069
 had some problems 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:36.420
 but to get in there is great 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.259
 solved and finally on mine 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.689
 opinion deserves to win 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.999
 Michael Hefele the team again 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.950
 scored as captain on the field scored 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:46.170
 by an unfortunate owner 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 leading hit for baku so what happens 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.499
 because in soccer just go to the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.460
 defender position is simply one 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.990
 a little luck 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.630
 I thought behind me is still the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.639
 striker who runs in from the outside and yes 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.569
 that just happens because you stop 

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.179
 simply a cold 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.189
 Robert Cook ironed the early residue 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:05.840
 with his hit and recommended 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.840
 thus for the position in the attack 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.890
 It is one of the options very clear though 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.060
 you are right in the center of the offensive 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.680
 We do not have a look at this area 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.930
 many players as we with luca dürholtz 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.390
 with combos baumann and in the cooker 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.860
 have quasi quasi four players these 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.510
 can hold both positions 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.100
 Stefan Burger had in the last 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.350
 unity before the game with his 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.810
 Practitioners practiced intensive standards 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.670
 a few hours later one of these led 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.160
 eckball variants by the header of 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.440
 häfele to the 2 1 goal 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.090
 yes there was just then everything has 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.970
 Everything was fine voted fortunately was 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.830
 this morning again such standards 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.430
 practiced and I always think so 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.400
 happy with the 21 so much help and 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 I was in a group and so finally 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.209
 we did it today and who did it 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.910
 worked perfectly and yes it was 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.980
 victory for the victory so far 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.720
 it is enough at the end due to a class 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.330
 team performance and a held 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.680
 eleven meters from benny boxes I think we 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.810
 are on a very good way because you are here 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.820
 at these temperatures after the 10 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.580
 after the stupid 100 years again 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.860
 The enemy came back was okay then 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.320
 it already draws the entire team 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.910
 performance and you can tell now 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.489
 Also every day we are together longer 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.769
 we will become like I have that 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.540
 puzzleteil times we add 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.610
 piece by piece and we are too 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.620
 very good on Wednesday is the 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.010
