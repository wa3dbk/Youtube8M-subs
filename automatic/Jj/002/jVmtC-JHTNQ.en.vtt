00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.280
 Welcome to the first segment of 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.620
 news and I'll explain more or 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.540
 less how it will be dynamic because 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.639
 He spent a lot of time at university and 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.710
 he liked to make videos and they come out very good 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.930
 news in the world of technology is 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.820
 a way in minutes that the 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.949
 news upload alone to all of you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.350
 be informed of news that is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 fresh out of the world's oven 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.420
 technologies but right now let's go with the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.730
 first news and the first news is 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.800
 of youtube since it is saying that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.749
 by the end of this week it could be 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 and launch what are subscriptions for 

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:41.699
 50 channels that are already chosen where 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.039
 they will start to charge a subscription 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.600
 monthly or something super weird one of the 

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:47.729
 things that I think of youtube is that it is 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.949
 so big because people can receive 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.600
 information completely free but 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.019
 well the creators of youtube say that 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.459
 not that they are going to prove if this works and 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.199
 that larger studies like what is 

00:00:56.459 --> 00:01:00.479
 more china mao makers studio that has 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 quite a few very large English channels 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.080
 they could charge up to 5 dollars 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.539
 monthly something that we already see in the world 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.430
 of technology since there are charges for 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.350
 movies and things and services 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.260
 internal the second news will be of 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.570
 xbox and the project lasted and because 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.290
 We're going to go into that because the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 event 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.060
 just around the corner and a leaked 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.040
 mail where they are naming it durango 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.170
 to the project and also another 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.940
 information that includes what it is that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.010
 you always have to have the console 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.229
 connected to the internet and that's what 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.119
 completely denied it in that 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.130
 mail saying there are many functions 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.290
 that people will be able to occupy as a 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.300
 single campaign of a game where no 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.950
 we need the internet connection 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.649

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.660
