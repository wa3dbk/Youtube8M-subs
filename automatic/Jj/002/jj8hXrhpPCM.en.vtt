00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.630 

since<00:00:46.320> my<00:00:46.440> eyebrows<00:00:46.800> already<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.460> shape

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
since my eyebrows already have the shape

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.119 
since my eyebrows already have the shape
that<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:48.149> I'm<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.780> basically<00:00:49.230> tweezing

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that I like I'm just basically tweezing

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.770 
that I like I'm just basically tweezing
all<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> stray<00:00:50.789> hairs<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.390> have<00:00:51.480> grown

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
all the stray hairs that have grown

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.709 
all the stray hairs that have grown
underneath<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.829> shape<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.309> don't<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:54.149> do

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
underneath the shape I don't really do

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.250 
underneath the shape I don't really do
any<00:00:54.989> weird<00:00:55.879> curves<00:00:56.879> with<00:00:57.149> my<00:00:57.300> eyebrows<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.989> like

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
any weird curves with my eyebrows I like

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.619 
any weird curves with my eyebrows I like
the<00:00:58.440> line<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.070> quite<00:00:59.760> straight<00:01:00.090> leading<00:01:00.480> up

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the line to be quite straight leading up

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.920 
the line to be quite straight leading up
to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:01.230> arch<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.920> doesn't<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:02.579> odd<00:01:03.239> or

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to the arch so it doesn't look odd or

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.230 
to the arch so it doesn't look odd or
too<00:01:04.409> harsh<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.100> guess<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> very

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
too harsh I guess I like it to be very

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.350 
too harsh I guess I like it to be very
gradual<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.369> obviously<00:01:08.369> I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:09.119> do

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
gradual and obviously I don't do

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.609 
gradual and obviously I don't do
anything<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.960> part<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> my<00:01:10.439> eyebrow

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
anything to that part of my eyebrow

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.250 
anything to that part of my eyebrow
because<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.640> quite<00:01:11.880> sparse<00:01:12.210> already<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.810> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
because it is quite sparse already and I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
because it is quite sparse already and I
just<00:01:13.290> don't<00:01:13.650> like<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.250> shape<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.299> eyebrows

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just don't like to shape my eyebrows

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.920 
just don't like to shape my eyebrows
from<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.560> top<00:01:16.799> anyway<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.820> only<00:01:18.299> pluck<00:01:18.689> and

from the top anyway so I only pluck and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.750

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.390 
the whole look and makes it look a bit
sleeker<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.870> we're<00:02:21.380> not<00:02:21.470> shaping<00:02:21.800> we're<00:02:22.190> just

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
of them and this just kind of gives a

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.420 
of them and this just kind of gives a
nicer<00:03:21.000> shape<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.420> my<00:03:21.510> eyebrows<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.049> guess<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.650> I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
nicer shape to my eyebrows I guess and I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.830 
nicer shape to my eyebrows I guess and I
just<00:03:23.700> really<00:03:23.879> like<00:03:24.030> it<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.389> it<00:03:24.540> looks<00:03:24.750> very

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
just really like it but it looks very

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.949 
just really like it but it looks very
wet<00:03:25.379> and<00:03:25.620> shiny<00:03:26.579> right<00:03:26.849> now<00:03:27.000> but<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.359> does<00:03:27.569> dry

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
wet and shiny right now but it does dry

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:36.500 
wet and shiny right now but it does dry
matte<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:33.500> that<00:03:34.500> is<00:03:34.829> my<00:03:35.250> eyebrow<00:03:35.579> routine<00:03:35.940> and

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
matte and that is my eyebrow routine and

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.780 
matte and that is my eyebrow routine and
obviously<00:03:37.349> it's<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.680> too<00:03:37.889> complicated<00:03:38.250> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
obviously it's not too complicated and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.909 
obviously it's not too complicated and
it's<00:03:39.180> not<00:03:39.299> for<00:03:39.480> everybody<00:03:39.690> but<00:03:39.930> so<00:03:40.470> I<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.620> it

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919
