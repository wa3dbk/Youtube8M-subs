00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 for providing the test device 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.600
 thank the store about house hello everyone 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.370
 dear friends this 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.559
 appleinsider.ru and today we talk about 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.840
 comparing two bracelet from pattern we 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.470
 talked about ja boom 2 we talked about 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.880
 toads three new difference why do you 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.830
 need to buy one or the other 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.830
 we haven't said it yet 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 so friends of the fitness tracker we 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 already told in general nothing 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.340
 so special ones tell me 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.650
 left here on the box that says 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.809
 This is a mess with activity in the tracker clip 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.330
 i.e. it is a wireless sensor 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.910
 activity is clear and this and this is surprising 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.010
 also wireless sleep activity sensor 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 but also with a sensor 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.540
 heartbeat that works for now 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.140
 only in some cases from 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.350
 he zhabonov 3 I departed with him more than two 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.340
 months I like this to really like and 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.870
 distinctive feature are both 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.080
 once these very daughter who 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.780
 are located throughout around the bracelet then 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.090
 have when we put this bracelet on 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.700
 our wrist then sensors tight tight 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.610
 fit our wrist and start 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 measure our pulse and and in fact they 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.770
 would have to measure our temperature 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 blood oxygen saturation and a lot 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.460
 other very , very interesting 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.140
 parameters but while the company ja bonny 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.660
 preoccupied with finalizing the software 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.020
 ensure nevertheless toons 3 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.069
 this is probably the most perfect 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.899
 fitness bracelet fitness tracker which 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:38.160
 Now there is on the market if you compare it 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.140
 with template 2 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.500
 that we actually tried it 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.060
 were going to do something in size 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.860
 guys whom this size is important we 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.950
 see for yourself does not differ literally 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.229
 there on a millimeter and a half on the bracelet they 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.849
 for once became dimensionless then 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.340
 eat we don't need this weird brace 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:58.560
 pull on your arm so here they have 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.539
 absolute parity and and here how would you 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.250
 you can choose absolutely any of these 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.250
 devices except that the clasp became 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.020
 somewhat more strange and now she 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.929
 reminds i won't say that 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.709
 reminds me specifically of me 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.640
 she is 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.750
 but no less get used to her 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.200
 zipping is still necessary because 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.819
 what to thread under special 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.890
 for a special piece of metal 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.400
 here and so I will select the selected piece 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.580
 strap 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.710
 Still it is necessary to its blowout 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.780
 which we have already told you 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.970
 and about this fastener you can with us on 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 Channel watch already a couple of videos where we 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.900
 just as we stamp it as in this 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.360
 video as for appearance 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.730
 friends then here will be just rippled 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.180
 the surface while here dragon 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.090
 age 2 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.830
 and in the toads 3 will be a little more can 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.110
 be frilly design such 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.850
 designer sophistication that someone 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.500
 please someone not but nonetheless 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.080
 Mud probably will collect less 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.520
 than ribbing on from templates 2 and for 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.210
 someone and can really become 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.860
 such an important moment of choice because 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.080
 previous bracelets were very dirty and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.240
 very active well nevertheless it is not 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.490
 the main natural difference and perhaps 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.300
 worth all the same note and 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.250
 software and hardware differences in data 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.620
 devices for this i am now 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.690
 unlock your iphone call 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.790
 application up which I have now 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.790
 will help toads toris which measures how 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.310
 I go once and perhaps the main moment 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.340
 which distinguishes between these two 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.990
 device is tracking mode 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.930
 pulses during sleep 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:34.980
 well , one more thing ja bon app 2 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.500
 distinguishes only fast and deep sleep in 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.510
 while java is on day 3 from their 3 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.430
 phases that is fast not deep deep 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 and accordingly we can at this 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.840
 moment to trace which phases of sleep 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.340
 fixed this very bracelet 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.830
 I have a deep sleep, of course 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.160
 not enough today in general was 34 minutes 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.680
 sleep 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.570
 but it is nevertheless the little things up to the bridge 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.630
 our main task is to find out what 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.090
 they are different and so that same pulse 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.340
 then the change itself let the pulse rate 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.320
 during sleep because unfortunately these 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.120
 bio impedance sensors despite the fact that 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.450
 promised temperature and much more 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.360
 due to a number of problems in engineering in 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.040
 country program areas failed 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.830
 for now I hope that for now 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.660
 because I would only vote for op-3 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.910
 due to the fact that he has a perspective 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.710
 much more than apb2 apb2 grow 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.530
 nowhere blows all already passed 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.140
 Well done guys will repeat 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.930
 sensors and so the pulse is measured somewhat 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.380
 time during sleep then computed 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.270
 some kind of average heart rate and 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.690
 we can you check it out app 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:41.030
 jabba on me it seems that for those people 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.800
 who care about their health for their 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.160
 physical exertion will be pretty 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.650
 It is important to see how their 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.210
 heart muscle rests during the night 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.320
 because I like the remote start 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.300
 there from 105 and eventually drops to 74 and 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.570
 it's like they say pretty cool because 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.520
 the ratings that the coach is 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.490
 the very trailer in smart coaches 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.410
 suggest that necessary difference and 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.290
 necessary indicator which would be better 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.970
 still reach here again July 24 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.070
 on August 5th here we have 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:17.390
 certain indicators can be 58 numbers 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.660
 -6 78 79 here I apparently almost did not live 49 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.070
 beats per minute at night seriously well apparently 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.390
 just the night was for once 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.050
 calm 1 august 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.430
 it was it was my saturday 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.100
 itâ€™s already gone three shots and 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.220
 somewhere upward well this is already 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.320
 Work days began working when 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.840
 you have to think in general for the most part 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.700
 parts of the work in addition to measuring the pulse 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.590
 actually no difference yet 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.470
 I was waiting for some 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.810
 temperature measurement charts and graphs 

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.110
 measuring the amount of oxygen in 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.000
 of blood 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.190
 we talked about such sensors and on and 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.620
 tablets on android insider . you and in 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.570
 principle for this here these whites 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.120
 departmental modules are enough 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.600
 but for now unfortunately this pattern or not 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.270
 realized but the truth is there is one in general 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.830
 the moment that I want to mention 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.410
 these guys were planning to release this 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.390
 bracelet back in december and from december i'm his 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.900
 I waited very, very much because I was 

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:18.050
 its time was changed on ap20 which 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.270
 changed to at 24 then changed it to apb2 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.300
 essentially being and 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.720
 apb2 of this generation that is both 24 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.790
 m2 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:28.130
 this is the same bracelet just in 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:30.590
 different packages if you have up24 not 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.390
 change just wait for payment 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.870
 here is this model if you want something 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:38.270
 Take about 3 and wait for it to appear 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.200
 fresh firmware i really believe in these 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.540
 guys what do they really make us 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.100
 these normal full sports 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.290
 fitness tracker when given 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.480
 functionality will appear in the dragon 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:50.250
 the author will definitely inform you on our 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.720
 channel on our website because we 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:53.820
 do you love these fitness tracker they 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.470
 really interesting really 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.540
 wonderful if they still take you to 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.740
 his hands were announcing it was generally gorgeous but 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.300
 so stay with us on 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.620

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.250
 details here are jabbons 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:08.900
 op-3 apb2 and other interesting things in 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.900
 world fitness bracelets until all 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.740
 and
