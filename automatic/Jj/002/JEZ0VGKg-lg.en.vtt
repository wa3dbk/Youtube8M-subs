in this movie I'm going to demonstrate
some<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.960> basics<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.590> working<00:00:13.889> with

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
some of the basics of working with

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.820 
some of the basics of working with
shadow<00:00:14.580> box<00:00:15.260> I'm<00:00:16.260> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.710> by

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
shadow box I'm going to start by

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.060 
shadow box I'm going to start by
bringing<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.400> dog<00:00:17.699> tool<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.720> canvas<00:00:19.619> you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
bringing the dog tool on the canvas you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.650 
bringing the dog tool on the canvas you
can<00:00:20.250> use<00:00:20.400> any<00:00:20.609> tool<00:00:20.880> that<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.119> like<00:00:21.300> but<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
can use any tool that you like but the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.570 
can use any tool that you like but the
dog<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> make<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> few<00:00:23.010> aspects<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
dog is going to make a few aspects of

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.310 
dog is going to make a few aspects of
working<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.119> shadow<00:00:24.600> box<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:25.019> bit<00:00:25.170> more

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
working with shadow box a bit more

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
working with shadow box a bit more
obvious<00:00:25.699> just<00:00:26.699> switching<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.390> nice<00:00:27.539> white

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
obvious just switching to a nice white

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.689 
obvious just switching to a nice white
material<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:28.740> everything's<00:00:29.160> nice<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.429> easy

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
material so everything's nice and easy

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.269 
material so everything's nice and easy
to<00:00:29.880> see<00:00:30.140> expand<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> sub<00:00:31.470> tool<00:00:31.710> pallet<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
to see expand the sub tool pallet and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.340 
to see expand the sub tool pallet and
click<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.850> shadow<00:00:33.120> box<00:00:33.390> button<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.140> what

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
click on the shadow box button and what

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.889 
click on the shadow box button and what
this<00:00:34.500> does<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.370> replaces<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> dog<00:00:36.570> tool

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
this does is this replaces the dog tool

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.639 
this does is this replaces the dog tool
with<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.350> shadow<00:00:37.620> box<00:00:37.860> tool<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:40.230> creates

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
with the shadow box tool and it creates

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.950 
with the shadow box tool and it creates
a<00:00:40.770> mask<00:00:41.070> from<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.550> initial<00:00:41.969> dog<00:00:42.210> shape<00:00:42.600> which

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
a mask from the initial dog shape which

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.529 
a mask from the initial dog shape which
is<00:00:43.140> projected<00:00:43.680> on<00:00:43.800> each<00:00:44.010> side<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:45.300> shadow

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
is projected on each side of the shadow

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.930 
is projected on each side of the shadow
box<00:00:45.750> tool<00:00:46.110> now<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.100> mesh<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:47.610> see<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
box tool now the mesh that you see in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
box tool now the mesh that you see in
the<00:00:48.030> center<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.600> created<00:00:49.230> at<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the center is created at the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.490 
the center is created at the
intersection<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> three<00:00:51.090> masks<00:00:54.469> now<00:00:55.469> I

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
intersection of the three masks now I

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.410 
intersection of the three masks now I
can<00:00:55.739> clear<00:00:55.920> these<00:00:56.070> masks<00:00:56.579> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> shadow<00:00:57.090> box

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
can clear these masks out of shadow box

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.209 
can clear these masks out of shadow box
just<00:00:57.719> by<00:00:57.870> holding<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.350> control<00:00:58.710> key<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
just by holding the control key and

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.799 
just by holding the control key and
dragging<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.149> canvas<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.750> that

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
dragging on the canvas and that

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
dragging on the canvas and that
essentially<00:01:01.320> clears<00:01:01.739> out<00:01:01.949> shadow<00:01:02.250> box<00:01:02.520> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
essentially clears out shadow box and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.329 
essentially clears out shadow box and
gives<00:01:02.910> me<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> nice<00:01:03.589> clean<00:01:04.589> shadow<00:01:04.890> box<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
gives me a nice clean shadow box to

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.219 
gives me a nice clean shadow box to
start<00:01:05.610> working<00:01:05.909> what<00:01:06.630> I'm<00:01:06.720> going<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.080> is

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
start working what I'm going to do is

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.289 
start working what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:01:07.350> actually<00:01:07.530> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.220> shadow<00:01:08.820> box<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
I'm actually going to use shadow box to

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'm actually going to use shadow box to
create<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.600> very<00:01:09.780> simple<00:01:09.990> couch<00:01:10.460> to<00:01:11.460> make

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
create a very simple couch to make

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.370 
create a very simple couch to make
things<00:01:11.909> more<00:01:12.090> obvious<00:01:12.570> I'm<00:01:12.780> going<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.200> bring

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
things more obvious I'm going to bring

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.640 
things more obvious I'm going to bring
in<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.560> custom<00:01:13.979> texture<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:15.119> has<00:01:15.180> labels<00:01:16.140> for

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
in a custom texture that has labels for

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.340 
in a custom texture that has labels for
each<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.130> sides<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.790> shadow<00:01:18.090> box<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
each of the sides of shadow box and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.840 
each of the sides of shadow box and
apply<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.950> shadow<00:01:20.130> box<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
apply this to shadow box so it's a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.690 
apply this to shadow box so it's a
little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.150> easier<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.570> what's<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.080> on

center of shadow box now I'll draw

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.050 
center of shadow box now I'll draw
another<00:01:47.110> rectangle<00:01:47.409> on<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.280> right<00:01:48.549> side<00:01:51.060> and

leads me a sort of acknowledging
continue<00:01:59.860> to<00:01:59.979> trim<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.280> math<00:02:00.670> shake<00:02:01.030> down

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
continue to trim my math shake down

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.410 
continue to trim my math shake down
easily<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.259> now<00:02:03.009> to<00:02:03.069> create<00:02:03.310> legs<00:02:03.789> I'm<00:02:04.179> just

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
easily and now to create legs I'm just

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.449 
easily and now to create legs I'm just
going<00:02:04.539> to<00:02:04.599> extend<00:02:04.899> the<00:02:05.409> bottom<00:02:05.799> of<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> mesh

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459 
going to extend the bottom of the mesh

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.219 
going to extend the bottom of the mesh
by<00:02:06.819> drawing<00:02:07.149> another<00:02:07.539> mask<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:08.049> you'll

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
by drawing another mask now you'll

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.410 
by drawing another mask now you'll
notice<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:08.679> nothing<00:02:08.920> happened<00:02:09.519> this<00:02:10.239> is

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
notice that nothing happened this is

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.000 
notice that nothing happened this is
because<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.869> mesh<00:02:11.080> of<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.380> center<00:02:11.680> of<00:02:11.769> shadow

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
because the mesh of the center of shadow

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.100 
because the mesh of the center of shadow
box<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.519> the<00:02:12.610> intersection<00:02:13.360> of<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:14.080> two

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
box is the intersection of the two

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.339 
box is the intersection of the two
members<00:02:14.830> so<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.280> have<00:02:15.519> to<00:02:15.700> extend<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.840> mask<00:02:17.079> on

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
members so I have to extend the mask on

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.770 
members so I have to extend the mask on
the<00:02:17.440> back<00:02:17.620> down<00:02:18.099> to<00:02:18.610> make<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> legs<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.599> as

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
the back down to make the legs now as

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.080 
the back down to make the legs now as
you<00:02:19.870> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.560> have<00:02:21.310> these<00:02:21.519> leg<00:02:21.819> shaped

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you can see I have these leg shaped

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:31.050 
you can see I have these leg shaped
coming<00:02:22.510> down<00:02:27.359> and<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.590> could<00:02:29.859> just<00:02:30.040> hold<00:02:30.190> ctrl<00:02:30.790> +

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
coming down and I could just hold ctrl +

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.569 
coming down and I could just hold ctrl +
alt<00:02:31.329> again<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:32.530> just<00:02:32.769> cut<00:02:32.980> away<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.400> middle

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579 
alt again to just cut away the middle

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.030 
alt again to just cut away the middle

back<00:03:54.770> view<00:03:55.040> I'll<00:03:55.280> draw<00:03:55.550> another<00:03:55.580> rectangle

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
back view I'll draw another rectangle

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.320 
back view I'll draw another rectangle
which<00:03:56.690> will<00:03:56.900> constrain<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:57.560> size<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:58.760> what<00:03:59.300> I

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
which will constrain the size to what I

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.660 
which will constrain the size to what I
need<00:03:59.450> for<00:03:59.810> my<00:03:59.870> cushion<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:01.130> there<00:04:01.340> I<00:04:01.370> have<00:04:01.640> my

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
need for my cushion and there I have my

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.210 
need for my cushion and there I have my
couch<00:04:02.600> with<00:04:02.900> a<00:04:02.990> back<00:04:03.230> cushion<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.770> armrests

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
couch with a back cushion and armrests

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.580 
couch with a back cushion and armrests
and<00:04:04.580> I'll<00:04:05.270> turn<00:04:05.510> off<00:04:05.720> shadow<00:04:06.020> box<00:04:06.320> and

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
and I'll turn off shadow box and

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.650 
and I'll turn off shadow box and
transparency<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.550> now<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.150> can<00:04:08.360> see<00:04:08.510> the

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
transparency and now you can see the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.680 
transparency and now you can see the
completed<00:04:09.080> couch<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.820> that's<00:04:10.970> the<00:04:11.090> basics<00:04:11.570> of

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
completed couch and that's the basics of

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.600 
completed couch and that's the basics of
working<00:04:11.870> shadow<00:04:12.260> box<00:04:12.530> obviously<00:04:13.370> you<00:04:13.459> can

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
working shadow box obviously you can

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.699 
working shadow box obviously you can
come<00:04:13.820> up<00:04:13.940> with<00:04:14.090> your<00:04:14.300> own<00:04:14.470> shapes<00:04:15.470> that<00:04:15.650> are

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
come up with your own shapes that are

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.530 
come up with your own shapes that are
much<00:04:15.980> much<00:04:16.220> more<00:04:16.430> complex<00:04:16.970> than<00:04:17.209> the<00:04:17.299> couch

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
much much more complex than the couch

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.270 
much much more complex than the couch
but<00:04:18.140> this<00:04:18.290> is<00:04:18.500> just<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.799> simple<00:04:19.100> demonstration

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
but this is just a simple demonstration

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.070 
but this is just a simple demonstration
and<00:04:19.790> give<00:04:19.910> an<00:04:20.000> idea<00:04:20.390> of<00:04:20.989> how<00:04:21.170> shadow<00:04:21.470> box<00:04:21.739> works
