00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.780
 Fernando GÃ³mez will be the national director 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:12.380
 of the radio and friendship as red he had 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.050
 your private home before taking the 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.270
 position of the presidency was to average 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.640
 block from the church where he lived 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.880
 father grassi smiths way he knew 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.789
 those priests of them used 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.130
 with the first authorizations so that 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:30.950
 Give Rafael a minute 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.590
 every day when I arrived in Bogota 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.720
 and he is in Bogota because he had 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.370
 removed from here because they said no 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.920
 he was communist 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.290
 and why do you think the beginning here in Cali 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.930
 you think that nothing declared exit that was 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.830
 where I want to hear him by lightning that 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.630
 a ministry of honesty will be established 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.780
 that he would convince everyone 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.760
 Colombians to be honorable me in the in 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.860
 what I have the minute knowledge 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.920
 of God since I was very little what 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.730
 I saw before the news with a ruana 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.880
 behind him there was a wooden cross 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:11.150
 gave biblical parts it was always for the 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 love and family bonding all 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.220
 Colombians we must assume an attitude 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.890
 of solidarity with colombia charity 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.190
 of cundinamarca offered to the father 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.560
 rafael soon soon after 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.290
 start the program offered him a 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
 sponsorship the father rafael said by 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.750
 television that had received a thousand 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:36.410
 five hundred pesos and that he did not need 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:40.310
 that money to live for that he was going to 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.920
 distribute those 1,500 pesos in three 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 portions and that he 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.660
 to three poor families all 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.910
 Colombians we must collaborate in this 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.010
 emergency and on the third night he said 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.840
 Well, I gave everything I had 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.180
 received 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.849
 I hope the next month when I 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.739
 again give may repeat the same 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:05.930
 action but the next day in the morning 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.510
 He arrived at his office in the parish in 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.760
 the anguish a woman and the father 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.480
 discreetly he said that by his attire and 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.910
 by his way of being it was perceived that 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.459
 she was a woman who worked in trades 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.310
 nocturnal and the woman told him father here 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:26.390
 I bring you another 1500 pesos so that 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:28.610
 you can give me an amount equal to 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.370
 other three families is to highlight that 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 the minute of God has given help to more than 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.550
 ten thousand homes throughout colombia 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.340
 and this has been very beneficial for all the 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.830
 less favored class has been built 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.680
 homes have been improved many others and 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.530
 Some 350 thousand people have benefited 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.730
 many Colombians what we mean by 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.890
 reality does not give us television 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.140
 Then Father Rafael GarcÃ­a Herreros 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.540
 wants to participate in that reality and 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.030
 clear they find on television a 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.100
 open road although father rafael 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.630
 understands that to make society 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.790
 one can not despise anyone sometimes 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.740
 we make television spaces marginalizing 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.870
 people sometimes we make spaces 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.550
 television believing that we are the voices 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.140
 of the truth and that we do not have 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.940
 nothing to see the workshop is rafael we 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.890
 taught that to make television we have 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.570
 what to buy with everyone and always 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:22.640
 it seemed cute no thing 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:24.890
 extraordinary of all life in front 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.470
 of his minute Father GarcÃ­a Herreros 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.420
 reached such popularity that even 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.710
 He managed to get the dreadful Pablo Escobar 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.530
 will deliver to justice 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:35.690
 in order to have lasted more than 50 years 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.670
 for having achieved that many stingy 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.070
 this country pay one million pesos for 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.780
 a broth and because it has given home to 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.240
 thousands of families 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.190
 know that the minute of God is not only 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.560
 the oldest program but the most 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.840
 important of Colombian television 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.540
 I liked everything 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.860
 to banquets with the queens 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.050
 of beauty all everything 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.270
 What I liked most about the minute of 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.870
 God is the social work that has come 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.939
 performing at the level of the entire territory 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.919
 national and why you like to see it because 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.319
 you never miss it, not me, always 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.849
 I sit there and I love to hear me 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.280
 love to see the meo father who has made me 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.110
 a very beautiful thing and the aura so 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.960
 beautiful that makes me believe that magic 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.819
 of the minute God is first in the 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.860
 remain in the witnessing of the 

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:25.509
 construction of country in the witness 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.969
 of the construction of society I believe 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:30.909
 that that's the first thing the second has been 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:32.199
 always a synthetic exercise and in a 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:33.789
 country where we are used to 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:34.960
 long speeches where I was 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.150
 used to having people talk and 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.849
 talk and talk to meet a 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.800
 chiquitito testimony I think it has been 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.710
 effective and I think it has been effective in 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.180
 that way the Christian participates in the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:51.910
 community and does not feel isolated and 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:56.350
 carefree of others 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:06:00.360
 my god in your hands we place this day 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.360
 that has already happened and the night arrives 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.350
 ah
