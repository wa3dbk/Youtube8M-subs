00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.070
 My name is Karina and to me 10 in place. 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:27.449
 like popcorn made the coffee rate the place 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.640
 where I can come relax sit and have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.610
 my time to have tea to eat the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.000
 cake talk to my friends 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 so there is a time is my time of 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.379
 rest and peace and fun so one day 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.620
 that does not worry that I can come 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.250
 here and do not think about anything and nothing much 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.160
 Really 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 You can come here from morning to 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.660
 taking the city seems to turn if 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.510
 lunch you can come here but in the afternoon 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:59.010
 To have tea with cake with friends. 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.629
 It turned out to be the one I had already 11 days 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.550
 I want something who had the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.000
 warranty belly with something 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.000
 I already know where it operates one day. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.460
 it still looks like a doll's house 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.189
 I say it's full it 's all decked out. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.670
 This is how some people can do 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.439
 no access but for me it's for me you're not 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.470
 for me it's that thing that we have 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.479
 will adorn the spruce and effect 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.820
 never too much and he always changes 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.100
 decoration it always changes some things 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.450
 have the pictures on display also 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.159
 always change 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.080
 the bottom is more afraid and in the 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.830
 the top has some sofas that can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.959
 sit and relax but it is quietly 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.610
 yes it 's like in the room in your 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.159
 living room just like with your friends 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.560
 eating drinking and talking a lot 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.970
 Yummy, it feels like you're at home. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.970
 but the case is super-decorated 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.940
 bush 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.289
 change that I had during 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.270
 already started before the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 exchange program because I took the time to 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.720
 plan to see 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.190
 so when I walk I saw when 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.890
 I arrived in danbury 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.110
 I wanted to escape from the traditional of that 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.120
 that I already had Brazil did not break a 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.260
 coffee as I have in my city is a 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.239
 place that I always say I could not 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.569
 I was at what hours and hours by car from 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.040
 agreement because my place here think it's 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.840
 a bar that reflects the quality of life I 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.190
 I mean in the wheel when he came back 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.180
 Brazil do its best to find a 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.680
 picturesque place so cute it seems 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.030
 doll cart 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.030
 as well as bodies
