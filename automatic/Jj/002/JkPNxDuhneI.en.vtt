00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.140
 in this video we will calculate all the 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.140
 dividers 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.650
 of 60 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.090
 for this we express 60 as a product 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.090
 prime factors 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.550
 60 we break it down 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.250
 how they finish 0 is divisible by two they 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.650
 sat between two is 30 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.170
 as cancer or is visible by 230 between 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.560
 2 is 15 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:44.410
 156 is divisible by 315 between 35 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:49.270
 51 where 60 would be 2 squared 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.270
 by three and by five 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:56.590
 we can also write this as 2 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:01:00.620
 squared by 3 raised to 1 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:05.890
 by 5 raised to 1 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.890
 then it is true that all divisor 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.549
 of 60 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:19.819
 is expressed in the form 2 ^ x by 3 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:22.230
 raised ai by 5 high az where x is 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:25.380
 a value less than or equal to 2 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.570
 is a less natural value less or 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.360
 same as 1 iceta its natural number 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.090
 less than or equal to 1 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.540
 then we have that x would belong to 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.020
 set 0 1 2 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:45.300
 and the set 01 would belong 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:47.580
 iceta would belong to set 01 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.510
 then the possibilities for x would be 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.510
 0 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.610
 one 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.610
 and 2 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.820
 given a value of x the y varies 0 1 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.360
 0 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.360
 one 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.330
 but 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.330
 one 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.890
 01 this stops and now the z for 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.890
 any value of xl between 0 and 1 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.450
 one 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.250
 one 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 0 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.700
 one 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.069
 one 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.069
 0 1 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.590
 and 01 then we have 000 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.150
 001 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:50.630
 0 10 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.790
 0 1 1 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.160
 00 the first element is the exponent 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.000
 of 2 the second is the exponent of 3 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:06.170
 third exponents of 5 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.170
 here is the 1 0 0 1 0 1 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.819
 10 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.970
 0 0 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.010
 0 1 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.160
 10 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.830
 and 211 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:31.580
 you get here 2 raised to 0 x 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:35.690
 3 raised to zero by 5 high 02 a 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:39.170
 braceros one by one by one this is 1 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.450
 first divisor that we get from 60 of 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.700
 that we will have 2 high 0 by three 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.470
 raised 0 by 5 raised to 1 that would be 5 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:53.020
 all raised 0 by 3 raised to 1 by 5 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.950
 elevated to zero stress 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.240
 20 by three elevated 1 by 5 raised to 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.180
 115 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.430
 2 raised 1 by 3 will be done for 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:10.410
 50 which is 22 high 1 by 3 high 0 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:16.130
 by 5 high 1 which is 10 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:19.730
 2 raised 1 by 3 raised 1 by 5 206 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.360
 21 by 3 raised 1 by 5 raised to 1 that 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.360
 it's 30 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:31.389
 2 raised to 2 x 3 high 0 by 5 042 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:34.680
 raised to 2 by 5 by 3 raised to 0 by 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.680
 5 raised to 1 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:45.210
 two elevated by three raised to zero 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:48.720
 by 5 raised to 14 by 5 20 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:52.020
 2 high 2 by 3 high one by five 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.349
 raised 0 that would be 12 finally 2 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.590
 raised two by three raised one by 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:05:07.770
 five raised to one that is left 4 by 3 12 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:10.910
 for 560 and these 15 3 15 2 16 34 20 12 60 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.539
 they are the set of all the divisors 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.539
 in 60
