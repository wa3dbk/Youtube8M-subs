during the year

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.460 
during the year
now<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> soaked<00:00:22.260> this<00:00:23.100> root<00:00:23.779> for<00:00:24.779> about<00:00:24.960> 20

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
now I soaked this root for about 20

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.259 
now I soaked this root for about 20
minutes<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:27.019> water<00:00:28.039> there's<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> weird<00:00:29.550> growth

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
minutes in water there's a weird growth

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.860

and<00:00:34.309> then<00:00:36.290> dig<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> hole<00:00:38.870> if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.989> look<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and then dig a hole if you look at the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.910 
and then dig a hole if you look at the
raspberry<00:00:41.149> plant<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.780> don't<00:00:42.809> want<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.350> cover

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
raspberry plant you don't want to cover

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.510 
raspberry plant you don't want to cover
it<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:44.879> dirt<00:00:45.180> about<00:00:45.719> right<00:00:45.989> here<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it up here with dirt about right here is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.540 
it up here with dirt about right here is
how<00:00:47.730> far<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> plant<00:00:49.079> these

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
how far you want to plant these

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.799 
how far you want to plant these
raspberry<00:00:50.550> plants<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.539> go<00:00:51.809> too<00:00:52.410> deep<00:00:53.809> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
raspberry plants don't go too deep and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.770 
raspberry plants don't go too deep and
they<00:00:54.960> say<00:00:55.789> about<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> foot<00:00:57.210> foot<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.690> half

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
they say about a foot foot and a half

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
they say about a foot foot and a half
apart<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:59.309> do<00:01:01.280> spread

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.660 

then<00:01:07.080> once<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.470> get<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> planted<00:01:08.400> you're

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then once you get it planted you're

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.100 
then once you get it planted you're
going<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.360> water<00:01:11.090> first<00:01:12.090> cat<00:01:12.420> go<00:01:12.630> pack

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
and then I already prune this one but if

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.910 
and then I already prune this one but if
there's<00:01:33.060> dead<00:01:33.750> growth<00:01:34.109> like<00:01:34.500> I'll<00:01:34.649> show<00:01:34.679> you

there's dead growth like I'll show you
over<00:01:35.250> here<00:01:36.770> all<00:01:37.770> these<00:01:38.189> raspberries<00:01:38.909> need<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
over here all these raspberries need to

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.520 
over here all these raspberries need to
be<00:01:39.990> pruned<00:01:40.289> yet<00:01:41.450> before<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.719> growth<00:01:43.140> comes

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
growing all by itself I like to see that

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.730 
growing all by itself I like to see that
because<00:04:09.600> those<00:04:09.780> are<00:04:09.930> kind<00:04:10.170> of<00:04:10.230> free<00:04:10.530> plants<00:04:11.510> in
