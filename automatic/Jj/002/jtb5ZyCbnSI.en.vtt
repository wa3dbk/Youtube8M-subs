00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.679
 in this lesson i will show you how to do 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.530
 the response loop on the right is used in 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.190
 work skol pleshtek active loop 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:21.970
 top right put a pin and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:23.769
 hang two pairs of bobbins and start 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.759
 weave as usual with a dots 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:30.569
 began to weave Perevi match interrupt 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.640
 weave every time after this operation 

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:37.840
 pull up translate weave pull up 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:42.840
 Perevi bowls tighten pour Christie 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:47.699
 pull up and carry out the bag 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.699
 but the intersection with the point. 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.149
 schematically denotes from the wine 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:57.510
 loop is a great loop for 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.510
 lace decoration for trellis decoration 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 when a long eyelet on the right for u 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.550
 to make her take a couple 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.050
 which is closer to the drain 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.240
 we take a pair of loops in the left hand 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:17.860
 right hand we take a pin pin 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.710
 is brought under the extreme thread hooks 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.550
 the tip of the second thread and pulls it 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.080
 out 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:29.530
 then the tip tightens the outermost thread 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:33.030
 hooks and and tip and pulls 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 up into the noose formed and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.680
 pin is inserted drawn point 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 strings are tightened extreme thread 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.080
 tighten the length of the eyelet and the second 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.150
 thread tightens the thread on the eyelet 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.870
 when we pulled the loop made 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.940
 little continue to weave again translate 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.280
 list 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.400
 translate 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 and the amount of a little pull up to perform 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:21.560
 wand and before crossing the next 2 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:28.250
 drink this pin we bring to the extreme 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.760
 thread capture the second tip 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.480
 pins pick up the thread 1 bobbin 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.470
 and pull it into a loop set in 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:47.500
 bench hole and pull up 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.500
 weave yurevich weave and pull up again 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.069
 in the place where we did the blame 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.579
 loops do not break it 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.530
 also keeps going smoothly 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.320
 if you have it still does not get something 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.620
 train lash should not change 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.920
 together tween loops so we came 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.390
 before the next loop do again 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:25.430
 the pin is fed under the first string 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:28.910
 grabs the second tip pulls out 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.829
 extreme whooping point each thread bobbins and 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.750
 displayed in the loop 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.380
 put in the dot and pull up very 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.170
 conveniently 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.220
 learn to do bulk that's all for her 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.500
 fat plate 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.730
 the thread does not move away does not leave immediately 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.470
 pulls up ie you need to work 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.690
 tide and then already on others 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.690
 the threads you learn zi makes it easier 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.250
 learning to answer again 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.210
 the pin will be let down 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.410
 seized the second picked up the extreme and 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:08.710
 pulled her out 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.710
 here's a pin in the loop 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:16.640
 you can pull the strings they will 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.920
 play hurray align smoothly do 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.480
 loop 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:24.400
 same size so that they cost 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.170
 get you out 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.130
 pleshka to be flat and again 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.430
 continue to weave on skolku can 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.370
 weave a small length of 20 centimeters 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.310
 only three cups if you do not work 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.280
 at this distance , some do 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.980
 again if you donâ€™t want to break away 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.890
 around the cushion weave this whip 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.320
 put the veins at its discretion can 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.630
 they are very often put the main thing that they 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.880
 you got exactly the same and 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:58.690
 plethes all over was 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.690
 smooth
