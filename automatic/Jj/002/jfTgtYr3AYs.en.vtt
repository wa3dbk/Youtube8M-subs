we<00:00:02.520> believe<00:00:02.820> technology<00:00:03.030> is<00:00:03.689> at<00:00:04.080> its<00:00:04.230> very

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
we believe technology is at its very

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.270 
we believe technology is at its very
best<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:05.430> it's<00:00:05.580> invisible<00:00:07.160> when<00:00:08.160> you're

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
best and it's invisible when you're

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.759 
best and it's invisible when you're
conscious<00:00:08.730> only<00:00:08.849> of<00:00:09.150> what<00:00:09.360> you're<00:00:09.480> doing<00:00:09.840> not

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
conscious only of what you're doing not

conscious only of what you're doing not
the<00:00:10.830> device<00:00:11.250> you're<00:00:11.429> doing<00:00:11.670> it<00:00:11.790> with<00:00:11.969> an<00:00:13.009> iPad

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the device you're doing it with an iPad

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.330 
the device you're doing it with an iPad
is<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.400> perfect<00:00:15.120> expression<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.990> idea

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
is the perfect expression of that idea

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.700 
is the perfect expression of that idea
it's<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.760> magical<00:00:18.330> pane<00:00:18.510> of<00:00:18.660> glass<00:00:18.710> it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
it's just this magical pane of glass it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.230 
it's just this magical pane of glass it
can<00:00:19.890> become<00:00:20.130> anything<00:00:20.430> you<00:00:20.609> want<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.090> be

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
can become anything you want it to be

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.939 
can become anything you want it to be
and<00:00:22.880> that's<00:00:23.880> why<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.330> many<00:00:24.420> people<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.830> many

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
and that's why so many people in so many

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.550 
and that's why so many people in so many
different<00:00:26.189> places<00:00:26.460> are<00:00:27.090> using<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.380> so

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
different places are using it for so

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
different places are using it for so
many<00:00:28.619> different<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:29.630> it's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.750> more

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
many different things it's a more

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
many different things it's a more
personal<00:00:30.960> experience<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:32.040> technology<00:00:32.160> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.600 
so when you enhance the display you
enhance<00:01:24.170> everything<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.280> Retina

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
enhance everything and the Retina
