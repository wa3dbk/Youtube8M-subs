00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.450 
ponytails often times make the wig caps
tighter<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.409> this<00:01:43.590> will<00:01:43.799> loosen<00:01:43.950> up<00:01:44.250> some

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460

space<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.930> dent<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.409> because<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070

smaller head and my hair isn't very long
or<00:01:49.320> thick<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.490> rearranged<00:01:51.000> my<00:01:51.180> hair<00:01:51.390> a

or thick so I just rearranged my hair a
bit<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.840> stuffed<00:01:52.170> some<00:01:52.470> tissue<00:01:52.710> under<00:01:53.189> the

bit and stuffed some tissue under the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.240 
bit and stuffed some tissue under the
wig<00:01:53.490> cap<00:01:53.520> before<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.180> put<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.450> on<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:55.250> you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
wig cap before I put it back on if you

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.950

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hair is really long or thick and you

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520

can't get the wig over your head very
well<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.520> recommend<00:02:02.850> braiding<00:02:03.390> your<00:02:03.540> hair

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
in at least two different areas and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.100

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
wrapping them around your head so that

it's dispersed evenly

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.819
