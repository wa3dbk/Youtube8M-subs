00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello to all and inco futes I hope 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.130
 that you're fine 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 we are now finally here for the 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.389
 return of fifa 14 season 2 experience and 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.650
 specifically for episode 6 but 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.580
 before starting this episode I 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.799
 would like to thank very warmly 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.599
 to help him this world who decided 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.430
 to stop falling is to give me like 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.380
 you see it on the screen 105,000 credit 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.000
 thank you very much to you and thank you very much to 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.990
 you generally whenever 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.430
 you make even the slightest 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.890
 which allows me to propose you 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.359
 even more big players and you 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.250
 present even more beautiful teams 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.840
 and precisely perfect transition thanks 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.309
 especially at his one hundred thousand credit I 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.630
 could pay me the legend 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.100
 campbell soil so why throw a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.600
 legend and well just I 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.610
 decided to incorporate a new concept 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.989
 in tfe a concept that I will try to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 do it once or twice a week that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.290
 is actually a mix between two ideas all 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.360
 first the main goal will be to 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.059
 test all legends 2 fifa 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.860
 ultimate team 14 in ascending order 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.449
 that is to say the smallest general ground 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.579
 campbell to the bigger general the king 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.170
 peeled and I will incorporate these legends a 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.940
 by one in teams with whom 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.949
 I will only play in season so 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.260
 the second goal will be to go up 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.640
 division to climb the ladder with 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.100
 growing legends for at 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 final win division one with the king 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.740
 bare 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.180
 so first legend that I'm testing 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.010
 first team that I build around 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.080
 of campbell ground English who did 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.479
 part of the victorious team in 2003 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 2004 of arsenal that had managed to stay 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.869
 undefeated for a whole season 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.460
 whole we know how it is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.680
 difficult so I integrated campbell ground 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.939
 in a 4-4-2 a bpl because that's 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.740
 difficult to incorporate legends 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.939
 English in something else than a bpl 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.110
 but all the better that will allow me to 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.700
 test some big players 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.439
 so you've seen the defense enough 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.540
 classic joe hart in cages gary cahill 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.280
 in defense micah richards right I the 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.780
 prefer to walker because he is very 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.369
 very good defensively leighton baines 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.780
 a little disappointment I find it is 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.520
 very expensive for the little yield he 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.290
 a and only Belgian camp I will tell you 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.210
 at the end of video for me2 for you 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.380
 to forgive my impressions on this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.479
 player we pass in the middle 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.040
 with scott parker central middle to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.509
 defensive vocation I loved in 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.340
 the older generation I like it just as much 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.780
 he is keen ball with very good foot 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.149
 technically and very good defensively 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 by his side the playmaker david silva 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 because of these contributions I find 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.060
 that in central medium he does not give the 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.530
 all of its potential it would be 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.149
 best in central offensive midfielder 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.649
 the crazy touch of this team 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.629
 it's nani the manchester portuguese 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.039
 united and his 5 stars gestures 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.180
 techniques but the best player of 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.250
 this team remains 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.810
 without discussion eden hazard that was 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.129
 decisive in this episode and yet 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.569
 you will see that at the front posts there 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.829
 has two big players but for me eden 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.310
 chance this is the best player of this 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.870
 team 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.010
 as I told you at the forefront 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.069
 big players both Mancunians 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.810
 sergio kun agÃ¼ero the little argentin of 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.129
 manchester city I put them left 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.519
 because he is right-handed and van persie 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.469
 the great manchester player united the 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.819
 tall dutch with his left foot to 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:37.439
 right like that he can transplant to 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.120
 inside this team is very 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.129
 complementary to the image of his two 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.959
 scorers so we're going to split 10 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.519
 because now I'm on xbox 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.810
 so I go back to division 10 but so 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.489
 the better it will allow me to you 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.560
 propose this concept in its entirety 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.650
 from division 10 to division one 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.689
 without them without pause without anything and 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.329
 right from the first match we see 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.459
 that nani with a mix between the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.760
 technique of luck and cold blood 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.260
 in front of the goal scored a magnificent goal at 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.090
 the entrance to the surface a strike at the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.069
 following some dribbling so first 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.989
 purpose in this concept first goals in 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.000
 division 10 it will have to wait until the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.419
 88th minute to create a second 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.609
 opportunity 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.260
 it's a hazard that will decide to start 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.060
 to highlight a magnificent 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.129
 action that leads to a beautiful goal 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.750
 so 2 goal at 0 it's too much for my 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.190
 opponent who decide to quit quit and 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.959
 so we take our first three points 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.220
 in division say our first three 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.019
 points in this new concept and thanks 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 to this victory we unlock all 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.109
 manager tasks which allows me to go 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.060
 look for my pack that is reserved for me 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.470
 heard I would have nothing at all in this 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.629
 pack it does not matter we leave ball in 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.459
 head in this new concept in division 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.889
 The second match is against a 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.359
 beautiful team a 4-3-3 false number 9 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.359
 around their division and the liga 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.040
 bbva with leader of this team 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.750
 carlos vela booth so a very very 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.759
 beautiful team and yet from the 19th 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.470
 wonderful minute a two between eden 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:54.090
 chance and david silva eden hazard who 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.040
 fits in the field oriented a 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.569
 hook a strike unfortunately that 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.879
 will be the left foot is pushed back 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:02.159
 by the goalkeeper we stay at 0-0 again 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:04.019
 in a tight match you have to wait until the 70th 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.819
 minute so that eden hazard still him 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:08.400
 again and again he decidedly it's 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.259
 his episode dribble you'll see everything 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.970
 the world on his left side gives the 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:13.199
 balloon end hero aguero a hook in 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.489
 first intention he has a lot of 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:16.680
 chance to get the ball back he gets 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.239
 found alone in front of the keeper inside 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.750
 the right foot is done in full 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.729
 skylight 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.430
 Gorgeous hitting is beautiful goal 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.990
 so greenhouse due to the costs 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.030
 ayrault that allows me to win this 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.919
 match a game rather dominated but enough 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.690
 tight you saw him at the level of 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.009
 statistics so six points in two 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.990
 matches it's not bad we'll try to 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.460
 aim for nine points in three matches 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.080
 it will be the last match of this episode 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.000
 we fall against a nice bpl with 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.680
 especially lukaku benteke who will have to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.389
 beware of these two players in the 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.280
 offensive sector but from the first 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.680
 minutes we go into total football mode 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.090
 a succession of passes in one or two 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.660
 ball keys to go up very very 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.009
 quickly the ball 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.229
 we see that the hit of benz was 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.240
 repulsed but van persie followed well 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.729
 and push the ball into the net 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.830
 I lead 1 goal to 0 from 6 16th 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.419
 minute sorry and only five minutes 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.160
 later he's a friend to put himself in 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.539
 light a beautiful stop in turn for 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.470
 illuminate his direct opponent but 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:03.979
 you will see that he is not going 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.900
 stop there 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.580
 a roulette a double contact a 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.770
 second caster a magnificent strike 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.080
 from the outside of the wrong right foot 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.000
 the goalkeeper the ball is in the bottom of 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.830
 nets in the small net precisely 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.750
 from goal to zero from that moment on 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:19.099
 I felt pretty safe but soon 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.479
 the commitment that will follow I'm going to 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:22.400
 take a case here so what is this 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:23.630
 that a case here simply when 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.919
 commitment makes you a pass in 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:27.169
 withdrawal wants to launch deep into your 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:28.610
 attacker who finds himself alone in front of 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:29.930
 goalkeeper who scores the goal on this 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.060
 action my opponent still had 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.770
 a lot of luck but it's like that 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.139
 two nozzles 1 there will be a small 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.430
 reaction of pride in the 75th minute 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.130
 and who better to lead this 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.690
 reaction that eden hazard to close this 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.340
 episode you see a magnificent 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.690
 footwork neither sincere in 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.400
 the focus of the field a double contact a 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.099
 beautiful shot in the small net that 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.949
 does 3 busin and this will be the final score 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.750
 so we ensure our maintenance in 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:55.430
 division 9 and in the next episode 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.400
 with a brand new legend 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.840
 we will try to ensure the title good on 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.030
 the insured fairly easily 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.220
 So I'm not too worried 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.080
 little assessment of this team but 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.610
