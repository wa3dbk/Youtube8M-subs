00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi girls from avenues to my channel yo 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.240
 I am anabel and in this video we are going to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.580
 talk about what streaming is like 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.889
 So much sounds around there is all for 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.070
 instagram so if you want to know about 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:19.109
 what is it they want to know this video and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.100
 good the technique of electrobeach is based 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 in illuminating the face to a maximum level 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.070
 so to speak this makeup does not carry 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.380
 nothing of outline does not take anything of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.230
 bronzer is simply illuminating and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.870
 blogs by word for this tutorial I'm going to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.260
 use 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.470
 Illuminator of shapes and in the tone 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.040
 my email 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:50.240
 and that's how it's like vanilla tone 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.240
 pretty uphill 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.110
 and well basically let's light up what 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.239
 which is the upper part of the cheekbone below 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.030
 where is the normal contour that 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:05.089
 we make ourselves we will illuminate the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.700
 chin between the eyebrows on top of the arch 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:11.960
 from the eyebrow the tip of the nose the bow 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 of cupid and the lacrimal and eye of the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.380
 eyebrow 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.830
 and I'm going to use it in the reader knicks 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.750
 what is the control 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.070
 praxis 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.630
 so as I say, let's light up 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.630
 the highest part of the town 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's light up too 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.930
 under where we apply the contour 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.930
 usually 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.270
 we are also going to illuminate the 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.270
 between the eyebrows 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.450
 a total madness because apart always 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.439
 has to put action will still live 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.439
 talking but good 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.460
 and illuminate what is the tip 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.400
 the cupid's bow 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.250
 and the chin 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.400
 under the eyebrows 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.280
 will 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.590
 on top of the jungle arch 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.549
 and well then we're just going to 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:49.010
 Apply the blush in an ascending way 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.010
 below where we apply the illuminator 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.140
 use this valmy which is in the tone 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.020
 apply 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.150
 and I'm going to use my brochita de real 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.150
 techniques the plus bros 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.829
 and well that's basically the loss 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.500
 is it illuminates almost the whole face with 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.090
 this mind 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.489
 Y 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.670
 not bad, the truth is that there is no 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.950
 bad but as I do not have oily skin if 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:34.040
 they will take me away like knowing this when 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.560
 start to leave all that speed 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.750
 for now it knows very well and really that 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.000
 the technique is not bad for example for 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.049
 take some photos and such but 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.180
 process it during the day 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.650
 I definitely do not think it's a 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.579
 good idea 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.280
 and maybe the normal skin girl 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.950
 about them works very well and I think that 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.430
 This is much better for girls 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.760
 that are not so white because 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.150
 less sometimes I like to apply not 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.000
 both outline but bronzer for 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.000
 do not see me so pale then 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.980
 it's weird weird after having us 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.440
 used to doing a bit of contour 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.590
 Thank you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.049
 but in my opinion it's really a 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.860
 technique 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:26.830
 pretty and looks more natural than when 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.889
 we see the girls with their cotton coconut 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:32.259
 so everything depends on you in my 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.590
 really, I recommend this 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:39.500
 Normal illuminator is a powder format 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.300
 and what I like is that it has brightness 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.310
 but I also feel that it is magnificent 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.070
 because it's like if combined as 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.990
 compact powder as an illuminator so 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.030
 for real oily skin that I feel that 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.590
 works 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.800
 good girls I hope you liked it 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.970
 this video if you perform this technique 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.370
 let me know an agent algorithm 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.320
 you to see them and give them line 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.760
 and good if you have any questions or 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.410
 suggestion or comment they forget 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.350
 leave it here below and we are seeing 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:08.300
 in a next video trocha the girls 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.310
 welcome to my channel I am anabel and 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.610
 I have a lot of time with now two 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.560
 videos I've been very busy I've had 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.500
 a lot of work and when finally 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.970
 record me sick average terrible flu 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.280
 I could not talk so I'm still a 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.230
 little bit hoarse but good here we go today 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.650
 I bring you a super special fear and it is 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.650
