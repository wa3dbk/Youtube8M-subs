and the leanness above half throttle and
get<00:01:49.819> a<00:01:49.879> little<00:01:50.090> extra<00:01:50.390> boost<00:01:50.539> of<00:01:50.750> fuel<00:01:50.959> up

get a little extra boost of fuel up
there<00:01:51.349> and<00:01:51.860> I<00:01:51.950> used<00:01:52.129> a<00:01:52.220> craft<00:01:52.489> power<00:01:52.759> dial<00:01:53.060> in

there and I used a craft power dial in
order<00:01:53.599> to<00:01:53.660> control<00:01:53.989> the<00:01:54.050> power<00:01:54.349> valve<00:01:54.619> which<00:01:55.250> I

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
order to control the power valve which I

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.490 
order to control the power valve which I
then<00:01:55.640> can<00:01:55.849> adjust<00:01:56.209> stop<00:01:56.840> pull<00:01:57.080> up<00:01:57.200> side<00:01:57.379> of<00:01:57.440> the

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
then can adjust stop pull up side of the

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.559 
then can adjust stop pull up side of the
track<00:01:57.769> and<00:01:58.550> increase<00:01:58.849> the<00:01:59.000> preload<00:01:59.300> on<00:01:59.330> the

you leave it on the part of other than
that<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:02.929> all<00:02:03.140> I<00:02:03.200> did<00:02:03.349> to<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.679> engine

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920

chassis I wanted the lower the rear of
the<00:02:07.459> bike<00:02:07.670> because<00:02:07.849> the<00:02:08.209> some<00:02:08.840> reason<00:02:09.110> the

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
the bike because the some reason the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.869 
the bike because the some reason the
two-stroke<00:02:09.649> seemed<00:02:09.890> really<00:02:10.220> high<00:02:10.399> even

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 
two-stroke seemed really high even

two-stroke seemed really high even
compared<00:02:11.209> to<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.390> four<00:02:11.599> strokes<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:12.110> know<00:02:12.440> they

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
compared to the four strokes I know they

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.949 
compared to the four strokes I know they
raise<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.129> engine<00:02:13.550> up<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.000> ground<00:02:14.450> height<00:02:14.720> is

much higher on the two-stroke than it is
on<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> four-stroke<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.140> very<00:02:19.040> few<00:02:19.280> companies

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
on the four-stroke so very few companies

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.630 
on the four-stroke so very few companies
made<00:02:20.030> longer<00:02:20.480> shock<00:02:21.050> linkages<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> 2015

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
made longer shock linkages for the 2015

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.270 
made longer shock linkages for the 2015
model<00:02:22.910> but<00:02:23.660> fast<00:02:23.930> way<00:02:24.170> built<00:02:24.470> one<00:02:24.680> mainly<00:02:25.129> for

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
model but fast way built one mainly for

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.369 
model but fast way built one mainly for
enduro<00:02:25.670> cross<00:02:25.760> riders<00:02:26.360> but<00:02:26.599> they<00:02:26.750> could<00:02:27.260> be

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
enduro cross riders but they could be

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:29.080 
enduro cross riders but they could be
adjusted<00:02:27.650> over<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.310> different<00:02:28.610> lengths<00:02:28.940> and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
adjusted over for different lengths and

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.520 
adjusted over for different lengths and
I<00:02:29.360> went<00:02:29.569> with<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.780> longest<00:02:30.200> length<00:02:30.349> two

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
I went with the longest length two

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.680 
I went with the longest length two
millimeters<00:02:31.040> longer<00:02:31.250> I<00:02:31.519> wanted<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.120> longer

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
millimeters longer I wanted the longer

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.210 
millimeters longer I wanted the longer
rear<00:02:32.900> end<00:02:33.140> make<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.709> little<00:02:33.920> stiffer

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
rear end make it a little stiffer

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.399 
rear end make it a little stiffer
initially<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.450> make<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.720> bike<00:02:35.900> lower<00:02:36.140> so

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
initially and to make the bike lower so

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.680 
initially and to make the bike lower so
I<00:02:36.440> can<00:02:36.620> slide<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.950> forks<00:02:37.250> up<00:02:37.540> it's<00:02:38.540> not

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
I can slide the forks up it's not

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.420 
I can slide the forks up it's not
critically<00:02:39.470> important<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.890> put<00:02:40.129> new<00:02:40.250> wheels

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
critically important to put new wheels

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.000 
critically important to put new wheels
on<00:02:40.730> a<00:02:40.760> KTM<00:02:40.970> they<00:02:41.360> come<00:02:41.540> with<00:02:41.690> billet<00:02:42.019> hubs<00:02:42.230> they

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
on a KTM they come with billet hubs they

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.949 
on a KTM they come with billet hubs they
have<00:02:43.190> XL<00:02:43.670> rims<00:02:43.940> it's<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.330> pretty<00:02:44.540> good<00:02:44.780> wheel

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
have XL rims it's a pretty good wheel

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:47.050 
have XL rims it's a pretty good wheel
but<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.260> needed<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.830> set<00:02:46.129> of<00:02:46.250> spare<00:02:46.489> wheels<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.030> I

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
but I needed a set of spare wheels so I

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.479 
but I needed a set of spare wheels so I
could<00:02:47.330> have<00:02:47.480> new<00:02:47.629> wheels<00:02:47.900> ready<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.980> for<00:02:49.129> me<00:02:49.280> I

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
could have new wheels ready and for me I

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.220 
could have new wheels ready and for me I
had<00:02:49.909> really<00:02:50.239> good<00:02:50.359> experience<00:02:50.810> with<00:02:50.930> tusk

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
had really good experience with tusk

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.739 
had really good experience with tusk
wheels<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:51.920> I've<00:02:52.459> been<00:02:52.670> iffy<00:02:53.090> about<00:02:53.120> really

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:53.749 
wheels and I've been iffy about really

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.780 
wheels and I've been iffy about really
cheap<00:02:54.019> wheels<00:02:54.379> because<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:55.129> blow

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
cheap wheels because you blow

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.000 
cheap wheels because you blow
the<00:02:56.120> spokes<00:02:56.510> could<00:02:56.780> come<00:02:57.050> loose<00:02:57.260> or<00:02:57.530> ribs<00:02:57.769> go

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
the spokes could come loose or ribs go

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.490 
the spokes could come loose or ribs go
flat<00:02:58.370> but<00:02:58.970> these<00:02:59.090> tusk<00:02:59.390> wheels<00:02:59.629> are<00:02:59.840> really

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
flat but these tusk wheels are really

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.410 
flat but these tusk wheels are really
good<00:03:00.680> wheels<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.190> the<00:03:01.250> price<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.180> just

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
good wheels for the price you know just

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.210 
good wheels for the price you know just
like<00:03:02.540> everybody<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.200> as<00:03:03.379> proud<00:03:03.620> of<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:04.129> know

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
like everybody I'm as proud of you know

like everybody I'm as proud of you know
the<00:03:04.610> bike<00:03:04.790> I<00:03:05.000> races<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.840> average<00:03:06.110> guy<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.379> so

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
the bike I races the average guy and so

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.890 
the bike I races the average guy and so
I<00:03:06.769> wanted<00:03:07.069> it<00:03:07.159> to<00:03:07.280> look<00:03:07.400> good<00:03:07.610> but<00:03:08.209> also<00:03:08.599> if<00:03:08.780> I'm

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I wanted it to look good but also if I'm

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.330 
I wanted it to look good but also if I'm
going<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.110> replace<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.530> part<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:10.040> want<00:03:10.280> to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
going to replace a part I want to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.979 
going to replace a part I want to
replace<00:03:10.610> with<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:10.879> part<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:11.299> does<00:03:11.510> something

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
replace with a part that does something

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.199 
replace with a part that does something
so<00:03:12.200> when<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:12.500> came<00:03:13.010> time<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.280> put<00:03:13.519> new<00:03:13.730> plastic

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
so when I came time to put new plastic

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.630 
so when I came time to put new plastic
on<00:03:14.390> my<00:03:14.510> bike<00:03:14.720> I<00:03:15.019> went<00:03:15.530> with<00:03:15.680> psycrow<00:03:16.099> power

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
on my bike I went with psycrow power

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.880 
on my bike I went with psycrow power
flow<00:03:16.970> plastic<00:03:17.480> not<00:03:18.019> just<00:03:18.290> because<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.709> looks

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
flow plastic not just because it looks

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.920 
flow plastic not just because it looks
nice<00:03:19.129> and<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.519> fits<00:03:19.760> well<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:20.540> because<00:03:20.780> it

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
nice and it fits well but because it

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.750 
nice and it fits well but because it
increases<00:03:21.260> the<00:03:21.440> air<00:03:21.590> flow<00:03:21.829> both<00:03:22.310> through<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
increases the air flow both through the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.850 
increases the air flow both through the
seat<00:03:23.000> into<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.390> airbox<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.140> through<00:03:24.709> the

probably<00:03:29.060> isn't<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.360> tougher<00:03:29.690> bike<00:03:29.870> to<00:03:30.049> put

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260

stuck<00:03:39.470> really<00:03:39.680> good<00:03:39.920> over<00:03:40.459> the<00:03:40.579> years<00:03:40.819> I've

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
stuck really good over the years I've

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.380 
stuck really good over the years I've
had<00:03:41.120> really<00:03:41.390> good<00:03:41.540> luck<00:03:41.930> with<00:03:42.470> n<00:03:42.709> K<00:03:42.950> SFX<00:03:43.910> triple
