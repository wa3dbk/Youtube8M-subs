there's<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.260> reason<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.680> use<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:25.040> you<00:03:26.040> know<00:03:26.190> the

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
there's a reason to use the you know the

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.080 
there's a reason to use the you know the
kind<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.600> role<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:28.080> where<00:03:28.500> I'm<00:03:28.620> going

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
kind of the role there where I'm going

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:49.430 
kind of the role there where I'm going
third<00:03:30.570> finger<00:03:30.840> at<00:03:31.050> same<00:03:31.350> time<00:03:47.990> so<00:03:48.990> that's<00:03:49.200> more

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
third finger at same time so that's more

00:03:49.440 --> 00:04:07.290 
third finger at same time so that's more
of<00:03:49.500> that<00:03:49.620> kind<00:03:49.920> of<00:03:50.070> right<00:03:50.520> hand<00:03:50.730> technique

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.270 

that's<00:04:08.300> all<00:04:08.510> you<00:04:08.810> just<00:04:09.470> basically<00:04:09.650> different

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
that's all you just basically different

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.619 
that's all you just basically different
small<00:04:11.090> tiny<00:04:11.330> rhythms<00:04:11.780> put<00:04:11.989> together<00:04:13.510> at<00:04:14.510> this

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:14.629 
small tiny rhythms put together at this

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.199 
small tiny rhythms put together at this
point<00:04:14.750> I'm<00:04:15.019> playing<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.349> full<00:04:15.760> C<00:04:16.760> major<00:04:16.910> Barre

chord the egg bread the court has been

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.840 
chord the egg bread the court has been
used<00:04:26.290> and<00:04:27.290> that's<00:04:27.530> another<00:04:27.830> technique<00:04:28.130> to<00:04:28.370> you

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
used and that's another technique to you

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.040 
used and that's another technique to you
play<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.389> low<00:04:29.570> bass<00:04:30.050> string<00:04:30.470> with<00:04:31.070> pick<00:04:32.050> and

play the low bass string with pick and

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.200 
play the low bass string with pick and
then<00:04:33.169> kind<00:04:33.440> of<00:04:33.530> as<00:04:33.949> you<00:04:34.160> catch<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:34.729> top<00:04:34.940> that

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
then kind of as you catch the top that

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:52.440 
then kind of as you catch the top that
with<00:04:35.360> your<00:04:35.479> third<00:04:35.720> finger<00:04:36.020> next<00:04:37.010> on<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.460> chord

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.760 

maybe<00:04:53.450> notice<00:04:53.750> I'm<00:04:53.900> still<00:04:54.080> kind<00:04:54.260> of<00:04:54.290> rotating

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
maybe notice I'm still kind of rotating

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:10.810 
maybe notice I'm still kind of rotating
someone<00:04:55.220> back<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:55.610> forth<00:04:58.150> strong<00:05:08.710> so<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:10.039> lot

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
someone back and forth strong so a lot

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.370 
someone back and forth strong so a lot
of<00:05:10.970> different<00:05:11.330> variables<00:05:11.630> as<00:05:11.990> far<00:05:12.169> as<00:05:12.320> the

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
of different variables as far as the

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.260 
of different variables as far as the
right<00:05:12.590> hand<00:05:12.800> is<00:05:12.860> concerned<00:05:13.280> there<00:05:13.550> a<00:05:13.760> lot<00:05:14.180> of

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
right hand is concerned there a lot of

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.850 
right hand is concerned there a lot of
different<00:05:15.700> now<00:05:17.020> you<00:05:18.020> know<00:05:18.139> steel<00:05:18.530> guitar

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
different now you know steel guitar

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.590 
different now you know steel guitar
lyrics<00:05:19.130> and<00:05:19.250> stuff<00:05:19.310> like<00:05:19.550> that<00:05:19.789> used<00:05:20.419> a

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
lyrics and stuff like that used a

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:28.240 
lyrics and stuff like that used a
different<00:05:20.780> cloth<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.910> open<00:05:22.910> string<00:05:23.210> runs

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:33.860 

so<00:05:29.250> there's<00:05:29.460> a<00:05:29.550> pattern<00:05:29.790> there<00:05:32.390> you<00:05:33.390> know<00:05:33.540> so

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
so there's a pattern there you know so

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:53.390 
so there's a pattern there you know so
that<00:05:34.080> basically<00:05:34.470> is<00:05:34.710> like<00:05:34.890> a<00:05:35.100> finger<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:53.280> know

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
that basically is like a finger you know

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.750 
that basically is like a finger you know
this<00:05:53.670> million<00:05:54.210> of<00:05:54.270> those<00:05:55.250> and<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:56.370> melodic

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
this million of those and the melodic

strings but the right hand is important

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.790 
strings but the right hand is important
because<00:06:10.230> you<00:06:10.470> want<00:06:10.590> to<00:06:10.710> get<00:06:10.800> that<00:06:12.590> they<00:06:13.590> see

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.980 

I<00:06:24.830> guess<00:06:25.490> without<00:06:25.639> getting<00:06:25.940> really<00:06:26.419> insanely

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
I guess without getting really insanely

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.020 
I guess without getting really insanely
mundane<00:06:27.530> about<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.919> whole<00:06:28.069> thing<00:06:28.310> is<00:06:28.550> that

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
mundane about the whole thing is that

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.219 
mundane about the whole thing is that
you<00:06:29.150> know<00:06:29.240> when<00:06:29.389> you<00:06:29.479> you<00:06:29.780> look<00:06:29.930> at<00:06:30.050> something

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
you know when you you look at something

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:31.930 
you know when you you look at something
that<00:06:30.380> you're<00:06:30.500> interested<00:06:30.860> in<00:06:30.949> doing<00:06:31.099> and

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
that you're interested in doing and

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.800 
that you're interested in doing and
you're<00:06:32.060> looking<00:06:32.270> at<00:06:32.330> the<00:06:32.419> technique<00:06:32.780> that

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810 
you're looking at the technique that

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.350 
you're looking at the technique that
you're<00:06:33.020> interested<00:06:33.349> in<00:06:33.500> and<00:06:34.030> or<00:06:35.030> if<00:06:35.240> you're

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:35.360 
you're interested in and or if you're

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.670 
you're interested in and or if you're
playing<00:06:35.569> something<00:06:36.139> and<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:36.319> run<00:06:36.440> into<00:06:36.530> a

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 
playing something and you run into a

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.040 
playing something and you run into a
problem<00:06:36.819> that's<00:06:37.819> probably<00:06:38.240> a<00:06:38.330> good<00:06:38.539> time<00:06:38.750> to

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
problem that's probably a good time to

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.330 
problem that's probably a good time to
make<00:06:39.259> some<00:06:39.919> sort<00:06:40.160> of<00:06:40.720> you<00:06:41.720> know<00:06:41.840> exercise<00:06:42.340> to

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
make some sort of you know exercise to

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.219 
make some sort of you know exercise to
make<00:06:43.669> an<00:06:43.789> adjustment<00:06:43.880> to<00:06:44.360> make<00:06:44.599> make<00:06:44.990> things

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:45.229 
make an adjustment to make make things

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.300 
make an adjustment to make make things
better<00:06:45.430> you<00:06:46.430> know<00:06:46.910> if<00:06:47.090> you<00:06:47.210> have<00:06:47.360> a<00:06:47.389> problem

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:48.310 
better you know if you have a problem

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:53.980 
better you know if you have a problem
with<00:06:49.310> a<00:06:49.340> particular<00:06:50.120> line<00:06:50.630> or<00:06:52.780> you<00:06:53.780> know<00:06:53.900> you

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:53.990 
with a particular line or you know you

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:55.420 
with a particular line or you know you
want<00:06:54.259> to<00:06:54.349> spend<00:06:54.590> time<00:06:54.740> finding<00:06:55.220> where<00:06:55.400> the

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
want to spend time finding where the

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:59.860 
want to spend time finding where the
problem<00:06:55.880> is<00:06:56.000> and<00:06:56.330> then<00:06:57.909> work<00:06:58.909> that<00:06:59.150> section<00:06:59.659> to

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
problem is and then work that section to

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:03.249 
problem is and then work that section to
make<00:06:59.900> it<00:07:00.199> to<00:07:00.500> make<00:07:00.650> it<00:07:00.770> really<00:07:01.300> you<00:07:02.300> know<00:07:02.419> you

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:03.259 
make it to make it really you know you
