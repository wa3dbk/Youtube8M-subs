00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.000
 geology that is a heresy is all 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.189
 doctrine that in matters of faith sustains 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.790
 opinions contrary to those of the word 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.799
 of god in the study of archeology 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.230
 treaty about heresies we try 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.270
 present a synthetic description of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 the main religions and sects 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.160
 giving a general notion of history 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 literature doctrine and others 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.029
 knowledge that characterize them 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.650
 refuting them with the truths 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.590
 incontrovertible of the sacred 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.829
 scriptures many believers judge 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.660
 unnecessary the study of that matter 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 They say that we are not interested study 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.760
 heresies but only the word of 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.070
 god without wanting to criticize those who 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.649
 they think that way we judge that the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.930
 following reasons among many others 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.329
 are enough to take us to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.840
 study false religions and sects 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.360
 the study of them enables us 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.730
 to fight them the apostle Paul 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.829
 he knew the false doctrines and he fought 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.320
 hard against them 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.970
 we need to know the enemy with 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.610
 which we are going to face 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.710
 the more we know their tactics and 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.000
 your nature more likely 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 We will have to beat him, Galatians 18 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.520
 help in evangelization we do not know 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.710
 what kinds of people are we going to 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.920
 find when we preach the gospel 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.500
 if we know his doctrines we will be more 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.630
 easy to talk about God's love ' is 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.670
 It is necessary for the Christian to know the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.670
 truth to be able to fight the lie 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.369
 that's why besides knowing the 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.409
 false sects the Christian must possess 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.009
 a good knowledge of the word of 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.259
 god the bible increases our faith when 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.720
 we stumbled upon the doctrines of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.420
 false sects most of the time 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.090
 ridiculous and baseless we have more 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.880
 security in what we have believed from there 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.190
 what can we say as Pablo because I 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 I know who I've believed and I'm sure that 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:05.879
 It is powerful to save my deposit 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.890
 so that the day 2 timoteo 112 increases 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.330
 Our responsibility 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.819
 the Christian is personally 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.490
 responsible for seeking the knowledge of 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.680
 the truth and fight the lie be 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.810
 against error and lying without dressing 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.310
 the armor of truth is lack of 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.120
 Christian responsibility 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.370
 be firm and tight your loins 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.709
 with the truth and dressed in armor 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.350
 of justice and take the helmet of the 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 salvation and the sword of the spirit that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:38.819
 It is the word of God 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:41.370
 Ephesians 6 14 17 Knowledge is power 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:45.500
 power is knowing the power of salvation 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.500
 for all wisdom comes from God
