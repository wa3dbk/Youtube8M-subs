 best role of the market with is the edition 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.799
 Well, that's where the paper is. 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.180
 lwc steal a little lower 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.180

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:57.329
 the colors are more and more light, right? 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.590
 on the paper the previous one is that it also leaves 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.100
 I put it so here for you 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.100
 compare I see the new edition is bigger 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:12.860
 so it is also makes the image very 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.120
 more striking it being published in the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.240

 I do not know if the video will catch the difference. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.450
 but there is a difference so it is the 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.900
 Things become further films 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.300
 vibrant 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.280

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:05.360
 Look, I'll tell you, it was another. 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:08.870

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.230

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.750

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.730
