00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.460 

well<00:00:01.709> I<00:00:01.740> thought<00:00:02.159> I'd<00:00:02.399> just<00:00:03.170> make<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.319> little

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
well I thought I'd just make a little

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.619 
well I thought I'd just make a little
short<00:00:04.770> video<00:00:05.060> to<00:00:06.060> talk<00:00:06.240> about<00:00:06.359> what<00:00:06.600> I

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
short video to talk about what I

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.570 
short video to talk about what I
discovered<00:00:07.259> I've<00:00:08.540> removed<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.630> head<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.580> I

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
discovered I've removed the head and I

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.089 
discovered I've removed the head and I
think<00:00:11.849> there<00:00:12.030> are<00:00:12.059> several<00:00:12.330> problems<00:00:13.009> one<00:00:14.009> of

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
think there are several problems one of

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.410 
think there are several problems one of
them<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.549> there<00:00:14.759> are<00:00:14.910> quite<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> lot<00:00:15.240> of

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
them is that there are quite a lot of

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.279 
them is that there are quite a lot of
machine<00:00:15.719> marks<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:17.160> block<00:00:18.170> whether<00:00:19.170> they

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
machine marks on the block whether they

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.010 
machine marks on the block whether they
show<00:00:19.590> up<00:00:19.740> really<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> on<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.090> camera<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.810> they

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
show up really on on the camera but they

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.230 
show up really on on the camera but they
are<00:00:22.080> there<00:00:22.380> they<00:00:23.340> look<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.580> bit<00:00:23.609> worse<00:00:23.939> than

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
are there they look a bit worse than

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
are there they look a bit worse than
they<00:00:24.359> are

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
they are

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.640 
they are
there<00:00:25.939> but<00:00:26.939> certainly<00:00:27.420> it's<00:00:28.050> not<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.439> good

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
there but certainly it's not very good

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.839 
there but certainly it's not very good
so<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.220> have<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.670> think

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
so I'm going to have a bit of a think

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.179 
so I'm going to have a bit of a think
about<00:00:30.000> what<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.330> with<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.800> idea<00:00:32.070> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
about what I do with that the idea of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.729 
about what I do with that the idea of
taking<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.960> engine<00:00:33.960> out<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.350> stripping<00:00:34.590> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
taking the engine out and stripping it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.950 
taking the engine out and stripping it
all<00:00:34.860> back<00:00:35.070> again<00:00:35.250> onto<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.660> can<00:00:36.809> have

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
all back again onto the so I can have

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.200 
all back again onto the so I can have
that<00:00:37.110> machine<00:00:37.649> doesn't<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.820> interest<00:00:39.090> me

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that machine doesn't really interest me

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.979 
that machine doesn't really interest me
very<00:00:39.300> much<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> big<00:00:43.050> problem<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:44.989> here

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
very much the big problem I think here

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.520 
very much the big problem I think here
is<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.579> head<00:00:47.809> because<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.350> the

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
is on the head because there are the

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.869 
is on the head because there are the
same<00:00:50.270> machine<00:00:51.270> marks<00:00:51.719> on<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.260> head<00:00:52.500> here<00:00:53.010> that

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
same machine marks on the head here that

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.069 
same machine marks on the head here that
they<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:55.110> lot<00:00:55.829> deeper<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:57.570> feel<00:00:57.840> them

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
they are a lot deeper I can feel them

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.939 
they are a lot deeper I can feel them
with<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.379> fingernail<00:00:59.090> so<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.770> didn't<00:01:01.770> notice

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
with my fingernail so I didn't notice

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.979 
with my fingernail so I didn't notice
those<00:01:02.309> when<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.670> had<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> head<00:01:03.210> plane<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.899> I

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
those when I had the head plane but I

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
those when I had the head plane but I
think<00:01:04.260> that<00:01:04.979> could<00:01:05.250> be<00:01:05.280> half<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> problem

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
think that could be half of the problem

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340 
think that could be half of the problem
they're<00:01:06.799> really<00:01:07.799> quite<00:01:08.580> noticeable<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.229> I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
they're really quite noticeable and I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
they're really quite noticeable and I
think<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.119> coolant<00:01:12.119> was<00:01:12.330> probably<00:01:12.659> being

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
think that coolant was probably being

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.210 
think that coolant was probably being
pressurized<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.710> being<00:01:13.860> pushed<00:01:14.100> through

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pressurized and being pushed through

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.440 
pressurized and being pushed through
here<00:01:15.320> across<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.619> edge<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> block<00:01:17.450> ahead

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
here across the edge of the block ahead

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
here across the edge of the block ahead
join<00:01:19.220> a<00:01:20.220> bit<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> an<00:01:21.030> issue<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.619> gonna<00:01:22.890> have

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
join a bit of an issue so I'm gonna have

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.469 
join a bit of an issue so I'm gonna have
to<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.340> certainly<00:01:23.790> had<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> head<00:01:24.210> done

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
to have certainly had the head done

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.280 
to have certainly had the head done
again<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:26.130> tidied<00:01:26.520> up<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:27.140> also<00:01:28.140> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
again just tidied up a little bit also I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.350 
again just tidied up a little bit also I
think<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> head<00:01:28.740> gasket<00:01:29.250> isn't<00:01:29.549> probably<00:01:30.240> as

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
think the head gasket isn't probably as

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.999 
think the head gasket isn't probably as
good<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> quality<00:01:30.720> as<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.200> should<00:01:31.470> be<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:31.770> came

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
good a quality as it should be it came

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.870 
good a quality as it should be it came
in<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> kit<00:01:32.900> so<00:01:33.900> I'm<00:01:34.079> gonna<00:01:34.229> replace<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.430> with

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in a kit so I'm gonna replace that with

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840 
in a kit so I'm gonna replace that with
a<00:01:36.540> good<00:01:37.409> quality<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.250> ate<00:01:38.430> spares

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
a good quality one that I ate spares

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.660 
a good quality one that I ate spares
make<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.960> UK<00:01:40.320> which<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.189> quite<00:01:41.369> expensive

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
make in the UK which is quite expensive

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.899 
make in the UK which is quite expensive
but<00:01:42.229> should<00:01:43.229> do<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> job<00:01:43.770> when<00:01:44.310> they<00:01:44.549> say<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
but should do the job when they say it

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.530 
but should do the job when they say it
will<00:01:45.030> anyway

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
will anyway

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.690 
will anyway
the<00:01:45.930> other<00:01:46.020> thing<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.380> I've<00:01:47.100> looked<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the other thing is I've looked at the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
the other thing is I've looked at the
studs<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.899> studs<00:01:49.229> actually<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:49.920> really

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
studs the studs actually look really

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.700 
studs the studs actually look really
good<00:01:50.939> but<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.750> I'll<00:01:52.049> probably<00:01:52.229> replace

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
good but I think I'll probably replace

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.859 
good but I think I'll probably replace
those<00:01:52.950> as<00:01:53.220> well<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.540> safe

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
those as well just to be on the safe

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.770 
those as well just to be on the safe
side<00:01:55.729> one<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> other<00:01:57.000> things<00:01:57.180> I<00:01:57.329> just

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
side one of the other things I just

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.270 
side one of the other things I just
wanted<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> point<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.860> mentioned

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
wanted to point out which I mentioned

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.459 
wanted to point out which I mentioned
before<00:01:59.610> these<00:02:00.390> are<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> bits<00:02:01.020> as<00:02:01.229> you<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
before these are all the bits as you can

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.679 
before these are all the bits as you can
see<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.860> I've<00:02:01.979> taken<00:02:02.579> off<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.360> things<00:02:03.600> I

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
see that I've taken off I know things I

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.530 
see that I've taken off I know things I
wanted<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.930> point<00:02:04.170> out<00:02:04.350> was<00:02:04.790> this<00:02:05.790> little<00:02:06.119> tip

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
wanted to point out was this little tip

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.850 
wanted to point out was this little tip
with<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.840> rocker<00:02:07.049> gear<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.469> I'm<00:02:07.530> sure<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> lot

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
with the rocker gear and I'm sure a lot

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.160 
with the rocker gear and I'm sure a lot
of<00:02:07.979> people<00:02:08.429> are<00:02:08.670> aware

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
of people are aware

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.650 
of people are aware
but<00:02:09.500> this<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.670> you<00:02:10.789> know<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.209> rocker<00:02:11.390> gear

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
but this as you know is the rocker gear

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.220 
but this as you know is the rocker gear
and<00:02:11.840> these<00:02:12.020> pedestals<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.870> are<00:02:14.870> made<00:02:15.110> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and these pedestals here are made of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.100 
and these pedestals here are made of
aluminium<00:02:15.640> now<00:02:16.640> one<00:02:16.880> of<00:02:16.910> them<00:02:17.209> you<00:02:17.900> can<00:02:18.080> see

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
aluminium now one of them you can see

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.800 
aluminium now one of them you can see
this<00:02:18.410> one<00:02:18.620> here<00:02:18.920> is<00:02:19.010> threaded<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.660> can

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
this one here is threaded if we can

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.830 
this one here is threaded if we can
focus<00:02:21.349> yep<00:02:22.190> okay<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:23.000> one's<00:02:23.209> threaded<00:02:23.630> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
focus yep okay that one's threaded and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.130 
focus yep okay that one's threaded and
that<00:02:24.319> has<00:02:24.620> an<00:02:24.980> oil<00:02:25.780> supply<00:02:26.780> pipe<00:02:27.110> here<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.930> just

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
that has an oil supply pipe here it just

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.920 
that has an oil supply pipe here it just
threaded<00:02:30.470> into<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.880> very<00:02:31.880> fine<00:02:32.239> thread<00:02:32.690> it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
threaded into it very fine thread it's

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.600 
threaded into it very fine thread it's
1/8<00:02:33.640> BSP<00:02:36.040> doesn't<00:02:37.040> seem<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.220> want<00:02:37.370> to<00:02:37.430> focus

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
1/8 BSP doesn't seem to want to focus

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.809 
1/8 BSP doesn't seem to want to focus
but<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.209> a<00:02:38.269> 1/8<00:02:38.540> bsp<00:02:39.110> now<00:02:39.709> of<00:02:39.769> course<00:02:39.950> the

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
but it's a 1/8 bsp now of course the

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.790 
but it's a 1/8 bsp now of course the
problem<00:02:41.000> is<00:02:41.150> that<00:02:41.360> it's<00:02:41.750> very<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:42.290> easy<00:02:42.590> to

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
problem is that it's very very easy to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.280 
problem is that it's very very easy to
strip<00:02:43.069> that<00:02:43.100> hole<00:02:43.850> out<00:02:44.209> because<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.140> only

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
strip that hole out because it's only

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.500 
strip that hole out because it's only
aluminium<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.550> I<00:02:46.640> was<00:02:46.819> aware<00:02:47.000> of<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.180> when<00:02:47.450> I

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
aluminium and I was aware of that when I

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.180 
aluminium and I was aware of that when I
put<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.780> engine<00:02:48.080> back<00:02:48.110> together<00:02:48.470> but<00:02:48.950> I

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
put the engine back together but I

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.509 
put the engine back together but I
forgot<00:02:50.150> when<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.810> was<00:02:51.739> playing<00:02:52.010> around<00:02:52.130> with<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
forgot when I was playing around with it

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.030 
forgot when I was playing around with it
just<00:02:53.150> in<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.810> last<00:02:53.989> couple<00:02:54.080> of<00:02:54.290> days<00:02:54.440> so<00:02:55.010> I

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
just in the last couple of days so I

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.250 
just in the last couple of days so I
stripped<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.489> thread<00:02:55.700> out<00:02:56.080> that's<00:02:57.080> what<00:02:57.230> I

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
stripped the thread out that's what I

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.100 
stripped the thread out that's what I
did<00:02:57.500> was<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:58.010> think<00:02:58.790> this<00:02:58.940> will<00:02:59.090> be<00:02:59.209> okay<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.750> use

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
did was I think this will be okay I use

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.380 
did was I think this will be okay I use
one<00:03:00.440> of<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.620> other<00:03:00.650> pedestals<00:03:01.459> this<00:03:02.060> one<00:03:02.269> off

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
one of the other pedestals this one off

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.770 
one of the other pedestals this one off
the<00:03:02.540> end<00:03:02.569> here<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:04.340> retyped<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.630> that

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the end here and I retyped it for that

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.530 
the end here and I retyped it for that
and<00:03:06.080> then<00:03:06.950> as<00:03:07.250> I<00:03:07.430> exchanged<00:03:07.880> them<00:03:08.000> over<00:03:08.330> and

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
and then as I exchanged them over and

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.560 
and then as I exchanged them over and
then<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:08.810> plugged<00:03:09.200> this<00:03:09.980> hole<00:03:10.310> here<00:03:10.730> with<00:03:11.690> a

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
then I plugged this hole here with a

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.390 
then I plugged this hole here with a
little<00:03:14.570> bolt<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.320> just<00:03:15.650> ground<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.130> off<00:03:16.220> at

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
little bolt and just ground it off at

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.900 
little bolt and just ground it off at
the<00:03:16.489> end<00:03:16.519> so<00:03:17.510> hopefully<00:03:17.930> that<00:03:18.109> will<00:03:18.790> do<00:03:19.790> the

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the end so hopefully that will do the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.789 
the end so hopefully that will do the
trick<00:03:20.150> but<00:03:20.390> if<00:03:21.230> you're<00:03:21.350> pulling<00:03:21.620> those<00:03:21.739> apart

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 
trick but if you're pulling those apart

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.289 
trick but if you're pulling those apart
be<00:03:22.400> really<00:03:22.910> really<00:03:23.359> careful<00:03:23.829> of<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.700> one

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
be really really careful of this one

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.840 
be really really careful of this one
that<00:03:26.510> has<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> oil<00:03:26.870> pipe<00:03:27.410> feed<00:03:27.799> Union<00:03:28.489> into<00:03:28.760> it

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
that has the oil pipe feed Union into it

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.699 
that has the oil pipe feed Union into it
because<00:03:29.000> it's<00:03:29.269> a<00:03:29.390> very<00:03:29.420> fine<00:03:30.049> thread<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.620> it

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
because it's a very fine thread and it

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.750 
because it's a very fine thread and it
just<00:03:31.209> snaps<00:03:32.209> almost<00:03:32.750> instantly<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.549> very<00:03:34.549> easy

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
just snaps almost instantly so very easy

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.210 
just snaps almost instantly so very easy
to<00:03:34.850> strip<00:03:35.209> out<00:03:35.390> they're<00:03:36.109> available<00:03:36.350> but<00:03:36.829> you

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
to strip out they're available but you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.530 
to strip out they're available but you
know<00:03:37.370> it's<00:03:37.640> just<00:03:37.760> a<00:03:37.910> nuisance<00:03:38.209> if<00:03:38.390> that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
know it's just a nuisance if that

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
know it's just a nuisance if that
happens<00:03:38.900> so<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.859> think<00:03:40.100> that's<00:03:40.870> probably<00:03:41.870> about

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
happens so I think that's probably about

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.720 
happens so I think that's probably about
it<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.250> just<00:03:43.430> wanted<00:03:43.970> to<00:03:44.090> sort<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.420> report<00:03:44.840> on

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
it I just wanted to sort of report on

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.370 
it I just wanted to sort of report on
what<00:03:46.730> I<00:03:46.760> discovered<00:03:47.359> when<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:47.870> took<00:03:47.930> their<00:03:48.260> head

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
what I discovered when I took their head

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.900 
what I discovered when I took their head
off<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.890> hopefully<00:03:49.670> um<00:03:51.579> hopefully<00:03:52.579> that<00:03:52.760> will

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
off and hopefully um hopefully that will

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.610 
off and hopefully um hopefully that will
solve<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.329> problem<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.900> I'll<00:03:54.079> have<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.380> bit<00:03:54.530> of

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
solve the problem and I'll have a bit of

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.900 
solve the problem and I'll have a bit of
a<00:03:54.680> think<00:03:54.859> about<00:03:55.100> what<00:03:55.250> to<00:03:55.400> do<00:03:55.519> with<00:03:55.609> the<00:03:55.700> block

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
a think about what to do with the block

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.660 
a think about what to do with the block
I'll<00:03:56.569> probably<00:03:56.840> put<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.920> head<00:03:58.100> together<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
I'll probably put the head together a

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.009 
I'll probably put the head together a
little<00:03:58.790> back<00:03:59.030> together<00:03:59.150> again<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.840> little

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
little back together again with a little

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.380 
little back together again with a little
bit<00:04:00.230> of<00:04:00.319> higher<00:04:00.530> Lemar<00:04:00.799> as<00:04:00.980> well<00:04:01.160> just<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.150> help

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
bit of higher Lemar as well just to help

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.240 
bit of higher Lemar as well just to help
seal<00:04:02.690> that<00:04:02.870> up<00:04:02.930> and<00:04:03.170> maybe<00:04:03.709> with<00:04:03.890> a<00:04:03.920> different

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
seal that up and maybe with a different

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.650 
seal that up and maybe with a different
head<00:04:04.370> gasket<00:04:04.819> and<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.000> bit<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.209> high<00:04:05.359> Alomar

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
head gasket and a bit of high Alomar

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.550 
head gasket and a bit of high Alomar
that<00:04:06.410> will<00:04:06.680> solve<00:04:06.920> the<00:04:07.100> problem<00:04:07.459> so<00:04:08.440> it's<00:04:09.440> a

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
that will solve the problem so it's a

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.680 
that will solve the problem so it's a
pain<00:04:09.799> but<00:04:10.639> I<00:04:10.700> guess<00:04:11.060> it's<00:04:11.239> just<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.540> little

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
pain but I guess it's just a little

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.220 
pain but I guess it's just a little
setback<00:04:12.049> that<00:04:12.980> we<00:04:13.160> have<00:04:13.420> on<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.600> upside<00:04:14.930> it

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
setback that we have on the upside it

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.960 
setback that we have on the upside it
was<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.350> beautiful<00:04:15.799> autumn<00:04:16.160> day<00:04:16.190> here<00:04:16.700> today

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
was a beautiful autumn day here today

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.250 
was a beautiful autumn day here today
and<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.599> took<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.620> MGF

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
and I took the MGF

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.740 
and I took the MGF
a bit<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.590> spin<00:04:19.890> and<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:21.000> really<00:04:21.240> nice<00:04:21.420> little

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
a bit of a spin and a really nice little

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.980 
a bit of a spin and a really nice little
drive<00:04:22.380> around<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.830> hills<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:24.330> there<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.840> go

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
drive around the hills so there we go

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.690 
drive around the hills so there we go
we'll<00:04:25.470> see<00:04:25.740> what<00:04:25.860> happens<00:04:26.160> when<00:04:26.370> we<00:04:26.490> get<00:04:26.580> all

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
we'll see what happens when we get all

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.240 
we'll see what happens when we get all
this<00:04:26.790> rebuilt
