00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.040
 show for the most irreverent series of the 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.180
 television returns to the consoles with a 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.150
 game that has the stamp of its 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.740
 creators the developer obsidian has 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.630
 bet to create a reflect by 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.310
 turns and promises a game at the height of 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.500
 the emblematic series will have 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.760
 got or will be just another one for me is 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.450
 take advantage of the fans as has happened 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.450
 so many times 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.130
 a new guy has just arrived at his par 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.780
 and karman quickly wants to recruit what 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.470
 for his side in the role play of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.470
 children of the village 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.330
 in this simple approach will give 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 place to such a far-fetched story 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.440
 hilarious as the original series everything is 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 possible in south park and its great 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.229
 argument could belong 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.300
 perfectly to a television season 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 since troy parker and matt stone 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.530
 creators of the series are behind 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.210
 script now the cute for its solid 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.680
 argument are the graphics that adapt 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.570
 100% animation 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.250
 the development of the game is divided into 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.110
 missions both main and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.360
 secondary along a great 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.160
 recreation of all its parts we will have 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.630
 total freedom to explore the town to 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.970
 our craving and make requests 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.050
 that our inhabitants will ask us 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.120
 to interact with a lot of 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.480
 characters in the series all have something 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.430
 what to contribute 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.840
 advancing in the story we will get 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.820
 skills to interact with the 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.530
 scenario what will allow us to perform 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.120
 new missions and access zones 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.130
 inaccessible at the beginning of the adventure 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.810
 special mention have the farts that 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.700
 They take great prominence throughout the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.260
 title both in combat and in 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.780
 scenarios to distract or is to create 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.000
 enemies 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.740
 turn-based battles adapt the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.780
 the classics of this genre to the fights 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.450
 street that can have a group of 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.310
 children playing the role weapons and equipment 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.150
 they are everyday objects that charge a 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.610
 new use as golf clubs balls 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.409
 we can cure ourselves by taking snacks and 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.510
 refreshments between altered states 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.670
 we find the disgust as an original touch 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.620
 that makes us throw up losing life 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.750
 each shift and prevents us from eating during the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.250
 combat on your part in the image we 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.280
 allows to perform different attacks 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.720
 using our flatulence there are 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.459
 special skills that we can 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.920
 activate depending on the initial class 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.890
 that we have chosen wizard wizard 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.900
 thief and Jew highlights this last one by 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.790
 its novelty in the genre with attacks like 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.980
 circumcise the enemy or invoke the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.959
 clear of egypt we will not be alone in 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.819
 the combat can choose between six 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.780
 of the children in the series counting on 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.580
 different skills 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.410
 they also have their adaptation 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.630
 invocations of other titles that we 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.520
 let you call various characters from 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.540
 They are parc like Mr. Cairn or the 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.540
 Jesus Christ himself 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.250
 the entire menu system of the game is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.860
 based on a social network similar to 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.780
 facebook and by helping the characters 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.200
 these will mark us as friends in their 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.330
 profile 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.060
 unlocking well support skills 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.860
 In total we can do more than 120 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.540
 friends in the village of course 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.540
 we receive messages of all kinds in 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.849
 our wall 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.530
 there is in the background of the game 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:25.150
 great criticism of the network society 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.780
 social networks smartphones and their 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.780
 consequences 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.290
 as we have already commented at a graphic level 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.730
 fulfills its mission perfectly 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.650
 It seems that we are inside a 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.150
 true chapter of the account series 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.830
 also with a multitude of elements and 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.910
 situations extracted from the 17 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.910
 seasons of show park 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.239
 at a sound level the game does not waver with 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.370
 great themes including some taken 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.340
 in the television series itself 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.750
 It's a pity that ubisoft has not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.459
 bothered to double the title to our 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.959
 language something that would have greatly improved the 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.640
 game experience at least 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.599
 we will enjoy the magnificent dubbing 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.340
 original of the medium american series 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.349
 part we must do before the censorship 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.299
 carried out by ubisoft in europe 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.650
 only in the PC version is complete 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.829
 including the desktop versions 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.720
 a few censored scenes are little 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.640
 important the cuts made and the 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.260
 Men's gaming experience but 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.269
 we do not understand these decisions in a 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.769
 show park game and less when it 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.980
 they include much stronger situations 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.360
 that the censored material 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.970
 the duration of the main story 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.160
 round 12 or 15 hours reaching 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.810
 easily the twenty if we complete the 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.520
 majority of secondary missions and we 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.940
 we make friends of all the characters 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.940
 of the town 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.979
 south park and the rod of truth is a 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:41.870
 game developed thinking about all the 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.400
 fans of the series and everyone will find 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.589
 exactly the same as this one offers 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.599
 but in playable format with an argument 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:50.839
 very television full of surprises humor 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.669
 and bodily fluids psuv park and the 

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.259
 truth bar rises as the best 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.249
 videogame adaptation performed 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:58.569
 to date 

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:58.569
 you're really going to lose it alone 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.460
 the mountain
