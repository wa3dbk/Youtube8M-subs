are<00:00:46.650> affected<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.970> balance<00:00:48.150> are<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
are affected so the balance are going to

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.310 
are affected so the balance are going to
capsule

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
capsule

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.570 
capsule
unbalanced<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.130> also<00:00:50.400> have<00:00:50.490> the

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.580 
unbalanced out will also have the

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.390 
unbalanced out will also have the
capsule<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.630> how<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.900> more<00:00:52.650> di<00:00:53.010> looks

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
capsule so this is how the more di looks

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.180 
capsule so this is how the more di looks
like<00:00:53.640> when<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.150> put<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.600> in<00:00:55.500> context<00:00:56.070> our

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
like when you put it in context our

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.090 
like when you put it in context our
power<00:00:56.370> border<00:00:56.700> you<00:00:56.790> fire<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.030> up<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
power border you fire it up so when the
