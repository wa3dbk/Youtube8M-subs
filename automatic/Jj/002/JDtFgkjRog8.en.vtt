it's<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> non<00:00:17.670> training<00:00:18.060> day<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.300> I'm<00:00:18.390> going<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it's a non training day and I'm going to

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's a non training day and I'm going to
talk<00:00:18.780> to<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.050> about<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.500> equipment<00:00:19.740> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
talk to you about the equipment you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.160 
talk to you about the equipment you
should<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.369> using<00:00:20.550> during<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> 12<00:00:21.630> weeks<00:00:21.869> I

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
should be using during the 12 weeks I

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
should be using during the 12 weeks I
personally<00:00:22.980> prefer<00:00:23.369> free<00:00:23.790> weights<00:00:24.029> over

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
personally prefer free weights over

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.929 
personally prefer free weights over
machines<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.500> reason<00:00:25.890> being<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.340> just<00:00:26.369> find<00:00:26.759> it

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
machines the reason being I just find it

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.450 
machines the reason being I just find it
activates<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:28.020> lot<00:00:28.380> more<00:00:28.560> muscle<00:00:28.890> fibers<00:00:28.920> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
activates a lot more muscle fibers and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.880 
activates a lot more muscle fibers and
use<00:00:29.640> in<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.910> machine<00:00:30.240> itself<00:00:30.689> however<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.680> will

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
use in a machine itself however you will

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.460 
use in a machine itself however you will
see<00:00:32.099> me<00:00:32.250> using<00:00:32.279> both<00:00:33.110> free<00:00:34.110> weights<00:00:34.140> and

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
see me using both free weights and

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.450 
see me using both free weights and
machines<00:00:34.620> during<00:00:35.129> the<00:00:35.190> 12-week

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
machines during the 12-week

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
machines during the 12-week
transformation<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.629> reason<00:00:36.960> why<00:00:37.080> I<00:00:37.110> prefer

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
transformation the reason why I prefer

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.830 
transformation the reason why I prefer
free<00:00:37.769> weights<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.220> that<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.059> does<00:00:39.330> help

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
free weights is that it does help

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.110 
free weights is that it does help
utilize<00:00:40.379> your<00:00:40.590> stabilizing<00:00:41.250> muscles<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.090> well

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
utilize your stabilizing muscles as well

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.500 
utilize your stabilizing muscles as well
as<00:00:43.190> your<00:00:44.190> primary<00:00:44.430> muscles<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> work<00:00:45.269> in

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
as your primary muscles that you work in

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.350 
as your primary muscles that you work in
but<00:00:46.470> with<00:00:46.680> machines<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.489> great<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:47.970> be<00:00:48.090> doing

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
but with machines it's great to be doing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.119 
but with machines it's great to be doing
drop<00:00:48.600> sets<00:00:48.900> superset<00:00:49.470> stuff<00:00:49.739> like<00:00:49.920> that

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
drop sets superset stuff like that

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.979 
drop sets superset stuff like that
because<00:00:50.519> you're<00:00:50.760> able<00:00:50.879> to<00:00:51.089> select<00:00:51.659> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
because you're able to select the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
because you're able to select the
weights<00:00:52.199> very<00:00:52.500> quickly<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.549> easily<00:00:53.729> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
weights very quickly and very easily and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.789 
weights very quickly and very easily and
move<00:00:54.299> from<00:00:54.540> one<00:00:54.690> machine<00:00:55.019> to<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.350> next

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:55.799 
move from one machine to the next

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.479 
move from one machine to the next
without<00:00:56.400> any<00:00:56.790> problems<00:00:57.979> obviously<00:00:58.979> they<00:00:59.430> do

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
without any problems obviously they do

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
without any problems obviously they do
have<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.850> place<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.150> this<00:01:00.420> program<00:01:00.870> especially

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
have a place in this program especially

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
have a place in this program especially
when<00:01:01.530> you're<00:01:01.650> doing<00:01:01.739> legs<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.489> instance<00:01:02.580> lay

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
when you're doing legs for instance lay

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.390 
when you're doing legs for instance lay
extensions<00:01:03.629> hamstring<00:01:04.170> curls<00:01:04.440> isolation

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
extensions hamstring curls isolation

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399 
extensions hamstring curls isolation
movements<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.630> overall<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.290> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
movements like that but overall if you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.890 
movements like that but overall if you
want<00:01:07.619> your<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.670> know<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> mass<00:01:09.119> builders<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
want your you know the mass builders and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.380 
want your you know the mass builders and
the<00:01:10.860> exercises<00:01:11.520> are<00:01:11.640> really<00:01:11.670> gonna<00:01:12.030> burn

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the exercises are really gonna burn

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.109 
the exercises are really gonna burn
calories<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.619> build<00:01:14.040> muscle<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.490> burn<00:01:14.549> fat<00:01:14.939> at

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
calories so build muscle and burn fat at

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.000 
calories so build muscle and burn fat at
the<00:01:15.210> same<00:01:15.420> time<00:01:15.689> but<00:01:16.229> I<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.590> use<00:01:16.710> free

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
the same time but I like to use free

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.940 
the same time but I like to use free
weights<00:01:17.479> if<00:01:18.479> you're<00:01:18.720> a<00:01:18.750> beginner<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.650> I

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
weights if you're a beginner then I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.740 
weights if you're a beginner then I
especially<00:01:20.369> advise<00:01:20.910> that<00:01:20.940> you<00:01:21.270> use<00:01:21.450> free

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
especially advise that you use free

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.150 
especially advise that you use free
weights<00:01:21.930> because<00:01:22.440> they're<00:01:22.620> gonna<00:01:22.740> use<00:01:22.980> your

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
weights because they're gonna use your

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.280 
weights because they're gonna use your
fixators<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:23.970> well<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.690> for<00:01:24.870> instance<00:01:25.170> if

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
fixators as well so for instance if

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.940 
fixators as well so for instance if
we're<00:01:25.440> doing<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.710> bench<00:01:25.950> press<00:01:26.300> with<00:01:27.300> dumbbells

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
we're doing a bench press with dumbbells

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
we're doing a bench press with dumbbells
you're<00:01:28.950> stabilizing<00:01:29.490> muscles<00:01:30.000> which<00:01:30.180> he<00:01:30.330> has

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you're stabilizing muscles which he has

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240 
you're stabilizing muscles which he has
shoulders<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:31.050> stop<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.680> weight<00:01:32.070> from

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
shoulders a stop in that weight from

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.340 
shoulders a stop in that weight from
falling<00:01:32.760> back<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.330> throwing<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.870> side<00:01:34.170> or

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
falling back or throwing to the side or

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.870 
falling back or throwing to the side or
ethic<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.920> where<00:01:35.190> if<00:01:35.430> you're<00:01:35.580> doing<00:01:35.760> a

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
ethic that where if you're doing a

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510 
ethic that where if you're doing a
machine<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.630> much<00:01:36.810> does<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.980> for<00:01:38.310> you

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
machine it pretty much does that for you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.430 
machine it pretty much does that for you
and<00:01:38.730> he's<00:01:38.940> stabilizing<00:01:39.420> muscles<00:01:39.900> don't

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
and he's stabilizing muscles don't

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.800 
and he's stabilizing muscles don't
become<00:01:40.830> as<00:01:40.980> strong<00:01:41.160> as<00:01:41.670> they<00:01:42.000> should<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.450> it

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
become as strong as they should be so it

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.050 
become as strong as they should be so it
does<00:01:42.990> increase<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.410> likelihood<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.340> injury

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
does increase the likelihood of injury

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.180 
does increase the likelihood of injury
especially<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:46.020> those<00:01:46.200> primary<00:01:46.620> muscles<00:01:46.980> get

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.190 
especially as those primary muscles get

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.010 
especially as those primary muscles get
stronger<00:01:47.550> and<00:01:47.820> stronger

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
stronger and stronger

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.719 
stronger and stronger
