detailing on his feet and they put a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.480 
detailing on his feet and they put a
quite<00:03:54.770> a<00:03:54.800> bit<00:03:55.010> of<00:03:55.100> yellow<00:03:55.310> on<00:03:55.550> him<00:03:55.760> from<00:03:56.120> his

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
quite a bit of yellow on him from his

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.050 
hip hands to his little mouth to his
horns<00:04:02.860> which<00:04:03.860> I<00:04:04.100> like<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.460> think<00:04:04.520> that's<00:04:04.790> what's

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
horns which I like I think that's what's

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.490 
horns which I like I think that's what's
really<00:04:05.180> cool<00:04:05.390> about<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.900> papyrus<00:04:06.140> one<00:04:06.350> is

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
really cool about the papyrus one is

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.420 
really cool about the papyrus one is
over<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.740> yellow<00:04:06.950> and<00:04:08.890> this<00:04:09.890> is<00:04:10.100> a<00:04:10.130> good<00:04:10.400> thing

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
over the yellow and this is a good thing

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.290 
over the yellow and this is a good thing
I<00:04:10.910> I<00:04:11.480> don't<00:04:11.930> know<00:04:12.110> why<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:12.740> does<00:04:13.130> this<00:04:13.240> but<00:04:14.240> you

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:14.300 
I I don't know why it does this but you

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.690 
I I don't know why it does this but you
can<00:04:14.480> actually<00:04:14.750> turn<00:04:16.750> like<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:18.830> rotate<00:04:19.370> see

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
can actually turn like you rotate see

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.330 
can actually turn like you rotate see
that<00:04:19.910> and<00:04:20.720> then<00:04:20.870> I'll<00:04:20.960> kind<00:04:21.080> of<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.290> punch<00:04:24.340> if

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
that and then I'll kind of like punch if

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.570 
that and then I'll kind of like punch if
you<00:04:25.460> see<00:04:25.610> that<00:04:26.650> another<00:04:27.650> cool<00:04:28.010> thing<00:04:28.040> on<00:04:28.400> him

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
you see that another cool thing on him

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.890 
you see that another cool thing on him
is<00:04:29.050> right<00:04:30.050> here<00:04:30.290> it<00:04:30.440> has<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.710> kind<00:04:30.920> of<00:04:31.040> design

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
is right here it has this kind of design

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.020 
is right here it has this kind of design
which<00:04:32.900> is<00:04:33.110> cool<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.710> me<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.860> think<00:04:35.350> and<00:04:36.350> then

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
which is cool to me I think and then

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.540 
which is cool to me I think and then
here's<00:04:38.030> the<00:04:38.150> back<00:04:38.530> there's<00:04:39.530> plain<00:04:39.920> not<00:04:40.340> much

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
here's the back there's plain not much

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.300 
here's the back there's plain not much
to<00:04:40.940> show<00:04:40.970> us<00:04:41.390> on<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:41.630> heavy<00:04:41.870> metal<00:04:42.200> ring<00:04:42.380> this

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
to show us on this heavy metal ring this

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.559 
to show us on this heavy metal ring this
two<00:04:43.580> yellow<00:04:43.850> parts

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:57.400 

okay<00:04:51.569> so<00:04:52.470> very<00:04:55.190> I'm<00:04:56.190> going<00:04:56.490> to<00:04:56.699> show<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:56.940> the

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
okay so very I'm going to show you the

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:03.469 
okay so very I'm going to show you the
so<00:04:58.410> if<00:04:59.130> you<00:05:00.030> get<00:05:00.180> the<00:05:00.300> Pirates<00:05:00.780> won<00:05:02.060> by<00:05:03.060> Jesus

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
so if you get the Pirates won by Jesus

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.740 
so if you get the Pirates won by Jesus
on<00:05:03.690> their<00:05:04.229> arms<00:05:04.650> right<00:05:04.860> here<00:05:05.419> you<00:05:06.419> can<00:05:06.599> see

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
on their arms right here you can see

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:13.370 
on their arms right here you can see
that<00:05:06.900> blurry<00:05:07.110> thing<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:12.300> Pyro's<00:05:12.690> running<00:05:13.110> six

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
that blurry thing the Pyro's running six

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:22.370 
that blurry thing the Pyro's running six
bodies<00:05:14.780> see<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:17.300> and<00:05:18.300> then<00:05:20.030> September<00:05:21.030> is<00:05:21.840> a

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
bodies see that and then September is a

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:30.620 
bodies see that and then September is a
little<00:05:22.770> stronger<00:05:24.530> with<00:05:25.530> 650<00:05:26.160> GS<00:05:28.940> so<00:05:29.940> they're

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
little stronger with 650 GS so they're

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.260 
little stronger with 650 GS so they're
not<00:05:30.930> that<00:05:31.139> much<00:05:31.580> stronger<00:05:32.580> than<00:05:32.940> each<00:05:33.120> other

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
not that much stronger than each other

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:35.830 
not that much stronger than each other
just<00:05:33.599> misses<00:05:33.870> that<00:05:34.080> one's<00:05:34.289> a<00:05:34.410> little<00:05:34.620> stronger

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
just misses that one's a little stronger

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.080 
just misses that one's a little stronger
and<00:05:36.840> over<00:05:37.470> I<00:05:37.740> would<00:05:38.130> do<00:05:38.310> them<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:40.909> guess<00:05:41.909> is

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
and over I would do them I guess is

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:47.720 
and over I would do them I guess is
seven<00:05:42.479> point<00:05:42.690> five<00:05:42.960> out<00:05:43.229> of<00:05:43.259> ten<00:05:43.820> so<00:05:44.820> thanks
