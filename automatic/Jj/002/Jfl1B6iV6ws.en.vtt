00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
shown in these swatches just because I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.880 
shown in these swatches just because I
was<00:02:47.980> going<00:02:48.310> through<00:02:48.700> so<00:02:49.300> many<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:50.200> you<00:02:50.800> know

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
was going through so many that you know

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.860 
was going through so many that you know
I<00:02:50.920> didn't<00:02:51.310> have<00:02:51.340> time<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> set<00:02:52.180> them<00:02:52.390> but<00:02:52.600> once

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
I didn't have time to set them but once

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.270 
I didn't have time to set them but once
you<00:02:53.140> leave<00:02:53.320> them<00:02:53.500> on<00:02:53.620> for<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.920> little<00:02:54.160> bit

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
you leave them on for a little bit

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.890 
you leave them on for a little bit
longer<00:02:54.520> they're<00:02:55.000> going<00:02:55.210> to<00:02:55.360> set<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.780> more

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
longer they're going to set and more

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.690 
longer they're going to set and more
matte<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:57.630> do<00:02:58.630> not<00:02:58.900> trust<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.890> color<00:03:00.190> on<00:03:00.490> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
matte to do not trust the color on the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.390 
matte to do not trust the color on the
tubes<00:03:01.090> they<00:03:01.510> vary<00:03:01.810> quite<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.320> lot<00:03:02.650> from<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
tubes they vary quite a lot from the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.980 
tubes they vary quite a lot from the
color<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.880> shown<00:03:04.210> on<00:03:04.360> the<00:03:04.480> tube<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.930> the

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
color that shown on the tube and the

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.200 
color that shown on the tube and the
color<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.260> will<00:03:05.530> actually<00:03:05.740> go<00:03:06.100> on<00:03:06.130> your<00:03:06.430> your

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
color that will actually go on your your

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.980 
color that will actually go on your your
lips<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.200> my<00:03:08.350> recommendation<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.430> to<00:03:09.730> always

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
lips so my recommendation is to always

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.440 
lips so my recommendation is to always
try<00:03:10.990> it<00:03:11.050> before<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.800> buy<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.070> or<00:03:12.370> get<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.240> at

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
try it before you buy it or get it at

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300 
try it before you buy it or get it at
Ulta<00:03:13.690> because<00:03:14.410> they<00:03:14.530> have<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.680> great<00:03:14.980> return

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
Ulta because they have a great return

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.590 
Ulta because they have a great return
policy<00:03:15.990> 3<00:03:16.990> it's<00:03:17.440> quite<00:03:17.980> decieving<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:19.060> terms

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
policy 3 it's quite decieving in terms

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.890 
policy 3 it's quite decieving in terms
of<00:03:19.900> application<00:03:20.830> from<00:03:21.190> some<00:03:21.790> of<00:03:21.910> them<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.720> doe

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
of application from some of them the doe

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.720 
of application from some of them the doe
foot<00:03:23.110> applicator<00:03:23.170> is<00:03:23.800> really<00:03:24.040> helpful<00:03:24.340> in

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
foot applicator is really helpful in

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.790 
foot applicator is really helpful in
putting<00:03:24.880> on<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.180> product<00:03:25.690> but<00:03:26.290> I've<00:03:26.560> found

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
putting on the product but I've found

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800 
putting on the product but I've found
that<00:03:27.130> once<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.090> thought<00:03:28.270> that<00:03:28.480> we're<00:03:28.600> going<00:03:28.720> to

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
that once I thought that we're going to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.980 
that once I thought that we're going to
be<00:03:28.930> really<00:03:29.080> easy<00:03:29.470> to<00:03:29.950> apply<00:03:30.630> we're<00:03:31.630> quite

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
be really easy to apply we're quite

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.680 
be really easy to apply we're quite
difficult<00:03:32.230> and<00:03:32.830> came<00:03:33.400> on<00:03:33.550> quite<00:03:33.850> streaky<00:03:34.450> and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
difficult and came on quite streaky and

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.900 
difficult and came on quite streaky and
I'm<00:03:34.990> even<00:03:35.350> actually<00:03:35.770> maybe<00:03:36.280> two<00:03:36.700> or<00:03:36.880> three

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
I'm even actually maybe two or three

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.660 
I'm even actually maybe two or three
tries<00:03:37.420> to<00:03:37.450> actually<00:03:37.900> get<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.350> to<00:03:38.530> a<00:03:38.830> smooth

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
tries to actually get it to a smooth

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.030 
tries to actually get it to a smooth
opaque<00:03:40.360> color<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:41.080> then<00:03:41.230> there<00:03:41.380> were<00:03:41.500> those<00:03:41.680> I

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
opaque color and then there were those I

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.120 
opaque color and then there were those I
think<00:03:42.520> on<00:03:42.850> the<00:03:43.320> darker<00:03:44.320> end<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.920> pink

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
think on the darker end of the pink

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.740 
think on the darker end of the pink
spectrum<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.820> we're<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.060> going<00:03:46.390> on<00:03:46.510> like<00:03:46.570> a

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
spectrum that we're just going on like a

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.290 
spectrum that we're just going on like a
dream<00:03:47.140> and<00:03:47.380> it<00:03:47.590> didn't<00:03:48.040> take<00:03:48.310> much<00:03:48.520> maybe<00:03:48.820> one

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
dream and it didn't take much maybe one

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.250 
dream and it didn't take much maybe one
or<00:03:49.480> two<00:03:49.510> swipes

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
or two swipes

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.740 
or two swipes
to<00:03:50.410> get<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.800> color<00:03:51.010> perfect<00:03:51.580> and<00:03:51.730> then<00:03:52.060> for

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
to get the color perfect and then for

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.150 
to get the color perfect and then for
finally<00:03:53.680> my<00:03:53.980> last<00:03:54.310> tip<00:03:54.670> is<00:03:54.910> in<00:03:55.420> terms<00:03:56.140> of<00:03:56.500> using

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
finally my last tip is in terms of using

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.870 
finally my last tip is in terms of using
these<00:03:57.900> lip<00:03:58.900> products<00:03:59.470> I<00:03:59.590> would<00:03:59.680> always<00:04:00.070> use<00:04:00.580> it

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
these lip products I would always use it

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.490 
these lip products I would always use it
with<00:04:01.180> a<00:04:01.540> lip<00:04:02.470> liner<00:04:02.740> underneath<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:03.880> because

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
with a lip liner underneath just because

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.230 
with a lip liner underneath just because
applications<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.620> lot<00:04:05.650> easier<00:04:06.250> color<00:04:06.940> payoff

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
applications a lot easier color payoff

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.550 
applications a lot easier color payoff
is<00:04:07.540> a<00:04:07.570> lot<00:04:07.810> better<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.500> I<00:04:09.250> find<00:04:09.730> that<00:04:10.060> it<00:04:10.840> lasts

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
is a lot better and I find that it lasts

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.160 
is a lot better and I find that it lasts
a<00:04:11.710> lot<00:04:11.830> longer<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.490> far<00:04:12.880> I<00:04:12.910> really<00:04:13.030> like<00:04:13.570> them<00:04:13.990> I

think my favorites would have to be

Istanbul and Tokyo maybe there's one

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.170 
Istanbul and Tokyo maybe there's one
other<00:05:05.110> one<00:05:05.349> I<00:05:05.380> was<00:05:05.560> like<00:05:05.740> whew<00:05:06.039> not<00:05:06.820> cute

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:07.180 
other one I was like whew not cute

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.260 
other one I was like whew not cute
definitely<00:05:08.050> was<00:05:08.380> not<00:05:08.710> a<00:05:09.099> good<00:05:09.699> look<00:05:09.970> for<00:05:10.210> me

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
definitely was not a good look for me

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.150 
definitely was not a good look for me
because<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.960> would<00:05:11.050> just<00:05:11.110> made<00:05:11.590> my<00:05:11.710> teeth<00:05:11.919> with

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
because it would just made my teeth with

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.640 
because it would just made my teeth with
a<00:05:12.190> little<00:05:12.520> yellow<00:05:13.139> application<00:05:14.139> was<00:05:14.320> very

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
a little yellow application was very

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.560 
a little yellow application was very
difficult<00:05:14.919> because<00:05:15.280> I<00:05:15.430> have<00:05:15.699> darker<00:05:16.210> lips

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
difficult because I have darker lips

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.370 
difficult because I have darker lips
so<00:05:16.690> getting<00:05:16.930> this<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:18.009> go<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.910> be<00:05:19.690> opaque

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
so getting this to go on and be opaque

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.290 
so getting this to go on and be opaque
enough<00:05:20.560> was<00:05:21.099> hard<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.759> then<00:05:21.880> once<00:05:22.120> it<00:05:22.270> was

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
enough was hard and then once it was

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.920 
enough was hard and then once it was
okay<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:23.080> just<00:05:23.110> look<00:05:23.440> like<00:05:23.470> I<00:05:23.949> look<00:05:24.880> scary<00:05:25.270> so

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
okay I just look like I look scary so

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.120 
okay I just look like I look scary so
yeah<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:27.099> then<00:05:27.669> finally<00:05:28.120> in<00:05:28.630> terms<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.560> the

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
yeah and then finally in terms of the

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.600 
yeah and then finally in terms of the
reds<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.819> the<00:05:30.970> darks<00:05:31.449> I<00:05:31.750> found<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.580> you<00:05:33.580> know

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610
