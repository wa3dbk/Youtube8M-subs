about<00:00:03.480> flush<00:00:03.840> trim<00:00:04.170> routing<00:00:04.589> what<00:00:05.490> flush<00:00:05.730> trim

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
about flush trim routing what flush trim

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.150 
about flush trim routing what flush trim
routing<00:00:06.390> does<00:00:06.779> is<00:00:07.080> it<00:00:07.200> takes<00:00:07.410> two<00:00:07.649> boards<00:00:08.010> and

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
routing does is it takes two boards and

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.020 
routing does is it takes two boards and
it<00:00:08.250> makes<00:00:08.519> them<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.880> same<00:00:09.090> plane<00:00:09.980> by

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
it makes them in the same plane by

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.089 
it makes them in the same plane by
having<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.150> bit<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.750> we've<00:00:13.170> got<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> top<00:00:13.650> bearing

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
having a bit and we've got a top bearing

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.709 
having a bit and we've got a top bearing
and<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.309> bottom<00:00:14.580> bearing<00:00:14.849> bit<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.570> what

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
and a bottom bearing bit but what

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.349 
and a bottom bearing bit but what
happens<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.350> your<00:00:17.070> keep<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.730> piece<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.300> wood

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
happens is your keep the piece of wood

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.080 
happens is your keep the piece of wood
that<00:00:18.480> you're<00:00:18.630> keeping<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.789> the<00:00:20.789> bearing

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
that you're keeping the the bearing

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
that you're keeping the the bearing
rides<00:00:21.300> along<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.779> piece<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.560> wood<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.980> then

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
rides along that piece of wood and then

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.179 
rides along that piece of wood and then
the<00:00:23.550> cutter<00:00:23.880> head<00:00:24.150> here<00:00:24.800> makes<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.980> other

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
the cutter head here makes the other

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
the cutter head here makes the other
piece<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:26.970> wood<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.590> same<00:00:28.800> plane<00:00:29.039> set<00:00:29.279> so

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
piece of wood in the same plane set so

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.450 
piece of wood in the same plane set so
it<00:00:29.519> shaves<00:00:29.849> away<00:00:30.210> whatever<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:31.080> proud<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.859> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it shaves away whatever is proud of this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
it shaves away whatever is proud of this
piece<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.910> wood<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.329> bearing<00:00:33.600> is

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
piece of wood that the bearing is

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.170 
piece of wood that the bearing is
running<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.200> cuts<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.530> away<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.120> what<00:00:36.120> do

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
running on and cuts it away and what do

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.910 
running on and cuts it away and what do
you<00:00:36.210> have<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> top<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.050> bottom<00:00:37.200> bearing<00:00:37.680> for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
you have a top and a bottom bearing for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
you have a top and a bottom bearing for
is<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.700> just<00:00:38.910> depends<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.600> is<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.410> top

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
is really just depends on is it the top

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
is really just depends on is it the top
piece<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:40.860> wood<00:00:41.040> or<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.250> bottom<00:00:41.579> piece<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
piece of wood or the bottom piece of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.569 
piece of wood or the bottom piece of
wood<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.300> needs<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.170> be<00:00:43.290> cut<00:00:43.530> with<00:00:44.129> our<00:00:44.309> piece

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
wood that needs to be cut with our piece

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.729 
wood that needs to be cut with our piece
here<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.480> want<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.750> cut<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> bottom<00:00:46.260> piece

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
here we want to cut the bottom piece

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.889 
here we want to cut the bottom piece
here<00:00:47.070> which<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> see<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> proud<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.750> this

here which you can see is proud of this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
here which you can see is proud of this
piece<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.530> want<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.800> route<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:49.980> away<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
piece so we want to route that away so

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.689 
piece so we want to route that away so
generally<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> use<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:53.219> bearing

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
generally you want to use a top bearing

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.729 
generally you want to use a top bearing
bit<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> then<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.050> bearing<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.469> running

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
bit and then the bearing is running

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.799 
bit and then the bearing is running
along<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:55.980> top<00:00:56.370> piece<00:00:56.699> here<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.719> going

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
along the top piece here and it's going

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.139 
along the top piece here and it's going
to<00:00:57.899> shave<00:00:58.140> away<00:00:58.410> all<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.520> material<00:01:00.000> below

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to shave away all the material below

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.750 
to shave away all the material below
that<00:01:00.570> we<00:01:00.690> want<00:01:00.899> gone<00:01:01.219> sometimes<00:01:02.219> it's<00:01:02.460> just<00:01:02.579> as

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that we want gone sometimes it's just as

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.609 
that we want gone sometimes it's just as
simple<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.270> flipping<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> piece<00:01:03.960> around<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
simple as flipping the piece around and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.710 
simple as flipping the piece around and
then<00:01:04.979> using<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.519> bottom<00:01:05.820> bearing<00:01:06.090> bit<00:01:06.330> but

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
then using the bottom bearing bit but

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.810 
then using the bottom bearing bit but
sometimes<00:01:07.229> like<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.619> big<00:01:07.860> tables<00:01:08.430> where<00:01:08.729> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
sometimes like on big tables where it's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.130 
sometimes like on big tables where it's
really<00:01:08.970> hard<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.360> flip<00:01:09.600> over<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> piece

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
really hard to flip over the piece

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.660 
really hard to flip over the piece
you're<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:11.010> have<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> you're

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
you're really gonna have to you're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.830 
you're really gonna have to you're
really<00:01:11.850> gonna<00:01:11.939> need<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.299> two<00:01:12.570> different

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
really gonna need these two different

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.929 
really gonna need these two different
bits<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.680> adjust<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.729> lot

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
bits so that you can adjust a bit a lot

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.460 
bits so that you can adjust a bit a lot
easier<00:01:15.330> than<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:15.600> would<00:01:15.720> take<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.350> get

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
easier than it would take to get

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.620 
easier than it would take to get
sometimes<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.490> many<00:01:17.670> as<00:01:17.790> four<00:01:18.030> people<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.420> flip

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
sometimes as many as four people to flip

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
sometimes as many as four people to flip
a<00:01:18.720> really<00:01:18.990> big<00:01:19.200> heavy<00:01:19.409> tabletop<00:01:20.040> over<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.759> do<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
a really big heavy tabletop over to do a

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.820 
a really big heavy tabletop over to do a
profile<00:01:21.450> or<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.810> flush<00:01:22.049> trim<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.560> we're<00:01:22.740> gonna

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
profile or a flush trim as we're gonna

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.670 
profile or a flush trim as we're gonna
do<00:01:23.100> right<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.720> since<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.200> need<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> top

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
do right here and so since we need a top

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800 
do right here and so since we need a top
bearing<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.549> we're<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.689> way

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
bearing bit what we're gonna do the way

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.109 
bearing bit what we're gonna do the way
