00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.359
 we were hit 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:16.669
 over the years 

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:19.499
 it would be very well put into use by companies 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.749
 and as a result, we are still at a location one percent earlier 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.060
 these sites that are about to be issued for industry in 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.300
 This case Zeeland Sigthorsson has a duty of care regarding the have 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.790
 more hear that on its territory we are sitting and will in addition be careful 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790
 to handle 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.649
 a lot of goodies 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.049
 it's a habit that often goes him in a certain way next to the west corner 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.200
 He just needs to see what makes the walking route logical and then I am young people 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.790
 once 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.920
 that probably cover most traded routine they put the 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 opening 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.650
 on that walking route 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.310
 write a thread 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.410
 so stuck 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.560
 I would say try myself and check if you have now set it correctly 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.880
 Your movements accompany them to see how they spread 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.040
 by marking those birds it is very recognizable so we look where 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.730
 they were moving within the port and inside 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.160
 their legs Zeeland so you are going to see how long that bit full against Muslim beard 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.369
 to put through the incurred or would care for 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.530
 odd actually come out too well 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.710
 that will be tricky salmon in practice is very, very many of the theories that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.710
 single party much more fun to do 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.200
 and not just a few years 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.259
 amersfoort abruptly interrupted I try to wait and see just like that 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.090
 the participants 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.890
 and grab on the wings 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.380
 and from the neighborhood it is NATO policy that is 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.380
 also for your hands 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.730
 sorry i do upstairs 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.620
 he had his and his students of the study nature, environment and space 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:12.269
 they learn how to make notes of themselves 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.559
 administer the movement of technology natural and is also involved 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.229
 what is also of a bit of awareness of year of the hour that we still have 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.319
 in the netherlands a how to handle this with care and how to make a contribution 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.809
 can deliver with research 

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:25.909
 therefore were disgusting training 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:28.989
 anyone who is the most last year, also for nature in the Netherlands 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.129
 best team next round 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:36.310
 since a few years ago it was uncertain whether both due to the sand 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:38.829
 yes this is a male 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.299
 what your dog had but I have seen and they protest much bigger 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.669
 to be 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:48.239
 he does like the stalker all we wanted is the following 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:52.930
 after what goes back and forth against the bow, say the way you go 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.859
 with psv but yes and ladies, the people from Eindhoven are interested in this and 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.719
 not if they are afraid that you are yourself 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:02.419
 If you also often miss out on the right place at the opening of the IOC 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.629
 quickly and firmly outside 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.840
 yep not just theory because some courses think about what you 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.510
 much more so even though it is very few to come up outside and there 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.510
 it's all for old students and they are now working at the closet bike 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.099
 robbed 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.969
 and they do this sleeves but now with other species there are indeed 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:22.659
 grown indoors 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.079
 I do further research in this way 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.689
 the campaign fell on the equalizer
