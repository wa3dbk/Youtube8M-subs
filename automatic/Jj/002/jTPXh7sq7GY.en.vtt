00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.070 

so<00:01:03.970> that's<00:01:04.120> what<00:01:04.270> flooded<00:01:04.540> the<00:01:04.600> ground<00:01:04.870> the

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:07.390 
pipe came up to about here and I don't

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.210 
pipe came up to about here and I don't
think<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.870> should<00:01:07.900> be<00:01:08.110> a<00:01:08.140> kicked<00:01:08.440> in<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:09.040> then

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
think you should be a kicked in and then

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.590 
think you should be a kicked in and then
it<00:01:09.370> just<00:01:09.490> snapped<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:09.970> right<00:01:10.150> at<00:01:10.360> the<00:01:10.420> ground

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
it just snapped it right at the ground

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.750 
it just snapped it right at the ground
level<00:01:10.720> so<00:01:11.440> all<00:01:11.650> night<00:01:12.040> the<00:01:12.280> water<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.700> just
