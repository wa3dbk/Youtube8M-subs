 I bring you a refreshing drink very 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.800
 simple and the only thing that we are going to occupy 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.960
 as ingredients would be the strawberries and the 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.420
 orange juice and if you like, you can 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.309
 put good honey before you start with 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.070
 the recipe wanted to tell you something very 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.890
 important orange juice this 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.470
 contains substances that help improve 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.949
 the state of the organism between them is 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.460
 stand out as calcium phosphorus and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.460
 iron magnesium and potassium and good this 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.400
 helps a lot in particular to facilitate the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.619
 development of our bones and good 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.290
 because phosphorus is helps us a lot to 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.479

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.420

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.090
 move to the strawberry 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.090

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 now I'm going to put the juice 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.710
 and then to my taste this time I'm going 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.210
 to put a spoonful of honey 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.210
 and liquefy 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.380
 and well we liquefy the only thing I'm going to 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.380
 to do is to boil 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:15.640
