chaotic staff for absolutely no reason

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.770

the<00:01:15.960> first<00:01:16.229> wave<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.759> was<00:01:18.000> kind<00:01:18.240> of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
the first wave and it was kind of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510 
the first wave and it was kind of
annoying<00:01:18.659> Pisa<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.619> thought<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.340> would

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
annoying Pisa I thought that we would

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.039 
annoying Pisa I thought that we would
have<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.759> least<00:01:20.790> gotten<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.720> part<00:01:21.900> where

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
have at least gotten to the part where

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.160 
have at least gotten to the part where
we<00:01:22.170> get<00:01:22.530> those<00:01:22.740> um<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.759> its<00:01:24.150> tectonic<00:01:24.600> not

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
we get those um I think its tectonic not

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.710 
we get those um I think its tectonic not
plates<00:01:25.500> its<00:01:25.740> tectonic<00:01:26.159> energy<00:01:26.909> which<00:01:27.479> we

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
plates its tectonic energy which we

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.330 
plates its tectonic energy which we
could<00:01:27.840> have<00:01:27.960> sold<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.500> GE<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> bit<00:01:29.250> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
could have sold on the GE for a bit of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.740 
could have sold on the GE for a bit of
profit<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.240> what<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.450> need<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
profit because that's what you need to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.210 
profit because that's what you need to
actually<00:01:31.049> um<00:01:31.439> do<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
actually um do the

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.600 
actually um do the
make<00:01:34.850> the<00:01:35.030> armor<00:01:35.540> for<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.080> local<00:01:36.470> 90<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:36.920> the

make the armor for the local 90 and the
funny<00:01:37.880> thing<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:38.180> that<00:01:38.300> this<00:01:38.720> is<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.020> point

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
funny thing is that this is the point

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.710 
funny thing is that this is the point
where<00:01:39.350> box<00:01:39.710> dies<00:01:40.010> basically<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.210> dark<00:01:41.450> horn
