00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
right yeah it's a little video and

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.600 
right yeah it's a little video and
Alyssa<00:00:06.240> the<00:00:07.240> other<00:00:07.390> day<00:00:07.569> I<00:00:07.600> invested<00:00:08.290> in<00:00:08.610> for

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
Alyssa the other day I invested in for

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.660 
Alyssa the other day I invested in for
ticket<00:00:09.969> it<00:00:10.150> comes<00:00:10.450> in<00:00:10.600> the<00:00:10.660> night

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
ticket it comes in the night

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.910 
ticket it comes in the night
ok<00:00:12.670> I<00:00:12.969> hope<00:00:13.570> you<00:00:13.629> know<00:00:13.840> you<00:00:14.260> look<00:00:14.469> forward<00:00:14.709> to

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:14.920 
ok I hope you know you look forward to

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.790 
ok I hope you know you look forward to
pitch<00:00:15.449> and<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:17.800> get<00:00:19.140> attention<00:00:20.140> by<00:00:20.470> effects

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
pitch and you get attention by effects

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.620 
pitch and you get attention by effects
and<00:00:21.099> these<00:00:21.279> I'll<00:00:21.490> come<00:00:21.670> off<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:22.060> line<00:00:22.210> so<00:00:22.570> you

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
and these I'll come off the line so you

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.120 
and these I'll come off the line so you
can<00:00:22.689> get<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.929> bit<00:00:23.169> more<00:00:23.259> pressure<00:00:23.500> on<00:00:23.710> I<00:00:23.919> found

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
can get a bit more pressure on I found

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.489 
can get a bit more pressure on I found
with<00:00:24.339> this<00:00:24.429> pic<00:00:24.669> you<00:00:24.759> do<00:00:25.000> need<00:00:25.240> to<00:00:25.359> put<00:00:25.480> quite<00:00:26.439> a

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:26.499 
with this pic you do need to put quite a

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:28.140 
with this pic you do need to put quite a
bit<00:00:26.589> of<00:00:26.710> pressure<00:00:26.980> on<00:00:27.310> it<00:00:27.339> so<00:00:27.519> you<00:00:27.789> can<00:00:27.820> feel

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
bit of pressure on it so you can feel

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.019 
bit of pressure on it so you can feel
here<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.619> locking<00:00:29.919> mechanism<00:00:30.369> inside<00:00:30.759> it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
here the locking mechanism inside it

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.420 
here the locking mechanism inside it
inside<00:00:31.509> the<00:00:31.660> locks<00:00:32.190> you<00:00:33.190> can<00:00:33.340> make

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
inside the locks you can make

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.650 
inside the locks you can make
sufficiently<00:00:33.760> if<00:00:33.880> yell<00:00:34.090> a<00:00:34.120> bit<00:00:34.329> more<00:00:34.480> pressure

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
sufficiently if yell a bit more pressure

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.850 
sufficiently if yell a bit more pressure
but<00:00:34.870> you<00:00:34.930> gotta<00:00:35.050> be<00:00:35.110> careful<00:00:35.140> which<00:00:35.559> ones<00:00:35.710> to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
but you gotta be careful which ones to

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.740 
but you gotta be careful which ones to
put<00:00:35.980> pressure<00:00:36.190> on<00:00:36.399> as<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:37.210> so<00:00:37.360> when<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:37.510> put

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
put pressure on as it so when I put

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.380 
put pressure on as it so when I put
pressure<00:00:37.899> on<00:00:38.140> this<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:39.460> wiring<00:00:39.879> fact<00:00:40.120> quite

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
pressure on this the wiring fact quite

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.090 
pressure on this the wiring fact quite
thin<00:00:40.600> on<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.719> end<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.170> you'll<00:00:41.350> be<00:00:41.469> careful

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
thin on the end it's you'll be careful

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.860 
thin on the end it's you'll be careful
so<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.670> but<00:00:42.820> you<00:00:42.879> go<00:00:43.030> over<00:00:43.180> more<00:00:43.329> careful<00:00:43.780> you

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
so the but you go over more careful you

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.209 
so the but you go over more careful you
are<00:00:43.899> cuz<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.320> might<00:00:44.469> end<00:00:44.649> up<00:00:44.710> snapping<00:00:44.890> the

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219 
are cuz you might end up snapping the

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.729 
are cuz you might end up snapping the
peach<00:00:45.489> right<00:00:46.449> then<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:46.840> know<00:00:47.020> you<00:00:47.260> wanted<00:00:47.500> much

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
peach right then I know you wanted much

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.369 
peach right then I know you wanted much
finished<00:00:48.070> thing<00:00:48.219> worked<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:49.539> first<00:00:50.170> of<00:00:50.289> all

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
finished thing worked right first of all

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.529 
finished thing worked right first of all
I'm<00:00:50.710> not<00:00:50.769> going<00:00:51.039> to<00:00:51.100> use<00:00:51.250> this<00:00:51.430> I<00:00:51.699> don't<00:00:52.420> bother

00:00:52.529 --> 00:00:52.539 
I'm not going to use this I don't bother

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.259 
I'm not going to use this I don't bother
with<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.809> instead<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.649> three<00:00:53.859> feet<00:00:54.179> into<00:00:55.179> the

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
with that instead of three feet into the

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.040 
with that instead of three feet into the
lock<00:00:56.429> right<00:00:57.460> Oh<00:00:57.579> it'll<00:00:57.789> be<00:00:57.850> picks<00:00:58.149> will<00:00:58.719> lock

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
lock right Oh it'll be picks will lock

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.369 
lock right Oh it'll be picks will lock
the<00:00:59.440> lock<00:01:00.179> so<00:01:01.179> best<00:01:01.629> thing<00:01:01.809> to<00:01:01.839> do<00:01:01.989> is<00:01:02.109> put<00:01:02.289> the

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
the lock so best thing to do is put the

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.250 
the lock so best thing to do is put the
pick<00:01:02.559> in<00:01:02.769> turn<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.699> way<00:01:03.820> I'll<00:01:03.969> turn<00:01:04.330> and

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 
pick in turn it the way I'll turn and

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.830 
pick in turn it the way I'll turn and
you<00:01:05.440> know<00:01:05.590> that's<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.880> one<00:01:07.450> way<00:01:07.600> you're<00:01:07.750> gonna

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
you know that's the one way you're gonna

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.120 
you know that's the one way you're gonna
pick<00:01:08.110> you<00:01:08.230> wanna<00:01:08.350> be<00:01:08.410> picking<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:08.890> weight

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
pick you wanna be picking in weight

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
pick you wanna be picking in weight
doesn't<00:01:09.340> turn<00:01:09.700> right<00:01:10.420> so<00:01:10.660> I'll<00:01:10.750> push<00:01:10.930> that<00:01:10.960> up

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
doesn't turn right so I'll push that up

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.490 
doesn't turn right so I'll push that up
like<00:01:11.560> that<00:01:12.300> pull<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.420> wire<00:01:13.630> out<00:01:13.780> I<00:01:13.960> hold<00:01:14.260> all

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
like that pull the wire out I hold all

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.630 
like that pull the wire out I hold all
the<00:01:14.530> picks<00:01:14.800> in<00:01:14.950> position<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:17.200> then<00:01:17.410> move<00:01:17.800> each

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
the picks in position and then move each

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.810 
the picks in position and then move each
one<00:01:18.970> of<00:01:19.060> these<00:01:19.210> Peaks<00:01:20.200> around<00:01:20.800> until<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:21.700> find

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
one of these Peaks around until you find

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.780 
one of these Peaks around until you find
the<00:01:21.940> ones<00:01:22.090> that<00:01:22.120> don't<00:01:22.360> turn<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:24.430> there<00:01:24.700> we

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
the ones that don't turn right there we

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.330 
the ones that don't turn right there we
go<00:01:24.940> look<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.420> one<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.020> four<00:01:26.260> these<00:01:26.980> are

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
go look this one and four these are

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.710 
go look this one and four these are
calls<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:29.380> four<00:01:29.650> sticks<00:01:30.150> because<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.450> said<00:01:31.690> I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
calls the four sticks because I said I

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.390 
calls the four sticks because I said I
wanted<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.020> actually<00:01:32.260> turn<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.590> lock<00:01:32.800> so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
wanted to actually turn the lock so

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.070 
wanted to actually turn the lock so
we're<00:01:33.580> putting<00:01:34.030> pressure<00:01:34.360> on<00:01:34.510> to<00:01:34.720> these

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
we're putting pressure on to these

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.760 
we're putting pressure on to these
now<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.260> reset<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:35.860> all<00:01:36.150> set<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.240> tumblers

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
now we reset it all set and tumblers

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.810 
now we reset it all set and tumblers
find<00:01:38.770> all<00:01:38.890> I'm<00:01:39.010> added<00:01:39.280> pressure

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
find all I'm added pressure

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.360 
find all I'm added pressure
turn<00:01:40.000> that<00:01:40.210> they<00:01:40.900> start<00:01:41.170> picking<00:01:41.320> right<00:01:42.190> so

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
turn that they start picking right so

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.680 
turn that they start picking right so
it's<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.580> bar<00:01:42.730> cell<00:01:43.030> for<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.270> back<00:01:43.480> and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
it's the bar cell for the back and

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.750 
it's the bar cell for the back and
you'll<00:01:44.140> feel<00:01:44.440> it<00:01:44.500> just<00:01:44.800> kind<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.220> go<00:01:45.550> into<00:01:45.640> a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
you'll feel it just kind of go into a

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.420 
you'll feel it just kind of go into a
groove<00:01:46.590> quite<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.620> little<00:01:47.740> bit<00:01:47.830> of<00:01:47.950> pressure<00:01:48.250> on

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
groove quite a little bit of pressure on

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.010 
groove quite a little bit of pressure on
it<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:48.880> then<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.450> guys<00:01:49.570> work<00:01:49.900> on<00:01:50.140> it<00:01:52.020> keep

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
it and then you guys work on it keep
