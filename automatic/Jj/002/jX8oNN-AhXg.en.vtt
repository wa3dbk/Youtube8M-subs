people<00:01:50.759> tend<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> they<00:01:51.720> think<00:01:51.780> I'm

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
people tend to do that they think I'm

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.210 
people tend to do that they think I'm
gonna<00:01:52.140> run<00:01:52.350> around<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:52.950> it'll<00:01:53.159> be

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
gonna run around and like it'll be

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.550 
gonna run around and like it'll be
harder<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.549> catch<00:01:53.790> me<00:01:54.090> if<00:01:54.180> I'm<00:01:54.270> running<00:01:54.600> no<00:01:55.320> let

harder to catch me if I'm running no let

harder to catch me if I'm running no let
the<00:01:55.680> zombies<00:01:55.710> come<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.640> way<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.820> see

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the zombies come to you that way you see

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.840 
the zombies come to you that way you see
them<00:01:57.240> coming<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.659> can<00:01:57.899> line<00:01:58.079> up<00:01:58.110> your<00:01:58.259> shots

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
them coming you can line up your shots

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.130 
them coming you can line up your shots

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
you know who's coming from where I

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.179 
you know who's coming from where I
usually<00:02:01.560> tend<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> stay<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:03.210> sort<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.600> um

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
usually tend to stay just sort of um

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.399 
usually tend to stay just sort of um
where<00:02:05.189> I'm<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.540> as<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.869> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> every

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
where I'm at like as you can see every

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.839 
where I'm at like as you can see every
time<00:02:07.590> they<00:02:07.710> spawn<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.399> tend<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.670> just

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
time they spawn me I just tend to just

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.050 
time they spawn me I just tend to just
stay<00:02:09.090> there<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:10.080> do<00:02:10.470> go<00:02:10.800> through<00:02:11.099> for<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.849> while

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
stay there I do go through for a while

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.590 
stay there I do go through for a while
where<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> don't<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.050> any<00:02:13.200> kill

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
where I don't get any kill

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.270 
where I don't get any kill
I<00:02:13.870> think<00:02:14.260> this<00:02:14.380> might<00:02:14.590> be<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.860> start<00:02:15.130> of<00:02:15.190> this

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
I think this might be the start of this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.490 
I think this might be the start of this
segment<00:02:15.490> yeah<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:16.600> right<00:02:17.050> there<00:02:17.290> they

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
segment yeah like right there they

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.280 
segment yeah like right there they
cheated<00:02:17.890> me<00:02:18.040> but<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.700> do<00:02:19.480> go<00:02:19.750> through<00:02:19.780> for<00:02:20.260> a

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
cheated me but I do go through for a

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.070 
cheated me but I do go through for a
while<00:02:20.500> not<00:02:21.130> getting<00:02:21.340> any<00:02:21.610> kills<00:02:21.940> okay<00:02:22.930> this

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
while not getting any kills okay this

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.990 
while not getting any kills okay this
isn't<00:02:23.290> it<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.160> think<00:02:24.430> it's<00:02:24.550> during<00:02:24.850> like

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
isn't it it I think it's during like

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.720 
isn't it it I think it's during like
three<00:02:25.840> two<00:02:26.140> one<00:02:26.320> minute<00:02:26.950> somewhere<00:02:27.520> in<00:02:27.610> there

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
three two one minute somewhere in there

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.190 
three two one minute somewhere in there
about<00:02:27.850> two<00:02:28.120> minutes<00:02:28.150> run<00:02:28.570> just<00:02:28.810> can't<00:02:29.080> get

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
about two minutes run just can't get

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.000 
about two minutes run just can't get
anything<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.370> also<00:02:30.910> another<00:02:31.540> good<00:02:32.350> strategy

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
anything but also another good strategy

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.110 
anything but also another good strategy
to<00:02:33.640> use<00:02:33.670> is<00:02:34.650> always<00:02:35.650> try

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
to use is always try

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.390 
to use is always try
always<00:02:37.840> try<00:02:38.140> and<00:02:38.170> get<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.980> final<00:02:39.340> bonus<00:02:39.670> um<00:02:41.400> so

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
always try and get the final bonus um so

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.170 
always try and get the final bonus um so
just<00:02:43.330> wait<00:02:43.540> until<00:02:43.870> about<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:45.129> five<00:02:45.700> seconds

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
just wait until about like five seconds

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.000 
just wait until about like five seconds
left<00:02:46.330> ten<00:02:46.599> seconds<00:02:46.959> left<00:02:47.019> and<00:02:47.319> then<00:02:47.500> go<00:02:47.769> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
left ten seconds left and then go and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.880 
left ten seconds left and then go and
attack<00:02:49.019> because<00:02:50.019> if<00:02:50.140> you<00:02:50.230> do<00:02:50.349> attack<00:02:50.709> with

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
attack because if you do attack with

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.170 
attack because if you do attack with
like<00:02:51.010> 30<00:02:51.190> seconds<00:02:51.549> left<00:02:51.700> you're<00:02:51.879> gonna<00:02:51.970> end<00:02:52.090> up

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.890 
I was trying my strategy of letting the
people<00:03:27.549> go<00:03:27.760> first<00:03:28.000> in<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.239> me<00:03:28.329> going<00:03:28.659> but<00:03:28.780> they

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
people go first in the me going but they

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.089 
people go first in the me going but they
kept<00:03:29.109> getting<00:03:29.379> him<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> first<00:03:29.709> time<00:03:29.859> because

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
kept getting him the first time because

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.619 
kept getting him the first time because
the<00:03:30.340> guy<00:03:30.430> would<00:03:30.640> not<00:03:30.819> kill<00:03:31.060> him<00:03:31.239> for<00:03:31.480> some

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
the guy would not kill him for some

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.770 
the guy would not kill him for some
reason<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.680> i<00:03:33.150> don't<00:03:34.150> know<00:03:34.209> maybe<00:03:34.450> I<00:03:34.540> was<00:03:34.690> just

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
reason but i don't know maybe I was just

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.599

playing<00:03:35.019> with<00:03:35.140> some<00:03:35.319> bad<00:03:35.470> people<00:03:35.500> but<00:03:35.980> they

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609

possible but that they were adding this
because<00:04:03.700> I<00:04:03.790> thought<00:04:04.030> about<00:04:04.180> it<00:04:04.299> before<00:04:04.480> you

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690
