 hello friends channel has to have one more 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.600
 video here on the channel and today we are going 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.620
 talk about brewing schools what 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.969
 are the brewing schools which are and 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.170
 characteristics of the styles of 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.670
 each one of them 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:31.800
 so you can not miss this video 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:34.860
 right after the beer school vignette 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.829
 is the designation of origin or from where 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.829
 was born one or more styles of beer and 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.570
 also involves the issue of 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.539
 characteristics of a particular style 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.370
 which are dictated according to the school of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.670
 where it originated we currently have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.210
 four large German brewery schools 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.620
 Belgian, English and American, who 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.170
 characteristics of your 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.440
 own personality that have been 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.379
 formed over centuries of history 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.439
 Brewing Company 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.240
 recipes for brewing masters 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.670
 their particularities 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 the German school that encompasses the region of 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 in Germany as well as the region of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 of Bohemia in the Czech Republic 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 where the famous bohemian originated 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.939
 pilsner, then the German school is not 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.369
 formed only by Germany is formed 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.420
 also by the Czech Republic and 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.400
 feature of the German school and the 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.280
 efficiency of their production, the 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.770
 of their production and also the question of 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 of the German purity law does not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 allowed adjunct ingredients 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 spices in their recipes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.670
 only what is the basic beer standard 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.250
 water malt hops and yeast and the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.740
 main styles that are what they do 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:00.390
 part of the German school pilsner style 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.270
 unique reles o bok o hatib show and of course 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.610
 the great and famous beers of wheat to 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.069
 Belgian school that is formed by belgium 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.080
 the north of france and also the south of 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.620
 Netherlands 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:15.140
 which has as basic characteristic 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.320
 well- malted beers and 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.380
 also very complex because at school 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:24.770
 allow the addition of spices 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.490
 of new ingredients in basic recipe 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:31.970
 of the beer bringing aromas of flavors 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:34.130
 and the great school fort 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.620
 Belgian are also the yeast is because 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.800
 the Belgian yeasts they confer a 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.310
 very aromatic richness of flavors 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.860
 interesting is for your recipes 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.790
 are part of the style that 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:53.450
 make up the Belgian bond school and listen tibi 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.340
 dell floor that blew the strong and and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.590
 the famous bee four foot tripods 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.660
 Trappist beers do not even know it there. 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.820
 designation of origin on behalf of the 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.400
 Trappist monks and not only the quality 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.480
 recipes but at the end the Belgian school 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.810
 these revenues from these 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.760
 quite complex styles maybe the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.580
 more complex styles of all 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.310
 brewery schools to a company that 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.800
 born there in the British Isles is 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.380
 as characteristic the fact of having had 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.110
 a long historical period perhaps even 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.040
 older than the German school it right 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.550
 and because of this she alternated several 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 times which were her base styles 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.300
 right taking the sweeter beers and 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.180
 alcoholic to beer is also more 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.700
 more bland and lighter 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.890
 is in another very clear feature 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.720
 of the English school is the question of 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:56.239
 carbonation of beers then you 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:59.060
 take a bitter it's a carbonation 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.150
 lower and consequently it is also 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.720
 smaller foam formation does not have 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.690
 beers with a minimum of training and 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:13.070
 england at school english way 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:15.350
 general synonym of beer is and then 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:18.350
 ales they are in your 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:21.680
 all high fermentation beers 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.380
 even then there is much that uses it a lot to 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.850
 expression and I mean beer 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.750
 so in england you do not lose one 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.840
 guide you ask one and I'm you one 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.520
 addendum here is an additional up in the series 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:39.770
 game of thrones that is a personification 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.140
 English of kings and all that history 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.470
 you see when they ask for beer 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:48.800
 they ask him to wait in May, and the 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:53.870
 English school styles are peoas 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:58.190
 the doors to stout the health and the dancing wine 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:01.220
 brown and finally the bits that are to a range 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.410
 and styles of the English school and 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.420
 Finally, the American school 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.850
 the youngest of schools 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:10.580
 breweries born in the United States and 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.340
 has as main characteristic the high 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.370
 creativity of the brewer masters who 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.940
 already earmarked revenues from 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.590
 other large breweries and 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.780
 transform these recipes 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.580
 with new ingredients or maybe with 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:30.710
 greater quantities of the ingredients already 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.720
 standards of each recipe, and also in the 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.700
 United States, you have the planting of 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.460
 hops then you have lupus 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.820
 Americans who end up also creating 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:45.040
 aroma out and new features 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:47.000
 for American beers is the 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.060
 also characteristic of beer 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.490
 is the question of the search for the new 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.790
 by the extreme for example 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.830
 You take an apple and you bring it to English. 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.340
 American school is more heavily 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:04.370
 hops is more bitter and maybe even more 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.670
 aromatic then the United States 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:11.180
 In this new brewery school she has 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:13.790
 this garment of carrying more 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.370
 ingredients and because of this too 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.980
 we do not have a style of their own 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.020
 styles of the American school 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:24.680
 because the American school picks up 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.840
 styles already transformed and 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.340
 add your prefix so if you have 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.740
 an English ipa at the American school 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.320
 it is America and America in the 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.410
 team and then you put this prefix 

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.090
 at the beginning of the recipe name and then the 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:42.120
 American clothing for that 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:44.270
 determined is brewery revenue 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.710
 So, there you have a talking video. 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:49.050
 briefly on schools 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.820
 breweries we seek to address the 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.800
 most important information because 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:55.139
 all information we do not 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.690
 we will be able to put in a single video that 

00:06:55.139 --> 00:07:00.360
 There is a lot to be said about it. 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.979
 of each school regarding the history of 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.830
 each one of them but I wanted to make a 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.990
 General catch to bring you 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.900
 this information so that when you 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.120
 Hear, talk, look, that's beer. 

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.800
 more for the Belgian school but for the school 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.720
 you know what we 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.030
