00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
died a lot of times and then it ranks

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.280 
died a lot of times and then it ranks
you<00:05:29.710> when<00:05:30.100> you're<00:05:30.220> done<00:05:30.370> with<00:05:30.430> level<00:05:30.970> 0<00:05:31.260> so<00:05:32.260> far

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
you when you're done with level 0 so far

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.290 
you when you're done with level 0 so far
I've<00:05:32.680> gotten<00:05:33.070> nothing<00:05:33.280> higher<00:05:33.670> than<00:05:33.700> terrible

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
I've gotten nothing higher than terrible

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.230 
I've gotten nothing higher than terrible
which<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.870> lowest<00:05:35.380> rank<00:05:35.850> I've<00:05:36.850> so<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.060> just

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
which is lowest rank I've so I just

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.630 
which is lowest rank I've so I just
leveled<00:05:37.570> up<00:05:37.660> attack<00:05:38.410> power<00:05:38.650> increased<00:05:39.070> okay

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.640 
leveled up attack power increased okay

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:47.790 
leveled up attack power increased okay
so<00:05:40.090> I'm<00:05:40.210> at<00:05:40.360> level<00:05:40.540> 9<00:05:46.320> very<00:05:47.320> addictive

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
so I'm at level 9 very addictive

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.800 
so I'm at level 9 very addictive
gameplay<00:05:48.010> and<00:05:48.550> I<00:05:48.700> think<00:05:48.910> it<00:05:49.030> has<00:05:49.120> more<00:05:49.390> replay

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
gameplay and I think it has more replay

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.050 
gameplay and I think it has more replay
value<00:05:50.050> than<00:05:50.440> zombieville<00:05:50.920> did<00:05:51.190> because<00:05:52.030> you

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
value than zombieville did because you

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.190 
value than zombieville did because you

as far as I know it's just level to
level<00:06:12.640> two<00:06:12.910> level<00:06:13.260> so<00:06:14.260> I'm<00:06:14.440> going<00:06:14.620> to<00:06:14.650> pause

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980
