 we got here to toronto canada this 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.659
 beautiful landscape with the volunteer 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.950
 we are with our medalist who is 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.020
 making history and logically with this 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.700
 Presea 13 gold medals for our 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.079
 peru how do you feel what your 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.820
 first impressions logically then 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.320
 is the natalia award itself very 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.960
 excited do not wait for me you can have 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.840
 the black and if it exceeds the determined and happy 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.969
 for all 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.070
 we chat just in a few minutes 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:50.649
 before out of camera logically that 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.840
 you found almost without words with then 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.630
 of knowing this result I am too 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.659
 happy in skiing what happens is that 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.509
 I figure if it's 20 seconds two passes 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.950
 in 20 seconds and it takes 30 minutes 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.259
 what the points and the judges say 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.600
 evaluate then those 30 seconds were 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.340
 the worst 30 seconds of my life I am 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.780
 too nervous I did not know if it was that 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.760
 two seconds it has been first or 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.989
 third in three days after the 30 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.670
 seconds when they made news of the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.590
 incredible results 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.780
 it was a spectacular moment it has not 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.450
 finished the tests and by the speaker 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.900
 They said in Natales Julian of Peru 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.549
 idea 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.170
 with the score but you do not mean 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.480
 absolutely nothing because it was not official 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.459
 they still have 30 seconds to 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.349
 change it too you try for 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.170
 change it then I did not want to say anything 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.760
 until I'm sure they had 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 hiding place 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.290
 but good family the whole family 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:50.799

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:53.599
 they support me in everything and I am happy that 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.010
 my work is very happy for my themes 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.349
 I'm already video and my family too 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.750
 I just left the water of greasy china and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.150
 you're so good you see us it's amazing 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.189
 We are live for all of Peru 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.420
 Let's see if you can communicate 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:06.769
 combine anyway with with 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.090
 gustavo that is right in the 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.069
 site study please put in the 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.930
 auricular gustavo listens to you natalia 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.689
 July to our medalist in the game 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.489
 panamericanos natalia how are you a kiss 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:19.069
 in the distance congratulations for this 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.829
 extraordinary result as you said 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:25.159
 we saw the proof and the attention before the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:28.200
 wait is very hard but those 20 40 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:31.260
 seconds between one pass and the other 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.180
 like the looser shots let's say here 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.620
 I will do what they at the time 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.620
 of the figures 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.400
 and then the first pass was a lot 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.049
 quieter because in the first 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.540
 last, which is worth the most points 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.280
 had gone very well and already for the 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.620
 second only wanted to do everything 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.450
 because he knew he could be among the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.459
 first three posts now the 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.030
 difficulty in the afternoon is that first 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.100
 you go 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.680
 holding hands on the rope and then 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.310
 of feet that is a bit the difficulty of 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.310
 being passed 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.370
 and it strengthens me the foot pass is what 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.510
 what I like the most is what I train 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.030
 then I was super quiet for the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.560
 second pass but for the first 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.260
 I was a little more nervous because 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.210
 mortals are not my strength too 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.819
 It takes me to fall 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.430
 some tremendous rivals must be highlighted 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:31.319
 also that this victory is against a 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.960
 world youth champion like the pnc and 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:35.310
 it's like against the Canadian who has 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.690
 won a lot of medals not 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.819
 only in these Pan-American ones but 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.440
 also in guadalajara, I had two 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.930
 great competitors I think that the 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.340
 three others from the final were not in 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.410
 reality with the possibility of climbing 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.240
 podium but between you three in a 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.550
 very equal fight not for anyone and 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.690
 that's why he had his despair in these 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.690
 30 minutes of waiting 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.330
 erika and the canadian whitney are usually 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.270
 improve six faces of the world's trick 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.379
 they are top 5 and it has been a great honor for 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.229
 compete against them 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.529
 today was not his best day and I had the 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.959
 lucky to be able to do my two past 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.829
 so I 'm very happy I did the best 

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:16.289
 I could 

00:05:13.829 --> 00:05:18.299
 this time but necessary for the 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.189
 running in first place 

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.779
