00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.840
 let's start the study of planimetry first 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.330
 briefly tell you what it is 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.129
 then proceed directly to the lesson 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.260
 main theoretical points 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.570
 consider simple tasks 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.130
 the simplest definition of planimetry 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.110
 can be found in the dahl dictionary 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.900
 planimetry this part of geometry 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.210
 plane figures 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.030
 this is an example of two-dimensional space or 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.579
 2d in simple terms we will 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.250
 study shapes in 2d 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.500
 move on to solving problems number 1 dan 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.780
 triangle with sides a b and c 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 known angles alpha and beta 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.540
 you need to find the gamma and delta angles for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.760
 solutions we need to remember 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.090
 some rules namely the sum of the angles 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.910
 the triangle is 180 degrees this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.730
 calculated by the formula of the sum of the angles 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:00.690
 polygon the sum of the angles is n minus 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.360
 2 times 180 where n is equal to quantity 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.600
 polygon corners in this case 3 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.499
 from here we can find hama hama is equal 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.749
 180 minus the sum of alpha and beta 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:14.689
 second angle adjacent to any angle 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.759
 triangles and any polygon 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.060
 call external in the sum these adjacent 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.899
 angles are 180 degrees mean angle 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.909
 the delta is the outer 3 outer corner 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.670
 a triangle is equal to the sum of two angles 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.409
 triangles non adjacent delta 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.810
 equal alpha + beta 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.999
 the following are a few basic 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.909
 definitions that will be needed for 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.149
 problem solving further problem examples 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.679
 can be found in the text of the lecture 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.749
 the bisectors of the triangle drawn from 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.939
 a given vertex is called a segment 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.429
 connecting this vertex with a point on 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.399
 opposite side and dividing angle 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.139
 at this top in half height 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.149
 triangles drawn from this 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.130
 vertices called perpendicular 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.139
 omitted from this vertex on 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.590
 the opposite side or her 

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:06.299
 continuation of the median of a triangle 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.910
 drawn from a given vertex is called 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.630
 the segment coming out of the corner of the triangle and 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.130
 dividing the opposite side in half 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.770
 the middle line of the triangle is called 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.110
 the segment connecting the middle of two sides 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.030
 and 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.160
 and the triangle this line is always 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.620
 parallel to the third party and in length 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.270
 equal to her half 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.100
 the perimeter of the triangle is the sum 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.860
 lengths of all sides of the triangle 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.870
 denoted by the letter n so we 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.330
 We considered the main properties that 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.040
 applicable to all kinds of triangles 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.490
 Now consider what are 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.170
 triangles and their features exist 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.040
 several types of triangles 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.740
 isosceles regular rectangular 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.480
 and arbitrary isosceles this 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:51.490
 a triangle in which the lengths of two sides 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.250
 equal these two sides are called 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.080
 lateral and third bases in 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.330
 isosceles triangle angles at 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.459
 the grounds are equal and if hold the height 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.250
 from opposite the bottom of the top 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.739
 then it will be a bisector and a median 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.900
 right triangle is a triangle 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.570
 where all sides are equal in length and all 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.209
 60 degree angles here are a few 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.739
 properties of a regular triangle all 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.170
 the heights of the triangle are 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.410
 at the same time and media us and bisector 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.660
 my 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.330
 their length is half the length of the side 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.880
 multiplied by the root of 3. their 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.040
 intersection is the center of the inscribed and 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.560
 circumscribed circle and is called 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.170
 center of a right triangle by 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.420
 property of medians it divides each height 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.049
 in relation to two to one counting from 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.739
 tops 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.200
 that is, r is large and r is small 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.470
 circumference is 3 lengths 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.390
 sides to the root of 3 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.580
 the radius of the inscribed circle is 6 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.230
 parts of the length of the side multiplied by the root 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.130
 of 3 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.980
 right triangle is 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.290
 a triangle in which one angle is 90 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.110
 degrees this angle is called 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.580
 straight sides adjacent right angle 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.769
 called cathets 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.760
 side against a 90 degree angle 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.290
 called the hypotenuse pythagorean theorem 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.470
 in a right triangle square 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.739
 hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.109
 that is, c squared equals a squared plus b 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.459
 square studying a right triangle 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.120
 easy go to trigonometry and so 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.040
 trigonometric relationships in 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.410
 right triangle following 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.230
 take the angle alpha lying against 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:30.110
 parties 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.920
 and sine alpha is equal to opposite 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.170
 side divided by hypotenuse 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:39.560
 cosine alpha equals side adjacent 

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:42.410
 divided by hypotenuse and tangent alpha 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.780
 equal the opposite side divided by 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.230
 adjacent to some tasks 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.660
 on trigonometry knowledge is necessary 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.850
 standard trigonometric values 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.860
 functions they are given in the text of lectures 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.630
 back to the types of triangles 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.880
 arbitrary we will call 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.340
 triangle not falling under any of 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.500
 of the definitions previously parsed it has 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.710
 property which we listed at the beginning 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.710
 the lesson 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.819
 so knowing what kinds are 

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:13.649
 triangles we move on to the next 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:16.219
 the area of ​​the triangle 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:18.779
 it can be found in five different ways. 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:21.059
 the area of ​​an arbitrary triangle is equal to 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:24.629
 side and height 

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:27.539
 dropped on this side also it is equal 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:29.929
 half the product of the two sides on 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.369
 sine of angle between them 

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:35.969
 area can also be calculated by the formula 

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:37.860
 Heron crash small this is a semi perimeter 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:41.339
 a triangle that is equal to half 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.589
 the sum of the sides of the area of ​​the triangle is also 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:45.689
 equal to the product of the perimeter floor 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:50.909

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:02.039
 area of ​​a right triangle 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:04.949
 can be calculated as follows semi 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.569
 his artworks 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:09.599
 a regular triangle is equal to a square 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:12.629

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.909
 divided by 4 parse tasks on 

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:17.129
 application of these formulas you can find 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.439
 in the text of the lecture we are almost finished 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.389
 studying the topic triangle left 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:23.599
 recall two theorems that you 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:26.069
 help in solving problems in stereometry 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:28.139
 sine length theorem 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.300
 triangles are proportional to sine 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.550
 opposite angles and coefficient 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.319
 proportionality is equal to the diameter 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.079
 circumscribed around a triangle of a circle 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.999
 that is, two radii
