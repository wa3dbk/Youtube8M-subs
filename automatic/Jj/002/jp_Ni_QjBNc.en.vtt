00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
patterns one sheet each so I'm curious

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.390

is on you get all these different

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.289 
is on you get all these different
patterns<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.519> they<00:00:46.699> would<00:00:46.850> all<00:00:46.940> work<00:00:47.089> really

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:47.299 
patterns and they would all work really

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:49.030 
patterns and they would all work really
well<00:00:47.449> together<00:00:47.780> because<00:00:48.199> of<00:00:48.500> the<00:00:48.650> general

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
though you know when they think origami

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.740 
though you know when they think origami
paper<00:02:32.740> they<00:02:33.010> think<00:02:33.280> Japanese<00:02:34.030> and

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
paper they think Japanese and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.540 
paper they think Japanese and
traditional<00:02:35.410> and<00:02:35.860> everything<00:02:36.250> looks<00:02:36.400> like

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
traditional and everything looks like

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.310 
traditional and everything looks like
it's<00:02:36.730> made<00:02:36.880> out<00:02:36.940> of<00:02:37.060> silk<00:02:37.480> and<00:02:37.690> kimonos<00:02:38.290> and

it's made out of silk and kimonos and

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.380 
it's made out of silk and kimonos and
all<00:02:38.710> that<00:02:38.890> and<00:02:39.130> something<00:02:39.850> like<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.210> might

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
all that and something like this might

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.970 
all that and something like this might
be<00:02:40.570> really<00:02:40.720> off-putting<00:02:41.020> and<00:02:41.560> because<00:02:41.800> it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
be really off-putting and because it's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.850 
be really off-putting and because it's
not<00:02:42.130> you<00:02:42.520> know<00:02:42.630> traditionally<00:02:43.630> Japanese<00:02:44.200> but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
not you know traditionally Japanese but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.560 
not you know traditionally Japanese but
if<00:02:45.100> you're<00:02:45.250> just<00:02:45.400> looking<00:02:45.490> for<00:02:45.760> something<00:02:46.120> fun

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
if you're just looking for something fun

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.020 
if you're just looking for something fun
and<00:02:46.990> what's<00:02:47.560> popular<00:02:48.130> now<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.850> is

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
and what's popular now this is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.760 
and what's popular now this is
definitely<00:02:49.450> something<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.590> that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
definitely something that is for that

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.860 
definitely something that is for that
now<00:02:51.280> when<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.520> look<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:51.970> kind<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.540> up<00:02:52.660> close

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
now when you look at it kind of up close

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.900 
now when you look at it kind of up close
it<00:02:53.170> looks<00:02:53.200> almost<00:02:53.500> like<00:02:53.650> it's<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.880> a

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
it looks almost like it's like a

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.400 
it looks almost like it's like a
replication<00:02:55.570> of<00:02:55.630> something<00:02:55.930> that's<00:02:56.110> been<00:02:56.380> on

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
replication of something that's been on

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.000 
replication of something that's been on
like<00:02:56.710> cotton<00:02:57.340> maybe<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.200> get<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> little<00:02:59.440> kind<00:02:59.920> of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
like cotton maybe I get a little kind of

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.770 
like cotton maybe I get a little kind of
sense<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:00.610> when<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.820> look<00:03:01.060> at<00:03:01.210> it<00:03:01.360> here<00:03:01.540> but

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
sense of that when I look at it here but

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.260 
sense of that when I look at it here but
let's<00:03:02.140> see<00:03:02.620> how<00:03:02.770> how<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.580> folds<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.940> colors

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
let's see how how it folds the colors

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.430 
let's see how how it folds the colors
are<00:03:07.390> really<00:03:07.510> bright<00:03:07.840> nice<00:03:08.740> pattern<00:03:10.410> into<00:03:11.410> the

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
are really bright nice pattern into the

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.410 
are really bright nice pattern into the
paper<00:03:11.830> like<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.130> said<00:03:12.340> is<00:03:12.460> a<00:03:12.490> good<00:03:12.760> weight<00:03:13.090> it's

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
paper like I said is a good weight it's

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.920 
paper like I said is a good weight it's
crisp<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.320> it<00:03:14.410> holds<00:03:14.590> its<00:03:14.710> crease<00:03:15.100> well<00:03:15.930> I'll

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
crisp so it holds its crease well I'll

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.090 
crisp so it holds its crease well I'll
go<00:03:17.020> ahead<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.170> finish<00:03:17.380> this<00:03:17.590> off<00:03:17.800> and<00:03:17.950> show

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
go ahead and finish this off and show

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.530 
go ahead and finish this off and show
you<00:03:18.190> guys<00:03:18.310> what's<00:03:18.610> like<00:03:18.760> when<00:03:18.940> it's<00:03:19.090> done<00:03:19.270> I

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
you guys what's like when it's done I

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.110 
you guys what's like when it's done I
would<00:03:20.440> definitely<00:03:20.590> say<00:03:20.860> compared<00:03:21.670> to<00:03:21.760> some<00:03:22.090> of

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
would definitely say compared to some of

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.880 
would definitely say compared to some of
the<00:03:22.270> other<00:03:22.300> paper<00:03:23.110> that<00:03:23.500> I've<00:03:23.590> been<00:03:23.710> buying

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
the other paper that I've been buying

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.130 
the other paper that I've been buying
recently<00:03:24.520> from<00:03:24.760> this<00:03:25.150> particular<00:03:25.420> hundred<00:03:26.020> in

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
recently from this particular hundred in

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.560 
recently from this particular hundred in
store<00:03:26.500> because<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.670> I'd<00:03:27.820> say<00:03:28.030> because<00:03:28.390> you

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
store because and I'd say because you

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.449 
store because and I'd say because you
can<00:03:28.720> usually<00:03:28.990> tell<00:03:29.350> by<00:03:29.560> how<00:03:29.800> many<00:03:29.860> sheets<00:03:30.220> that

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
can usually tell by how many sheets that

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.130 
can usually tell by how many sheets that
are<00:03:30.490> the<00:03:30.850> quality<00:03:31.360> is<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.750> be<00:03:31.870> higher

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
are the quality is going to be higher

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.050 
are the quality is going to be higher
when<00:03:32.170> there's<00:03:32.560> less<00:03:32.800> sheets<00:03:33.160> because<00:03:33.760> there's

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
when there's less sheets because there's

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.210 
when there's less sheets because there's
only<00:03:34.180> 16<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.930> here<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.350> paper<00:03:35.560> is<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:35.920> little

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
only 16 in here the paper is a little

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.240 
only 16 in here the paper is a little
thicker<00:03:36.490> I<00:03:36.790> think<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.270> folds<00:03:37.690> nicer<00:03:38.250> because

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
thicker I think it folds nicer because

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.650 
thicker I think it folds nicer because
of<00:03:39.580> that<00:03:39.700> you<00:03:39.880> get<00:03:40.000> something<00:03:40.360> a<00:03:40.390> little<00:03:40.570> more

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
of that you get something a little more

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.390 
of that you get something a little more
