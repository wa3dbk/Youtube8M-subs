00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello everyone big white is tackling 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.099
 housing segment with its first 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.900
 solution the silence down 1800 we got 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.910
 deal with a medium-round casing by 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.500
 against large format or multiple 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.570
 originality is present in order to 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 distinguish the builder worked 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.740
 the design and the features we are going 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.140
 see all this in detail now 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.320
 for sure they undergo it offers a 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.420
 design spell with a clean front 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.460
 on the other hand, originality we have a liseret 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 surrounding the two openings the liseret 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.090
 and if you are looking for a silver finish 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.100
 it is possible to find in black or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.350
 still in orange the front facade 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.350
 consists of two parts a small door 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.180
 giving access to four bay caches 5 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 1/4 inch on the other hand there are only three 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.510
 locations 5 inches a case on the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 below we have a hatch 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.469
 opening by simple pressure tomorrow 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.160
 this time access a filter 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.530
 anti-dust protecting the 240 mm 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 before it comes to pure fans 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.539
 windows the casing ensures its maintenance 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.000
 with wide legs 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.070
 here we are dealing with a silver finish 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 it's up to the exit of the box 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.030
 nothing complicated that this clip simply 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.990
 in the chassis here we are dealing with 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.580
 plastic 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.229
 both side panels are equipped 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.180
 an originality we have a hatch 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.820
 Adjustable ventilation that is to say we have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.170
 an ergo system inside that he 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.180
 must push the EU outside what 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.100
 allows to deport the hatch and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.310
 to increase the opening for the flow 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.020
 air when I reread offers not 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 less than seven expansion slots with 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.460
 pci brackets perforated one also has 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.619
 passes bulkheads for a watercooling and 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.130
 a third fan this time 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
 in 120 mm and not in 140 mm it 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.909
 still belongs to the pure range 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.770
 muniz of food is placed on 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.540
 the bottom accompanied by an anti filter 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.250
 dust this is the second this 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.829
 once removable from the back by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.659
 a small plastic tab 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.009
 will find the inter a handed coating 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.960
 louis present on both panels 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.880
 side and on the front 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the door and the hatch as one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.630
 you explained it we have a hatch 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.759
 side air vent thereof 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.680
 has the advantage and hopefully efficiency 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.190
 to provide fresh air directly to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.380
 level 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.210
 Mapping management is simple to 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.520
 made by small plastic pins 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.700
 just pinch and push for 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.290
 increase or decrease the air intake on 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.360
 chassis this time he wants himself 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.470
 compatible with the tea format xx 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.960
 micro-atx and mini-itx a single column 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.700
 brings together the two hard drive cages 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.340
 as well as the three locations 5 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.590
 inch 1/4 with a generalization of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.390
 quick bindings a maximum of seven 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.400
 hard drives can be installed or 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
 still three optical drives at all 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.610
 accompanied by four ssd in 2.5 format 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.030
 inch 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.560
 to sum up the cooling 1 120 in 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.420
 extraction in the back two hundred 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.880
 forty years the inspiration at the bank 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.700
 question compatibility we will find 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.340
 170 mm at the maximum height 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.050
 authorized for the ventirad is at the level 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.830
 graphics card a generous space 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.840
 since this one of 290 mm with the cage 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.640
 hard drive and if it is removed 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.110
 we will go this time to 400 mm on 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.600
 28 cents movie before arguments 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.420
 noise-reduction coating internally three 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.850
 fans with 840 of the 120 hatches 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.410
 aeration adjustable side a 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.239
 connector on the other hand placed on the top 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.160
 which implies that the case 8 can 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.800
 to be placed on the ground we have the right 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.220
 usb3 usb2 case if audio jack 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.780
 headset microphone and central button tower 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.580
 we therefore propose to find you on 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.380
 the site scifo points like for a test 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.600
 complete to know his 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.790
 benefits in terms of silence but 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.519
 also cooling knowing that 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.050
 the architect is generous capable of 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.370
 take long graphic cards this 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.290
 which implies that gaming 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.330
 normally should not make him too much 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.190
 so scared right away on the site 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.570
 jean needs for a complete test of this 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.430
 novelty big wyeth 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.430
