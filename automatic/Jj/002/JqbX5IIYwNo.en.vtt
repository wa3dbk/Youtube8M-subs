00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello how about you guys how are you if you do not 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.730
 traffic comments on a new video and in this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.690
 occasion we are at an extreme to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:26.510
 minecraft 29.5 this writer is called in 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.510
 hotel zeppelin and this way then 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:34.790
 did not authorize and they open a green drop 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.690
 meaning and how is the only thing that you have 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 What to do is generate a structure 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.660
 is 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.360
 I will genre 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.350
 the only thing you just have to build 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.350
 anything 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.730
 but tests 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.690
 and you can see that 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.690
 anything 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.249
 yes 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.249
 a little yes 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 but 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.950
 wake up because it's just a test 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.130
 just catch them 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.720
 ready 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:21.970
 we have to give it and we will need 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.970
 first iron 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.009
 you can also find these cousins ​​that 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.009
 what we get 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.380
 and what I need is two blocks of 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.310
 there 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 two blocks 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.700
 now we give it here and we get the 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:52.280
 defensive I'm going to believe me another and 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.120
 I already have it that now the only thing 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:00.250
 we have to do is give a click 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.070
 to the structure and they appear in the 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.370
 controls these controls are for uploading 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.550
 lower the palate so that it goes more 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.660
 faster slower to go north 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.650
 south east and west we have nothing to give 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.220
 aft 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.770
 we go to a small one but that does not matter 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.260
 because it is not coming up 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:31.930
 and this when we go up a bit we see this 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.590
 as we see in the uploaded very sound 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.530
 let's go to the ground 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.840
 now we want to go north of course 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.550
 the north will not be there 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.510
 London by fire in the north so 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:50.709
 this world the north is for 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.250
 it is here for the left and we 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.490
 let's go north this 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:03:03.930
 let's go faster let's give it to 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:06.659
 80 and 90 in the event or exit east 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.620
 and so it seems that we are going to fall and 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:09.620
 we will know 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.200
 we can not generate any structure 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.600
 that we want we can climb 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.770
 this we say in the car and go flying 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.040
 I 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.430
 I love this one that is 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.350
 is one of the best I would say 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.569
 i 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:39.630
 the update is really good 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:44.160
 and let's try what the new one brings 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.030
 what we need is full goal 2 and 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.030
 sixth 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.900
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.129
 this the clicks 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.129
 the fret 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:06.980
 I want to have because it's cut or 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.660
 we put and we create them 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:13.280
 if he 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.320
 the net one is here it is and I'm missing the 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.320
 perfect dynamite 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.740
 and now I have two together and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.740
 we eat is a troop 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.349
 of tintín 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:35.990
 now we can place in any 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:41.140
 place for example this we take 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:44.140
 and we take the second to activate it 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.140
 electric 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.130
 one click and loose a dynamite as we see 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.130
 results 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.380
 as we see alone we go click click 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.360
 and release two twigs so this 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.360
 I'm also very funny very good 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:09.419
 this continues more we follow 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:11.760
 we can be a bit speed a 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.220
 bit slower so it's perfect 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.210
 but that you liked it and if it was like that and
