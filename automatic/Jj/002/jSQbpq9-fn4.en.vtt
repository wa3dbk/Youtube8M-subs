00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.240

 Chutsuki 28 days jammed the other day it is to have to go in the suite line also we have recruited

 Two people who volunteered to come are called Oishi 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.970
 a 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:34.200
 In even though I was finished with that over a variety of flowers 1 Somo 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 Another decision because say whether the actual results after the seat output to at all I thought about 6:00 pm Do not amazing question was 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.310
 I will 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.310
 It may be different 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.090
 Hmm 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.090
 Yes 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 The 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.490
 First of all 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.720
 Fujinami and Prism Dragon's 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.330
 Smash day is what turns 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.460
 2 cases 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.250
 I also This is you want to let me written in true horror because 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.980
 Let's go ahead of the news 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.590
 Come on 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:20.909
 After all I really want to do 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.619
 that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.619
 I thought I would not raise my hand 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.720
 But good 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.470
 Referred to as the first player to say Tatsumi Fujinami's 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.610
 That's 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.900
 Among the existing legend wrestler 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.320
 I think it is the highest peak 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 that is 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.160
 After all 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:48.750
 Wrestling that I would like to make 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.640
 Almost completely square-cho 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.600
 Have a prototype 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600
 I think that I have 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.830
 After all it is born in business professional wrestling somehow why all Japan professional wrestling giant 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.570
 Tteyuu have Baba's specific taste 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.909
 Changed 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:13.700
 Everybody who is born is doing 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:18.080
 After all, cormorants actually also try to Rokappu one person taking a look at the game of the moment to lock up 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.910
 I think tension is really the best in the world 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.630
 It's really just a name match 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.480
 It is really different again 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.709
 As a racer 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.709
 This is a great person 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.069
 It is and seemed 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.510
 By all means 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.930
 I wanted to do it 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.510
 But we do things a little personal 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.569
 My father is 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.480
 You died on August 28, last year 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.799
 that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.370
 Father of which is I'm just like a more than Tatsumi Fujinami Sato 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:57.830
 Calligrapher wants to show you 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:03.860
 It looks like it's exactly like cherry blossoms are on the floor 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.340
 I guess it's time of about kindergarten and high-year-old when I is small when the body is also small and have all 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.850
 Already 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:12.050
 Wrestling fun day that father is great 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:13.350
 My father put me on the wrestling venue and baptized wrestling 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.940
 I am receiving 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:23.660
 When small 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.660
 When it's time to go to bed, my dad pulls my futon and my dad wrestles me 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.420
 I think it's a idiot 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:34.350
 I 'm the fifth leader 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:36.540
 At that time I went to see for the first time and saw it as a souvenir because the bi cannon was still there 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.440
 I gave you your granny 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:47.480
 Later this Brazil- san was coming flowers 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:50.910
 That's what I like in real time and I am shown to my dad 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:56.000
 I want to become a professional wrestling I think elementary school 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.960
 A book called professional wrestling Introduction to personal property ask to buy one elementary school 4 meters 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.060
 The 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.060
 Why did I have a variety of wrestling skills genius education 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.860
 It is not know how to become a professional wrestler turned teen 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.900
 Karina will house from the time being 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.550
 Road 2 to buy 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.600
 That's why 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.489
 There is such a meaning, too 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.269
 Equipment dad 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.110
 The cute become the 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:27.510
 Still amazing that the unique when it becomes without 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:30.210
 I do not know if that what was I gone mainland 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.420
 It is a sense 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.449
 Big 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:37.050
 View Fujinagi's and passed it 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:42.229
 Is that issue to 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.229
 I do not want to wrestle with my father again 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.669
 There 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.910
 Ring 's 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.540
 I want to do it 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.540
 uoa 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.340
 Mr. Ultimo Dragon 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.160
 Ultimo Dragon Mountain 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.430
 North 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:01.200
 For the first time 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:06.500
 Wrestling 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:06.500
 Always's before still be incurring undercover 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.740
 The era of universal 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.490
 The history of 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.840
 I think it 's ridiculously relieved 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.840
 I receive the picture culture shock 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:27.020
 After all , hit mexico with one body and create my own status 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.840
 Change up to the history of passing 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.000
 Also draw Kono's a weapon now 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.540
 I think that I can not sleep with my feet facing 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.540
 This industry 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.740
 Mr. çˆº 1 1 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:47.070
 After all , influenced by Mr. Asai 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.529
 Time also to be a dragon of 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.330
 What's Virtua 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:52.610
 Say smash 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.020
 real 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:58.120
 I'm eating a minute 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.120
 It is a person that might founder 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:05.439
 In the sense that so 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:08.630
 Ultimo dragon's is might be rude to say Legend 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:10.310
 I am active 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.289
 truly 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:17.520
 It's like a god whose hand is likely to reach 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:19.529
 I think the Japanese El's 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.139
 Say so 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:25.600
 Three Ultimo Dragons 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:27.569
 Tatsumi Fujinami's say mad to take the world Tsu press 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.289
 This is ridiculous 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:33.400
 I think so 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:36.240
 Is it wonderful that Fujinami Ryosa 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.240
 Say back will bankrupt the 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.590
 To be scolded 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:45.889
 Cormorants etc. the original professional wrestling is also the industry 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:48.919

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:53.700
 I wonder if that's right oh smosh 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:56.540
 It seems that there is a certain difference in the movement industry 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.620
