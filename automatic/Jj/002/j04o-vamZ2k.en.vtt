00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.800 
I got sort of a who knows which I
thought<00:02:51.370> would<00:02:51.549> complicate<00:02:51.940> my<00:02:52.180> design

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
thought would complicate my design

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.720 
thought would complicate my design
because<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.170> event-related<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:54.069> mustache<00:02:54.459> for

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
because I event-related a mustache for

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.640 
because I event-related a mustache for
this<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:55.629> I<00:02:55.720> wasn't<00:02:55.900> sure<00:02:56.080> if<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.349> would<00:02:56.440> fit

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
this and I wasn't sure if it would fit

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.440 
this and I wasn't sure if it would fit
over<00:02:56.680> top<00:02:56.860> that<00:02:57.760> didn't<00:02:58.030> end<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.150> being<00:02:58.360> an

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
over top that didn't end up being an

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.050 
over top that didn't end up being an
issue<00:02:58.599> I<00:02:58.959> worry<00:02:59.799> about<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.250> edge<00:03:00.489> because

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
issue I worry about that edge because

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.670 
issue I worry about that edge because
the<00:03:01.599> edge<00:03:01.870> show<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.260> kind<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.620> thick<00:03:03.220> so<00:03:03.640> I

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
the edge show is kind of thick so I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.890 
the edge show is kind of thick so I
don't<00:03:05.680> know<00:03:05.799> like<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:06.700> mean<00:03:07.209> I<00:03:07.420> did<00:03:07.660> good<00:03:07.840> job

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
don't know like if I mean I did good job

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.740 
don't know like if I mean I did good job
or<00:03:08.349> not<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.860> think<00:03:08.980> here<00:03:09.489> mostly<00:03:09.880> at<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.480> end<00:03:10.510> of

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
or not I think here mostly at the end of

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.210 
or not I think here mostly at the end of
it<00:03:10.840> competing<00:03:11.230> against<00:03:11.620> yourself

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
it competing against yourself

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.640 
it competing against yourself
not<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:12.910> much<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.239> other<00:03:13.360> people<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.260> really
