00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
to change it so if I pick white for

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.760 
to change it so if I pick white for
instance<00:03:00.330> then<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.900> white<00:03:01.110> bar<00:03:01.350> will<00:03:01.470> appear<00:03:01.560> at

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
instance then a white bar will appear at

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.470 
instance then a white bar will appear at
the<00:03:01.800> very<00:03:02.010> top<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.460> device<00:03:02.820> that<00:03:03.360> will

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
the very top of the device that will

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.730 
the very top of the device that will
then<00:03:03.600> allow<00:03:03.660> you<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.140> actually<00:03:04.260> go<00:03:04.530> through

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
then allow you to actually go through

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.440 
then allow you to actually go through
and<00:03:04.950> change<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.310> volume<00:03:05.490> on<00:03:05.820> your<00:03:06.060> device

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
and change the volume on your device

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.600 
and change the volume on your device
you've<00:03:07.140> also<00:03:07.290> then<00:03:07.530> got<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.680> volume<00:03:08.010> scrubber

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
you've also then got a volume scrubber

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.220 
you've also then got a volume scrubber
which<00:03:08.880> control<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.300> volume<00:03:09.480> by<00:03:09.720> dragging<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
which control the volume by dragging the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.900 
which control the volume by dragging the
progress<00:03:10.650> bar<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.280> fortunately<00:03:11.850> this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
progress bar and fortunately this

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.550 
progress bar and fortunately this
doesn't<00:03:12.270> work<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:12.870> think<00:03:13.110> it's<00:03:13.320> to<00:03:13.440> do<00:03:13.530> with

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
doesn't work and I think it's to do with

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.440 
doesn't work and I think it's to do with
the<00:03:13.680> actual<00:03:13.980> device<00:03:14.250> as<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.640> may<00:03:14.790> work<00:03:14.970> on<00:03:15.150> some

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
the actual device as it may work on some

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.630 
the actual device as it may work on some
but<00:03:15.750> doesn't<00:03:16.050> unfortunate<00:03:16.470> work<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.800> mine<00:03:17.010> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
but doesn't unfortunate work on mine you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.000 
but doesn't unfortunate work on mine you
can<00:03:17.790> also<00:03:17.910> do<00:03:18.150> expand<00:03:18.660> automatically<00:03:19.530> which

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
can also do expand automatically which

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.100 
can also do expand automatically which
always<00:03:20.220> shows<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.790> expanded<00:03:21.270> panel<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:21.900> again

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
always shows the expanded panel so again

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.810 
always shows the expanded panel so again
if<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.320> go<00:03:22.380> back<00:03:22.590> into<00:03:22.800> choose<00:03:23.160> style<00:03:23.460> and

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
if I go back into choose style and

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.910 
if I go back into choose style and
expanded<00:03:24.450> volume<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.200> then<00:03:25.470> tick<00:03:25.710> this<00:03:25.860> box

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
expanded volume and then tick this box

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.160 
expanded volume and then tick this box
every<00:03:26.850> time<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.060> go<00:03:27.240> to<00:03:27.300> change<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.720> volume<00:03:27.840> it

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
every time I go to change the volume it

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.780 
every time I go to change the volume it
will<00:03:28.260> show<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.710> of<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:29.070> volumes<00:03:29.400> on<00:03:29.610> my

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
will show all of the volumes on my

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.640 
will show all of the volumes on my
device<00:03:30.120> now<00:03:30.930> as<00:03:31.050> I<00:03:31.080> mentioned<00:03:31.440> at<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.560> start

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
device now as I mentioned at the start

this<00:03:32.010> video<00:03:32.160> the<00:03:32.460> main<00:03:32.640> reason<00:03:32.970> why

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
this video the main reason why

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.150 
this video the main reason why
downloaded<00:03:33.720> this<00:03:33.870> was<00:03:34.290> to<00:03:34.410> have<00:03:34.560> my<00:03:34.740> phone<00:03:34.980> go

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
downloaded this was to have my phone go

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.460 
downloaded this was to have my phone go
to<00:03:35.190> a<00:03:35.430> silent<00:03:36.120> mode<00:03:36.300> now<00:03:36.810> as<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.960> can<00:03:37.080> see<00:03:37.260> if

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
to a silent mode now as you can see if

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.650 
to a silent mode now as you can see if
you<00:03:37.560> do<00:03:37.710> volume<00:03:38.040> down<00:03:38.280> on<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.760> device<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.600> can

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
you do volume down on the device you can

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.240 
you do volume down on the device you can
see<00:03:39.930> here<00:03:40.140> that<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> ringer<00:03:40.770> has<00:03:40.950> actually

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
see here that the ringer has actually

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.910 
see here that the ringer has actually
turned<00:03:41.400> off<00:03:41.670> and<00:03:42.210> my<00:03:42.450> phone<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.110> on<00:03:43.350> silent

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
turned off and my phone is now on silent

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.530 
turned off and my phone is now on silent
and<00:03:44.100> again<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.550> can<00:03:44.670> use<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.090> turn<00:03:45.360> the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
and again you can use it to turn the

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.780 
and again you can use it to turn the
volume<00:03:45.810> up<00:03:46.110> now<00:03:46.860> unfortunately<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.520> doesn't

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
volume up now unfortunately it doesn't

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.480 
volume up now unfortunately it doesn't
do<00:03:48.180> exactly<00:03:48.720> what<00:03:48.870> it<00:03:48.930> says<00:03:49.020> on<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.410> tin<00:03:49.740> as<00:03:50.010> if

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
do exactly what it says on the tin as if

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:51.830 
do exactly what it says on the tin as if
you<00:03:50.610> control<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.090> volume<00:03:51.210> as<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:51.600> can<00:03:51.690> see

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you control the volume as you can see

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.750 
you control the volume as you can see
how<00:03:52.020> impressing<00:03:52.500> volume<00:03:52.830> down<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:53.340> it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
how impressing volume down and it's

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640 
how impressing volume down and it's
making<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.150> noise<00:03:54.180> but<00:03:54.870> none<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> volumes

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
making a noise but none of the volumes

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.530 
making a noise but none of the volumes
are<00:03:55.770> changing<00:03:56.250> again<00:03:56.730> if<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:56.940> do<00:03:57.000> volume<00:03:57.360> up

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
are changing again if I do volume up

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.110 
are changing again if I do volume up
again<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.440> volume<00:03:58.650> goes<00:03:58.800> up<00:03:58.980> but<00:03:59.700> it<00:03:59.820> is<00:03:59.850> a<00:03:59.940> bit

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
again the volume goes up but it is a bit

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.550 
again the volume goes up but it is a bit
inconsistent<00:04:00.450> at<00:04:00.930> times<00:04:01.230> which<00:04:01.440> is

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
inconsistent at times which is

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.320 
inconsistent at times which is
definitely<00:04:01.920> a<00:04:01.950> bit<00:04:02.130> of<00:04:02.190> a<00:04:02.280> disappointment<00:04:02.580> as

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
definitely a bit of a disappointment as

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.850 
definitely a bit of a disappointment as
sometimes<00:04:03.690> it<00:04:03.930> doesn't<00:04:04.110> necessarily<00:04:04.710> do

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
sometimes it doesn't necessarily do

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.010 
sometimes it doesn't necessarily do
exactly<00:04:05.280> what<00:04:05.460> you<00:04:05.580> want<00:04:05.880> now<00:04:06.510> they<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.810> iron

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
exactly what you want now they can iron

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.720 
exactly what you want now they can iron
out<00:04:07.170> some<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.560> these<00:04:07.680> kinks<00:04:07.980> it's<00:04:08.340> definitely

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
out some of these kinks it's definitely

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.310 
out some of these kinks it's definitely
going<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.060> great<00:04:09.390> application<00:04:09.540> to<00:04:10.080> have
