 between those of the fox surface and those of the whole floating city are 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.109
 captured two dissidents in the latter 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:23.739
 and transported by train to live in exile 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:27.199
 but the truth is that it causes its escape leading to a massacre 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.810
 premeditated 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.940
 make 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.380
 when you reach the heart of a country and find it crystallized and fight 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.440
 battle that convert them yes 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 servants of the fans

 having now a mission that neither they buy 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.720
 but that will discover little by little 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.380
 accompanying them is the nice panic and the resentful Cuba 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.700
 who blames snow for the death of his mother 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.820
 in the same way trying to survive a subject called Tsar joins them with 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.459
 everything and collided pet 

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:04.800
 the various teams 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.890
 and then with the other members 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.440
 but this is a fairly conventional role playing battles 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.080
 connections in real time over and over again raising your levels and gaining 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.159
 skills but with peculiarities like the selection of the best training of 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:18.880
 combat 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.940
 the sequence of the story are formidable but the game so 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.390
 request products are not fans of the rpg 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.689
 the game score pointed tb for fano fantasy grows 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.930
 7 points 5 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.180
 ap 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.369
 Inspired by the novel by Russian writer and journalist Dimitri Klukowski 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.659
 this is 2033 meter video game that happens two decades after a 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.049
 nuclear holocaust due to which the survivors have had to hide 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.369
 from the surface and develop their lives there in the subway tunnels 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.030
 Debutant attacks are frequent but it seems that humanity faces a 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.900
 new threat 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 you are a person 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.180
 a young man who comes to the surface in front of the strange beings but who is in 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.910
 coma 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.720
 remembering as before only now what's there eight days ago when he went out to 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.570
 receive john t old acquaintance who came to the station friend of his father 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.679
 adoptive 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.409
 unfortunately the catastrophe arrived with him 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.129
 so he started a trip escaping from men 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.279
 the dark ones in which they will discover because they are special 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.780
 the title is a first person trigger but more demanding than others 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.519
 since there is little ammunition 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.340
 there is no health indicator on the screen you know something is wrong if you notice 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.679
 your oxygen mask or if the screen turns red 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:39.629
 in terms of story environments and creatures design the game palin very much 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:40.389
 the sorrow 

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:42.939
 Unfortunately, combat is frustrating 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.569
 especially when the ministers arrive very quickly and do not know 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.039
 can locate well 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:52.969
 the game score pointed tevÃ© for subway 2033 this 7 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.979
 ap 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:01.349
 being the first downloadable wii title that employ the skills for 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.779
 better motion detection the wii motionplus accessory we expected 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:06.009
 something interesting 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:08.319
 it was not like that the owners account 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.480
 in the text the story that the well of a village dried up and that from it 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.459
 they began to go out via public creatures to which they will have to 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.339
 fight 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:20.889
 initially you can choose between two zeros, one blond and one brown, which 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.539
 It does not even matter because the game is in the first person so during the 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:25.479
 start 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.089
 they can also choose whether to use the windows alone or with the wii motionplus 

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.449
 and on a sword its arrangement let's say it's a title of 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.339
 first person swordsman 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.620
 first impressions are good since a relationship of 

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.859
 move one to one but when the enemies come out 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.820
 another section 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.380
 there is a bad perspective in 3d so if you have not come close enough 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.759
 just fanning have in the air 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:52.729
 Equally odious is the system under which both you and the 

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:53.599
 enemies 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.899
 it works more randomly what with some logic 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.389
 graphics are bad citi music 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.389
 only two notes that repeat themselves incessantly 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.159
 the cueca point rating will leave you with heller city this
