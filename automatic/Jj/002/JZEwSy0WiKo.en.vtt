00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 that she has the habit that will change 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.660
 your life you definitely know background 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.130
 from you that there is one thing that you 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.840
 should do but you do 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.940
 not today and who you 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.590
 would literally change 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.420
 your life to have results 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.949
 different 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.199
 the biggest mistake when you want 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.350
 change your life or change something 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.900
 in his life we're going to start too 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.980
 strong and that's typical for example of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.359
 big that starts running an hour 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.470
 that's pretty difficult and so they 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.570
 give up after one week 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 obviously it was too difficult 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 it was too hard to start too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.440
 strong at the beginning we have motivation on 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 is motivated and as and when this 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.469
 force of will diminishes and so the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 typical mistakes is to say ok I 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.020
 will start by making an hour of 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.899
 sport a day i'm going to work two 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.989
 hours without interruption to see too much 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.250
 strong at the beginning this is what prevents a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:01.530
 habit of settling and so ask 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.629
 what is the smallest habit 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.580
 that will change your life you can 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.500
 use for example the technique of 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.670
 five minutes personally I 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 started like that when I wanted 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.060
 resume the sport I started with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.850
 five minutes were going to run five 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.430
 minutes you may tell me that 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.680
 no use it's not much 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.420
 yes maybe but in any case it's 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.210
 like that I was able to install this 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.520
 more habit if I had said ok 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.390
 must I run an hour I would have 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.130
 find excuses 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.600
 I would have said amazing age must I 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.700
 run an hour I would never have time to 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.619
 run an hour tonight I have other 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.180
 things to do 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:39.210
 this way that's fine 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.509
 against it was going to be a force too 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 strong for my strength of will and so 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.299
 starting with five minutes of sport 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.890
 not only once you are 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.960
 outside usually you continue you 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.049
 do more than five minutes but in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.560
 the more this installs this habit for 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.969
 you so there are other very examples 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.820
 concrete that I will give you there are 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.549
 a member of the mastermind new man on 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.680
 tried to set up 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.180
 different habits and actually 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.710
 the habit that we changed the main 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.690
 these two years 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.209
 his diet to modify the apples 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.510
 land with vegetables plus they 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:18.240
 race 1 minute 5 10 minutes 15 minutes 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.170
 two or three times a week we 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.760
 that's nothing extraordinary ok he has 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.040
 just changed the potatoes by 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.520
 vegetables and he runs from time to time 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 time but that's nothing extraordinary 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.980
 results 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.800
 however, the results are absolutely 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.280
 extraordinary in 28 days so in 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.690
 less than a month he lost 6.5 kg 6 5 kg 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.100
 in less than a month it went from 100 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.160
 1.5 kg to 95 kg in 28 days results 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.769
 spectacular thanks to a tiny 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 habit that was changed just a 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.570
 little behavior that has been modified and 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.430
 it totally changes your life changes 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.420

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.700
 so you go here are some other little ones 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.350
 examples that you could for example 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.819
 set up that can be write five 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.160
 minutes a day it can be 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.900
 affirmations that can be questions 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.420
 that you ask yourself every day for 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.489
 can really be aligned to the 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.900
 direction you want to go little that can 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.079
 be short and 100 minutes read five 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
 minutes spoken to three customers a day 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.440
 this is whatever domain you 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.390
 in which you want to progress you 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.489

 life I'm sure you have an idea 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.730
 in the lead you know that if you had to 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.709
 to do if you had this habit then 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.570
 you would have results absolutely 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.220
 incredible you can even imagine them 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.380

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.480
 three years if you did this action 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.060
 every day the results that this 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.590

 minutes for example if you can 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.420
 measure by the time it starts with 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.049
 run five minutes or so edit 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.600
