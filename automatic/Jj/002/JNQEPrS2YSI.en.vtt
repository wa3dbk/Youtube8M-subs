I<00:00:05.509> grew<00:00:06.509> up<00:00:06.540> thinking<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.230> farms<00:00:07.680> as<00:00:07.859> places

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
I grew up thinking of farms as places

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.470 
I grew up thinking of farms as places
with<00:00:08.580> red<00:00:08.820> Barn's

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.850 
cows and gray-haired men with overalls I
never<00:00:12.750> thought<00:00:13.019> about<00:00:13.080> where<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> vegetables

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
never thought about where the vegetables

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.189 
never thought about where the vegetables
fit<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.420> would<00:00:15.570> happen<00:00:15.929> when<00:00:16.080> the

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
fit in or what would happen when the

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.710 
fit in or what would happen when the
gray-haired<00:00:16.650> men<00:00:16.859> turned<00:00:17.220> gray<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.359> and

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
gray-haired men turned gray is I and

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.900 
gray-haired men turned gray is I and
everyone<00:00:19.230> around<00:00:19.350> me<00:00:19.680> continued<00:00:20.400> to<00:00:20.520> grow<00:00:20.730> up

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
everyone around me continued to grow up

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.230 
everyone around me continued to grow up
and<00:00:21.150> depend<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.810> farms<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.529> food<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.100> also<00:00:23.820> grew

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
and depend on farms for food I also grew

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
and depend on farms for food I also grew
up<00:00:24.269> thinking<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.019> might<00:00:25.230> become<00:00:25.439> an

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
up thinking that I might become an

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
up thinking that I might become an

even a fairy princess anything but a

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.290 

there<00:00:42.680> have<00:00:42.829> been<00:00:42.980> incredible<00:00:43.399> advances<00:00:44.149> in

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
there have been incredible advances in

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.960 
there have been incredible advances in
technology<00:00:44.960> over<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.320> past<00:00:45.559> century<00:00:45.920> some<00:00:46.850> of

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:46.970 
technology over the past century some of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:48.790 
technology over the past century some of
which<00:00:47.149> our<00:00:47.360> growing<00:00:47.600> population<00:00:47.930> could<00:00:48.620> not

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
which our growing population could not

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.860 
which our growing population could not
live<00:00:49.040> without<00:00:49.220> but<00:00:50.180> some<00:00:50.420> of<00:00:50.540> these<00:00:50.660> are

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
live without but some of these are

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.139 
live without but some of these are
asking<00:00:51.290> our<00:00:51.440> bodies<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.160> the<00:00:52.280> environment<00:00:52.970> to

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
asking our bodies and the environment to

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.630 
asking our bodies and the environment to
compromise<00:00:53.570> more<00:00:54.050> than<00:00:54.290> they<00:00:54.470> can<00:00:54.640> through

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
compromise more than they can through

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.910 
compromise more than they can through
farming<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.420> have<00:00:56.690> learned<00:00:56.989> that<00:00:57.230> we<00:00:57.379> all<00:00:57.410> have

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
farming I have learned that we all have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.250 
farming I have learned that we all have
choices<00:00:58.190> when<00:00:58.489> it<00:00:58.790> comes<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.390> our<00:00:59.570> food<00:00:59.900> our

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
choices when it comes to our food our

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.610 
choices when it comes to our food our
bodies<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.370> our<00:01:01.640> environment<00:01:02.360> things<00:01:03.110> do<00:01:03.409> not

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
bodies and our environment things do not

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.560 
bodies and our environment things do not
have<00:01:03.949> to<00:01:04.129> be<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.489> way<00:01:04.640> that<00:01:04.820> they<00:01:04.940> are

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.910 

research<00:01:08.570> has<00:01:08.810> proven<00:01:09.229> that<00:01:09.440> people<00:01:09.500> are

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
research has proven that people are

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.560 
research has proven that people are
their<00:01:10.070> happiest<00:01:10.610> when<00:01:10.820> they<00:01:10.940> are<00:01:11.060> part<00:01:11.360> of<00:01:11.509> a

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
their happiest when they are part of a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.510 
their happiest when they are part of a
strong<00:01:11.869> community<00:01:11.930> and<00:01:12.740> when<00:01:13.130> they<00:01:13.250> help

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
strong community and when they help
