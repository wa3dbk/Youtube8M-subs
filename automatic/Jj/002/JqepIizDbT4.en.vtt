and i personally know from dealing with
these<00:05:53.170> what<00:05:53.950> I<00:05:53.980> think<00:05:54.310> are<00:05:54.430> COINTELPRO<00:05:55.030> agents

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.170 
these what I think are COINTELPRO agents

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.900 
these what I think are COINTELPRO agents
operating<00:05:56.170> on<00:05:56.620> facebook<00:05:57.070> they<00:05:57.490> have<00:05:57.640> full

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
operating on facebook they have full

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.610 
operating on facebook they have full
access<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.480> everything<00:05:58.630> you're<00:05:59.050> doing<00:05:59.260> this

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
access to everything you're doing this

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.800 
access to everything you're doing this
and<00:05:59.920> so<00:06:00.040> if<00:06:00.190> they<00:06:00.340> want<00:06:00.370> to<00:06:00.700> target<00:06:00.910> you<00:06:01.210> they

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
and so if they want to target you they

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.610 
and so if they want to target you they
could<00:06:01.960> target<00:06:02.170> you<00:06:02.460> all<00:06:03.460> right
