00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.870
 but yes sir 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:14.550
 the first forced to the court with the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.110
 July 33 chiarini retires the capi something 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.730
 has changed has changed 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.289
 I do not know if we're going 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.839
 something has changed here inside 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.179
 do not say that I changed before let 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:30.759
 tell you only time has passed and I see 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.309
 the different things I do not know if it is to send 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.649
 or not only live the present because never 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.050
 I stopped and when they told me to stop 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.149
 I make rap I make music for me for me 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.550
 people for everyone who listens to these 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.530
 words and feel them I keep to the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.479
 margin of those who always insult me 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.000
 because I've always been one of those who swam 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:51.339
 against the current I am aware that 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.129
 I never have enough nobody could 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.540
 with me let the next one pass 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.909
 endured so much and more to endure is 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.369
 surely I learned to love myself 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:02.830
 because everything is in the mind, watch every 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.659
 step perhaps from one of the mind you are 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.909
 owner of your acts so I know 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.490
 consequently our being better person 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.990
 I only swear to you for my life that I do not 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.560
 There is a day that I did not understand what 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 tried 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.299
 and that reflects that it makes these 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.700
 stop and my music is for you is for 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.189
 something has changed because I needed 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.229
 feel happy again something has changed 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:28.479
 something has changed in me 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.090
 I know that reflects that I know that 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.799
 reflects that my music is for you my 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.250
 music is for so something has changed 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.140
 because I felt that it must be like that and so that 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.470
 child became a man obligatorily 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.360
 I go through so many things suddenly looking 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.549
 towards nothingness was there and the absent gaze 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.619
 I was looking for small things and not 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.600
 I found incentives she came to 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.479
 look for me sometime but I looked at her 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.580
 I can not leave yet because I have 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.740
 pending things I'm one of those who believes that 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 things do not happen by luck one 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.270
 he picks up what he sows with the sweat of his 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.190
 front my family believed in me and that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.189
 made me stronger snuffed is so different 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.110
 naiara to love eternally I trust in me 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.509
 people blindly though sometimes I 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.720
 disorientated I am my sustenance I try 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.880
 to be demanding of me something has changed 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.220
 and although I was also a teenager, it does not 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.020
 so much that they overcame my impulses and were 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.090
 hot I was always brave though 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.430
 now smarter and I know that time 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.680
 will put everyone where you should just know 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.320
 something has changed in the end something has changed 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.990
 says that is reflected when in those 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.690
 in this song and music is for you is 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.150
 for something has changed because I needed 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.260
 feel happy again something has changed 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.540
 in me 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.000
 has changed he says that reflects 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.610
 that me that that reflects my music here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.280
 is for you my music is for you something has 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.680
 changed because I felt that I should be like that 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.900
 I consider myself a clear person and 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.450
 transparent I go face and without anything 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.820
 for it's because I'm brave I just do 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.010
 music and you let me orient you 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.709
 I liked the fame and in my bed it continues 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.750
 currently something has changed is evident 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.209
 I've been happy again this time 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.850
 maybe it's not permanent I will not complain 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.560
 I chose the path voluntarily I ask 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.630
 another opportunity to do it 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.030
 correctly 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.160
 It is better to bite the tongue and tighten 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.290
 fronts sure you have also said 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.540
 things that you do not feel life puts 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.060
 obstacles and baits so that they understand you 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.590
 but you will only fail yourself if you 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.990
 lie and lie 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.100
 and who was going to tell him when he was a 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.100
 I only raise 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.880
 but something has changed the prism since the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.080
 that now I see everything is different something has 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.569
 changed 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.819
 something has changed and I know that reflects 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.040
 also that is reflected in my music 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.530
 is for you is for something has changed 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.380
 because I needed to feel again 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.250
 happy something has changed the pace has 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.470
 changed 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.110
 I know that reflected that I said that that 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.180
 reflects here my music is for you my 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:01.730
 music is for you something has changed 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.730
 because I felt that it must be like this will be 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.000
 I prefer to work in my capacities and 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.510
 more serious that the bow is felt without 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.510
 protection
