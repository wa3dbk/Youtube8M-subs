00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.759
 next to a blanket and a basket for 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.519
 the dog that must be so 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.530
 that he can stretch out comfortably and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 You can turn around there as well 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.990
 a box for the car around him during the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.130
 I have the following to secure 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.730
 basic equipment for dogs brought 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 we need two stable nets one for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 water and one for food further 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.779
 a collar which is not too 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.120
 pull and is adjustable in size 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.800
 as the dog circumference in the course of 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.700
 change and thereby change 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.460
 will enlarge 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.110
 for walkers on the road I recommend 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.719
 give them a lining bag 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.890
 you can stay here for little ones 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.950
 workouts parts of the photo 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.170
 fill in and take with you for the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.989
 Fur care we need a brush 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.750
 This must be soft enough around the dog 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.280
 not to hurt 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 there are dogs every once in a while 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.870
 capture tick we need a so 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.359
 called ticks tongs with this time 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.850
 you can fix the tick on the head 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.100
 and slowly pull upwards 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 Please avoid turning the tick 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.710
 or else oil or other means 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 to drip on it 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.390
 Last but not least we need one more 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.790
 stable leash 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.460
 this copy is completely suitable 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.400
 you are displaced in length and is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 about two meters long 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.540
 please refrain from the models 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.130
 can be rolled out flexibly 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 You can not keep your dog anymore 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.570
 control and learn already 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.700
 this leash pull the so-called leash 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.619
 because the constant pressure on the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.619
 collar will eventually become normal for him 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.869
 before the puppy in the new home 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.360
 you should definitely move in 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.790
 to prepare his future berth 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.950
 ideally also with a blanket 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.479
 you already know from the breeder or from the 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.729
 cities where he grew up 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.440
 apples should be ready for him 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.990
 already one filled with fresh water 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.130
 And of course, should be leash and collar 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.130
 be handy
