where the bottom right is now sending
his<00:00:41.340> overlord<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.000> was<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.149> cross<00:00:42.420> position

how<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.870> gonna<00:00:46.110> work<00:00:46.350> out<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.890> Bly<00:00:47.129> here

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430

bottom right there's gas taken right now

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.429 
bottom right there's gas taken right now
it's<00:01:28.530> actually<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.700> pool<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.720> expand

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
it's actually not the pool in to expand

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.069 
it's actually not the pool in to expand
its<00:01:31.740> gas<00:01:32.100> before<00:01:32.790> even<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> hatch<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.840> being

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
its gas before even the hatch is being

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.950 
its gas before even the hatch is being
built<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.619> Bly<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:36.060> go<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.810> an

all-out attack either he has well
actually<00:01:39.450> he<00:01:39.780> has<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.020> gas<00:01:40.170> taken<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
actually he has the gas taken to so it

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.670 
actually he has the gas taken to so it
looks<00:01:41.310> more<00:01:41.430> like<00:01:41.939> we're<00:01:42.119> gonna<00:01:42.270> see<00:01:42.540> 10<00:01:42.899> guys

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
looks more like we're gonna see 10 guys

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.789 
looks more like we're gonna see 10 guys
that<00:01:44.100> were<00:01:44.310> having<00:01:45.030> 10<00:01:45.329> pool<00:01:45.689> into<00:01:45.960> 10<00:01:46.259> gas<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
that were having 10 pool into 10 gas and

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.350 
that were having 10 pool into 10 gas and
therefore<00:01:46.950> we're<00:01:47.189> gonna<00:01:47.340> see<00:01:47.640> most<00:01:47.909> likely

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
therefore we're gonna see most likely

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.940 
therefore we're gonna see most likely
banelings<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.930> can<00:01:49.079> also<00:01:49.259> just<00:01:49.500> go<00:01:49.649> into<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
banelings you can also just go into a

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.649 
banelings you can also just go into a
speed<00:01:50.250> build<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.270> what<00:01:51.450> he's

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
speed build and that's what he's

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.270 
speed build and that's what he's
currently<00:01:52.049> researching<00:01:52.380> put<00:01:52.920> out<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
currently researching put out the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.679 
currently researching put out the
harvester<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.060> gonna<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> pennies

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
harvester so it's not gonna be pennies

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.149 
harvester so it's not gonna be pennies
after<00:01:54.990> all<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.500> speak<00:01:55.829> those<00:01:56.040> I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
after all it's just that speak those I

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.020 
after all it's just that speak those I
was<00:01:56.280> mentioning<00:01:56.490> a<00:01:56.729> sec

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
was mentioning a sec

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.920 
was mentioning a sec
Jaedong<00:01:58.020> used<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.590> recently<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.750> we<00:02:00.750> have

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
Jaedong used that recently and we have

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.040 
Jaedong used that recently and we have
for<00:02:01.680> nerds<00:02:02.370> oh<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.210> guess<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> speed

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
for nerds oh well I guess the speed

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.900 
for nerds oh well I guess the speed
upgrade<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.770> gonna<00:02:05.010> be<00:02:05.160> started<00:02:05.550> as<00:02:05.640> soon<00:02:05.760> as

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
upgrade is gonna be started as soon as

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.120 
upgrade is gonna be started as soon as
he<00:02:06.060> has<00:02:06.150> his<00:02:06.390> hundredth<00:02:06.750> gas<00:02:06.930> ready<00:02:07.290> he<00:02:07.860> is

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
he has his hundredth gas ready he is

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.609 
he has his hundredth gas ready he is
gonna<00:02:08.550> fall<00:02:08.880> behind<00:02:09.119> a<00:02:09.420> bit<00:02:09.600> in<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> timing<00:02:10.410> so

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
gonna fall behind a bit in the timing so

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.230 
gonna fall behind a bit in the timing so
that<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:10.920> be<00:02:11.100> a<00:02:11.130> time<00:02:11.490> where<00:02:11.700> black<00:02:11.910> can

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
that will be a time where black can

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.660 
that will be a time where black can
engage<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:12.780> disengage<00:02:12.980> battles<00:02:13.980> easily

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
engage and disengage battles easily

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.730 
engage and disengage battles easily
whereas<00:02:15.209> nerd<00:02:15.450> sure<00:02:15.660> will<00:02:15.959> have<00:02:16.200> to<00:02:16.380> fight<00:02:16.560> if

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
whereas nerd sure will have to fight if

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.380 
whereas nerd sure will have to fight if
he<00:02:16.770> caught<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.280> he's<00:02:17.430> caught<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.850> map<00:02:18.000> but

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
he caught if he's caught on the map but

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.060 
he caught if he's caught on the map but
the<00:02:18.480> expansion<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:19.020> now<00:02:19.140> started<00:02:19.560> furniture

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the expansion is now started furniture

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.920 
the expansion is now started furniture
and<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.250> harvest<00:02:20.550> account<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.090> already<00:02:21.450> 14

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
and the harvest account is already 14

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.230 
and the harvest account is already 14
against<00:02:22.500> 10<00:02:22.770> gives<00:02:23.370> him<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.640> decent<00:02:23.910> lead

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
against 10 gives him a decent lead

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
against 10 gives him a decent lead
against<00:02:24.480> this<00:02:24.630> opponent<00:02:24.930> Ling's<00:02:25.620> running

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
see what the bit of a good defense nerd

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.960 
see what the bit of a good defense nerd
sure<00:02:36.690> would<00:02:37.080> have<00:02:37.320> great<00:02:37.950> start<00:02:38.340> here<00:02:38.550> how

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
sure would have great start here how

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.670 
sure would have great start here how
those<00:02:39.209> links<00:02:39.600> of<00:02:39.720> nerds<00:02:39.959> you're<00:02:40.170> gonna<00:02:40.320> find

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
those links of nerds you're gonna find

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.710 
those links of nerds you're gonna find
no<00:02:41.040> they're<00:02:41.550> not<00:02:41.670> gonna<00:02:41.880> find<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.300> zerglings

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
no they're not gonna find the zerglings

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.000 
no they're not gonna find the zerglings
he's<00:02:42.870> gonna<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.110> into<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.440> main<00:02:43.590> base<00:02:43.770> he's

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
he's gonna get into the main base he's

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.460 
he's gonna get into the main base he's
gonna<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.489> there<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.760> no<00:02:45.290> expansion<00:02:46.290> and

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
gonna see that there is no expansion and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.500 
gonna see that there is no expansion and
then<00:02:46.920> of<00:02:47.070> course<00:02:47.130> he<00:02:47.550> will<00:02:47.790> start<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.330> produce

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
then of course he will start to produce

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.360 
then of course he will start to produce
his<00:02:48.840> own<00:02:48.870> zerglings<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.980> quite<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
his own zerglings like quite a lot of

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.430 
his own zerglings like quite a lot of
that<00:02:50.550> because<00:02:50.880> he<00:02:51.000> asked<00:02:51.300> you<00:02:51.390> speed<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.230> gonna

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
that because he asked you speed is gonna

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.770 
that because he asked you speed is gonna
start<00:02:52.860> in<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.340> second<00:02:53.820> here<00:02:54.239> comes<00:02:54.510> nerd

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
start in just a second here comes nerd

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.510 
start in just a second here comes nerd
she<00:02:54.959> already<00:02:55.230> had<00:02:55.739> a<00:02:55.770> quick<00:02:56.070> look<00:02:56.100> right<00:02:56.489> over

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
she already had a quick look right over

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.250 
she already had a quick look right over
there<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:56.910> didn't<00:02:57.209> see<00:02:57.360> anything<00:02:57.660> and<00:02:57.959> moves

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
there I didn't see anything and moves

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.100 
there I didn't see anything and moves
already<00:02:58.890> back<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.790> he<00:02:59.970> needs<00:03:00.239> more<00:03:00.630> units<00:03:00.989> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
already back so he needs more units and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.870 
already back so he needs more units and
he<00:03:01.170> feels<00:03:01.320> his<00:03:01.440> spine<00:03:01.620> crawler<00:03:01.880> immediately

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
he feels his spine crawler immediately

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.789 
he feels his spine crawler immediately
spine<00:03:03.510> crawler<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.930> being<00:03:04.230> built<00:03:04.470> he<00:03:04.620> gets

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
spine crawler is being built he gets

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.770 
spine crawler is being built he gets
more<00:03:05.070> zerglings<00:03:05.700> he<00:03:05.790> gets<00:03:05.940> another<00:03:06.150> queen<00:03:06.510> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
more zerglings he gets another queen and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.350 
more zerglings he gets another queen and
he<00:03:07.410> might<00:03:07.739> even<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.310> cancel<00:03:08.670> this<00:03:09.120> hatch

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
he might even have to cancel this hatch

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.449
