about<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.140> so<00:03:03.140> it's<00:03:03.709> just<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.980> really

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
about it so it's just a really

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.690 
about it so it's just a really
affordable<00:03:04.550> against<00:03:05.090> a<00:03:05.150> easily<00:03:05.750> under<00:03:06.140> $100<00:03:07.090> I

you a couple hundred bucks and then you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.199 
you a couple hundred bucks and then you
have<00:03:17.959> to<00:03:18.049> get<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.470> controller<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.760> get<00:03:20.060> your

to<00:03:23.269> 70<00:03:24.019> degree<00:03:24.410> range<00:03:24.680> instead<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.190> cooling<00:03:25.489> it

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580

to 70 degree range instead of cooling it
down<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:26.690> know<00:03:26.780> you<00:03:26.870> have<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.110> actually<00:03:27.320> have

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
down you know you have to actually have

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.229 
down you know you have to actually have
a<00:03:27.440> thermometer<00:03:27.799> to<00:03:28.040> control<00:03:28.340> control<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.120> all

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
a thermometer to control control and all

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.140 
a thermometer to control control and all
that<00:03:29.360> stuff<00:03:29.600> and<00:03:29.780> that's<00:03:30.170> a<00:03:30.320> great<00:03:30.560> way<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.769> go

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
that stuff and that's a great way to go

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.910 
that stuff and that's a great way to go
I've<00:03:32.150> been<00:03:32.450> told<00:03:32.780> that<00:03:33.140> running

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
I've been told that running

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.740 
I've been told that running
refrigerators<00:03:34.489> at<00:03:34.640> a<00:03:34.670> higher<00:03:34.880> temperature<00:03:34.910> is

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
refrigerators at a higher temperature is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.590 
refrigerators at a higher temperature is
actually<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.200> bigger<00:03:36.560> screen<00:03:36.980> on<00:03:37.250> them<00:03:37.600> but

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
actually a bigger screen on them but

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.820 
actually a bigger screen on them but
then<00:03:38.720> I've<00:03:38.810> also<00:03:38.959> had<00:03:39.200> people<00:03:39.380> say<00:03:39.590> it<00:03:39.680> doesn't

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
then I've also had people say it doesn't

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.050 
then I've also had people say it doesn't
make<00:03:39.980> sense<00:03:40.250> that<00:03:40.340> you're<00:03:40.580> running<00:03:40.700> them<00:03:40.880> half

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
make sense that you're running them half

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.850 
make sense that you're running them half
as<00:03:41.269> much<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:41.780> why<00:03:41.930> would<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:42.170> be<00:03:42.290> more<00:03:42.470> strained

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
as much so why would it be more strained

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.680 
as much so why would it be more strained
so<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.250> honestly<00:03:43.580> don't<00:03:43.730> know<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.510> is<00:03:44.660> a

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
so I honestly don't know this is a

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.590 
so I honestly don't know this is a
really<00:03:45.080> inexpensive<00:03:45.290> way<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.799> go<00:03:46.239> all<00:03:47.239> polled

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
really inexpensive way to go all polled

my brother-in-law said that his ice
trays<00:04:39.530> were<00:04:39.710> lasting<00:04:40.070> him<00:04:40.750> day<00:04:41.750> and<00:04:41.870> a<00:04:41.930> half

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
trays were lasting him day and a half

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.590

David<00:04:42.919> let's<00:04:43.280> say<00:04:43.400> day<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.730> two<00:04:44.090> days<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:44.510> it

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
David let's say day to two days and it

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.170 
David let's say day to two days and it
depends<00:04:44.960> on<00:04:45.080> obviously<00:04:45.260> to<00:04:45.530> eat<00:04:45.680> when<00:04:46.180> you're

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
depends on obviously to eat when you're

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.090 
depends on obviously to eat when you're
really<00:04:47.570> if<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:47.720> got<00:04:47.870> to<00:04:48.110> carboys<00:04:48.620> in<00:04:48.770> here<00:04:48.950> and

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
really if you got to carboys in here and

they're permitting heavy another
generating<00:04:50.900> heat<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.320> obviously<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:51.860> going

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
generating heat so obviously it's going

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.150

boys<00:05:27.010> so<00:05:27.190> you<00:05:27.220> get<00:05:27.370> a<00:05:27.400> better<00:05:27.550> reading<00:05:27.880> of<00:05:28.060> the

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
boys so you get a better reading of the

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.330 
boys so you get a better reading of the
temperature<00:05:28.660> of<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:28.810> card<00:05:29.260> way<00:05:29.470> but<00:05:30.130> I<00:05:30.160> just

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
temperature of that card way but I just

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.860 
temperature of that card way but I just
want<00:05:30.520> a<00:05:30.550> general<00:05:30.970> reading<00:05:31.180> of<00:05:31.390> the<00:05:31.510> entire

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
want a general reading of the entire

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.020 
want a general reading of the entire
chamber<00:05:32.410> and<00:05:32.890> it's<00:05:33.340> that<00:05:33.580> average

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
chamber and it's that average

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.070 
chamber and it's that average
temperature<00:05:34.540> that<00:05:34.720> I'm<00:05:34.810> going<00:05:34.960> to<00:05:34.990> be

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
temperature that I'm going to be

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.080 
temperature that I'm going to be
controlling<00:05:36.780> done<00:05:37.780> cool<00:05:38.650> so<00:05:38.980> I've<00:05:39.430> got<00:05:39.610> there

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
controlling done cool so I've got there

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.760 
controlling done cool so I've got there
now<00:05:40.390> it's<00:05:40.570> cooling<00:05:40.810> down<00:05:40.930> actually<00:05:41.470> a<00:05:41.500> rain

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
now it's cooling down actually a rain

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.850 
now it's cooling down actually a rain
