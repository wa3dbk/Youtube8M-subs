 thank you very much well this is 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.770
 next song is undoubtedly a very 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.830
 special and one of the reasons is because 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.960

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.619
 songs that I wrote for this album 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.000
 when when I started doing the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.820
 great composers was amaury 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.989
 Gutierrez who was the composer of nothing 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.690
 it's forever that we sing it 's a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.020

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.520
 flame because it says it rains inside this 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.890
 title and I join him and so super 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.210
 quickly we finish this song that forms 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.710
 part of this album and here I am 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.190
 presenting I think it's the first 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.190

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.370
 what can I do babies inside 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.370
 and the heart 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.980
 it hurts and it melts I think about you 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.900
 I want to fly 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.870
 this sadness 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.710
 to escape in me 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.710
 I want to live 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.050
 forever 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 and this 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.680
 Your look 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.680
 and nothing 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.880
 then I tore my soul away 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180
 that separates us 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.140
 how we did it 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.140
 that early morning 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.879
 hip hop body you run songs 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.890

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.270

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.360
 let's say people like olga cannon and 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.640

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.100
 the woman of fire where you tell you Luis 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.700
 which is a song that goes through your mind 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:13.210
 you get nervous to me it's just a 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.290
 look back and the first person 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.900

 he said fonsi I want to write me a 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.910
 song at that time I still 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.230
 I was traveling with me, they ask me 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.570
 composition the fact that she trusted 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.740
 in me it meant a lot because of 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:31.960
 suddenly now that I have to talk about the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:34.270

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.760

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:07.310
