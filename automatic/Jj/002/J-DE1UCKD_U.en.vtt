of this area a regular factory is famous
to<00:00:23.580> produce<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.300> back<00:00:24.630> today<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
to produce is back today we are the

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.029 
to produce is back today we are the
second<00:00:26.760> biggest<00:00:27.170> producer<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> speck<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.920> the

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
second biggest producer of speck in the

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.060 
second biggest producer of speck in the
world<00:00:29.280> we<00:00:29.789> produce<00:00:30.000> about<00:00:30.360> 4,000<00:00:31.260> pieces<00:00:31.710> away

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
world we produce about 4,000 pieces away

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.590 
world we produce about 4,000 pieces away
and<00:00:32.510> we<00:00:33.510> were<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.079> first<00:00:34.409> producer<00:00:35.370> that

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
and we were the first producer that

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
and we were the first producer that
exported<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.629> the<00:00:36.749> USA<00:00:37.409> a<00:00:37.620> regular<00:00:38.129> family

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
exported to the USA a regular family

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.119 
exported to the USA a regular family
lives<00:00:39.059> here<00:00:39.179> for<00:00:39.359> more<00:00:39.719> than<00:00:39.899> 400<00:00:40.170> years<00:00:40.620> and

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
lives here for more than 400 years and

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.110 
lives here for more than 400 years and
they<00:00:41.850> decide<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.719> invest<00:00:43.289> again<00:00:44.129> in<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.729> area

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
they decide to invest again in this area

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
they decide to invest again in this area
and<00:00:45.300> double<00:00:45.839> their<00:00:46.229> Factory

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and double their Factory

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.000 
and double their Factory
to<00:00:47.190> increase<00:00:47.489> their<00:00:48.149> production<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:49.229> there

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
to increase their production that there

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.250 
to increase their production that there
was<00:00:50.129> an<00:00:50.399> energy<00:00:50.819> program<00:00:51.030> because<00:00:51.659> this<00:00:51.809> area

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
was an energy program because this area

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.879 
was an energy program because this area
is<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> week<00:00:52.979> of<00:00:53.249> energy<00:00:54.059> resources

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:54.889 
is a week of energy resources

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:58.430 
is a week of energy resources
practically<00:00:55.889> electrical<00:00:56.670> energy<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.359> not<00:00:57.659> so

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
practically electrical energy is not so

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.869 
practically electrical energy is not so
much<00:00:58.589> available<00:00:58.829> yeah

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
much available yeah

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.329 
much available yeah
the<00:01:00.089> problem<00:01:00.569> here<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:02.010> are<00:01:02.039> the

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
the problem here is that we are the

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.359 
the problem here is that we are the
really<00:01:03.209> the<00:01:03.389> only<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.959> that<00:01:04.320> uses<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.070> lot<00:01:05.309> of

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
really the only one that uses a lot of

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.020 
really the only one that uses a lot of
energy<00:01:05.579> and<00:01:06.500> that<00:01:07.500> makes<00:01:08.219> it<00:01:08.399> very<00:01:08.640> very

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
energy and that makes it very very

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.819 
energy and that makes it very very
expensive<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.049> we<00:01:11.210> immediately<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.659> lot<00:01:13.530> more

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:13.829 
expensive so we immediately a lot more

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.149 
expensive so we immediately a lot more
electrical<00:01:14.729> power<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.600> so<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.619> capstone

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
electrical power and so the capstone

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.399 
electrical power and so the capstone
microturbine<00:01:17.969> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.390> thing<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.049> we<00:01:19.380> really

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
microturbine is the thing that we really

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.859 
microturbine is the thing that we really
really<00:01:20.070> needed<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.850> this<00:01:21.030> location<00:01:21.390> we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
really needed in this location we

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.740 
really needed in this location we
install<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.950> July<00:01:23.759> 2010<00:01:24.630> see<00:01:25.469> 1000<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
install in July 2010 see 1000 and

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.960 
install in July 2010 see 1000 and
at<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.990> beginning<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.650> start<00:01:27.980> only<00:01:28.550> with<00:01:28.820> the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
at the beginning we start only with the

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.000 
at the beginning we start only with the
electrical<00:01:29.540> energy<00:01:29.750> production<00:01:30.350> because<00:01:30.860> it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
electrical energy production because it

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.100 
electrical energy production because it
was<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:31.370> leakage<00:01:31.790> of<00:01:31.940> electrical<00:01:32.540> energy<00:01:32.690> in

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
was the leakage of electrical energy in

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.680 
was the leakage of electrical energy in
after<00:01:33.740> six<00:01:34.040> months<00:01:34.250> they<00:01:34.760> complete<00:01:35.300> this

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
after six months they complete this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.440 
after six months they complete this
plant<00:01:36.020> also<00:01:36.260> with<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.680> cogeneration<00:01:37.450> system

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
plant also with the cogeneration system

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.650 
plant also with the cogeneration system
and<00:01:39.040> producing<00:01:40.040> steam<00:01:40.580> with<00:01:41.210> the<00:01:41.240> steam

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
and producing steam with the steam

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.010 
and producing steam with the steam
boiler<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.620> also<00:01:43.100> hot<00:01:43.550> water<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.420> practically

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
boiler and also hot water so practically

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.740 
boiler and also hot water so practically
the<00:01:45.410> system<00:01:45.740> recover<00:01:46.370> more<00:01:46.820> than<00:01:46.880> 80<00:01:47.360> percent

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
the system recover more than 80 percent

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.430 
the system recover more than 80 percent
of<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.890> energy<00:01:49.070> from<00:01:49.850> the<00:01:50.150> natural<00:01:50.660> gas<00:01:50.960> our

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
year personally I like the turbines

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
year personally I like the turbines
because<00:02:26.990> I'm<00:02:27.680> responsible<00:02:28.100> for<00:02:28.400> the
