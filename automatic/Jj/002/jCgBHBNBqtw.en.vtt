let's<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.750> at<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> player's<00:01:49.229> choice<00:01:49.500> carts

let's look at the player's choice carts
for<00:01:50.220> which<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.490> only<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:50.939> 13<00:01:51.360> codes<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:52.560> are

for which I only got 13 codes these are
not<00:01:53.009> uncommon<00:01:53.430> games<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.509> must<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.899> that

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
not uncommon games so it must be that

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.109 
not uncommon games so it must be that
