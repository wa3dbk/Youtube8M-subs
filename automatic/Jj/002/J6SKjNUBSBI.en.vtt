00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
have to say that I'm pretty sure they're

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.460 
have to say that I'm pretty sure they're
gonna<00:03:19.930> release<00:03:20.170> this<00:03:20.680> in<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.520> series<00:03:22.330> oh<00:03:22.570> so

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
gonna release this in a series oh so

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
gonna release this in a series oh so
there's<00:03:23.620> probably<00:03:24.010> going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.190> be<00:03:24.250> more

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
there's probably going to be more

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.760 
there's probably going to be more
releases<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.060> look<00:03:25.240> forward<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.840> in<00:03:26.110> this

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
releases to look forward to in this

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.570 
releases to look forward to in this
whole<00:03:28.380> element<00:03:29.380> pack<00:03:29.950> or<00:03:30.160> whatever<00:03:30.430> it's

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
whole element pack or whatever it's

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.030 
whole element pack or whatever it's
probably<00:03:30.790> going<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> be<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.120> pack<00:03:31.800> this<00:03:32.800> shoe<00:03:33.010> is

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
probably going to be a pack this shoe is

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.830 
probably going to be a pack this shoe is
probably<00:03:33.670> the<00:03:33.790> start<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.210> it<00:03:34.300> is<00:03:34.450> no<00:03:34.570> telling

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
probably the start of it is no telling

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.150 
probably the start of it is no telling
when<00:03:35.020> they're<00:03:35.140> going<00:03:35.230> to<00:03:35.320> keep<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.650> going<00:03:35.920> with

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
when they're going to keep it going with

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.700 
when they're going to keep it going with
I<00:03:36.510> think<00:03:37.510> it<00:03:37.630> is<00:03:37.750> a<00:03:37.780> little<00:03:38.140> sign<00:03:38.350> that<00:03:38.380> there

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
I think it is a little sign that there

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.140 
I think it is a little sign that there
are<00:03:38.860> going<00:03:39.040> to<00:03:39.100> probably<00:03:39.340> make<00:03:39.580> more<00:03:39.760> these

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
are going to probably make more these

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.000 
are going to probably make more these
shoes<00:03:40.420> different<00:03:41.110> models<00:03:41.530> but<00:03:41.680> just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
shoes different models but just

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.280 
shoes different models but just
different<00:03:42.400> styles<00:03:42.820> or<00:03:42.940> whatever<00:03:43.210> don't<00:03:43.780> so

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
different styles or whatever don't so

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.200 
different styles or whatever don't so
it's<00:03:45.040> kind<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.310> interesting<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.910> see<00:03:46.090> what

see what the rest of the shoes are going
to<00:04:00.520> look<00:04:00.580> like<00:04:00.640> if<00:04:00.940> they<00:04:01.120> continue<00:04:01.630> this<00:04:01.780> as<00:04:02.050> a

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
to look like if they continue this as a

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.460 
to look like if they continue this as a
series<00:04:02.710> our<00:04:02.920> pack<00:04:03.220> on<00:04:03.900> which<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.140> looks<00:04:05.320> like
