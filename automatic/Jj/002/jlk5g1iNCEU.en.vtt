00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.810 
iPad and I cut it up to 24 smaller
pieces<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:17.840> I<00:00:18.349> could<00:00:18.590> modify<00:00:18.890> my<00:00:19.189> texture<00:00:19.640> pack

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
pieces so I could modify my texture pack

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.109 
pieces so I could modify my texture pack
and<00:00:20.089> get<00:00:20.570> it<00:00:20.720> in<00:00:21.099> just<00:00:22.099> the<00:00:22.250> way<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:22.429> want<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:22.910> to

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
it to a normal size without having it

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.610 
left now my first build had a problem
because<00:00:47.870> the<00:00:48.170> screen<00:00:48.650> crack<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:50.780> LCD

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
because the screen crack and the LCD

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.860

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
modify the texture pack you can't really

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.630 
modify the texture pack you can't really
get<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.540> right<00:01:11.960> on<00:01:12.140> all<00:01:12.380> sides<00:01:12.680> you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.490> get

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640

for but you can see minecraft hasn't
developed<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:24.440> where<00:01:24.880> you<00:01:25.880> can<00:01:26.060> modify<00:01:26.360> these

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
developed to where you can modify these

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540 
developed to where you can modify these
sides<00:01:27.020> of<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.800> texture<00:01:28.190> pack<00:01:28.340> how<00:01:28.490> the

sides of the texture pack how the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.820 
sides of the texture pack how the
individual<00:01:29.180> images<00:01:29.720> there<00:01:30.320> might<00:01:30.470> be<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.620> mod

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
individual images there might be a mod

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.040 
individual images there might be a mod
for<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.190> but<00:01:31.460> I'm<00:01:31.550> trying<00:01:31.820> to<00:01:31.909> go<00:01:32.060> as<00:01:32.090> vanilla

understand<00:02:01.640> so<00:02:02.360> all<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:02.840> did<00:02:03.170> was<00:02:03.290> basically

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
understand so all I did was basically

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.619 
understand so all I did was basically
just<00:02:03.830> cut<00:02:04.250> cut<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:04.729> an<00:02:04.850> image<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.360> replace

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:07.629 
just cut cut up an image and replace

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:11.349 
just cut cut up an image and replace
these<00:02:08.629> normal<00:02:09.319> blocks<00:02:09.619> which<00:02:10.099> would<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:11.029> wool

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
these normal blocks which would be wool

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.180 
these normal blocks which would be wool
in
