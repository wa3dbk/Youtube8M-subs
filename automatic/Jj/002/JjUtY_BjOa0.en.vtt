 in a show is called the dream of

 aerial swimmers synchro it's a mix 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.990
 a little bit of everything I 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.340
 am able to do the show in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.110
 himself is pretty huge 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.300
 these productions of $ 200 million the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.400
 American dream life size for the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.130
 native of montauban but that's another 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.440
 unfulfilled dream that pushed him into this 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.390
 new adventure of a dream the agreement 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.410
 15h to gm doubt a newspaper at 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.300
 world champion it's up 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.170
 the ordeal and she struggles for the guys 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.280
 so have done is not an option 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.880
 alice craziest people more 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 trans france and virginia are 9000 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.830
 kilometers not very convenient to put 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:01.500
 in point a duo if the interim energy 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.170
 so it's through interposed video that he 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.730
 train when I watched the video 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.920
 you and you do not feel I have not 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:15.060
 need to face this sequel 1 2 I 'm 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:25.050
 sense at home I'm doing that you're 8.1 everything is 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:26.940
 ok normally bengo trains all 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.130
 days during between six and eight months 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.290
 side by side so that's for sure 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.940
 not chose the easiest route but 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.799
 I think we both have when 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.060
 even a sporting past that is one is 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.160
 both of them big for the 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.459
 perfectionist who is who is going to be at 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.459
 our advantage 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.230
 in all they could swim together only 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 five weeks 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.920
 three trips from virginia vegas to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.920
 Benoît's visit to France 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.180
 a bet based on a duality 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.330
 stronger than in female duets 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.250
 usual with julie fabre the coach at 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.530
 the origin of the project they developed 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.530
 a deliberately innovative program 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.680
 that's also why I wanted to 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.230
 come back to the competition it was 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.550
 work differently and have despite 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.880
 everything even though my figures are really 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.550
 synchronized we still see the 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.260
 male side and the female side while 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:27.370
 having a harmony 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.040
 a tango necessarily on the recovery of 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.930
 roxane red mill version the key 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.230
 French that can make a difference 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.230
 kazan
