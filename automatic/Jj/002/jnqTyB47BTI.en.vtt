00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.420
 Hello and welcome to the booth soon 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.770
 doing so often behind 2014 is so one 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.699
 well-known manufacturer from Germany and 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.170
 you can tell that family is really great 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:20.000
 Business is usually just about everyone 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.830
 do and standing with me is also the felix 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.490
 do so that 's the grandson of 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.080
 company founders and hello felix first 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.570
 is what you are everything you are now 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.430
 everything new is okay too so we have 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.100
 a new one here for the core markets 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.440
 we have disc cleaners especially 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.630
 value on this beautiful design here 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.550
 The effect of some features was nice 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.620
 slim beautiful slender of the core markets 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.829
 can change very well 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.200
 you can change a nice one here 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.510
 feature the inner magnet has one 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.820
 distance of three millimeters to switch 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.500
 that is if the sand is a smaller one 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.940
 There is no problem with that 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.980
 magnet in the sand impression you can 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.570
 clean here when you go up the falls 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.050
 whole sand just out there are two 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910
 versions 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.620
 there is one free of the choir and even 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.299
 once here that clearly so i voiced 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.930
 me two versions a small version 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.440
 up to 10 mm is the long version 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.300
 the 15 millimeter long strong version 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.880
 based on the case but with the 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.950
 stronger magnets called her 20 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.780
 he is now known for his work 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.880
 example also from this we have 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.140
 Now neither a metal blade nor here 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.120
 Do we have this pad is mine yet 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.600
 knows a plastic blade here 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:32.000
 used a very resistant 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.010
 Material the blades are interchangeable 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.690
 they do not quite clean as well as 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.460
 metal rings but much better as 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.840
 the pats the ministers are scratching them 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.520
 probably the best known 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.259
 scratch the glass is not very good one 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.040
 argument and they do not rust and they do 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.110
 What you can do in principle 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.490
 sandpaper yourself if you like 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.800
 that would like or simply from oettinger 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.450
 put on 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.950
 I had asked the question about lime 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.720
 catch algae or something 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.490
 a bit of money has been promised for a long time 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.460
 as well here we can lead that 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:03.890
 yes you can do this here 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.990
 Solve element here and our stainless steel 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.750
 use springer 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.390
 then you have here is a front about 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.920
 millimeter that is rising towards 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.540
 are so metal sword 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.090
 retrofitted to them as tower 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 theoretically you can focus on the big one 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.600
 also make two small sounds on it 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.560
 or on the small and the big ones 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.960
 things 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.320
 the connections are the same 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.800
 right now at the next one 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.780
 product 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.480
 you are known to automotive customers 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.800
 Everyone knows they are classics like today 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 also not to develop further 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.960
 what do you have new this time we are 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 have tried on a new concept 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.130
 we wanted to get closer to the engine 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.120
 slice make the whole flatter 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.340
 make it easier with the buddy 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.410
 can hide as our result 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.290
 The exit is up and leaves 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.440
 then here about this element 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.150
 adjust 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.560
 That's the reason the customer is here 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.520
 nicely shown in the basin and very well 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.410
 scare 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.760
 still a very good flow 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.500
 60 20 here does not replace the 16 15die 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.910
 becomes parallel to it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 is always standard with the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.010
 has also equipped newspaper houses 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:16.370
 now open seconds 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:19.400
 They had the flu for a quiet 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.610
 state and the 60 20 a big brother 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.410
 a controllable points the 60 40 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.480
 the only difference is that we have one 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.490
 cap is less and she has one 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.410
 circuit board 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.310
 that makes a 1000 liters per hour 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.790
 1000 watts and the 13 watts with 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.790
 four and a half thousand 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.360
 the customer here is always very small 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.129
 standard this controller 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.459
 the delivery will be in the future 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:48.500
 our electronics and citizens of the navel 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.090
 the value placed on that is in 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.379
 waterproof for easy to understand 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.150
 have to 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:55.160
 it also comes with this cover me and 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.810
 with the holder that must 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.250
 can 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.990
 Yes 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.240
 I can now that has everything 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:04.730
 Regulate once it is in principle the 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.900
 Function of the raid controller one can 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.510
 find a wave 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.710
 You can just do the performance 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.450
 regulate 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.450
 or you can in principle 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.730
 also a second controller 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.370
 connect two points 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:25.780
 You can connect both cables 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.890
 could only run or there is 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.310
 There are some possibilities 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:29.310
 possibilities 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.130
 Do you have anything new after we have 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.130
 there is only one 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.470
 okay that was already the next product 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.130
 AbrÃ¤umer also known for doing the company 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.520
 because he knew I already 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.990
 there comes a but what left we right 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.760
 now have a big one 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:50.840
 little brother new here we have the 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:53.840
 9001 to 140 liters magnetically attached 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.900
 was in principle as well as being that 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.610
 bigger brother off 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.630
 just a small step one 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.090
 reduction 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.720
 and a very big brother about it 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.350
 1200 liters based on the model 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.120
 self- design 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.800
 the big one may have as innovations 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.410
 interesting what slice of the 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.950
 decoupled and now has lisa lenz 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:22.140
 the fighters would have the same as at 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.960
 the tour wants and then you have there 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.030
 next to it from our museum 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.390
 our federal issues so very nice the 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.430
 my grandfather's first relegated in 1963 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.430
 years 50 years 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.230
 very short is that your biggest try 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.870
 like master stream with 420 watts skating 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.930
 one is not even lighting 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.890
 participate in the power consumption 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.740
 yes we wish you nice ones 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.930
 Messetage since further innovative the 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:56.100
 previous very well done and then 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.100
 do not see us arrive
