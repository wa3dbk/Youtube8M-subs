00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
thousand coins other thing so I'd rather

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.639

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
obviously if you have enough money then

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.029 
obviously if you have enough money then
you<00:00:45.270> would<00:00:45.390> want<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.690> play<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.020> them<00:00:46.230> with<00:00:46.920> it

almost<00:00:47.219> over<00:00:47.610> Pepe<00:00:48.059> just<00:00:48.539> because<00:00:48.930> he<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
almost over Pepe just because he is a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
almost over Pepe just because he is a
tiny<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.340> better<00:00:50.670> generally<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.329> some<00:00:51.960> of

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
tiny little better generally in some of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.209 
tiny little better generally in some of
the<00:00:52.140> tackling<00:00:52.469> stats<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:52.980> sort<00:00:53.190> thing

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
the tackling stats and that sort thing

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
the tackling stats and that sort thing
but<00:00:53.879> honestly<00:00:54.539> it's<00:00:54.690> not<00:00:54.809> worth<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> moat

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
but honestly it's not worth the moat

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.920 
but honestly it's not worth the moat
worth<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> money<00:00:56.190> after<00:00:57.120> got<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.750> in
