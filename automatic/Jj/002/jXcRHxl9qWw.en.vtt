polypharmacy and in care facilities this
is<00:01:00.989> much<00:01:01.170> higher<00:01:03.739> but<00:01:04.739> what's<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.129> problem

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
is much higher but what's the problem

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.149 
is much higher but what's the problem
with<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.519> people<00:01:05.729> being<00:01:06.000> unloaded<00:01:06.479> tablets

with all people being unloaded tablets
there's<00:01:08.159> surely<00:01:08.340> some<00:01:08.549> positives<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.180> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
there's surely some positives of that so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
there's surely some positives of that so
for<00:01:10.200> example<00:01:10.560> if<00:01:10.680> there's<00:01:10.830> an<00:01:10.920> evidence-based

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
I'll tell you what I'll give this

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.839 
I'll tell you what I'll give this
patient<00:03:29.819> some<00:03:29.940> Doretta<00:03:30.269> such<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.750> frozen<00:03:30.930> wide

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:31.849 
patient some Doretta such as frozen wide

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.129 
patient some Doretta such as frozen wide
the<00:03:32.849> net<00:03:33.000> result<00:03:33.299> might<00:03:33.480> be<00:03:33.510> precipitating

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
the net result might be precipitating

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.470 
the net result might be precipitating
over<00:03:34.440> static<00:03:34.620> hypotension<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.639> he<00:03:36.329> being

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
over static hypotension and he being

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.449 
over static hypotension and he being
really<00:03:36.750> pessimistic<00:03:36.900> this<00:03:37.859> may<00:03:38.040> result<00:03:38.280> in

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
really pessimistic this may result in

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.819 
really pessimistic this may result in
your<00:03:38.549> patient<00:03:38.880> falling<00:03:39.239> fracturing<00:03:39.739> so<00:03:40.739> you

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
your patient falling fracturing so you

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.319 
your patient falling fracturing so you
can<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.370> a<00:03:41.400> very<00:03:41.609> common<00:03:41.970> prescribing

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
can see here a very common prescribing

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.360 
can see here a very common prescribing
cascade<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.410> can<00:03:43.560> result<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.889> harm<00:03:44.130> to<00:03:44.250> a

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
cascade that can result in harm to a

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.440 
cascade that can result in harm to a
patient<00:03:44.790> or<00:03:46.639> a<00:03:47.639> by<00:03:47.790> example<00:03:48.239> about

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
patient or a by example about

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.490 
patient or a by example about
prescribing<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:49.079> what<00:03:49.230> we've<00:03:49.349> called

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
prescribing is what we've called

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.800 
prescribing is what we've called
counterproductive<00:03:49.980> prescribing<00:03:50.660> this<00:03:51.660> is

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
counterproductive prescribing this is

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.030 
counterproductive prescribing this is
basically<00:03:52.079> where<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.560> giving<00:03:52.859> two

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
basically where you giving two

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.680 
basically where you giving two
medications<00:03:53.549> that<00:03:53.760> pose<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.090> actions<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.569> one

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
medications that pose the actions of one

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.990 
medications that pose the actions of one
another<00:03:55.430> taking<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.519> patient<00:03:56.790> from<00:03:56.849> the

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
another taking the patient from the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.640 
another taking the patient from the
previous<00:03:57.329> example<00:03:57.750> who<00:03:57.870> has<00:03:58.019> off<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.349> static

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
previous example who has off of static

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.069 
previous example who has off of static
hypotension<00:03:59.099> you<00:04:00.030> might<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.480> well<00:04:00.840> let's

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
hypotension you might think well let's

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:02.690 
hypotension you might think well let's
give<00:04:01.769> fludrocortisone

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
give fludrocortisone

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.390 
give fludrocortisone
so<00:04:03.440> mineralocorticoid<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:04.950> increases

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
so mineralocorticoid that increases

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.800 
so mineralocorticoid that increases
sodium<00:04:05.669> resorption<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.209> water<00:04:06.359> resorption

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
sodium resorption and water resorption

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.479 
sodium resorption and water resorption
but<00:04:07.560> essentially<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.099> think<00:04:08.280> about<00:04:08.340> the

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
but essentially if you think about the

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.039 
but essentially if you think about the
way<00:04:08.579> these<00:04:08.730> two<00:04:08.880> drugs<00:04:09.030> work<00:04:09.359> they're

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
way these two drugs work they're

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.270 
way these two drugs work they're
basically<00:04:10.349> two<00:04:10.590> sides<00:04:10.859> of<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.069> same<00:04:11.220> coin

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
basically two sides of the same coin

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.310 
basically two sides of the same coin
this<00:04:12.120> is<00:04:12.299> counter<00:04:12.599> productive<00:04:12.630> prescribing

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
this is counter productive prescribing

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.509 
this is counter productive prescribing
the<00:04:16.320> last<00:04:16.500> fer<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.889> talk<00:04:17.130> is<00:04:17.280> going<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.430> focus

the last fer this talk is going to focus

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.279 
the last fer this talk is going to focus
on<00:04:17.940> some<00:04:18.120> really<00:04:18.359> nasty<00:04:18.479> medications

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
on some really nasty medications

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.649 
on some really nasty medications
medications<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.669> are<00:04:20.760> badly<00:04:20.909> tolerated<00:04:21.539> and

00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:21.659 
medications that are badly tolerated and

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:24.450 
medications that are badly tolerated and
