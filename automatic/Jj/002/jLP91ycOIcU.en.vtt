00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.859 
out gives you something to do peat moss
is<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.579> good<00:01:50.850> thing<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.119> maintaining<00:01:51.420> moisture

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
is a good thing for maintaining moisture

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
but it can cause a skin rash so I would

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.719 
but it can cause a skin rash so I would
not<00:01:54.450> recommend<00:01:54.590> peat<00:01:55.590> moss<00:01:55.770> if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.399> use<00:01:56.520> any

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
the dirt was all hard so I had to use

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.390 
the dirt was all hard so I had to use
these<00:02:20.670> PVC<00:02:21.270> pipes<00:02:21.420> here<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:23.040> can<00:02:23.160> see<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
these PVC pipes here you can see the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.470 
these PVC pipes here you can see the
holes<00:02:23.610> that<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:23.880> drilled<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.240> it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
holes that I drilled in it

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.420 
holes that I drilled in it
what<00:02:25.110> I<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.560> stick<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.950> down<00:02:26.070> into<00:02:26.340> the

what I do is I stick it down into the
bottom<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:26.790> pit<00:02:27.209> stick<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:27.900> garden<00:02:28.230> hose

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580

squeeze the nozzle trigger and the water

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.230 
squeeze the nozzle trigger and the water
percolates<00:02:35.400> up<00:02:35.610> through<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> mud<00:02:36.060> and

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
percolates up through the mud and

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.360 
percolates up through the mud and
softens<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.989> then<00:02:37.739> of<00:02:37.830> course<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:38.190> have

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
softens it and then of course I have

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.290 
softens it and then of course I have
this<00:02:38.489> stick<00:02:40.340> mechanical<00:02:41.340> agitation<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.970> also

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
this stick mechanical agitation is also

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.420 
this stick mechanical agitation is also
good<00:02:43.700> now<00:02:44.700> as<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.120> weather<00:02:45.270> warms<00:02:45.600> up<00:02:46.430> and

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
softening up because what happens in the

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
winter time is that they're all

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.300 
winter time is that they're all
stratifies<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.420> becomes<00:04:00.660> hard<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:02.010> clay

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
stratifies and becomes hard like clay

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.300 
stratifies and becomes hard like clay
and<00:04:02.549> he's<00:04:02.730> got<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.970> break<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.650> but<00:04:04.650> if<00:04:05.130> you

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
and he's got to break it up but if you

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.860 
and he's got to break it up but if you
really<00:04:05.459> got<00:04:05.670> money<00:04:05.910> you<00:04:06.030> might<00:04:06.450> want<00:04:06.660> to<00:04:06.690> use

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
really got money you might want to use
