00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
tri-oval and there just was nowhere for

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.880 
tri-oval and there just was nowhere for
these<00:01:44.600> guys<00:01:44.810> to<00:01:45.049> go<00:01:45.200> once<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.649> lose<00:01:45.860> your

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
these guys to go once you lose your

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.590 
these guys to go once you lose your
momentum<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:46.549> just<00:01:46.700> backs<00:01:46.939> everything<00:01:47.420> up

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
momentum it just backs everything up

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.420 
momentum it just backs everything up
until<00:01:47.750> somebody<00:01:48.290> runs<00:01:48.560> over<00:01:48.860> somebody<00:01:49.280> and

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
want to try to maintain that momentum

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.719
