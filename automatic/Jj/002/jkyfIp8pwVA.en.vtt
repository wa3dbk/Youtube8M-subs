don't<00:00:59.770> know<00:00:59.829> maybe<00:01:00.039> fourth<00:01:00.460> fifth<00:01:00.820> largest

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
don't know maybe fourth fifth largest

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.660 
don't know maybe fourth fifth largest
pharmaceutical<00:01:01.710> in<00:01:02.710> this<00:01:02.949> company<00:01:03.460> in<00:01:03.550> the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
pharmaceutical in this company in the

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.999 
pharmaceutical in this company in the
world<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.149> largest<00:01:04.560> diagnostic<00:01:05.560> company

world and the largest diagnostic company
in<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:06.340> world<00:01:06.369> so<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.330> idea<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.780> to<00:01:08.229> make

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
in the world so the idea is to make

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
in the world so the idea is to make
medicines<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.640> are<00:01:10.119> really<00:01:10.960> really<00:01:11.260> deliver

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
medicines that are really really deliver

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.230 
medicines that are really really deliver
benefit<00:01:13.540> tangible<00:01:14.470> terrific<00:01:15.280> benefit<00:01:15.820> for

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
benefit tangible terrific benefit for

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.940 
benefit tangible terrific benefit for
people<00:01:16.600> so<00:01:16.930> if<00:01:17.020> we<00:01:17.170> make<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.380> medicine<00:01:17.920> for

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
people so if we make a medicine for

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.249 
people so if we make a medicine for
somebody<00:01:18.520> with<00:01:18.670> cancer<00:01:19.270> we'd<00:01:19.720> have<00:01:19.840> to<00:01:19.900> show

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
somebody with cancer we'd have to show

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.800 
somebody with cancer we'd have to show
that<00:01:20.290> they<00:01:20.650> actually<00:01:21.189> live<00:01:21.520> longer<00:01:21.689> when<00:01:22.689> they

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
that they actually live longer when they

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.440 
that they actually live longer when they
take<00:01:23.049> the<00:01:23.229> medicine<00:01:23.740> for<00:01:24.460> example<00:01:24.970> so<00:01:25.420> i

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
take the medicine for example so i

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.410 
take the medicine for example so i
oversee<00:01:26.110> research<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.909> our<00:01:28.030> research<00:01:28.390> group

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
oversee research so our research group

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.090 
oversee research so our research group
is<00:01:28.900> about<00:01:29.340> 1,300<00:01:30.340> folks<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.840> have<00:01:31.869> about<00:01:32.229> 150

the dose it depends on the disease

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.879 
the dose it depends on the disease
sometimes<00:03:27.329> it'll<00:03:27.599> be<00:03:27.810> in<00:03:27.930> patients<00:03:28.560> with<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:31.949 
disease sometimes not but then usually

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.140 
disease sometimes not but then usually
in<00:03:32.069> in<00:03:32.549> phase<00:03:32.879> 2<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:34.079> do<00:03:34.379> you<00:03:35.370> do<00:03:35.669> us<00:03:35.849> a

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
in in phase 2 you do you do us a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.990 
in in phase 2 you do you do us a

relatively small number of patients but
enough<00:03:39.419> patients<00:03:40.049> so<00:03:40.199> that<00:03:40.230> you<00:03:40.500> have

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
enough patients so that you have

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.460 
enough patients so that you have
statistical<00:03:41.699> power<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.780> see<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.290> you're

what we then do would be to if the phase

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.909 
what we then do would be to if the phase

the United States permission to mark
the<00:04:24.800> drug<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.630> we're<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.350> my<00:04:27.979> job<00:04:28.220> is<00:04:28.280> to

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
the drug so we're so my job is to

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.620 
the drug so we're so my job is to
deliver<00:04:30.400> molecules<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.729> we<00:04:31.910> say<00:04:32.150> have<00:04:32.360> gone

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
deliver molecules that we say have gone

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.810 
deliver molecules that we say have gone
through<00:04:32.930> proof-of-concept<00:04:33.470> we<00:04:34.430> believe<00:04:34.789> that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
through proof-of-concept we believe that

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.629 
through proof-of-concept we believe that
they<00:04:35.150> work<00:04:35.449> we<00:04:36.110> have<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.470> chemical<00:04:36.919> entity<00:04:37.430> we

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 
they work we have the chemical entity we

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:40.270 
they work we have the chemical entity we
know<00:04:37.789> that<00:04:38.000> it<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.360> be<00:04:38.750> manufactured<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.860> to

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
know that it can be manufactured and to

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.020 
know that it can be manufactured and to
hand<00:04:40.639> this<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.240> global<00:04:41.600> group<00:04:42.050> where

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
hand this to the global group where

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.700 
hand this to the global group where
there's<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.210> lot<00:04:44.419> of<00:04:44.449> science<00:04:44.990> involved<00:04:45.590> but

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
there's a lot of science involved but

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.370 
there's a lot of science involved but
there's<00:04:45.949> a<00:04:46.009> huge<00:04:46.430> amount<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:47.050> logistics<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
there's a huge amount of logistics and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.800 
there's a huge amount of logistics and
regulatory<00:04:49.240> involvement<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.449> that's<00:04:50.630> when

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
regulatory involvement and that's when

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:52.900 
regulatory involvement and that's when
the<00:04:50.840> commercial<00:04:51.380> people<00:04:52.009> get<00:04:52.220> involved<00:04:52.520> and

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
the commercial people get involved and

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.260 
the commercial people get involved and
so<00:04:53.120> on<00:04:53.300> hey<00:04:53.930> end<00:04:54.139> up<00:04:54.850> frankly<00:04:55.850> I'm<00:04:55.970> less

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
so on hey end up frankly I'm less

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.659 
so on hey end up frankly I'm less
interested<00:04:56.690> in<00:04:57.080> that<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.470> then<00:04:57.919> go<00:04:58.130> back<00:04:58.370> and

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
interested in that I then go back and

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.969 
interested in that I then go back and
try<00:04:58.940> and<00:04:59.090> discover<00:04:59.750> a<00:04:59.870> new<00:04:59.990> medicine<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:00.800> show

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:00.979 
try and discover a new medicine and show

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:03.430 
try and discover a new medicine and show
that<00:05:01.010> it<00:05:01.220> works
