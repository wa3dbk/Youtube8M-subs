00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
the running costs so I think probably

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.199 
the running costs so I think probably
about<00:03:14.229> three<00:03:14.979> five<00:03:15.280> thousand<00:03:15.699> dollars<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:16.180> year

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
about three five thousand dollars a year

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.879 
about three five thousand dollars a year

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
to help pay the running costs give me a

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.680 
to help pay the running costs give me a
bit<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.069> extra<00:03:18.340> money<00:03:18.459> but<00:03:19.000> it's<00:03:19.150> really<00:03:19.359> more

bit of extra money but it's really more

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.229 
bit of extra money but it's really more

work that we did for the city of Sydney

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.050 
work that we did for the city of Sydney
we<00:03:56.590> estimated<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.280> for<00:03:57.489> every<00:03:57.519> dollar
