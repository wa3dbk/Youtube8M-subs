I love the look of it if I was to own
any<00:00:30.240> bike<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.439> propose<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> even

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
any bike just just propose not to even

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.240 
any bike just just propose not to even
write<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.480> would<00:00:33.780> get<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.590> MCM<00:00:35.070> just

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
write I would get this the MCM just

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.340 
write I would get this the MCM just
first<00:00:36.000> thing<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.719> notice<00:00:37.020> without<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
first thing you notice without this

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.139 
first thing you notice without this
fight<00:00:37.590> is<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:37.800> how<00:00:38.219> impressive<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.940> looked

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
fight is just how impressive it looked

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.900 
fight is just how impressive it looked
at<00:00:39.530> almost<00:00:40.530> like<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.829> time<00:00:41.040> trial<00:00:41.370> bike<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
at almost like a time trial bike in the

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779 
at almost like a time trial bike in the
way<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.300> shake<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.230> tubes<00:00:43.530> yeah<00:00:44.489> it<00:00:44.610> looks

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
way that shake the tubes yeah it looks

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.209 
way that shake the tubes yeah it looks
very<00:00:44.879> long<00:00:45.270> but<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.539> guess<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:45.960> only<00:00:46.219> 56:17

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
very long but I guess it's only 56:17

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.700 
very long but I guess it's only 56:17
taught<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.730> so<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:51.600> bow<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.320> shape<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
taught you so the bow the shape of the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
taught you so the bow the shape of the
bars<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:53.070> always<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> final<00:00:54.180> after<00:00:55.110> they

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
bars I always get a final after they

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930 
bars I always get a final after they
break<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.620> shout<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.070> guru<00:00:56.340> would<00:00:56.520> love<00:00:56.730> them

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
break my shout do guru would love them

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430 
break my shout do guru would love them
because<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:57.690> them<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.020> your<00:00:58.230> hand

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
because it's put them in that your hand

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.200 
because it's put them in that your hand
in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.800> position<00:00:59.280> that's<00:00:59.399> just<00:00:59.699> right<00:00:59.910> where

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
in the position that's just right where

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.120 
in the position that's just right where
you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:01.440> straight

well<00:01:06.790> what<00:01:07.450> what<00:01:07.720> a<00:01:07.750> bike<00:01:07.990> it's<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:08.590> it's

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
well what what a bike it's just it's

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.580 
well what what a bike it's just it's
just<00:01:09.040> really<00:01:09.220> really<00:01:09.909> quick<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:11.110> can<00:01:11.259> see<00:01:11.439> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
just really really quick you can see the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.530 
just really really quick you can see the
BMC<00:01:11.770> I've<00:01:12.159> invested<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.759> lot<00:01:12.880> of<00:01:12.909> time<00:01:13.000> and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
BMC I've invested a lot of time and

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.030 
BMC I've invested a lot of time and
manpower<00:01:13.689> under<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.320> plate<00:01:14.590> because

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
manpower under this plate because

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.430 
manpower under this plate because
they've<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:15.880> picked<00:01:16.090> every<00:01:16.479> part<00:01:16.810> on<00:01:17.140> this

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
they've just picked every part on this

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.320 
they've just picked every part on this
bike<00:01:17.680> so<00:01:17.979> carefully<00:01:18.549> so<00:01:18.790> that<00:01:18.820> it<00:01:19.000> all<00:01:19.149> comes

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
bike so carefully so that it all comes

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.380 
bike so carefully so that it all comes
together<00:01:19.540> in<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.960> great<00:01:20.170> package<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:24.009> brakes

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
together in a great package the brakes

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.730 
together in a great package the brakes
with<00:01:25.390> great<00:01:25.600> noting<00:01:25.930> is<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.080> there<00:01:26.470> are<00:01:26.590> more

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
with great noting is that there are more

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.230 
with great noting is that there are more
of<00:01:26.830> an<00:01:26.920> on/off<00:01:27.280> feeling<00:01:27.729> there's<00:01:27.880> not<00:01:28.030> a<00:01:28.060> lot

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
of an on/off feeling there's not a lot

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.330 
of an on/off feeling there's not a lot
of<00:01:28.270> modulation<00:01:28.750> to<00:01:29.110> them<00:01:29.259> but<00:01:29.799> you've<00:01:29.950> got<00:01:30.159> a

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
of modulation to them but you've got a

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.359 
of modulation to them but you've got a
carbon<00:01:31.170> breaking<00:01:32.170> surface<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.799> usually<00:01:33.190> that

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
carbon breaking surface and usually that

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.590 
carbon breaking surface and usually that
dulls<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:35.670> power<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.000> bracelet<00:01:37.450> these

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
dulls the power of the bracelet these

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.930 
dulls the power of the bracelet these
are<00:01:37.810> super<00:01:38.140> powerful<00:01:38.409> brakes<00:01:38.860> they<00:01:39.250> really

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
are super powerful brakes they really

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.969 
are super powerful brakes they really
pull<00:01:40.149> you<00:01:40.240> up<00:01:40.420> there's<00:01:40.600> no<00:01:40.810> either<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.800> don't

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
pull you up there's no either you don't

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.980 
pull you up there's no either you don't
have<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.280> guess<00:01:43.240> whether<00:01:43.569> you're<00:01:43.750> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.899> be

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
have to guess whether you're going to be

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:45.300 
have to guess whether you're going to be
able<00:01:44.110> to<00:01:44.200> stop<00:01:44.440> or<00:01:44.590> not<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.920> day<00:01:45.069> just

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
this case would just simply be brakes

this case would just simply be brakes
and<00:01:51.360> then<00:01:52.360> I<00:01:52.479> ideal<00:01:52.960> for<00:01:53.289> the<00:01:53.470> leverage<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.399> it

with<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> powerful<00:02:10.030> brake<00:02:11.040> at<00:02:12.040> first<00:02:12.489> you<00:02:12.730> think

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
with a powerful brake at first you think

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.670 
with a powerful brake at first you think
it's<00:02:12.970> a<00:02:13.120> bit<00:02:13.269> you<00:02:13.720> grab<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.110> brakes<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.590> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
it's a bit you grab the brakes and you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.800 
it's a bit you grab the brakes and you
think<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.340> bit<00:02:15.459> spongy<00:02:15.730> but<00:02:16.450> once<00:02:16.570> you<00:02:16.690> get

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
think it's a bit spongy but once you get
