00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.769
 the crime of the babe 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.769
 I live without knowing how yes no 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.620
 today begins digital we have with us 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:22.720
 amaze with soler good usually people always feel a lot yoshida I've 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.779
 respected about that in these issues 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.929
 i the ipad a lot your birth to why you think you should 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.219
 Well maybe because the media have usually tried 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.660
 very bad these issues 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.700
 They have treated us with sensationalism and adjusted very little to reality and 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.510
 the truth 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 we are used to seeing in sensitive media 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.330
 picturesque sensory 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.960
 but there are never researchers who know that there is a distinction the sensitive is 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.590
 the one that has a capacity 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.629
 you rehearse let's call him so I thought seers can be measured 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.040
 but the researcher is a little to see how the difference between a 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.650
 doctor and nurse 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.560
 the doctor does not have to because the doctor does not have to have the disease to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.560
 cure the patient in the same way the researcher of these phenomena 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.870
 we do not have to be sensitive 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 to be able to solve the problems 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 I a little talking about your book you have would be well known as 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.420
 example the era k naan the faces b 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.390
 of belmez percent 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.800
 have ever felt fear when investigating these phenomena we are going to 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.610
 do 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.830
 I imagined that a doctor was afraid of blood 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.540
 I could not act 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.970
 then we just maybe because we have more knowledge more 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.480
 information 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.450
 that the rest of our peers 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.899
 because we approach these phenomena trying to analyze them 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.939
 first we try to analyze the most reaction to the possible mind what happens 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.109
 is that you do not forget the paranormal phenomenon that phenomenon for which 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.320
 we do not have a reasonable explanation 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 that means that with the advances of scientific knowledge many 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 of these phenomena end up being included 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:16.249
 in well-known sciences imagine all those that I have told you before the 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.479
 biology would end up by inserting into science the science of 

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:25.189
 biology if the physical defects then in physics and in the others in 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.039
 psychiatry or psychological 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.499
 so we go what we treat and what the parapsychology takes a lot 

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:33.409
 years already trying to investigate 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.369
 is what the mechanism 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.479
 by which the 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.089
 because that I do feel a mystery 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:45.459
 people admit telepathy but we still do not know how it occurs 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.129
 done and we know that there is a minimizing receptor that there has to be empathy 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.299
 that distance does not exist we know many things civil but what is the 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.299
 exact mechanism by which it occurs 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.519
 a transmission 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.849
 of a telepathic content from one person to another we still do not know it 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:05.099
 So I think it's very correct to address the issues 

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:08.539
 from the journalistic point of view 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.539
 a saying 'good if you are there who you what happens 

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:17.209
 in you what has ever sunk requested the person who opted in 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:18.799
 concert to guarantee 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:19.749
 to another 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:21.540
 a small debate is established
