you can go up here and actually set the
start<00:01:26.780> and<00:01:26.960> end<00:01:27.170> points<00:01:27.230> on<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.280> exact<00:01:28.850> second

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
start and end points on the exact second

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.270 
start and end points on the exact second
and<00:01:29.600> then<00:01:29.750> once<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.020> have<00:01:30.170> that<00:01:30.350> set<00:01:30.620> you<00:01:31.070> just

and then once you have that set you just
hit<00:01:31.400> save<00:01:31.640> trim<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.300> it<00:01:32.840> saves<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.260> exactly

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
hit save trim and it saves it exactly

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.130 
hit save trim and it saves it exactly
from<00:01:33.890> there<00:01:34.070> now<00:01:34.760> and<00:01:35.330> then<00:01:35.450> I<00:01:35.480> just<00:01:35.750> put<00:01:35.930> the

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
from there now and then I just put the

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.990 
from there now and then I just put the
clip<00:01:36.380> after<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:36.830> clip<00:01:37.010> after<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.430> clip<00:01:37.670> blah

blah blah
and<00:01:39.740> that's<00:01:40.070> how<00:01:40.490> I<00:01:40.520> basically<00:01:40.970> did<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.420> now

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
and that's how I basically did that now

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.760 
and that's how I basically did that now

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.379 
this out a little if I have to go in and
subtract<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.989> few<00:03:21.139> of<00:03:21.260> these<00:03:21.410> lines<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:23.180> make<00:03:23.329> it

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
subtract a few of these lines to make it

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.819 
subtract a few of these lines to make it
better<00:03:24.100> give<00:03:25.100> me<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.430> second<00:03:26.209> and<00:03:26.480> to<00:03:27.410> fix<00:03:27.620> it

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:27.829 
better give me a second and to fix it

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.949 
better give me a second and to fix it
I'm<00:03:27.980> just<00:03:28.130> going<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.579> bump<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.090> down<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.720> the

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
I'm just going to bump this down to the

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.099 
I'm just going to bump this down to the
size<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.319> 22<00:03:30.769> instead<00:03:31.130> of<00:03:31.220> 24<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.540> again<00:03:32.900> just

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
size of 22 instead of 24 and again just

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.240 
size of 22 instead of 24 and again just
move<00:03:33.290> it<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.500> the<00:03:33.620> side<00:03:34.690> actually<00:03:35.690> and<00:03:36.250> that's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
move it to the side actually and that's

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.009 
move it to the side actually and that's
exactly<00:03:37.609> what<00:03:37.940> I<00:03:37.970> do<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.450> again<00:03:38.690> you<00:03:38.870> can

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
exactly what I do and again you can

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.390 
exactly what I do and again you can
change<00:03:39.260> all<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.650> colors<00:03:39.680> you<00:03:40.130> can<00:03:40.280> do

long<00:03:47.030> right<00:03:47.239> here<00:03:47.480> up<00:03:47.959> here<00:03:48.139> where<00:03:48.470> it<00:03:48.530> says

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
long right here up here where it says

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.059 
long right here up here where it says
text<00:03:49.160> duration<00:03:49.840> see<00:03:50.840> how<00:03:50.959> it<00:03:51.079> goes<00:03:51.260> only<00:03:51.500> to<00:03:51.620> 30

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
text duration see how it goes only to 30

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:54.340 
text duration see how it goes only to 30
that's<00:03:52.880> not<00:03:53.120> the<00:03:53.329> limit<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:53.840> can<00:03:54.019> set<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.319> to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
that's not the limit you can set it to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.949 
that's not the limit you can set it to
whatever<00:03:54.680> you<00:03:55.250> want<00:03:55.280> gonna<00:03:55.760> do

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
whatever you want gonna do

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.620 
whatever you want gonna do
let's<00:03:57.349> do<00:03:59.560> 1,000.00<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:01.489> see<00:04:02.269> if<00:04:02.329> that<00:04:02.450> works

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
let's do 1,000.00 and see if that works

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.080 
let's do 1,000.00 and see if that works
see<00:04:02.840> how<00:04:03.079> it<00:04:03.319> just<00:04:03.349> got<00:04:03.799> bigger<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.340> now<00:04:04.849> it's

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
see how it just got bigger and now it's

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.599 
see how it just got bigger and now it's
on<00:04:05.299> all<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.650> clips<00:04:06.859> all<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.310> way<00:04:07.400> through

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
on all of the clips all the way through

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:08.920 
on all of the clips all the way through
to<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:07.849> end<00:04:07.880> so<00:04:08.239> you<00:04:08.329> just<00:04:08.450> want<00:04:08.599> to<00:04:08.660> give<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.870> a

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
to the end so you just want to give it a

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.509 
to the end so you just want to give it a
large<00:04:09.139> number<00:04:09.500> to<00:04:09.530> where<00:04:09.799> it<00:04:09.980> goes<00:04:10.190> to<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.489> end

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
large number to where it goes to the end

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.309 
large number to where it goes to the end
it'll<00:04:11.120> tell<00:04:11.299> you<00:04:11.419> there<00:04:11.569> are<00:04:11.720> limits<00:04:12.109> and

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
it'll tell you there are limits and

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.479 
it'll tell you there are limits and
stuff<00:04:12.500> like<00:04:12.620> that<00:04:12.799> which<00:04:12.950> makes<00:04:13.130> total<00:04:13.370> sense

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
stuff like that which makes total sense

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.779 
stuff like that which makes total sense
and<00:04:14.000> now<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.599> give<00:04:14.900> it<00:04:14.930> a<00:04:15.079> cool<00:04:15.380> effect<00:04:15.829> of<00:04:16.639> what

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:16.789 
and now to give it a cool effect of what

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760 
and I click on the picture right here

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.330

obviously<00:05:53.210> or<00:05:53.630> they<00:05:53.900> clip<00:05:54.770> right<00:05:54.950> here<00:05:55.130> that<00:05:55.310> I

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
obviously or they clip right here that I

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.250

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
obviously want to transition to and I

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.110 
obviously want to transition to and I
usually<00:05:57.410> just<00:05:57.650> do<00:05:58.040> this<00:05:58.250> one<00:05:58.460> right<00:05:58.580> here<00:05:58.910> it's

00:05:59.110 --> 00:05:59.120 
usually just do this one right here it's

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.300 
usually just do this one right here it's
called<00:05:59.510> blur<00:05:59.960> and<00:06:00.290> then<00:06:00.740> there's<00:06:00.920> this<00:06:01.070> one<00:06:01.250> I

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
called blur and then there's this one I

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.520 
called blur and then there's this one I
believe<00:06:01.490> it's<00:06:01.850> also<00:06:02.000> cross<00:06:02.780> fade<00:06:03.080> or<00:06:03.260> blue

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530

blur<00:06:04.010> through<00:06:04.340> black<00:06:04.640> I<00:06:04.880> do<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.120> blur<00:06:05.300> one

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
blur through black I do the blur one

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.340 
blur through black I do the blur one
usually<00:06:06.290> and<00:06:06.770> then<00:06:06.950> I<00:06:06.980> changed<00:06:07.640> it<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.350> one

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
usually and then I changed it to one

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.440 
usually and then I changed it to one
second<00:06:09.890> so<00:06:10.490> when<00:06:10.610> you<00:06:10.700> go<00:06:10.790> to<00:06:10.850> the<00:06:11.030> beginning

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
second so when you go to the beginning

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.450 
second so when you go to the beginning
you<00:06:12.020> have<00:06:12.050> your<00:06:12.320> picture<00:06:12.650> showing<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.250> then
