00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:15.549
 m 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.400
 now come to this particular 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.050
 tree, let's see how it works 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.050
 and start pruning 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 the ground is the root system 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.109
 extensive 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.730
 here is our root between the ground and the trunk 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.000
 neck 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.710
 further trunk 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.750
 or stamp 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 the first tier of the skeletal branches of it there 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.810
 12 years of the police for the first time 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.260
 further second tier 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.700
 trunk 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.490
 and the crown itself 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.650
 and in the blood 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.430
 many branches of different ages 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.000
 long thickness 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.630
 and destination 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.080
 let's see why 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.470
 from the trunk go 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.700
 thick skeleton now century 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.140
 first order 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.880
 second order 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.470
 fruit formations 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:19.570
 these are 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.100
 various lieutenants 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.440
 kapitsa 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.240
 in kachanovka 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.140
 here it is Kamchatka she grows rings 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.600
 what each year one ring grows 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:32.659
 slowly slowly 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.950
 but I would waive taxes 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.100
 work is like gloves 5 eight years 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.979
 then begins and gradual 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.780
 reduction of offerings 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.200
 dying here 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 chapter 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.430
 Well, we will not give up until just 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.410
 the sets of these names are fruit 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.140
 of education 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.220
 annual increment 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.620
 it's important to distinguish him but I'm happy 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.670
 quite simple annual increase 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.429
 is wood such 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:04.360
 serova 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.410
 light brown color consider 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.229
 closer 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.279
 Here's a year-old growth sprig 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:12.249
 kidneys 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:14.079
 such pointy 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.149
 small in size unlike 

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:19.449
 fruit buds and which is more 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.409
 rounded more so exaggerated then plump 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.939
 no cohesion 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.260
 than the big branch is covered with fruit 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.280
 kidneys the more valuable it is rarely 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.459
 agree that when rarely naked happen and 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.219
 such when the acron is too thick 

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.209
 we are from this branch apple especially harvest 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 do not wait 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.919
 because fruit buds have such branches 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.139
 cell alene 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.779
 located only at the ends how much can 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:47.199
 be a crop on such a branch for example 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.859
 covered with fruit buds and that is 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:51.839
 which stupidly fruit buds are located 

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.180
 only at the ends of the world it is clear that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.400
 here this branch is more fruitful more 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.559
 yield more valuable 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.479
 gardener 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.639
 by the way the magnitude of the annual increase 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.909
 diagnostic sign 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.499
 the port and its value can be determined in 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.499
 general condition tree 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.929
 young tree year growth 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.319
 usually fifty seventy 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.429
 centimeters 

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.640
 if less 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.740
 it means the tree is not strong enough 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.629
 develops normally 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.989
 because the more human growth 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.689
 the more risks on it the more 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.469
 nutrients they produce 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.959
 should we path more nutritious 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.109
 substances 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.269
 of places 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.889
 and modest is sent at the root the more 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:39.430
 nutrients to the roots the more they 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.799
 the roots work better the more they water 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.799
 reach and land and send crowns 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.639
 pruning trees correctly correctly 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.059
 annually 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:57.419
 can achieve that 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.010
 need to ensure that each flyers 

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:03.439
 output to the sun 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.189
 at least half a day because that crisis 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.169
 which is located in kenya it produces 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.779
 glucose is 10 times less than a leaf 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.009
 located in the sun 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:15.339
 how many nutrients are selected 

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:16.979
 how much less will go to root 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.769
 system from such sheet besides sheet 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.620
 located in kenya after rain or not 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.820
 need such a cloudy foggy weather as 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.520
 does not dry out that is, the percentage on it was 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.780
 more caused by different 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.069
 diseases 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.729
 on such leaves 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.589
 but also he often become or 

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:39.219
 defeated 

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:42.569
 convincing minute more 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.779
 so let's start 

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:47.020
 his 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.860
 but pruning
