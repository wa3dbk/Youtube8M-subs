00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.569 
it
but<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> history<00:00:32.160> of<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.340> light<00:00:32.550> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
but the history of this light is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.580 
but the history of this light is
somewhat<00:00:33.059> interesting<00:00:33.570> it's<00:00:33.989> a<00:00:34.200> tiered

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
somewhat interesting it's a tiered

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.319 
somewhat interesting it's a tiered
shaped<00:00:35.070> light<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.550> looks<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.910> teardrop

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
shaped light it looks like a teardrop

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
shaped light it looks like a teardrop
hence<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.899> name<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.469> been<00:00:37.800> used<00:00:38.040> in

the website for the lighting options I

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
the website for the lighting options I
said<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> magnet<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> magnet<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.479> is

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
said a magnet and the magnet actually is

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.200 
said a magnet and the magnet actually is
a<00:01:30.780> 70-pound<00:01:31.680> magnet<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.670> mounted<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a 70-pound magnet that's mounted to the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.510 
a 70-pound magnet that's mounted to the
base<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.720> particular<00:01:34.020> light<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.369> light

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
base of this particular light the light

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.149 
base of this particular light the light
itself<00:01:35.790> has<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.030> 100<00:01:36.780> watt<00:01:36.900> bulb<00:01:37.530> mounted

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
itself has a 100 watt bulb mounted

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.440 
itself has a 100 watt bulb mounted
inside<00:01:38.400> there<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.759> think<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.090> can<00:01:39.180> kind<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.360> move

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
inside there I think we can kind of move

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.370 
inside there I think we can kind of move
around<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.810> might<00:01:39.930> be<00:01:39.990> able<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
around they might be able to see a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.810 
around they might be able to see a
little<00:01:40.500> bit<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.490> studio<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.790> think

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
little bit here in the studio I think

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.100 
little bit here in the studio I think
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.960> see

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you can see it there we go you can see

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
you can see it there we go you can see
it<00:01:43.200> right<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:44.250> revolution<00:01:45.119> wise<00:01:45.299> that's

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
it right there it revolution wise that's

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.770 
it right there it revolution wise that's
the<00:01:45.990> flash<00:01:46.320> rate<00:01:46.590> is<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:47.399> 90<00:01:47.939> flashes<00:01:48.509> per

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the flash rate is at 90 flashes per

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.440 
the flash rate is at 90 flashes per
minute<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> bad<00:01:50.850> light<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.329> I

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
minute so it's it's not a bad light as I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.789 
minute so it's it's not a bad light as I
said<00:01:51.600> been<00:01:51.780> around<00:01:51.990> for<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.200> long<00:01:52.290> time<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
said been around for a long time I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.429 
said been around for a long time I
definitely<00:01:53.399> like<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.610> now<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> box<00:01:55.049> you'll

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
definitely like it now in the box you'll

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.679 
definitely like it now in the box you'll
get<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.649> couple<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.430> add-ons<00:01:57.090> this

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
get a couple of little add-ons this

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
get a couple of little add-ons this
happens<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.290> flash<00:01:58.770> back<00:01:59.100> cover<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520
