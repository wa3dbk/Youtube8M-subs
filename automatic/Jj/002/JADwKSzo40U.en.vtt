00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
although we tend to focus on new cars

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.580 
although we tend to focus on new cars
most<00:00:21.609> of<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.820> time<00:00:22.109> every<00:00:23.109> now<00:00:23.260> again

most of the time every now again
something<00:00:23.859> comes<00:00:24.220> our<00:00:24.400> way<00:00:24.519> that<00:00:24.640> we<00:00:24.760> simply

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
something comes our way that we simply

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.820 
something comes our way that we simply
can't<00:00:25.689> resist<00:00:25.840> something<00:00:26.260> really<00:00:26.590> special

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
can't resist something really special

can't resist something really special
and<00:00:27.160> this<00:00:27.699> is<00:00:27.760> about<00:00:28.210> as<00:00:28.359> special<00:00:28.599> as<00:00:28.840> they<00:00:28.960> get

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
and this is about as special as they get

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.720 
and this is about as special as they get
at<00:00:29.289> least<00:00:29.349> as<00:00:29.529> far<00:00:29.710> as<00:00:29.830> I'm<00:00:29.949> concerned<00:00:30.310> this<00:00:30.670> is

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
at least as far as I'm concerned this is

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.750 
at least as far as I'm concerned this is
a<00:00:30.880> 1955<00:00:31.630> Morgan<00:00:32.380> plus<00:00:32.650> for<00:00:32.920> some<00:00:33.520> people

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
a 1955 Morgan plus for some people

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.160 
a 1955 Morgan plus for some people
regard<00:00:33.910> it<00:00:34.180> as<00:00:34.270> the<00:00:34.450> ultimate<00:00:34.480> British

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.800 
sportscar and so do I Morgans are pretty
rare<00:00:39.670> at<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.910> best<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.240> times<00:00:40.300> but<00:00:40.660> this

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
rare at the best of times but this

particular car is very unique it's got
all<00:00:42.940> kinds<00:00:43.360> of<00:00:43.450> interesting<00:00:43.870> little<00:00:43.990> features

all kinds of interesting little features

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.740 
all kinds of interesting little features
for<00:00:44.950> example<00:00:44.980> you<00:00:45.880> probably<00:00:46.030> notice<00:00:46.510> that<00:00:46.600> its

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
for example you probably notice that its

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.020 
for example you probably notice that its
right-hand<00:00:47.140> drive<00:00:47.440> what<00:00:47.710> that<00:00:47.890> means<00:00:48.220> is<00:00:48.520> that

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
right-hand drive what that means is that

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.730 
right-hand drive what that means is that
it<00:00:49.120> was<00:00:49.210> probably<00:00:49.420> purchased<00:00:50.110> privately<00:00:50.590> in

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
it was probably purchased privately in

it was probably purchased privately in
the<00:00:50.770> United<00:00:51.190> Kingdom<00:00:51.520> and<00:00:51.670> brought<00:00:51.940> over<00:00:52.120> to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
the United Kingdom and brought over to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.330 
the United Kingdom and brought over to
North<00:00:52.690> America<00:00:53.140> as<00:00:53.680> opposed<00:00:53.920> as<00:00:54.070> we<00:00:54.160> can

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
North America as opposed as we can

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.820 
North America as opposed as we can
figure<00:00:54.520> it<00:00:54.790> arrived<00:00:55.270> in<00:00:55.450> California<00:00:55.830> somehow

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830
