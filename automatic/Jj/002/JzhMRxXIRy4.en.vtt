will be using pallet knives so let's get
into<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> first<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.399> we<00:00:32.550> have<00:00:32.759> to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
into it now the first thing we have to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.930 
into it now the first thing we have to
do<00:00:33.149> is<00:00:33.360> draw<00:00:34.020> up<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.500> wave<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.700> going<00:00:35.880> to

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
do is draw up our wave now I'm going to

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.389 
do is draw up our wave now I'm going to
use<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.480> Montmartre<00:00:37.170> charcoal<00:00:37.770> pencil<00:00:38.219> for

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
use a Montmartre charcoal pencil for

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.479 
use a Montmartre charcoal pencil for
this<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.730> find<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.110> best<00:00:40.290> way<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.370> it

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
this I find this the best way to do it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.190 
this I find this the best way to do it
because<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.790> like<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> pencil<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:42.899> leaves

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
because it's like a pencil but it leaves

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
because it's like a pencil but it leaves
a<00:00:43.410> beautiful<00:00:43.890> rich<00:00:44.160> black<00:00:44.640> line<00:00:45.000> which<00:00:45.719> bodes

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a beautiful rich black line which bodes

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.069 
a beautiful rich black line which bodes
very<00:00:46.230> well<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.980> white<00:00:47.309> canvas<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:48.629> let's<00:00:48.930> get

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
on like this and what I really want is

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.490 
on like this and what I really want is
the<00:01:57.830> unification<00:01:58.400> for<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.090> wave<00:01:59.270> here<00:01:59.690> that's

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
the unification for the wave here that's

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.290 
the unification for the wave here that's
the<00:02:00.710> important<00:02:01.220> part<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:02.710> pop<00:02:03.710> this<00:02:03.920> on<00:02:04.300> fairly

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
the important part so pop this on fairly

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:13.720 
the important part so pop this on fairly
thickly<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:11.390> you'll<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:12.430> when<00:02:13.430> you<00:02:13.550> actually

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
thickly and you'll see when you actually

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.280 
thickly and you'll see when you actually
try<00:02:14.210> this<00:02:16.150> you'll<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:17.780> like

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
try this you'll see that it's like

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.199 
try this you'll see that it's like
putting<00:02:18.680> plaster<00:02:19.160> of<00:02:19.250> Paris<00:02:19.580> on<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:19.940> very

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 
putting plaster of Paris on it's very

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:27.460 
putting plaster of Paris on it's very
thick<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:23.420> self-support<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:27.260> key

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
thick and it's self-support so the key

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.370 
thick and it's self-support so the key
here<00:02:27.770> is<00:02:27.800> generally<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.640> try<00:02:28.910> and<00:02:29.140> get<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.260> on

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
here is generally to try and get it on

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.720 
here is generally to try and get it on
relatively<00:02:31.010> quickly

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
relatively quickly

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.880
