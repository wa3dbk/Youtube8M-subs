and<00:01:23.000> manuals<00:01:27.170> now<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.229> n97<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> little

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
and manuals now the n97 is a little

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.630 
and manuals now the n97 is a little
large<00:01:31.049> compared<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.920> most<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.430> its

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
large compared to most of its

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.940 
large compared to most of its
competitors<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.840> let's<00:01:34.439> compare<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:36.799> here<00:01:37.799> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
competitors so let's compare it here it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.710 
competitors so let's compare it here it
is<00:01:38.070> next<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.960> iphone<00:01:39.960> 3g<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:42.060> about

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
is next to the iphone 3g it's a about

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.710 
is next to the iphone 3g it's a about
the<00:01:42.930> same<00:01:43.170> height<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:44.250> thicker<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.420> it's

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
the same height it's thicker but it's

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.680 
the same height it's thicker but it's
not<00:01:45.960> quite<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> wide

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.730 

it's<00:01:51.690> similar<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:53.120> 5800<00:01:54.260> just<00:01:55.260> a<00:01:55.350> tiny<00:01:55.590> bit

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
it's similar to the 5800 just a tiny bit

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.990 
it's similar to the 5800 just a tiny bit
taller<00:01:56.630> about<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> same<00:01:58.020> width<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:59.810> actually

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
taller about the same width and actually

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.150 
taller about the same width and actually
it's<00:02:03.000> only<00:02:03.270> slightly<00:02:03.570> thicker<00:02:06.320> now<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.740> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
it's only slightly thicker now if you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.130 
it's only slightly thicker now if you
haven't<00:02:08.399> n95<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.540> n95<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.380> thicker<00:02:12.140> shorter

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
haven't n95 the n95 is thicker shorter

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:22.940 
haven't n95 the n95 is thicker shorter
and<00:02:14.810> it's<00:02:17.570> about<00:02:18.570> the<00:02:18.720> same<00:02:18.930> width<00:02:21.560> use<00:02:22.560> mu<00:02:22.740> 1

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
and it's about the same width use mu 1

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.150 
and it's about the same width use mu 1
is<00:02:23.130> thinner<00:02:23.430> wider<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:24.830> about<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.980> same

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
is thinner wider and about the same

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:33.740 
is thinner wider and about the same
length<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:30.510> n85<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.970> just<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.090> tiny<00:02:33.450> bit

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
length the n85 is just a tiny bit

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.720 
length the n85 is just a tiny bit
thinner<00:02:35.690> shorter<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:37.880> not<00:02:38.880> quite<00:02:39.240> as<00:02:39.420> wide

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
thinner shorter and not quite as wide

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.350 
thinner shorter and not quite as wide
and<00:02:43.100> compared<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.190> the<00:02:44.280> storm<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.880> storm<00:02:45.120> is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
and compared to the storm the storm is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.430 
and compared to the storm the storm is
wider<00:02:46.550> more<00:02:47.550> it'll<00:02:47.880> just<00:02:48.090> tiny<00:02:48.450> bit<00:02:48.780> shorter

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
wider more it'll just tiny bit shorter

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.800 
wider more it'll just tiny bit shorter
and<00:02:49.650> narrower<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:52.130> actually<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:54.800> n97

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
and narrower so actually the the n97

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:04.940 
and narrower so actually the the n97
shape<00:02:58.100> makes<00:02:59.100> it<00:02:59.250> pretty<00:02:59.430> easy<00:02:59.550> to<00:02:59.940> hold<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
shape makes it pretty easy to hold the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.910 
shape makes it pretty easy to hold the
keyboard<00:03:06.709> if<00:03:07.709> you<00:03:07.860> can<00:03:08.660> make<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.690> out<00:03:09.989> here<00:03:10.019> my

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
keyboard if you can make it out here my

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.090 
keyboard if you can make it out here my
only<00:03:11.100> complaint<00:03:11.370> with<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.090> is<00:03:12.320> that<00:03:13.320> they<00:03:13.620> will

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
only complaint with it is that they will

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.030 
only complaint with it is that they will
have<00:03:14.250> two<00:03:14.430> complaints<00:03:14.940> really<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:16.040> spacebar

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
have two complaints really the spacebar

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.080 
have two complaints really the spacebar
is<00:03:17.430> off<00:03:17.820> to<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:20.940> that

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
is off to the right so you know that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.640 
is off to the right so you know that
takes<00:03:21.299> some<00:03:21.450> getting<00:03:21.630> used<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.019> and<00:03:22.230> also<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
takes some getting used to and also the
