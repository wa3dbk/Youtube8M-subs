00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.740 
toy and began the mutilated by using
modeling<00:04:29.350> clay<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.890> had<00:04:30.669> a<00:04:30.700> huge<00:04:31.060> smile<00:04:31.419> on<00:04:31.450> his

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
modeling clay it had a huge smile on his

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.420 
modeling clay it had a huge smile on his
face<00:04:31.780> so<00:04:32.140> I<00:04:32.169> used<00:04:32.410> similar<00:04:32.740> color<00:04:32.980> clay<00:04:33.370> to

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
face so I used similar color clay to

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.760 
face so I used similar color clay to
cover<00:04:33.820> up<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.210> smile<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:34.840> then<00:04:35.260> draw<00:04:35.440> a<00:04:35.470> mouth

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
cover up the smile and then draw a mouth

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.800 
cover up the smile and then draw a mouth
expression<00:04:36.430> with<00:04:36.610> magic<00:04:36.940> marker<00:04:37.270> over<00:04:37.510> top<00:04:37.780> of

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
expression with magic marker over top of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.860 
expression with magic marker over top of
it<00:04:38.220> then<00:04:39.220> I<00:04:39.250> animated<00:04:39.820> several<00:04:40.300> frames<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
it then I animated several frames of the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.920 
it then I animated several frames of the
turtle<00:04:41.230> moving<00:04:41.710> using<00:04:42.550> an<00:04:42.760> SOR<00:04:43.240> camera<00:04:43.750> with

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
turtle moving using an SOR camera with

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.790 
turtle moving using an SOR camera with
the<00:04:44.080> turtle<00:04:44.470> against<00:04:44.919> a<00:04:45.010> blue<00:04:45.250> backdrop<00:04:45.640> I

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
the turtle against a blue backdrop I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.470 
the turtle against a blue backdrop I
then<00:04:47.800> went<00:04:47.980> into<00:04:48.160> each<00:04:48.400> frame<00:04:48.790> and<00:04:49.000> remove<00:04:49.120> the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
then went into each frame and remove the

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.930 
then went into each frame and remove the
blue<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:50.020> just<00:04:50.530> put<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.800> frames<00:04:51.070> in<00:04:51.250> order<00:04:51.669> in

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
blue and just put the frames in order in

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.970 
blue and just put the frames in order in
the<00:04:52.120> video<00:04:52.419> looping<00:04:53.110> many<00:04:53.290> segments<00:04:53.860> to

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
the video looping many segments to

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.030 
the video looping many segments to
adjust<00:04:54.370> movement<00:04:54.880> speed<00:04:55.240> etc<00:04:55.680> then<00:04:56.680> put<00:04:56.919> the

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
adjust movement speed etc then put the

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.219 
adjust movement speed etc then put the
turtle<00:04:57.370> into<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.760> frame<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.270> then<00:04:58.840> taking

00:04:59.219 --> 00:04:59.229 
turtle into the frame and then taking

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.810 
turtle into the frame and then taking
elements<00:04:59.560> of<00:04:59.800> the<00:04:59.919> frame<00:05:00.130> to<00:05:00.160> make<00:05:00.490> sure<00:05:00.700> it

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
elements of the frame to make sure it

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.730 
elements of the frame to make sure it
overlap<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.479> turtle<00:05:01.810> as<00:05:01.960> well<00:05:02.380> as<00:05:02.530> making

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
overlap the turtle as well as making

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.680 
overlap the turtle as well as making
sure<00:05:02.890> that<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.400> turtle<00:05:03.669> cast<00:05:03.910> some<00:05:04.210> kind<00:05:04.240> of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
sure that the turtle cast some kind of

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.440 
sure that the turtle cast some kind of
shadow<00:05:05.050> it<00:05:05.380> was<00:05:06.310> pretty<00:05:06.550> simple<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.000> do<00:05:07.180> all<00:05:07.419> of

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450 
shadow it was pretty simple to do all of

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.490 
shadow it was pretty simple to do all of
it<00:05:07.660> just<00:05:07.720> time<00:05:08.410> consuming<00:05:08.650> and<00:05:09.190> tedious<00:05:10.500> so

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
it just time consuming and tedious so

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.200 
it just time consuming and tedious so
that's<00:05:11.710> about<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.040> for<00:05:12.220> now<00:05:12.430> we'll<00:05:12.820> have<00:05:12.970> al

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
that's about it for now we'll have al

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.030
