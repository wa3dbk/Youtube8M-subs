running any firmware ceruse moss is

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.240 
running any firmware ceruse moss is
basically<00:00:09.450> install<00:00:10.019> yes<00:00:10.290> or<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:10.679> solidus<00:00:10.950> five

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
basically install yes or in solidus five

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.400 
basically install yes or in solidus five
or<00:00:11.580> any<00:00:11.700> install<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.240> if<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.960> already<00:00:13.290> have

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
or any install this if you already have

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.400 
or any install this if you already have
a<00:00:13.440> jailbreak<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.269> Zeus<00:00:15.269> Moss<00:00:15.480> works<00:00:15.750> without

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
a jailbreak and Zeus Moss works without

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.029 
a jailbreak and Zeus Moss works without
or<00:00:16.710> with<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> jailbreak<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.180> basically<00:00:18.779> it's

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:19.039 
or with a jailbreak so basically it's

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.099 
or with a jailbreak so basically it's
$14.99<00:00:20.039> if<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.760> not<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.180> profiles<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
$14.99 if you do not have profiles and

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.050 
$14.99 if you do not have profiles and
certificates<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.949> it's<00:00:23.070> 49<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.609> if<00:00:23.789> you<00:00:23.910> ready

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
certificates and it's 49 I if you ready

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.050 
certificates and it's 49 I if you ready
had<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.480> so<00:00:25.350> basically<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:25.949> does<00:00:25.980> is<00:00:26.430> if

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
had that so basically what it does is if

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.609 
had that so basically what it does is if
you<00:00:27.599> don't<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:27.900> when<00:00:28.019> install<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
you don't know when install this is

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.070 
you don't know when install this is
basically<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.220> strips<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> most<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
basically it strips to the most of the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709 
basically it strips to the most of the
iOS<00:00:31.679> applications<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:32.969> strips<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
iOS applications from strips to

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.360 
iOS applications from strips to
protections<00:00:34.230> from<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.219> where<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
protections from it and it's where you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.940 
protections from it and it's where you
can<00:00:35.460> download<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.120> IPA<00:00:36.450> files<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.230> that's

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
can download the IPA files and that's

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.610 
can download the IPA files and that's
for<00:00:38.129> only<00:00:38.489> jailbroken<00:00:39.149> devices<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.379> know

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
for only jailbroken devices so you know

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.590 
for only jailbroken devices so you know
right<00:00:40.800> now<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.070> iOS<00:00:41.219> 6<00:00:41.700> jailbreak<00:00:42.210> probably

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
right now in iOS 6 jailbreak probably

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.639 
right now in iOS 6 jailbreak probably
not<00:00:42.719> gonna<00:00:42.870> come<00:00:42.989> out<00:00:43.020> for<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> couple<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
not gonna come out for a couple of

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.010 
not gonna come out for a couple of
months<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.430> December<00:00:44.820> I'm<00:00:45.539> guessing

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
months are in December I'm guessing

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.569 
months are in December I'm guessing
someone<00:00:46.230> be<00:00:46.350> two<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.620> three<00:00:46.800> months<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
someone be two or three months but it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.580 
someone be two or three months but it
will<00:00:47.789> come<00:00:48.030> out<00:00:48.059> sometime<00:00:48.570> but<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.110> is<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
will come out sometime but this is the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.470 
will come out sometime but this is the
best<00:00:49.800> alternative<00:00:50.010> I've<00:00:50.610> seen<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.270> most

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
best alternative I've seen for the most

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.020 
best alternative I've seen for the most
