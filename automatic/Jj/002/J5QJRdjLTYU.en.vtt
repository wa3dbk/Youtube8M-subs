00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.050
 in these moments we are going to see what is 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.629
 checking the monitoring system 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:11.379
 the monitoring system is the system 

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:13.930
 that regulates everything that is the systems 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:16.750
 of the machine both abnormal human as 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.140
 abnormal at this time let's give it 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.849
 with this check to our magna 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.789
 we have the action light 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:27.759
 the panel of meters and we see the system 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:29.499
 of message she delays because she is now 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.869
 same seeing all the systems of the 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.440
 machine in these moments as we can 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.030
 see the water separator is full thing 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.610
 which means that we are going to have 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.910
 to change what is the separator 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.850
 water and fill it we can also use 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.680
 what is the keyboard system in the 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.890
 keyboard system we can find 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.950
 that here we put half we can but 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.710
 also how can you see the information 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.740
 of filter and oil change when 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.020
 we are in this option we give ok and 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.089
 as you will see here we see filter 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.249
 motor oil we see the works 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.130
 service worked and how much you 

00:01:06.249 --> 00:01:09.289
 I should 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.570
 if we wanted to get out of there 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:14.000
 we just have to play the X and in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.560
 these moments by the tee we left the 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.380
 machine keeps telling us that the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.020
 water separator is wrong already when 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.240
 everything arrives is fine then we are going to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.880
 give it on have to always notice 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.610
 that your digits of revolutions by 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.750
 minute is in 1 and the travis the 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.990
 unique to this position 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.909
 when we give booted 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.979
 let's wait a few seconds for 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.979
 the machine can keep pace with 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.259
 work and that all the oils and 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.930
 components in the engine are lubricated 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:51.700
 and successively we are going to start raising 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.700
 to 2 to 3 4 5 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 910 at the moment your machine is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.570
 finds two thousand revolutions but 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 because we are not moving 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.549
 the finished joy of ours to that one that 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.630
 find in this location has 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.670
 lowered the revolutions per minute to 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.640
 1350 of us also want to get 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.090
 a minor revolution then we would touch 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.900
 up here on the joystick and the first and 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.060
 masters and will go down to 950 revolutions of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.850
 want to go back to 2,000 again 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.459
 revolutions simply by activating it to 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:32.850
 work little ball and do not do a little 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.890
 movement of the machine will raise the 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.810
 revolutions to 2000 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.150
 all this we can achieve through 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.519
 of the monitoring system that is the 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.170
 electronic system that controls 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.170
 all the systems of this machine
