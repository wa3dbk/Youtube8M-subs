of people are using this for bit miners
actually<00:00:29.929> Bitcoin<00:00:30.929> miners<00:00:32.390> I'm<00:00:33.390> running<00:00:34.050> at

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
actually Bitcoin miners I'm running at

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.160 
actually Bitcoin miners I'm running at
miner<00:00:34.559> s<00:00:34.829> ones<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:36.090> use<00:00:36.510> one<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> these

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
miner s ones and I use one of these

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.670 
miner s ones and I use one of these
power<00:00:37.380> supplies<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:38.190> power<00:00:38.430> two<00:00:38.910> of<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:40.170> ad

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.229 
power supplies to power two of my ad
miners<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:42.110> they're<00:00:43.110> both<00:00:43.290> making<00:00:43.500> about

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
miners and they're both making about

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.760 
miners and they're both making about
roughly<00:00:45.239> twenty<00:00:45.629> twenty-five<00:00:46.320> dollars<00:00:46.559> a<00:00:46.649> day

roughly twenty twenty-five dollars a day
in<00:00:46.980> bitcoins<00:00:47.700> so<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.960> did<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:50.059> see

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
in bitcoins so this is how I did it see

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.549 
in bitcoins so this is how I did it see

four<00:01:18.450> five<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:19.619> what<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.770> did<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.159> connected

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
four five what what I did is I connected

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.230 
four five what what I did is I connected
a<00:01:21.420> 1<00:01:22.100> 2<00:01:23.100> B<00:01:23.340> 1<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> wire

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
a 1 2 B 1 and then you see this wire

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.510 
a 1 2 B 1 and then you see this wire
that<00:01:27.240> actually<00:01:27.780> connects<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.790> b6<00:01:30.170> okay<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
that actually connects to b6 okay and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.200 
that actually connects to b6 okay and
then<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:33.290> that<00:01:34.290> jumper<00:01:34.650> above<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.210> that's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
then the that jumper above it that's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.760 
then the that jumper above it that's
connected<00:01:36.780> from<00:01:37.939> b2<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:40.170> b3

I'm sorry b2 2 C 2 and this will power
the<00:01:45.890> power<00:01:46.890> supply<00:01:47.250> when<00:01:47.460> you<00:01:47.549> plug<00:01:47.729> it<00:01:47.850> in<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the power supply when you plug it in and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.350 
the power supply when you plug it in and
these<00:01:49.110> big<00:01:49.409> connectors<00:01:50.130> back<00:01:50.310> here

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
these big connectors back here

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.420 
these big connectors back here
that's<00:01:52.350> your<00:01:52.560> 12-volt<00:01:52.920> DC<00:01:53.540> output<00:01:55.219> it's<00:01:56.219> quite

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
that's your 12-volt DC output it's quite

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.520 
that's your 12-volt DC output it's quite
simple<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.790> do<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.270> just<00:01:57.719> use<00:01:57.840> these<00:01:58.049> jumpers

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
simple to do I just use these jumpers

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.789 
simple to do I just use these jumpers
that<00:01:58.560> came<00:01:58.890> off<00:01:59.130> of<00:01:59.479> some<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.509> my<00:02:00.659> older<00:02:01.200> hard

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
that came off of some of my older hard

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.500 
that came off of some of my older hard
drives<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:03.170> computer<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.500> cards

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
drives and computer of cards

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.940 
drives and computer of cards
and<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.110> can<00:02:07.230> just<00:02:07.850> pop<00:02:08.850> them<00:02:09.000> over<00:02:09.360> these

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
and you can just pop them over these

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.760 
and you can just pop them over these
these<00:02:10.950> connectors<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.290> with<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.590> wire

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
these connectors the one with the wire

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
these connectors the one with the wire
is<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.310> trickier<00:02:14.670> because<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.120> have<00:02:15.240> to

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
is a little trickier because you have to

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.800 
is a little trickier because you have to
connect<00:02:15.600> three<00:02:15.870> spots<00:02:16.370> together<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.540> just

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
connect three spots together and I just

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.050 
connect three spots together and I just
ordered<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.230> wire<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.740> to<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> jumpers<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
ordered a wire on to the jumpers and

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.980 
ordered a wire on to the jumpers and
then<00:02:21.590> shrink<00:02:22.590> wrap<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.890> whole<00:02:23.040> thing<00:02:23.990> and

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
then shrink wrap the whole thing and

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.530 
then shrink wrap the whole thing and
there<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.230> have<00:02:25.380> it
