00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.639
 this video we will have another example of 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.580
 how to solve quadratic equations that 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.510
 present complex roots in their 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.300
 result 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:21.190
 for this we must support ourselves from our 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.210
 quadratic formula which is found 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.460
 here and from our equation to solve the 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.120
 which should be in normal position and 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:35.980
 we check ax squared plus bx + c 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.980
 equal to 0 if it is in position 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.890
 normal so now I proceed to identify 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.440
 the values of the variables 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 to that would be the first variable is equal 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.980
 a 1 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.900
 would be equal to the term that accompanies the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.690
 variable in this case minus 10 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.590
 and finally there is the term 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.720
 independent in this case with value of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.730
 3. 4 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.370
 is equal to 34 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.550
 now as a next step I proceed to 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.800
 solve the discriminant the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.030
 discriminant is the radical of the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.320
 quadratic formula 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.409
 placed then square root must the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.920
 square in this case of vale 10 would be 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:35.210
 then minus 10 squared 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.450
 - 4 x in this case a vale 1 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.450
 because it has the value of 34 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.330
 I resolve the parentheses the operation 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.430
 indicated 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:56.470
 - 10 squared would be 100 positive 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:00.090
 less and more is less and more minus 4 times 1 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.280
 they are 4 by 34 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.280
 it would be 136 100 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
 136 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:17.070
 I solve 100 236 contrary signs are 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.400
 subtract 136 minus 100 is 36 less than the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.060
 sign of the greater that is 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.860
 negative minus 36 what fraction or in a 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:33.610
 positive root and at the root of minus 1 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:37.240
 to replace it with its value as 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.370
 imaginary number which would be root 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.000
 square of 36 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.880
 6 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.480
 and since the imaginary number of the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.819
 unit is square root of minus 1 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:58.359
 replaced 6 and 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.489
 since this is my result 6 and it is the 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:03.760
 value of the discriminant that I find 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:09.569
 that replaced everything within my formula 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.569
 quadratic therefore says x equal 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:18.560
 - see - the value of b whose axes minus 10 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.310
 minus 10 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.990
 more minus the discriminant that I have 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:30.700
 here is 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:33.569
 6 and all this divided by 2 per a 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.569
 and talk to him 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.700
 we suffer the parentheses by effecting the 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.640
 Less operation and less is more 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.160
 10 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:50.360
 more or less 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:52.940
 6 y / 2 x 1 that would be 2 as can 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.000
 observe all the numbers have half 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.890
 so I can extract it half of 10 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.660
 half of 6 and half of 2 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:11.190
 this is the same as saying 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:14.550
 5 plus or minus half of 63 y / 1 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:18.000
 as any number / 1 is equal to 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.380
 same number I have then that x is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
 equal to 5 + less 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.500
 3 and the least indicates to me that each one 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.390
 of the values â€‹â€‹is worked separately 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:35.110
 so I can say that x1 equals 5 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:35.110
 + 3 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.990
 and x2 equals 5 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.420
 - 3 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.980
 finally I can say that the whole 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:56.290
 solution would be five minus three 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:56.290
 you take 5 + 3 and this is my result
