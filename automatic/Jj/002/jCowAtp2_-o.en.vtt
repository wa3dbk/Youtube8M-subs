collected a bunch of shells and I put
them<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.680> my<00:02:07.710> desk<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:09.360> kept<00:02:09.690> on<00:02:09.780> looking<00:02:09.959> at

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
them on my desk and I kept on looking at

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.260 
them on my desk and I kept on looking at
them<00:02:10.470> they're<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:11.100> incredible<00:02:11.970> tone

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
them they're like this incredible tone

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.140 
them they're like this incredible tone
of<00:02:12.480> like<00:02:12.720> corals<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.650> sand<00:02:14.190> colors<00:02:14.730> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
of like corals and sand colors and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.630 
of like corals and sand colors and
mother-of-pearl<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:17.010> decided<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.430> was

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
mother-of-pearl and I decided that was

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.530 
mother-of-pearl and I decided that was
going<00:02:17.790> to<00:02:17.819> be<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.000> inspiration<00:02:18.209> because

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
going to be the inspiration because

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.000 
going to be the inspiration because
every<00:02:18.750> time<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.930> looked<00:02:19.200> at<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.560> remembered

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
every time I looked at it I remembered

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.270 
every time I looked at it I remembered
the<00:02:20.450> sunlight<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.660> hit<00:02:21.810> my<00:02:21.930> face<00:02:22.260> like<00:02:22.950> being

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the sunlight that hit my face like being

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.580 
the sunlight that hit my face like being
there<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:23.850> being<00:02:23.940> like<00:02:24.300> with<00:02:24.510> my<00:02:24.900> loved<00:02:25.290> ones

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
there and being like with my loved ones

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.860 
there and being like with my loved ones
and<00:02:26.010> I<00:02:26.340> thought<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.120> collection<00:02:27.750> is

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
and I thought that this collection is

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.900 
and I thought that this collection is
going<00:02:28.080> to<00:02:28.140> be<00:02:28.290> about<00:02:28.680> giving<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.220> feeling<00:02:29.790> to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
going to be about giving that feeling to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:37.530 
going to be about giving that feeling to
every<00:02:30.180> bride<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.630> wears<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.050> dress

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.670

this signature for Rivini is there's
always<00:03:59.489> architecture<00:04:00.180> in<00:04:00.330> is<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.780> it's<00:04:00.959> a<00:04:01.170> play

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
always architecture in is so it's a play

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.360 
always architecture in is so it's a play
of<00:04:01.560> architecture<00:04:02.280> playing<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.360> layers<00:04:04.019> and<00:04:04.620> as

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
of architecture playing of layers and as

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.360 
of architecture playing of layers and as
far<00:04:05.640> as<00:04:05.790> detail<00:04:06.269> there's<00:04:06.870> minimal<00:04:07.560> detail<00:04:08.129> but
