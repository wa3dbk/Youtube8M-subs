enough<00:01:59.610> for<00:01:59.850> Hamlin<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.869> get<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.799> keep<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:03.649> if

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:01.200 
for a guy who le or in the week told me
you<00:04:59.620> were<00:04:59.710> about<00:04:59.889> a<00:04:59.919> C<00:05:00.190> on<00:05:00.430> restarts<00:05:01.000> you<00:05:01.090> did

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
you were about a C on restarts you did

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.850 
you were about a C on restarts you did
pretty<00:05:01.330> good<00:05:01.449> but<00:05:02.110> what<00:05:02.319> was<00:05:02.440> your<00:05:02.590> mindset

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
pretty good but what was your mindset

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.200 
pretty good but what was your mindset
when<00:05:03.069> that<00:05:03.190> green<00:05:03.370> white<00:05:03.550> checker<00:05:03.789> came<00:05:04.060> out

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
when that green white checker came out

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.420 
when that green white checker came out
and<00:05:04.360> you<00:05:04.389> were<00:05:04.569> almost<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.590> white<00:05:05.740> flag<00:05:05.770> I

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
and you were almost to the white flag I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.219 
and you were almost to the white flag I
asked<00:05:06.759> Mike<00:05:07.000> you<00:05:07.270> know<00:05:07.389> the<00:05:07.509> best<00:05:07.659> part<00:05:07.900> is<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:08.229 
asked Mike you know the best part is I

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:09.240 
asked Mike you know the best part is I
probably<00:05:08.470> could<00:05:08.650> have<00:05:08.710> got<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:08.949> that<00:05:09.099> white

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
probably could have got to that white

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.339 
probably could have got to that white
flag<00:05:09.520> in<00:05:09.729> time<00:05:09.940> but<00:05:10.150> it<00:05:10.720> started<00:05:10.990> backing<00:05:11.139> off

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
flag in time but it started backing off

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:14.010 
flag in time but it started backing off
just<00:05:11.620> in<00:05:11.740> case<00:05:11.919> we<00:05:12.520> needed<00:05:12.729> fuel<00:05:13.449> mileage<00:05:13.659> and

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
just in case we needed fuel mileage and

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.839 
just in case we needed fuel mileage and
he<00:05:14.139> said<00:05:14.319> no<00:05:14.500> get<00:05:14.770> that<00:05:14.800> white<00:05:15.130> as<00:05:15.340> soon<00:05:15.580> as<00:05:15.729> you

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
he said no get that white as soon as you

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:18.779 
he said no get that white as soon as you
can<00:05:16.060> and<00:05:16.090> I<00:05:16.509> literally<00:05:17.380> just<00:05:17.770> kept<00:05:18.370> focusing

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
can and I literally just kept focusing

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.070 
can and I literally just kept focusing
on<00:05:18.909> that<00:05:19.060> light<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.389> I<00:05:19.449> saw<00:05:19.630> torn<00:05:19.900> yellow

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.409
