00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.280
 The dog does woof, the cat does meow 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.960
 The bird tweets and the mouse does squeek 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.960
 The cow is moo, the frog croaks 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.520
 and the elephant does toot 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.440
 The ducks do quack and the fish makes blub 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.840
 and the seal does ow ow ow 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.840
 But there is a sound that nobody knows 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.640
 How does the fox do it? 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.720
 Ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.640
 Gering-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding! 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.160
 How does the fox do it? 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.920
 Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow! 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.760
 How does the fox do it? 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.400
 Hatee-hatee-hatee-ho! 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.080
 How does the fox do it? 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.280
 Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff! 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.960
 Tchoff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff! 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.240
 Joff-tchoff-tchoffo-tchoffo-tchoff! 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.440
 How does the fox do it? 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.160
 Big blue eyes, pointed nose 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 Hunt mice and dig holes 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.960
 Small legs up the hill 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.360
 Suddenly he stands up 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.560
 Your hair is red, so wonderful 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.920
 Like a disguised angel 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.000
 But if you meet a friendly horse 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:46.720
 Will you communicate through mo-ooo-orse? 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.440
 How will you talk to that cava-aaa-llo? 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.640
 How does the fox do it? 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.640
 Jacha-chacha-chacha-chow! 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.320
 Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow! 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.720
 Chacha-chacha-chacha-chow! 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.160
 How does the fox do it? 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.920
 Fraka-kaka-kaka-kaka-Kow! 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.600
 How does the fox do it? 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.400
 A-hee-ahee ha-hee! 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.120
 How does the fox do it? 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.760
 A-oo-oo-oo-ooo! 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.040
 Woo-oo-oo-ooo! 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.920
 How does the fox do it? 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.200
 The secret of the fox 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.920
 Ancient mystery 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.440
 Somewhere in the deep woods 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.440
 I know you're hiding it 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.160
 What is your verse? 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.680
 Will we ever know? 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.720
 It will always be a mystery 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.720
 What are you saying? 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.880
 You are my guardian angel 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.640
 Hidden in the woods 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.600
 What is your verse? 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880
 Will we ever know? 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:27.600
 I want to know!
