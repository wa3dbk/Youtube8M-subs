What's up everybody, this is Raymond from
Crayola Keds. I'm here with Expert Village.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:12.660
Today we're going to talk about details. What
I'm going to do now is apply another leopard

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:29.970
pattern, just smaller instead of the big ones
you see here. It gives it a more realistic

00:00:29.970 --> 00:01:20.649
look. Also you've got to be careful you don't
want that to happen. So writing again, no

00:01:20.649 --> 00:02:13.750
paint smudged around. Using the same brush,
just apply a little lighter, just touching

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:52.220
the sneakers. I'm going do here just a line
going down. Sometimes you can just do waves,

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.220
it's up to you. You can do a "v" if you want.
So you can see we've made a little line. Some

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.129
people may want to go with the waves or sideways
it's up to you. I'm now going to do the same

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:00.180
thing right on the side over here. Do the
same thing to the other side. There's your

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.259
leopard pattern.
