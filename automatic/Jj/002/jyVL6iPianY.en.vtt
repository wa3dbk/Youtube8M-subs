 okay okay that's okay 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.299
 by the way guys would have been introduced at all 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:40.730
 mainplex and such a thing that ever 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:43.200
 eat from the game gives you some kind of bank 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.570
 peculiar such a ban is permissible in 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.200
 KSK then poured over the ridge there is clear time 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.049
 and such ban and we also have Nagumo wait 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.660
 . no there if you lived with the game there 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.829
 something 300 seconds or something give five minutes 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.239
 in short gives you 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.220
 the fact that you can not give and not on one 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.170
 the game you follow on the server well, either you 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.420
 you leave the servers for five minutes and as if 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.030

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.130
 Basically, in principle, I'll tell you 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.449
 story I once on this game this 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:39.550

 hard going I started to play well in 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.750
 principle, you can pull us here four 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.120
 the two of them will continue to be fine I 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.919
 pulled out yes whom I wrote down in my 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.590
 even i was recording i wouldn't exactly say but 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.539
 I think I recorded this video and 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.819
 pulled out so it was ok yes 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.599
 Of course I spent notable know but under 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:07.419

 they are from another team of two people 

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.539
 throwing in red would be too 

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.080
