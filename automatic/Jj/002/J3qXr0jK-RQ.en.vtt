00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
ziplock bags in his water this is about

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.210 
ziplock bags in his water this is about
maybe<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.240> would<00:04:34.660> say<00:04:34.780> 10<00:04:34.990> cups<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.380> water<00:04:35.560> or<00:04:35.800> as

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
maybe I would say 10 cups of water or as

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.159 
maybe I would say 10 cups of water or as
much<00:04:36.400> as<00:04:36.460> you<00:04:36.610> can<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.180> big<00:04:37.389> pan<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.080> the

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.169 
much as you can in a big pan but the

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.810 
much as you can in a big pan but the
biggest<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.770> bigger<00:04:38.949> better<00:04:39.310> so<00:04:39.550> you<00:04:39.639> have

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
biggest the bigger better so you have

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.480 
biggest the bigger better so you have
more<00:04:40.150> space<00:04:40.479> to<00:04:40.780> boil<00:04:41.500> it<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:41.919> it's<00:04:42.250> in<00:04:42.400> the

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
more space to boil it and it's in the

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.820 
more space to boil it and it's in the
scheme<00:04:42.880> it's<00:04:43.270> inside<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> good<00:04:44.139> lock<00:04:44.350> just<00:04:44.650> like

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
scheme it's inside a good lock just like

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.879 
scheme it's inside a good lock just like
that<00:04:45.180> and<00:04:46.180> what<00:04:46.930> this<00:04:47.110> is<00:04:47.169> going<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.560> do<00:04:47.740> is

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
that and what this is going to do is

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.820 
that and what this is going to do is
just<00:04:48.520> name<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:48.910> okay<00:04:49.660> some<00:04:50.289> people<00:04:50.530> put<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.770> in

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
just name it okay some people put it in

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.180 
just name it okay some people put it in
the<00:04:50.919> oven<00:04:52.169> but<00:04:53.169> I<00:04:53.199> don't<00:04:53.560> recommend<00:04:53.680> that

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
the oven but I don't recommend that

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.969 
the oven but I don't recommend that
because<00:04:54.550> it<00:04:55.150> gets<00:04:55.360> too<00:04:55.720> dry<00:04:56.050> so<00:04:57.039> I<00:04:57.940> have<00:04:58.570> to

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
because it gets too dry so I have to

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:00.930 
because it gets too dry so I have to
just<00:04:59.979> make<00:05:00.190> sure<00:05:00.310> that<00:05:00.340> it's<00:05:00.550> not<00:05:00.639> too<00:05:00.820> much

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
just make sure that it's not too much

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.850 
just make sure that it's not too much
air<00:05:01.270> inside<00:05:01.780> just<00:05:02.050> be<00:05:02.169> careful<00:05:02.530> I'm<00:05:02.590> doing

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
air inside just be careful I'm doing

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.320 
air inside just be careful I'm doing
this<00:05:02.979> but<00:05:03.160> I'm<00:05:03.280> not<00:05:03.430> supposed<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.789> be<00:05:03.880> doing<00:05:04.150> it

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
this but I'm not supposed to be doing it

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.879 
this but I'm not supposed to be doing it
once<00:05:04.750> it's<00:05:04.990> in<00:05:05.169> there<00:05:05.199> you<00:05:05.440> just<00:05:05.560> have<00:05:05.680> to

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
once it's in there you just have to

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.770 
once it's in there you just have to
leave<00:05:06.010> it<00:05:06.070> you<00:05:06.940> don't<00:05:07.060> wanna<00:05:07.180> burn<00:05:07.360> yourself

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
leave it you don't wanna burn yourself

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.620 
leave it you don't wanna burn yourself
so<00:05:08.110> you<00:05:08.919> just<00:05:09.070> have<00:05:09.250> to<00:05:09.370> make<00:05:09.520> sure<00:05:09.580> it's<00:05:10.479> not

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
so you just have to make sure it's not

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.740 
so you just have to make sure it's not
too<00:05:10.810> much<00:05:10.930> air<00:05:11.199> inside<00:05:11.650> the<00:05:11.710> ziplock<00:05:12.190> and<00:05:12.750> I'm

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
too much air inside the ziplock and I'm

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.870 
too much air inside the ziplock and I'm
going<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.930> cover<00:05:14.139> it<00:05:14.410> leave<00:05:15.190> it<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.520> could<00:05:15.699> do

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
going to cover it leave it you could do

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.100 
going to cover it leave it you could do
it<00:05:15.970> on<00:05:16.060> medium<00:05:16.270> heat<00:05:18.570> it's<00:05:19.570> like<00:05:19.750> that<00:05:19.960> you

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
it on medium heat it's like that you

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.750 
it on medium heat it's like that you
cover<00:05:20.349> it<00:05:20.440> up<00:05:20.620> have<00:05:20.830> to<00:05:21.010> remove<00:05:21.280> it<00:05:21.430> in<00:05:21.610> the

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
cover it up have to remove it in the

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.110 
cover it up have to remove it in the
 out<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.750> foil<00:05:23.139> paper<00:05:23.880> because<00:05:24.880> it's

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
 out of the foil paper because it's

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.999 
 out of the foil paper because it's
been<00:05:25.270> in<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.539> water<00:05:25.750> boiling<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.289> an<00:05:26.590> hour<00:05:26.770> to

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:29.289 
a minute to be of it is you just put it

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:30.900 
a minute to be of it is you just put it
there<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:29.620> you<00:05:29.710> leave<00:05:29.919> it<00:05:29.949> alone<00:05:30.160> don't<00:05:30.639> touch

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
there and you leave it alone don't touch

there and you leave it alone don't touch
it<00:05:31.150> and<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:32.050> way<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.289> know<00:05:32.560> if<00:05:32.889> it's<00:05:33.250> done<00:05:33.699> in

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
it and the way to know if it's done in

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.779 
it and the way to know if it's done in
case<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.389> use<00:05:34.780> different<00:05:35.440> measurements<00:05:36.070> you

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
case you use different measurements you

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:39.480 
case you use different measurements you
feel<00:05:37.210> it<00:05:37.389> and<00:05:37.570> it<00:05:38.050> has<00:05:38.229> to<00:05:38.260> be<00:05:38.590> tender<00:05:39.130> but<00:05:39.340> at

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
feel it and it has to be tender but at

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.850 
feel it and it has to be tender but at
the<00:05:39.550> same<00:05:39.760> time<00:05:40.030> hard<00:05:40.960> I<00:05:41.229> think<00:05:41.500> that<00:05:41.680> make

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:41.860 
the same time hard I think that make

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.939 
the same time hard I think that make
