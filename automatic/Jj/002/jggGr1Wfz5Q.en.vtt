00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:09.530 
late 70s got Corvette seats or something
in<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:06.980> now<00:02:07.980> it's<00:02:08.160> an<00:02:08.310> an<00:02:08.880> automatic

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
in it is it now it's an an automatic

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.270 
in it is it now it's an an automatic
with<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.590> floor<00:02:10.860> floor<00:02:11.130> by<00:02:11.340> floor<00:02:11.400> shifter

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
with the floor floor by floor shifter

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.720 
with the floor floor by floor shifter
little<00:02:14.280> farm<00:02:14.520> stuff<00:02:16.070> smells<00:02:17.070> like<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> farm

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
little farm stuff smells like the farm

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.190 
little farm stuff smells like the farm
truck<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:18.990> 89<00:02:19.200> thousand<00:02:20.210> miles<00:02:21.210> well

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
truck so it's 89 thousand miles well

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.930 
truck so it's 89 thousand miles well
that<00:02:22.380> means<00:02:22.500> it's<00:02:22.740> older<00:02:22.950> than<00:02:22.980> 78<00:02:23.640> just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
that means it's older than 78 just

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
that means it's older than 78 just
probably<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.330> 77<00:02:29.090> better<00:02:30.090> shape<00:02:30.390> than<00:02:30.570> my<00:02:30.720> old

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
probably a 77 better shape than my old

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.150 
probably a 77 better shape than my old
Ford<00:02:33.740> pretty<00:02:34.740> bare-bones

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:53.660 

let's<00:02:38.160> take<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.400> look<00:02:38.610> at<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.820> motor<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:53.310> we're

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
let's take a look at the motor and we're

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.380 
let's take a look at the motor and we're
up<00:02:55.400> yeah<00:02:56.400> definitely<00:02:56.880> looks<00:02:57.000> like<00:02:57.120> it's<00:02:57.270> been

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
up yeah definitely looks like it's been

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.770 
up yeah definitely looks like it's been
sitting<00:02:57.540> around<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.959> while

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.360 

well<00:03:03.780> I'd<00:03:03.960> say<00:03:04.200> by<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.470> guns<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> motor

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
well I'd say by the guns and the motor

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.990 
well I'd say by the guns and the motor
it's<00:03:05.640> got<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:07.680> than<00:03:07.800> 500<00:03:08.340> kilometres<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's got more than 500 kilometres it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.310 
it's got more than 500 kilometres it
looks<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.270> it's<00:03:09.420> been<00:03:09.570> used<00:03:09.750> at<00:03:09.930> least<00:03:10.110> one

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.240 

definitely<00:03:44.760> been<00:03:44.880> sitting<00:03:48.650> well<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.890> got<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
check the fuel lines in the gas tank and

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.660 
check the fuel lines in the gas tank and
then<00:03:52.080> we'll<00:03:52.200> throw<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> battery<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:52.950> it<00:03:53.040> and<00:03:55.670> see

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
then we'll throw a battery in it and see
