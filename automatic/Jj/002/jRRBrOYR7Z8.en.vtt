00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.010
 one of the simple knots narrow end 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.420
 tie left wide to the right Kiryu 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.290
 wide tie 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.610
 for a narrow note, so what is left is looking 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.439
 in this case inside 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.560
 I twist the inner seam on the shirt 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:27.830
 here is the wide end of the tie around 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 we cover narrow in the center and immediately 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:37.010
 we pass the wide end of the neck 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:40.250
 a tie here is a little pan semiluk 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.690
 loose knot in order to stretch 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:51.690
 the wide end of the tie a little bit 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:55.730
 straighten the knot how to do it and then 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:01:00.570
 already directly the node itself 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:03.210
 once again just a little bit understand what 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.930
 so the following is all 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.869
 still 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.320
 the narrow end of the tie on your left 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.560
 let's say as my case i am so i 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.240
 throwing 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:19.560
 the wide end of the tie crosswise here 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.409
 so once turned so 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.049
 movement again in this case in 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.170
 the previous one more precisely, I turned right away 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.840
 closed minutes 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.960
 no tie but i can again 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.470
 crank the wide end for the second time 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.390
 tie on the center around guskov and already 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.600
 then throw in the center 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.430
 neck knot I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.190
 straighten it out a little denser 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 because here did two turns 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:02:01.200
 wide end tie and thread it 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:02:01.200
 in the formed took and corrected 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:15.960
 please also want to note that 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.010
 many ask how to length 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.530
 a tie 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.340
 after injury rules tie make 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.290
 neck knot 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.990
 so right to let this one 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.710
 the length of the tie slightly covered the buckle 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.330
 belt as soon as it appears 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.580
 slightly lower than the buckle 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.560
 some of the belts are higher at the subway 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.260
 it turns out that way when in narrow 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.140
 the end of the tie is so inferior for 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.980
 wide for this you should about 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.220
 roughly know your tie tie already 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.390
 wear it on a shirt and for that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.940
 it was not you will have 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:03:00.030
 let's say the narrow end of the tie as you 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.050
 need about this level either on 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.790
 so and then start 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.340
 tie a knot here when you're around 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.850
 made a tie layout on your 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.830
 the neck 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.769
 if let's do it again 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.290
 tie a knot it is clear that you will 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.680
 the wide end of the tie go down low 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.320
 if you say the opposite is wide gold 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.540
 lift up his cheeks like that for you 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:28.370
 his headphones so grandfather deserve it 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.370
