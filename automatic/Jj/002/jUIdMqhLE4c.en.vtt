here's<00:00:04.920> another<00:00:05.130> fairly<00:00:06.000> simple<00:00:06.540> song<00:00:06.810> it's

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
here's another fairly simple song it's

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.910 
here's another fairly simple song it's
called<00:00:07.200> Wild<00:00:08.010> Thing<00:00:08.309> and<00:00:09.530> I<00:00:10.530> believe<00:00:10.800> was

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
called Wild Thing and I believe was

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.810 
called Wild Thing and I believe was
written<00:00:11.130> by<00:00:11.309> a<00:00:11.340> band<00:00:11.880> called<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.269> trogs<00:00:13.820> back

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
written by a band called the trogs back

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.400 
written by a band called the trogs back
in<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.260> 1960s<00:00:16.260> Jimi<00:00:16.949> Hendrix<00:00:17.990> also<00:00:18.990> did<00:00:19.230> this

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
in the 1960s Jimi Hendrix also did this

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320 
in the 1960s Jimi Hendrix also did this
electric<00:00:20.070> guitar<00:00:20.430> so<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:20.850> could<00:00:20.970> do<00:00:21.090> two

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
electric guitar so we could do two

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.970 
electric guitar so we could do two
different<00:00:21.510> versions<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.230> this<00:00:22.439> on<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.800> one

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
different versions in this on do one

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.950 
different versions in this on do one
later<00:00:23.220> on<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> electric<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:24.779> for

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
later on with on the electric but for

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.470 
later on with on the electric but for
now<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.109> acoustic<00:00:26.660> it<00:00:27.660> uses<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.680> chords<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.480> d

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
now the acoustic it uses the chords a d

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.709 
now the acoustic it uses the chords a d
E<00:00:31.040> and<00:00:32.040> G<00:00:33.739> so<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:34.890> using<00:00:35.040> for<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.850> five<00:00:36.120> basic

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
E and G so it's using for the five basic

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.500 
E and G so it's using for the five basic
major<00:00:36.989> chord<00:00:37.440> forms<00:00:37.920> it's<00:00:38.430> in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.820> key<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.239> a
