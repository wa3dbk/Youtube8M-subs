00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.180 
these on opposite side and then next
I'll<00:02:07.270> do<00:02:07.450> my<00:02:07.690> lilac<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.440> with<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:08.979> lilac

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
I'll do my lilac and with your lilac

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.060 
I'll do my lilac and with your lilac
because<00:02:09.820> these<00:02:09.970> have<00:02:10.239> a<00:02:10.450> woody<00:02:10.720> stem<00:02:11.140> you<00:02:12.040> can

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
because these have a woody stem you can

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.030 
because these have a woody stem you can
either<00:02:12.400> take<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> floral<00:02:13.090> knife<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.010> shave<00:02:15.010> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
either take a floral knife and shave it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.490 
either take a floral knife and shave it
down<00:02:15.340> if<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.940> don't<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> slowly<00:02:16.630> most

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
down if you don't have a slowly most

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.020 
down if you don't have a slowly most
likely<00:02:17.950> you'll<00:02:18.130> have<00:02:18.310> a<00:02:18.340> hammer<00:02:18.640> laying

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
likely you'll have a hammer laying

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.570 
likely you'll have a hammer laying
around<00:02:19.180> your<00:02:19.450> house<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.930> what<00:02:20.800> you<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.100> do<00:02:21.280> is

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
around your house and what you can do is

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.650 
around your house and what you can do is
hammer<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.300> stem<00:02:22.600> down<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:24.790> open<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.269> up<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
hammer the stem down to open it up and

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.410 
hammer the stem down to open it up and
then<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.049> will<00:02:26.230> look<00:02:26.350> like<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:27.269> that<00:02:28.269> way

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
then it will look like this that way

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.120 
then it will look like this that way
it'll<00:02:28.630> be<00:02:28.750> able<00:02:29.049> to<00:02:29.200> drink<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.739> water

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
it'll be able to drink the water

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.170 
it'll be able to drink the water
properly<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:33.310> then<00:02:33.459> I'll<00:02:33.549> just<00:02:33.730> start<00:02:34.000> adding

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
properly and then I'll just start adding

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:42.950 
properly and then I'll just start adding
the<00:02:34.450> third<00:02:34.660> two<00:02:35.110> clusters<00:02:35.590> into<00:02:35.860> ravines

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.140 

you<00:02:43.800> know<00:02:43.920> it's<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.310> starting<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.970> look

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
you know it's really starting to look

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.220

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
over their range mate it'll kind of

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:35.410 
over their range mate it'll kind of
focus<00:03:29.500> into<00:03:30.500> one<00:03:30.709> area<00:03:33.579> if<00:03:34.579> you<00:03:34.760> notice<00:03:35.180> I'm

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
doing them at different heights and this

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.430 
doing them at different heights and this
creates<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.670> lot<00:03:37.849> of<00:03:37.879> depth<00:03:38.409> to<00:03:39.409> your

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
arrangement that way things are all that

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.490 
arrangement that way things are all that
like<00:03:43.610> one<00:03:43.849> level<00:03:46.480> so<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.540> can<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.840> three<00:03:48.230> there

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500
