 Today I want to show you about monster 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.649
 Sausage makes my child love this 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.870
 monster sausages and I'm whole 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.820
 safe thanks to true it is also great 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.349
 Find 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.740
 all you need is wiener 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:23.119
 Sausages and spaghetti noodle you take 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.119
 the ducks cut off a bit 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:40.449
 and make it a few of the same size 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:52.510
 pieces about as then you need the 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:57.780
 spaghetti then you take a few and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.780
 just break them in the middle 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.440
 let that be about the same 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:11.289
 then you take such a sausage and 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:14.500
 about five to six of the splits 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:27.820
 is broken then you stand 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 they carried just so across by the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.360
 other side 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 and so they look like here can also 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.250
 your little ones keeps and the spaghetti 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.740
 how we spit them ourselves 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 tastes best 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.570
 according to the motto if all together 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.940
 you have a pot with water 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.229
 they told you first the water in 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.700
 heat the kettle 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:04.229
 so you save a lot of time and electricity 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.899
 just hot water in the pot and 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:15.150
 salt and you would do just that 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:17.940
 Spaghetti then cook a bitter 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.280
 but let stamp and let churches look 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.620
 that the water does not boil too much 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.750
 otherwise the bubbles burst and that 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:30.239
 does not look so nice in the first place 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.180
 let hot water draw at mclaren 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.840
 and once her agent is eating 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840
 finished 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.300
 you can be the mass she will too 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.520
 just serve like that 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.070
 if you want you can of course 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.240
 make tomato sauce over it or something 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.550
 whatever comes to your mind 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.450
 but it tastes best when you look at it 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.450
 is by hand
