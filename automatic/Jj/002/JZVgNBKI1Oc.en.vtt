William Ramirez link was an interesting
way<00:03:10.510> to<00:03:10.540> go<00:03:10.780> about<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:11.110> right<00:03:11.290> side<00:03:11.530> but<00:03:11.739> he's

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
way to go about the right side but he's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:13.500

behind and takes him down right there so

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.589 
behind and takes him down right there so
I<00:03:51.010> was<00:03:51.340> like<00:03:51.519> all<00:03:51.790> right<00:03:51.849> well<00:03:52.269> if<00:03:52.299> there's

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:52.599 
I was like all right well if there's

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.099 
I was like all right well if there's
such<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:52.840> thing<00:03:52.930> as<00:03:53.140> FIFA<00:03:53.560> karma<00:03:54.280> I<00:03:55.109> suppose

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
such a thing as FIFA karma I suppose

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.839 
such a thing as FIFA karma I suppose
that<00:03:56.409> might<00:03:56.650> be<00:03:56.799> it<00:03:56.950> because<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.519> don't<00:03:57.670> think

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:57.849 
that might be it because I don't think

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.789 
that might be it because I don't think
he<00:03:58.000> was<00:03:58.120> probably<00:03:58.420> controlling<00:03:59.260> Philipp<00:03:59.590> Lahm

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
he was probably controlling Philipp Lahm

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.170 
he was probably controlling Philipp Lahm
when<00:04:00.069> he<00:04:00.190> took<00:04:00.340> me<00:04:00.519> down<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.940> wasn't

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
when he took me down I wasn't

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.259 
when he took me down I wasn't
controlling<00:04:01.599> Suarez<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.790> we'll<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:04.030> call<00:04:04.239> it

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
controlling Suarez so we'll just call it

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.849 
controlling Suarez so we'll just call it
even<00:04:04.540> but<00:04:05.200> we<00:04:05.620> do<00:04:05.950> have<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.340> racket<00:04:06.970> itch<00:04:07.180> so<00:04:07.859> 30
