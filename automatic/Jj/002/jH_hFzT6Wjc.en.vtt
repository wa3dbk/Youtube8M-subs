00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
moving along here these are actually a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.980 
moving along here these are actually a
couple<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.100> downloads<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.520> failed<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> not

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
couple of downloads that failed and not

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.660 
couple of downloads that failed and not
entirely<00:01:22.259> sure<00:01:22.439> why<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> bit<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
entirely sure why which is a bit of a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.310 
entirely sure why which is a bit of a
problem<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.150> if<00:01:24.180> for<00:01:24.390> example<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.780> tap<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.170> this

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
problem so if for example we tap on this

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.530 
problem so if for example we tap on this
one<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.130> saying<00:01:26.400> can't<00:01:26.729> play<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.150> download

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
one it's saying can't play or download

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.450 
one it's saying can't play or download
there's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.869> problem<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.320> license<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
there's a problem with the license so

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
there's a problem with the license so
not<00:01:30.270> really<00:01:30.420> getting<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> greatest<00:01:31.110> error

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
not really getting the greatest error

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
not really getting the greatest error
messages<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:31.920> but<00:01:32.729> every<00:01:33.090> once<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.329> a<00:01:33.390> while

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
messages there but every once in a while

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.910 
messages there but every once in a while
you<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.780> find<00:01:34.049> an<00:01:34.350> app<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.680> doesn't

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
you will find an app that just doesn't

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.890 
you will find an app that just doesn't
quite<00:01:35.130> install<00:01:35.460> properly<00:01:35.820> I'm<00:01:36.450> guessing<00:01:36.869> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
quite install properly I'm guessing that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.660 
quite install properly I'm guessing that
the<00:01:37.650> Microsoft<00:01:38.100> still<00:01:38.310> working<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the Microsoft still working out the

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
the Microsoft still working out the
kinks<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.680> but<00:01:40.680> let's

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
kinks with that a little bit but let's

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.960 
kinks with that a little bit but let's
take<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.009> look<00:01:41.220> at<00:01:41.340> installing<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.850> app<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
take a look at installing an app that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.590 
take a look at installing an app that
actually<00:01:42.240> works<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> here<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> said<00:01:45.479> we

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
actually works so here like I said we

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660 
actually works so here like I said we

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
actually wants to use so in this case

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.550 
actually wants to use so in this case
it's<00:03:08.940> it's<00:03:09.480> asking<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.930> be<00:03:10.050> allowed<00:03:10.140> to<00:03:10.410> access

marketplace really quickly and have a

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.789 
marketplace really quickly and have a
quick<00:04:17.970> look<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:18.299> if<00:04:18.900> we<00:04:19.109> were<00:04:19.260> for<00:04:19.440> example

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
quick look at if we were for example

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.590 
quick look at if we were for example
looking<00:04:20.070> for<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> very<00:04:20.549> specific<00:04:20.760> application

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
looking for a very specific application

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.550 
looking for a very specific application
how<00:04:22.470> we<00:04:22.530> can<00:04:22.710> find<00:04:22.950> that

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.809 

so<00:04:26.560> here<00:04:26.710> we<00:04:26.770> have<00:04:26.800> we're<00:04:27.159> loaded<00:04:27.460> up<00:04:27.550> into<00:04:27.729> the
