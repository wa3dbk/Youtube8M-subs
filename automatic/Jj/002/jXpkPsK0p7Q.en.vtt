00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
want to buy the passes of exp that um

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.339 
want to buy the passes of exp that um
that<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.859> buy<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.340> shop<00:00:26.930> you<00:00:27.930> they

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
that you can buy in the shop you they

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.950 
that you can buy in the shop you they
stack<00:00:28.769> on<00:00:29.099> each<00:00:29.160> other<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.119> buy<00:00:30.269> 130

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
stack on each other so you can buy 130

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.220 
stack on each other so you can buy 130
150<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.250> 200<00:00:32.489> percent<00:00:33.300> bonus<00:00:33.540> passes

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
150 and then 200 percent bonus passes

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.660 
150 and then 200 percent bonus passes
and<00:00:34.530> they<00:00:34.620> all<00:00:34.710> stack<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> they<00:00:35.399> give<00:00:35.550> you

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
and they all stack and they give you

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.479 
and they all stack and they give you
about<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.090> 4<00:00:36.420> times<00:00:36.630> bonus<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:38.100> basically

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
about a 4 times bonus so basically

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.000 
about a 4 times bonus so basically
you're<00:00:38.730> having<00:00:39.090> four<00:00:39.600> times<00:00:39.870> more<00:00:40.140> exp<00:00:40.379> than

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
you're having four times more exp than

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.160 
you're having four times more exp than
you<00:00:41.460> normally<00:00:41.670> would<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.540> buy<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.899> three

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
you normally would if you buy all three

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.680 
you normally would if you buy all three
of<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.440> passes<00:00:44.629> now<00:00:46.039> fast<00:00:47.039> ways<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.730> getting

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of the passes now fast ways of getting

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.979 
of the passes now fast ways of getting
exp<00:00:49.260> would<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.800> hop<00:00:50.340> hopping<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.000> what<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
exp would be hop hopping and what this

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.220 
exp would be hop hopping and what this
is<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.500> basically<00:00:52.530> going<00:00:53.219> into<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> 15<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
is is basically going into a 15 out of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
is is basically going into a 15 out of
16<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.160> 14<00:00:56.399> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> 16<00:00:56.940> players<00:00:57.480> game<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.350> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
16 or 14 out of 16 players game and you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
16 or 14 out of 16 players game and you
go<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.579> there<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.270> get<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.539> many<00:01:00.780> close<00:01:01.140> as

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
go in there and you get as many close as

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.170 
go in there and you get as many close as
possible<00:01:01.590> in<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.760> short<00:01:02.969> amount<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.600> time<00:01:03.769> and

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
possible in a short amount of time and

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.880 
possible in a short amount of time and
by<00:01:06.180> doing<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.540> you're<00:01:06.869> getting<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.439> ton<00:01:07.860> of

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
by doing that you're getting a ton of

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.640 
by doing that you're getting a ton of
exp<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:09.030> you're<00:01:09.299> getting<00:01:09.570> as<00:01:09.960> many<00:01:10.260> kills

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
exp because you're getting as many kills

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.250 
exp because you're getting as many kills
as<00:01:10.860> possible<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.700> like<00:01:12.299> under<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.900> hour<00:01:13.049> I

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
as possible in like under an hour I

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.170 
as possible in like under an hour I
guess<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.830> could<00:01:13.950> say<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.850> would<00:01:14.970> keep

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
guess you could say and you would keep

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
guess you could say and you would keep
repeating<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.780> process<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
repeating that process by going to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
repeating that process by going to
almost<00:01:17.970> full<00:01:18.210> game<00:01:18.420> that's<00:01:18.720> already<00:01:18.960> in

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
almost full game that's already in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.740 
almost full game that's already in
progress<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.369> go<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> there<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.270> get<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.570> many

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
progress you go in there you get as many

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.410 
progress you go in there you get as many
kills<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.229> possible<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.640> find

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
kills as possible and then you find

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.749 
kills as possible and then you find
another<00:01:24.840> def<00:01:25.409> match<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:26.100> then<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.700> straight

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
another def match and then go straight

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.390 
another def match and then go straight
in<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.479> get<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.470> kills<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:29.159> cannot

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
in there and get more kills you cannot

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
in there and get more kills you cannot
you<00:01:29.729> can<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.060> bombs<00:01:30.360> too<00:01:30.780> because<00:01:31.170> that's

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
you can go to bombs too because that's

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.069 
you can go to bombs too because that's
you<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.540> amount<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.840> kills

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you have to get a good amount of kills

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.330 
you have to get a good amount of kills
though<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> want<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.130> good<00:01:35.280> exp<00:01:36.170> um

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
though if you want to get good exp um

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
though if you want to get good exp um
but<00:01:38.340> generally<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.540> def<00:01:40.170> matches<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> get

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
but generally I I do def matches to get

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.810 
but generally I I do def matches to get
my<00:01:41.100> exp<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.820> then<00:01:42.780> bomb<00:01:43.079> loads<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
my exp and then bomb loads I have to

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.749 
my exp and then bomb loads I have to
make<00:01:45.000> sure<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:45.659> uh<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.740> usually<00:01:47.460> go<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
make sure that uh I usually go on a

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.999 
make sure that uh I usually go on a
stack<00:01:48.119> team<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.049> easy<00:01:49.470> kills<00:01:49.890> and

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
stack team so I get easy kills and

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
stack team so I get easy kills and
therefore<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.820> exp<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.750> a

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
therefore I can get good exp now a

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.639 
therefore I can get good exp now a
secret<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> getting<00:01:57.210> good<00:01:57.570> exp<00:01:58.140> one<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
secret way of getting good exp one of

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.069 
secret way of getting good exp one of
them<00:01:58.770> would<00:01:59.070> be<00:01:59.250> to<00:02:00.320> do<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> clan<00:02:02.219> bomb<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.270> do

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
them would be to do a clan bomb and do

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
team or from my clan and then I would on

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.039

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
then just um we would always win pretty
much<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.330> we<00:02:45.510> would<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.780> games<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.590> we

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
much and we would in the games and we

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.160 
much and we would in the games and we

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
would get a ton of exp so I recommend

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.190 
would get a ton of exp so I recommend
you<00:02:49.260> try<00:02:49.470> that<00:02:49.769> method<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.459> well<00:02:51.180> as<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.840> pub

you try that method as well as the pub
hopping<00:02:52.560> method<00:02:52.890> which<00:02:53.099> is<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.519> other<00:02:53.610> method

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
hopping method which is the other method

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.960 
hopping method which is the other method
