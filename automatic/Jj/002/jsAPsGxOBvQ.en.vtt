00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.310
 hello to everyone this new video for the 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:07.640
 babe in the academy 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.710
 in this video I will show you the new kits 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.170
 for nail art and kit number one e 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.400
 kit number 2 and the related nail note 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 Article 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:25.860
 these brushes this brush is the 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:28.560
 brush number zero instead this 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.020
 in the number 10 bar 0 which has very much 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:44.250
 thin and I will use this to reproduce 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 mine and nail art this instead to the kit e 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.640
 number one that is composed of a learned 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:56.520
 I was spot on the ultra bright fixer e 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.800
 a colored stone wheel the dr a 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:10.010
 two tips a little bigger a little 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:12.350
 the smaller this is the 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.210
 my idea is the end result I hope 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.830
 so much so that as always you like it e 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:23.270
 follow the tutorial to see how it is 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:27.590
 a base was built 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.320
 ultra vigan the hill france bianco the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.840
 ultra bright fixer the drops 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.380
 dries quickly and then this enamel that 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.380
 408 purple cahun and a mask 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.750
 see the final result in detail 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.490
 is my famous swiped flower that to 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.420
 tour liked very much 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.420
 many people 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.790
 we are with the application of the ultra base 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.970
 smoothing the ultra smoothing base serves 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.840
 precisely to smooth the surface e 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.369
 allow to have a note one 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.140
 homogeneous surface when we go 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:20.319
 apply the nail polish and dry it 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:23.739
 really very very fast after i take it 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.690
 my color 408 and apply it to 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.790
 single color on all nails like 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.830
 I always advise you to do some past 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.080
 very thin and rather of making them 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.290
 however, two are well outlined 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.860
 cuticles and side parts such as vi 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.170
 I said spread it very thin and when 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.239
 it will be very well dry we can do 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.420
 the second hand always recommend the 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:50.350
 second hand to make the color more 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.970
 homogeneous and much more covering for 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.819
 speed up let's take the drops to 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.950
 quick drying that you need 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.930
 to dry the polish more quickly 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.120
 can be precisely passed between one 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.739
 passed and the other and do not leave one 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.500
 oily layer as you are seeing precisely 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:11.590
 is doing the second pass because it 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.510
 enamel is now almost always dry 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.980
 gone and always try to pass 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.900
 very thin 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.350
 now let's take our brush 10 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.930
 bar 0 the thin one the pan in a 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.220
 we take the white france and it 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.070
 we apply on the vas that tina and then 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.780
 let's also look from the fixer 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.489
 especially the white to put 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.489
 very abundant drops 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.110
 we pass on the ring finger the fixator e 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.270
 even in this case you put it 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.250
 slightly abundant don't wait for that 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.340
 dry take the spot 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.470
 take the white and slowly there 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.240
 lay on the drops you will see that 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.310
 magically the drops as you see yes 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.620
 they are very expanding now take the 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.570
 brush flunked it in the transparent e 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.520
 pull the color from the inside towards 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.540
 the outside as you are seeing from these 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.910
 images 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.590
 you must be very quick especially 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.660
 don't have a direct heat source 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.739
 above because otherwise it really dries up 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.299
 a flash and you can't get it right 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.190
 to get them even more nail art 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.070
 always take the top spot more 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.540
 thin and make some side shots 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.540
 how are you living in this image 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.470
 now always take fixer e 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.510
 in the part in greenhouses and internal in the 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:44.270
 applied a pin, take yours 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.760
 wheel distracted with the color that best suits you 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.100
 like I take the silver position it 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.130
 pressing lightly to insert it 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.900
 better to fix the other nails for 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.970
 don't leave them alone 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.350
 we always take fixer and there 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.180
 we always apply a rag the 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.610
 silver color in the same way that 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.830
 I told you before 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.110
 this is used to give light to nails and 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:11.750
 embellish them with a touch on all the 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.520
 nails not too eccentric this nail 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.370
 I really like the art a lot 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.620
 I really reproduce so much 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.090
 this is the final result as you are 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.740
 seeing up close 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.210
 now that I recommend dry nail polish 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.729
 then to move mainly over the area 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.680
 the art the drops dries enamel that 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:29.360
 obviously help to dry first 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.190
 we take our fixer and it 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.690
 we pass over the whole surface over all 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.180
 nails especially where we did 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.270
 nail art and this is used to make it last 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.160
 more and make the enamel last longer 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.540
 still this the final result I hope 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.200
 much that you like at the next video 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.200
