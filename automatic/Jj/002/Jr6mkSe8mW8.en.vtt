00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
depends sometimes on what season it is

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.119 
depends sometimes on what season it is
in<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.109> wintertime<00:01:01.410> when<00:01:01.829> you're<00:01:01.980> not

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
in the wintertime when you're not

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.979 
in the wintertime when you're not
showing<00:01:02.309> any<00:01:02.609> skin<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.359> say<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.870> you're

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
showing any skin I would say that you're

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.010 
showing any skin I would say that you're
facing<00:01:04.290> your<00:01:04.530> neck<00:01:04.949> area<00:01:05.400> should<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.299> little

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
facing your neck area should be a little

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
facing your neck area should be a little
bit<00:01:07.140> more<00:01:07.409> closed<00:01:07.770> depending<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.369> how<00:01:08.520> your

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
bit more closed depending on how your

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
bit more closed depending on how your
skin<00:01:09.000> works<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.479> sometimes<00:01:09.659> people's<00:01:10.290> necks

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
skin works but sometimes people's necks

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.560 
skin works but sometimes people's necks
are<00:01:10.799> lighter<00:01:11.070> than<00:01:11.250> their<00:01:11.400> face<00:01:11.549> but<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
are lighter than their face but if it's

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.670 
are lighter than their face but if it's
summertime<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.110> you're<00:01:13.229> showing<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.530> lot<00:01:13.650> of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
summertime and you're showing a lot of

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.310 
summertime and you're showing a lot of
skin<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:14.070> would<00:01:14.250> definitely<00:01:14.790> say<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.990> face

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
skin I would definitely say go with face

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.770 
skin I would definitely say go with face
and<00:01:16.590> body<00:01:16.740> matching<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.759> could<00:01:18.060> you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and body matching because you could you

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.090 
and body matching because you could you
don't<00:01:18.960> match<00:01:19.140> your<00:01:19.290> face<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:19.890> if<00:01:19.979> your

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
don't match your face and then if your

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.070 
don't match your face and then if your
body's<00:01:20.400> darker<00:01:20.729> then<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.030> just<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.420> crazy

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
body's darker then you just look crazy

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.060 
body's darker then you just look crazy
so<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.610> depends<00:01:23.939> on<00:01:24.689> what<00:01:25.470> season<00:01:25.770> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
so it really depends on what season is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.460 
so it really depends on what season is
in<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:26.490> opinion<00:01:26.939> right<00:01:27.119> now<00:01:27.180> it's<00:01:27.450> summer<00:01:27.689> so
