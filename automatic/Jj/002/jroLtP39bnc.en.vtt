00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.050
 the Lohmann wrinkles 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.670
 It is the smallest nature reserve in Germany but the one with the largest 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.979
 Density of bridges Seabirds 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.759
 up to 60 meters high are his pitfalls 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.289
 more than 5000 breeding pairs argue here on Heligoland 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.289
 best and places 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.460
 before we take a look at the underwater world they meet on the beach Nico 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.789
 Martens daily noted on Lohmann rock the number of different 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.789
 Bird species and breeding pairs 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.190
 Fools omen they have similar habits the penguins are with 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.840
 but not remotely warned them 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.350
 to bleed the only ice are on the narrow ledge barely ten 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.630
 Square centimeter available 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.770
 despite targeted crowding and attachment, there were only a few eggs in the depth 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.690
 Finally, even warned, above all, can have a special shape 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.760
 the absolutely leading name 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.040
 and then the peculiarity that the emphasis in the top 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.060
 so they can if they on the dirt roads and actually times a foul 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 at the Wolf Center completely missed 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.050
 For millions led to turn so underlining that is so the hedge 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.740
 Nature's what an Albers is put through each year 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.820
 they are the biggest floods of lung cancer 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.780
 they came 100 years ago 15 years ago 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.409
 with the first and fourth classes in recent years ever again 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.900
 become more colorful 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.930
 Green and red 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.770
 the birds have learned the fishing net online then as collateral damage 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.610
 first ones are more durable than something below 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 the supposed progress of the club with 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.090
 the birds more or less build themselves a trap 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.200
 Mostly these options are then usually sacrificed to the victims 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.850
 what's in there 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.340
 occasionally the company Ortlieb tinkering itself then in this 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.340
 case 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.680
 the affected only the end of September and tinkered back out to sea 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.699
 and stay there until the next production starts 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.609
 it will take until then 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.879
 the hustle and bustle and croaking in the steep walls of the smallest 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.879
 German nature reserve 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.199
 just a stone's throw away 

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:38.279
 away from the main island on the so-called stage prevails the whole 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.839
 Year over operation 

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.839
 Here is Germany's largest chunk of colony 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.099
 You can sleep around 100 gray seals here 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.999
 and bathing excellent 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:55.319
 the animals have lost their shyness barely any more from the visitors 

00:03:03.119 --> 00:03:06.099
 As a tourist you really have to sometimes poses on the beach that you can 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.320
 do not take two kilos 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.680
 on 8 because they just went wrong Haasis they are at them 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.380
 just resigned that they are not alone here and people animals 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.509
 live here 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.509
 peacefully side by side 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:38.179
 next to Kevin Burden rather boring hard falls 

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:40.239
 but in the water transform 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.130
 up to 300 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.460
 Kilogram heavy animal will 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.939
 the elegant slim 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.650
 We decided to keep the biggest German top team under water 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.199
 watch and get in front of the lens 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.739
 who drive together a few experts from the biological institution Helgoland 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:56.669
 we get out 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.669
 the retirees go in Dubai investigators in Dubai are going for order 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:01.749
 Minden Much 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.619
 but only if we were now on the animals 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:06.209
 just sounds 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:07.430
 the conditions are falling 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.449
 Perfect 

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:09.649
 sunshine 

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:10.779
 flood 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:12.549
 calm 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.629
 well 400 meters in front of the beach of course want our underwater cameras in 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:18.859
 ten meters deep laid in wait 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:21.859
 he demands 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.419
 I am irritated 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:39.819
 a normal dive of a seal threatens well and like 20 minutes we have air 

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:43.229
 for almost an hour and a half we are on the search 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.529
 However, at first nothing was to be seen of the drugs in the evening the Germans were allowed 

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:50.439
 German or mackerel chasing can be found cheering we want this 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:53.439
 Tables is dirty 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.860
 40 minutes have already passed as a rib jellyfish just skids past 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.860
 from the announced interest that seals allegedly have from now on 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.870
 we notice a little 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.689
 then suddenly the first robber appears on z only much higher than expected 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.250
 The interest is not always in democracy in the bottom of the ground 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.529
 Sachs GR is waiting for our reserve divers when the first pictures 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:21.529
 just wanted to cool down 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.299
 after 60 minutes on the seabed introductory games between themselves StÃ¶ger 

00:05:30.299 --> 00:05:31.749
 and MDR divers 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:33.439
 that's what their chairman Gates 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:36.439
 still missing 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:39.680
 Things are different with Saskia 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.680
 Robben visits the second one 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.979
 then at the very end just before we run out of air it still happens 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.349
 the alstria gray seal is in contact 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.349
 from even talks to us 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.610
 since approx 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.719
 the child became curious is known 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.119
 that the animals have an increased interest in diving equipment 

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:15.339
 new ones 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:19.479
 especially our fins have done it to the animals again and again they will 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:22.479
 scrutinized closely 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.789
 Back on knees strange blogger sounds are for the open interest 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.789
 Has 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:35.699
 Ork 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:39.270
 Sites in the seventies hunting down the animals are euthanized 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:42.860
 People have no longer perceived themselves as a threat by now 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.340
 Animals used to it 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.340
 that they share their baby with a diver on some days 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.990
 ca 

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:08.089
 "These are wild animals that could only do so 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:12.719
 had led to or even no hand-reared animals are thus 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:17.209
 Wild animals approach us and contact us 

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:18.159
 People are looking for 

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:21.159
 all too rare, I think my nature 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:27.780
 Although diving off Heligoland is only allowed for research purposes 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.439
 At the stand of every single visitor the animals watch better than anywhere 

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:32.949
 otherwise in Germany
