00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:09.710
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:15.450
 1000 188 task which part of the kilogram 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:22.260
 makes 1 gram in kilogram 1000 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:27.510
 gram so 1 gram is one 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.910
 thousandth kilogram in kilogram 1000 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.239
 gram so 1 gram is one 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.190
 thousandth kilogram 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.380
 well or if you want we can write to 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.640
 decimal form means you 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:46.500
 it turns out 0 integers , 0 01 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.480
 here and wrote the numerator top zero integer 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.079
 we had therefore put at the beginning 0 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.420
 then a comma and since we have thousandths 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.789
 here 3 0 so after the comma should 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:04.110
 be 30 and there should be three after comma 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:07.680
 numbers therefore added another 20 and further 10 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 grams well 10 grams exactly the same every 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 gram is one thousandth kilogram then 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 10 grams is 10 thousandths of a kilogram if 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.640
 write in us zero integer put a comma 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.250
 then write the top ten numerator and then 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.590
 look at our denominator as much 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.970
 zeros 3 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 must have three digits after the decimal point and at 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.650
 only 2 of us add another 0 between 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:43.829
 numerator and comma 10 thousandths and here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:45.930
 one thousandth further by the way you can 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.890
 like that and you can still 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.600
 and continue to continue zero, zero one 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.610
 the most extreme 0 which is after comma 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.369
 you can not write code, and from 0 you can 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.070
 cross out and then only 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.290
 this part is after the comma itself 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.090
 extremely on whether toes can be dropped 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.259
 then it â€™s like this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:10.250
 one hundredth is obtained 1 grade or 10 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.250
 thousandths of one and the same 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.830
 so on 100 grams each gram is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.040
 one thousandth kilogram therefore 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:30.709
 100 thousandths of a kilogram are obtained 0 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.060
 whole , 100 0 whole, then we write 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.860
 the numerator in the numerator we have 3 digits you 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.300
 do you know 3 0 so there should be three 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 numbers all right nothing nothing 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.569
 no need to add a little bit 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.100
 simplify the number let's get extremely tac toe 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.080
 let's drop these two zeros 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.470
 discarding does not write like this 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.160
 one-tenth way it turns out that 100 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.540
 gram is one tenth of a kilogram 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.650
 kilogram kilogram 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.459
 and 10 grams is one hundredth of a kilogram 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.720
 forgot to write a kilogram and here it means 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.040
 one thousandth 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.250
 kilogram also forgot who noticed that I 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.970
 forgot kilogram write that well done a 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.769
 who has not noticed be careful how 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.340
 Actually, I myself also need to be 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:24.700
 more attentively 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:29.090
 sometimes wrong and take another 300 grams 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.829
 300 grams 300 grams each gram is 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.910
 thousandth of a kilogram therefore 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:41.540
 it turns out 300 thousandths of a kilogram here 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:46.250
 we have 0 integers, then we write the numerator 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:49.160
 300 here three numbers here 3 0 fits 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.780
 do not need to add anything a kilogram 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.200
 forget we can drop those zeros then 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.989
 there will be 0 point three kilograms 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.680
 300 grams is three- tenths of a kilogram here 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:07.150
 such a problem on this all write to 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.440
 comments did you understand everything 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.930
 if you like my videos by advise 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.319
 friends classmate on this all everything 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.319
 until
