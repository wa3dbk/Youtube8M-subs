veneer will have a 10 mil thick backer

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.120 
veneer will have a 10 mil thick backer
or<00:00:42.420> ten<00:00:42.870> thousandths<00:00:43.380> of<00:00:43.440> an<00:00:43.560> inch<00:00:43.650> backer

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
or ten thousandths of an inch backer

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.520 
or ten thousandths of an inch backer
and<00:00:44.340> it's<00:00:44.910> mainly<00:00:45.150> used<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.780> pressing

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
and it's mainly used for pressing

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.590 
and it's mainly used for pressing
applications<00:00:47.280> if<00:00:47.550> you're<00:00:47.760> using<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.210> vacuum

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
applications if you're using a vacuum

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
applications if you're using a vacuum
press<00:00:48.900> or<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.290> platen<00:00:50.280> press<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.790> hot<00:00:51.000> press

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.270 
press or a platen press or a hot press
when<00:00:51.570> you're<00:00:51.690> laying<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.080> your<00:00:52.230> panels<00:00:52.650> or<00:00:52.830> for

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
when you're laying up your panels or for

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.660 
when you're laying up your panels or for
whatever<00:00:54.290> type<00:00:55.290> of<00:00:55.320> work<00:00:55.590> you're<00:00:55.740> doing<00:00:55.770> then

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
whatever type of work you're doing then

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.730 
whatever type of work you're doing then
we<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.240> 22<00:00:57.600> mil<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:59.760> 22<00:01:00.240> mil<00:01:00.450> is

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:00.740 
we have the 22 mil and the 22 mil is

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.530 
we have the 22 mil and the 22 mil is
basically<00:01:01.740> two<00:01:02.160> layers<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.610> a<00:01:02.850> 10<00:01:03.060> mil<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
basically two layers of a 10 mil and

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.479 
basically two layers of a 10 mil and
then<00:01:04.049> there's<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.439> acrylic<00:01:04.710> adhesive<00:01:05.369> in

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
then there's an acrylic adhesive in

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
then there's an acrylic adhesive in
between<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.090> actually<00:01:06.600> adds<00:01:06.840> up<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.170> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
between that actually adds up to that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.620 
between that actually adds up to that
finished<00:01:08.040> thickness<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.759> the<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> backer

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
finished thickness of the of the backer

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.260 
finished thickness of the of the backer
and<00:01:09.990> this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.890> mainly<00:01:11.130> used<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.640> contact

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and this is mainly used for contact

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.249 
and this is mainly used for contact
cement<00:01:13.069> applications<00:01:14.090> or<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.569> you<00:01:15.719> have<00:01:15.929> to<00:01:16.109> do

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
cement applications or if you have to do

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.999 
cement applications or if you have to do
something<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.039> place<00:01:18.590> contact<00:01:19.590> cement<00:01:19.740> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
something in place contact cement is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.819 
something in place contact cement is
basically<00:01:20.700> your<00:01:20.850> only<00:01:20.999> option<00:01:21.710> because<00:01:22.710> you

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
basically your only option because you

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.069 
basically your only option because you
cannot<00:01:23.130> press<00:01:23.579> into<00:01:23.909> certain<00:01:24.270> circumstances

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
cannot press into certain circumstances

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.429 
cannot press into certain circumstances
and<00:01:25.289> so<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.759> added<00:01:27.359> thickness<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.139> the<00:01:28.229> backer

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
and so the added thickness in the backer

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.309 
and so the added thickness in the backer
get<00:01:29.159> adds<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.819> stability<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
get adds to the stability of the of the

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:34.249 
get adds to the stability of the of the
veneer<00:01:31.590> itself<00:01:32.240> then<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.869> wood<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.229> wood

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
veneer itself then in the wood on wood

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.840 
veneer itself then in the wood on wood
back<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.060> saying<00:01:36.539> earlier<00:01:36.920> is<00:01:37.920> used<00:01:38.490> for

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
back as I was saying earlier is used for

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.190 
back as I was saying earlier is used for
applications<00:01:41.850> where<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.299> more<00:01:42.659> akin<00:01:43.139> to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
applications where it's more akin to

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.529 
applications where it's more akin to
like<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:43.979> traditional<00:01:44.609> type<00:01:44.850> layout<00:01:45.149> because

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
like a traditional type layout because

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.919 
like a traditional type layout because
in<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.719> traditional<00:01:46.229> type<00:01:46.439> layup<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:47.539> know<00:01:48.539> 50

00:01:48.919 --> 00:01:48.929 
in a traditional type layup you know 50

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:51.289 
in a traditional type layup you know 50
or<00:01:49.079> so<00:01:49.259> years<00:01:49.289> ago<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:50.249> would<00:01:50.369> have<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.789> a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
or so years ago you would have a a

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.419 
or so years ago you would have a a
substrate<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.469> the<00:01:52.709> substrate<00:01:52.740> could<00:01:53.310> be

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
substrate and the substrate could be

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:56.359 
substrate and the substrate could be
built<00:01:53.639> out<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.600> stave<00:01:55.469> construction<00:01:56.189> or<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
built out of a stave construction or a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.129 
built out of a stave construction or a
series<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.700> boards<00:01:56.999> glued<00:01:57.329> together<00:01:57.539> or

00:01:58.129 --> 00:01:58.139 
series of boards glued together or

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.010 
series of boards glued together or
plywood<00:01:58.859> or<00:01:59.039> particle<00:01:59.850> board<00:02:00.029> and<00:02:00.209> then<00:02:00.779> they

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
plywood or particle board and then they

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.569 
plywood or particle board and then they
would<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> substrate<00:02:01.920> layer<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.340> veneer

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
would have a substrate layer of veneer

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.849 
would have a substrate layer of veneer
laid<00:02:02.850> down<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.899> primary<00:02:04.499> veneer<00:02:04.829> that

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:04.859 
laid down and then a primary veneer that

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.639 
laid down and then a primary veneer that
is<00:02:05.279> laid<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.969> top<00:02:05.999> of<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.450> with<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
is laid down on top of that with a in a

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.740 
is laid down on top of that with a in a
cross<00:02:07.920> banded<00:02:08.520> fashion<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.179> what<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.539> does

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
cross banded fashion and what that does

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.199 
cross banded fashion and what that does
is<00:02:09.990> that<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.349> adds<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.340> great<00:02:11.880> deal<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
is that it adds to a great deal of

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.530 
is that it adds to a great deal of
