00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.120 

let's<00:00:39.780> try<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.050> get<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.200> descending<00:00:40.920> part

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
let's try and get this descending part

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.080 
let's try and get this descending part
to<00:00:41.220> be<00:00:41.340> real<00:00:43.100> vocal<00:00:44.100> sounding<00:00:44.640> real<00:00:44.760> natural

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to be real vocal sounding real natural

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:56.030 
to be real vocal sounding real natural
sounding<00:00:53.660> what<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:54.930> when<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.200> descend<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.040 
sounding what so when we descend the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.100 
sounding what so when we descend the
been<00:00:56.660> a<00:00:58.640> singer<00:00:59.640> wouldn't<00:01:00.090> usually<00:01:00.420> change

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
been a singer wouldn't usually change

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.120 
been a singer wouldn't usually change
the<00:01:01.560> speed<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.960> glissando<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> slide

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
the speed of the glissando of the slide

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:06.109 
the speed of the glissando of the slide
in<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.700> middle

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
in the middle

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.350 
in the middle
so<00:01:06.479> once<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> movement<00:01:07.410> begins<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.460> happen<00:01:08.670> I

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
so once the movement begins to happen I

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.410 
so once the movement begins to happen I
mean<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> Ino<00:01:10.410> will<00:01:10.619> stay<00:01:10.890> being<00:01:11.790> song<00:01:12.240> or

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
mean this Ino will stay being song or

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.630 
mean this Ino will stay being song or
held<00:01:12.600> out<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.619> once<00:01:13.800> the<00:01:13.920> singer<00:01:14.250> starts

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
held out and once the singer starts

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
moving from E to D that rate of speed is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.430 
moving from E to D that rate of speed is
going<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.300> be<00:01:18.390> in<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.570> straight<00:01:18.810> line<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.290> not

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
going to be in a straight line it's not

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.380 
going to be in a straight line it's not
going<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.680> most<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.550> time<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.240> not

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
going that most of the time it's not

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.029 
going that most of the time it's not
going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.660> start<00:01:21.869> out<00:01:21.990> slow<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:22.890> get

00:01:23.029 --> 00:01:23.039 
going to start out slow and then get

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:25.370 
going to start out slow and then get
faster<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.670> D<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:23.940> the<00:01:24.270> diversity<00:01:24.600> what

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
faster to the D and the diversity what

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.620 
faster to the D and the diversity what
we're<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.619> doing<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.220> we're<00:01:26.880> implying<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
we're really doing is we're implying a

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.380 
we're really doing is we're implying a
move<00:01:27.899> from<00:01:28.860> E<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.190> D<00:01:29.460> but<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> doesn't<00:01:30.149> never

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
move from E to D but that doesn't never

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
move from E to D but that doesn't never
really<00:01:30.630> happens<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.440> move<00:01:31.649> only<00:01:31.890> happens

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
really happens the move only happens

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.290 
really happens the move only happens
from<00:01:32.670> E<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.390> E<00:01:33.660> flat<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.429> pull<00:01:35.670> off<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:35.970> D<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
from E to E flat and we pull off to D to

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.770 
from E to E flat and we pull off to D to
imply<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.410> rest<00:01:37.679> of<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:37.979> assignment<00:01:38.780> well

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
imply the rest of the assignment well

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.960 
imply the rest of the assignment well
because<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.200> can<00:01:40.319> only<00:01:40.440> do<00:01:40.590> half<00:01:40.910> using<00:01:41.910> a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
because we can only do half using a

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.090 
because we can only do half using a
using<00:01:42.539> this<00:01:42.780> pitch<00:01:43.050> you<00:01:43.170> only<00:01:43.590> do<00:01:43.740> half<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
using this pitch you only do half and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.199 
using this pitch you only do half and
what<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.220> singer<00:01:44.490> would<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.000> thing<00:01:45.119> I

00:01:45.199 --> 00:01:45.209 
what a singer would do this thing I

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:48.560 
what a singer would do this thing I
would<00:01:45.330> really<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.660> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:02:22.010 

let's<00:01:49.570> go<00:01:49.720> a<00:01:49.750> straight<00:01:50.020> line<00:01:50.290> but<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.160> sounds

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:33.000 

so<00:02:23.020> let's<00:02:23.230> try<00:02:31.410> did<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> difference

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so let's try did you a difference

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.010 
so let's try did you a difference
between<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> way<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.520> played<00:02:33.790> yes<00:02:34.060> what<00:02:34.840> was

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
between the way I played yes what was

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.460 
between the way I played yes what was
the<00:02:35.140> difference

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:50.790 

probably<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:49.450> band<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:50.290> meant<00:02:50.500> up<00:02:50.650> my

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
probably the my band you meant up my

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.960 
probably the my band you meant up my
bent<00:02:51.010> down<00:02:51.190> yeah<00:02:51.550> ugly<00:02:51.730> stuff<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:54.790> is<00:02:54.910> a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
bent down yeah ugly stuff this is a

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.500 
bent down yeah ugly stuff this is a
carry<00:02:55.150> more<00:02:55.680> yeah<00:02:56.680> does<00:02:57.489> it<00:02:57.519> all<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.790> time<00:02:57.970> all

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
carry more yeah does it all the time all

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
carry more yeah does it all the time all
the<00:02:58.840> time<00:02:58.870> and<00:02:59.670> you'll<00:03:00.670> often<00:03:01.769> alternate

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
the time and you'll often alternate

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.509 
the time and you'll often alternate
he'll<00:03:03.970> do<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.120> lot<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.450> those<00:03:05.340> descending<00:03:06.340> bends

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
he'll do a lot of those descending bends

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.880 
he'll do a lot of those descending bends
see<00:03:07.120> something<00:03:07.480> bends<00:03:07.660> decent<00:03:08.110> events<00:03:08.500> and

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
see something bends decent events and

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.530 
see something bends decent events and
then<00:03:09.010> at<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.250> end<00:03:09.280> we'll<00:03:09.670> bend<00:03:09.910> off<00:03:10.150> either<00:03:10.360> on

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
then at the end we'll bend off either on

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.479 
then at the end we'll bend off either on
the<00:03:10.630> same<00:03:10.780> pitch<00:03:11.019> another<00:03:11.350> push<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.980> now<00:03:12.280> that

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the same pitch another push and now that

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.630 
the same pitch another push and now that
upward<00:03:13.260> bending<00:03:14.260> know<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.620> very<00:03:14.650> very<00:03:15.040> strong

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
upward bending know is very very strong

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.580 
upward bending know is very very strong
it's<00:03:16.269> much<00:03:16.480> more<00:03:16.630> powerful<00:03:16.840> than<00:03:17.140> if<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.380> can

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
it's much more powerful than if you can

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.050 
it's much more powerful than if you can

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.240 
that you are playing we just make them
totally<00:04:42.660> kick-ass<00:04:43.099> okay

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
totally kick-ass okay

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.010 
totally kick-ass okay
so<00:04:44.400> making<00:04:44.610> two<00:04:44.849> variations<00:04:45.180> is<00:04:45.630> a<00:04:45.660> good<00:04:45.900> way

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
so making two variations is a good way

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.450 
so making two variations is a good way
to<00:04:46.080> start<00:04:46.289> practicing<00:04:46.470> even<00:04:47.130> if<00:04:47.220> you<00:04:47.280> don't

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
to start practicing even if you don't

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.180 
to start practicing even if you don't
like<00:04:47.750> this<00:04:48.750> particular<00:04:49.080> type<00:04:49.500> of<00:04:49.530> plan<00:04:49.949> your

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
like this particular type of plan your

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.680 
like this particular type of plan your
phrasing<00:04:50.610> there<00:04:50.940> are<00:04:51.060> other<00:04:51.180> things<00:04:51.360> that<00:04:51.570> you

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
phrasing there are other things that you

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.050 
phrasing there are other things that you
can<00:04:51.840> do<00:04:51.990> with<00:04:52.169> the<00:04:52.349> point<00:04:52.710> is<00:04:52.889> to<00:04:53.099> to<00:04:53.760> search

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
can do with the point is to to search

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.060 
can do with the point is to to search
always<00:04:54.539> for<00:04:54.810> for<00:04:55.139> more<00:04:55.380> variation<00:04:55.889> like<00:04:55.979> a

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
always for for more variation like a

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.589 
always for for more variation like a
little<00:04:56.310> theme<00:04:56.490> and<00:04:56.639> variations<00:04:57.090> doing<00:04:57.479> with

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
little theme and variations doing with

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.210 
little theme and variations doing with
one<00:04:57.780> dollar<00:04:57.960> or<00:04:58.199> two<00:04:58.349> notes<00:04:58.530> your<00:04:58.800> three<00:04:59.010> notes

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
one dollar or two notes your three notes

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:03.310 
one dollar or two notes your three notes
and<00:04:59.880> you'll<00:05:00.810> start<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.289> discover<00:05:01.650> overtime

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
and you'll start to discover overtime

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.990 
and you'll start to discover overtime
patterns<00:05:04.320> of<00:05:04.530> things<00:05:04.740> that<00:05:04.919> you<00:05:05.010> like<00:05:05.280> you

that is so right now I don't think you
have<00:05:12.419> any<00:05:12.570> idea<00:05:12.630> because<00:05:13.260> you<00:05:13.590> you<00:05:14.490> just<00:05:14.699> keep

going from one node to another node to

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.260 
going from one node to another node to
node<00:05:16.289> to<00:05:16.770> another<00:05:16.800> node<00:05:17.070> there's<00:05:17.370> no<00:05:17.699> time<00:05:18.030> to

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
node to another node there's no time to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.719 
node to another node there's no time to
even<00:05:18.389> develop<00:05:18.889> your<00:05:19.889> faces<00:05:20.190> aren't<00:05:20.400> developed

because there's no time to develop them

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.899 
because there's no time to develop them
okay<00:05:22.430> that<00:05:23.430> makes<00:05:23.580> sense

00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:23.909 
okay that makes sense

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.750

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
it's no big deal to play three notes or
