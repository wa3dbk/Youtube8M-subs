00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.730
 Mythical chests on them probably keys 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.760
 the most expensive now and what about them 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:39.629
 practical solid but 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:43.370
 interesting and a bunch of it mans ok and extremely 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.770

 I am sure that cool things will fall out but 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.090
