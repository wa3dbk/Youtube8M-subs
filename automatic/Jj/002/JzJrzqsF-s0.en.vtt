because I was super frustrated playing

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.719 
because I was super frustrated playing
ghosts<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> decided<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.189> just<00:01:59.340> sit<00:01:59.520> down<00:01:59.549> and

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
ghosts so I decided to just sit down and

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.660 
ghosts so I decided to just sit down and
come<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> class<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:01.320> for<00:02:01.680> me<00:02:01.950> dealt

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
come up with a class that for me dealt

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
come up with a class that for me dealt
with<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.969> frustrating<00:02:03.840> things<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.560> game

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
with the frustrating things in the game

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.100 
with the frustrating things in the game
so<00:02:05.009> I'm<00:02:05.100> gonna<00:02:05.250> explain<00:02:05.430> what<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.240> is<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.719> my

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so I'm gonna explain what it is and my

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.559 
so I'm gonna explain what it is and my
logic<00:02:07.710> my<00:02:07.920> reasoning<00:02:08.399> behind<00:02:08.580> it<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.539> I

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
logic my reasoning behind it and then I

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.510 
logic my reasoning behind it and then I
will<00:02:09.780> go<00:02:09.959> into<00:02:10.470> class<00:02:10.739> setup<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.310> show<00:02:11.459> you

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
will go into class setup and show you

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.260 
will go into class setup and show you
guys<00:02:11.760> exactly<00:02:12.030> what<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.750> class

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
guys exactly what the class

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.420 
guys exactly what the class
so<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.900> things<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.290> frustrate<00:02:14.890> me<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.190> most

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
so the things that frustrate me the most

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.050 
so the things that frustrate me the most
in<00:02:15.790> Call<00:02:16.180> of<00:02:16.210> Duty<00:02:16.510> ghosts<00:02:16.870> are<00:02:16.990> IEDs<00:02:18.060> campers

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
in Call of Duty ghosts are IEDs campers

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.570 
in Call of Duty ghosts are IEDs campers
and<00:02:19.390> snipers<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.680> sure<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.040> all<00:02:21.250> get<00:02:21.400> into

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
and snipers and I'm sure we all get into

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.130 
and snipers and I'm sure we all get into
those<00:02:21.790> lobbies<00:02:22.300> where<00:02:22.480> we're<00:02:22.630> getting<00:02:22.720> blown

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
those lobbies where we're getting blown

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.770 
those lobbies where we're getting blown
up<00:02:23.320> by<00:02:23.470> IEDs<00:02:23.650> every<00:02:24.340> two<00:02:24.550> seconds<00:02:25.060> we<00:02:25.540> can't

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
up by IEDs every two seconds we can't

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.060 
up by IEDs every two seconds we can't
find<00:02:25.990> anyone<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.620> map<00:02:26.830> because

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
find anyone on the map because

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.680 
find anyone on the map because
everyone's<00:02:27.460> camping<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.270> we're<00:02:28.600> getting

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
everyone's camping and we're getting

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.260 
everyone's camping and we're getting
sniped<00:02:29.110> out<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.620> nowhere<00:02:29.770> so<00:02:30.250> what<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.790> did<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
sniped out of nowhere so what I did to

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.150 
sniped out of nowhere so what I did to
combat<00:02:31.750> this<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.410> first<00:02:32.620> thing<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.890> did<00:02:32.950> is

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
combat this is the first thing I did is

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.460 
combat this is the first thing I did is
I<00:02:33.280> equipped<00:02:33.700> sitrep<00:02:34.300> because<00:02:34.870> not<00:02:35.050> only<00:02:35.080> does

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
I equipped sitrep because not only does

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.430 
I equipped sitrep because not only does
that<00:02:35.620> deal<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> IEDs<00:02:36.880> but<00:02:37.630> most<00:02:37.900> campers

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
that deal with the IEDs but most campers

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.500 
that deal with the IEDs but most campers
will<00:02:38.740> usually<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.340> equipment<00:02:40.090> with<00:02:40.300> them

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
will usually have equipment with them

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.990 
will usually have equipment with them
when<00:02:40.900> they're<00:02:41.050> camping<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:42.130> sitrep<00:02:42.640> allows

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
when they're camping so sitrep allows

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.910 
when they're camping so sitrep allows
you<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.300> see<00:02:43.480> where<00:02:43.930> they<00:02:44.230> are<00:02:44.260> you<00:02:44.710> can<00:02:44.890> be

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you to see where they are you can be

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.670 
you to see where they are you can be
like<00:02:45.130> oh<00:02:45.310> there's<00:02:45.640> like<00:02:45.820> 52<00:02:46.510> million<00:02:46.870> ideas<00:02:47.230> up

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
like oh there's like 52 million ideas up

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.190 
like oh there's like 52 million ideas up
there<00:02:47.890> with<00:02:48.070> a<00:02:48.100> SATCOM<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.880> a<00:02:48.910> fucking<00:02:49.360> sentry

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
there with a SATCOM and a fucking sentry

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.750 
there with a SATCOM and a fucking sentry
gun<00:02:50.380> I'm<00:02:50.710> pretty<00:02:50.980> sure<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.130> as<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.280> camper<00:02:51.700> up

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
gun I'm pretty sure it as a camper up

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.310 
gun I'm pretty sure it as a camper up
there<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.480> allows<00:02:52.720> you<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.020> be<00:02:53.140> able<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
there so it allows you to be able to

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.980 
there so it allows you to be able to
find<00:02:53.620> the<00:02:53.740> campers<00:02:54.160> much<00:02:54.460> easier<00:02:55.060> now<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.690> deal

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
find the campers much easier now to deal

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.950 
find the campers much easier now to deal
with<00:02:56.020> snipers<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.520> why<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.730> equip<00:02:58.420> stalker

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
with snipers that is why I equip stalker

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.140 
with snipers that is why I equip stalker
I<00:02:59.290> find<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.740> it's<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.220> lot<00:03:00.460> easier<00:03:00.730> to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
I find that it's just a lot easier to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.270 
I find that it's just a lot easier to
kill<00:03:01.420> them<00:03:01.660> because<00:03:02.080> obviously<00:03:02.470> they<00:03:02.920> have<00:03:03.100> to

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
kill them because obviously they have to

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.880 
kill them because obviously they have to
stand<00:03:03.490> still<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.240> shoot<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.900> where<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.500> can

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
stand still and shoot you where you can

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.860 
stand still and shoot you where you can
strafe<00:03:06.340> back<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:06.880> forth<00:03:07.120> and<00:03:07.420> keep<00:03:07.600> hitting

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
strafe back and forth and keep hitting

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.630 
strafe back and forth and keep hitting
them<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.380> it's<00:03:08.530> a<00:03:08.680> lot<00:03:08.710> harder<00:03:09.190> for<00:03:09.340> them<00:03:09.610> to

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
them and it's a lot harder for them to

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.760 
them and it's a lot harder for them to
hit<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.090> if<00:03:10.270> you<00:03:10.690> have<00:03:10.870> stalker<00:03:11.200> than<00:03:11.530> if<00:03:11.650> you

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
hit you if you have stalker than if you

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.100 
hit you if you have stalker than if you
don't<00:03:12.040> have<00:03:12.400> stalker<00:03:12.880> so<00:03:13.300> don't<00:03:13.630> that's<00:03:13.840> the

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
don't have stalker so don't that's the

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.100 
don't have stalker so don't that's the
main<00:03:14.410> ingredients<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:16.150> class<00:03:16.390> and<00:03:16.960> the

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
main ingredients of the class and the

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.500 
main ingredients of the class and the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
night so now that I have explained what

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.980 
night so now that I have explained what
the<00:03:24.310> class<00:03:24.550> is<00:03:24.790> supposed<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.300> do<00:03:25.570> and<00:03:25.600> what

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
the class is supposed to do and what

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.900 
the class is supposed to do and what
it's<00:03:26.140> supposed<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.620> combat<00:03:27.100> let's<00:03:27.640> go<00:03:27.820> ahead

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
it's supposed to combat let's go ahead

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.140 
it's supposed to combat let's go ahead
and<00:03:28.240> jump<00:03:28.540> into<00:03:29.050> an<00:03:29.200> example<00:03:29.290> of<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.550> class<00:03:30.790> so

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
and jump into an example of the class so

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.670 
and jump into an example of the class so
let's<00:03:31.330> first<00:03:31.540> take<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.810> look<00:03:31.870> at<00:03:32.140> an<00:03:32.350> assault

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
let's first take a look at an assault

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.770 
let's first take a look at an assault
rifle<00:03:32.740> class<00:03:33.130> I'm<00:03:33.490> using<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.150> honey<00:03:34.510> badger

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
rifle class I'm using the honey badger

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.530 
rifle class I'm using the honey badger
obviously<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.560> has<00:03:35.800> a<00:03:36.070> built-in<00:03:36.490> silencer<00:03:37.330> I

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
obviously it has a built-in silencer I

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.030 
obviously it has a built-in silencer I
would<00:03:37.780> recommend<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.470> use<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.740> silencer

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
would recommend that you use a silencer

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.850 
would recommend that you use a silencer
on<00:03:39.580> this<00:03:39.820> class<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.900> because<00:03:41.230> this<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.740> the

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
on this class just because this is the

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.900 
on this class just because this is the
class<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.070> I<00:03:42.280> bring<00:03:42.550> out<00:03:42.640> when<00:03:42.820> I'm

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
class that I bring out when I'm

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.850 
class that I bring out when I'm
frustrated<00:03:43.150> and<00:03:43.780> usually<00:03:44.410> I<00:03:44.440> get<00:03:44.590> frustrated

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
frustrated and usually I get frustrated

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.740 
frustrated and usually I get frustrated
when<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> game<00:03:45.520> is<00:03:45.550> really<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.060> really<00:03:46.420> slow

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
when a game is really really really slow

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.020 
when a game is really really really slow
now<00:03:47.290> if<00:03:47.440> you<00:03:47.650> do<00:03:47.830> not<00:03:47.950> have<00:03:48.160> a<00:03:48.190> silencer<00:03:48.760> in<00:03:48.940> a

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
now if you do not have a silencer in a

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.000 
now if you do not have a silencer in a
slow<00:03:49.300> game<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.900> soon<00:03:50.110> as<00:03:50.260> you<00:03:50.440> shoot<00:03:50.710> you're

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
slow game as soon as you shoot you're

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.410 
slow game as soon as you shoot you're
gonna<00:03:51.160> bring<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.640> lot<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.850> attention<00:03:52.030> to

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
gonna bring a lot of attention to

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.850 
gonna bring a lot of attention to
yourself<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.080> I'd<00:03:53.200> recommend<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.680> you<00:03:53.800> use

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
then I do have focus just because I

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.150 
then I do have focus just because I
don't<00:04:35.140> know<00:04:35.260> I<00:04:35.290> feel<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.680> it's<00:04:35.860> kind<00:04:36.070> of
