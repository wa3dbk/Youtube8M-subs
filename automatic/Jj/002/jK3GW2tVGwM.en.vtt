 jack 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.090
 Tell us guys here is the sleepy 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.860
 schools games and today in epic games 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.410
 bringing you here blade 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 in fact this game is here in games 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.280
 epic but for the sake of nostalgia né 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.440
 because this game does not have anything so 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630
 great not even people 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.090
 I will not be able to open the 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.040
 game as of custume games apps by 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.440
 copyright and I almost 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.660
 I screwed the car invitation taking the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.330
 game was released in 2000 the published 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.059
 by cleide on the playstation platform 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.980
 and is based on the story of the good anime 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.290
 practically everyone knows blade 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.510
 including the youngest prick and also 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.100
 some shows will come out of the season, I'll go 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.460
 start telling the story of the anime 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.409
 beyblade is an anime based on a 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.270
 toy that looks like a champion 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.610
 but in anime 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.890
 This is not a joke for them. 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.020
 sport and they participate in leagues 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.659
 national and international 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.280
 in some of these pedestrians are energized 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.250
 by beastly bits 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.250
 for this however they are wild beasts 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.140
 the beasts bits are spirits of creatures 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.159
 have lived on earth for millions. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.979
 of years 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.950
 It's good, what the fuck is that? 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.610
 the beast bits are imprisoned a pawn 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.920
 is and is controlled by children face 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.829
 When I stop to think about it today 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.619
 really makes no sense but in the 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:58.539
 I used to pay power, there's no way I can 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.890
 I bought the toy blinds 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.100
 here on my street a championship 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.369
 alone and neither have I been a champion twice 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.350
 is street champion face but knows the merit 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.890
 I had the honor when I played for the first time. 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.800
 time my stage was really good 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.710
 the kiss story revolves around the 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.730
 fights, whether they are individual or in 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.280
 team 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.530
 the main team is called blade 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.790
 breakers formed by the five 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.780
 protagonists 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.200
 tyson that has dragon like beast beach 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:35.019
 it falls that has andré as beast bits schiff 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.459
 the beast beast to say that is stuck 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.860
 on your laptop 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:42.250
 hey, have a fight like 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.570
 the beast bid and max that has bracial as 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.180
 Monday bits 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.460
 taking the beast beach from the tiff those are 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.920
 the four holy Arabs just wait 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.100
 strongest beach positioning 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.350
 more active in the fight the tite is a nerd of the 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.710
 older team galley 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.130
 it is one of the vital points of the brics to 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.180
 history of anime is basically that of 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.030
 game too, right? 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.370
 only it will have some differences 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.920
 so even though I talk about the game 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.860
 in the game you will get into the skin of a 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.410
 beautiful newbie and cyber dream 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:20.560
 fighter is to become world champion of 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.770
 Berlin the truth is not slow 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.660
 I thought it was a workshop, right? 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.489
 you could see that the story practically 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.980
 the same as anime 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.680
 only that seeing from a point of view of a 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.600
 new fighter that does not exist in the anime he 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.820
 was specially made for the game 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.750
 Then you will choose your baby's name. 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.150
 fighter 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.269
 the school comes very generic, which is one of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.190
 worse to fight if there is no worse and will 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.280
 coming back more and more to grow in 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:50.110
 world of the game is that you 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.180
 you can change your bibles as well as 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.110
 The name left me the way you did. 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.720
 want to 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:58.480
 For example, I'm in the parts of the company. 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.709
 some dragun parts and put in the beast 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.900
 beach 13 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.060
 you can change the pointer on the parts and 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.459
 webb blade chassis plus carnival 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.070
 possible calls well milk I made 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:12.310
 was more colorful fighting guy in the 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.320
 eyes but it was stronger in the game when 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.630
 I got to ride this bible. 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.989
 the game lost grace the machine was 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.790
 very weak a bible canvas top but 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.070
 a very cool fighting mode in this game 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.010
 that you played against your friend for 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.440
 example if he is playing well in the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.690
 his house did not leave one of his and you have 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.240
 some memory cade his plays is well 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.790
 I need you, we could put both 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.940
 Nuclei cache memory a fight against eu 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:42.850
 ate blade and he gave the baby since 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.919
 a bigger game life when you start 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:48.400
 a battle had a force gauge 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:51.849
 that you applied on the launcher and for that 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.119
 force you set the cbb already slower 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:57.819
 fast on the top of the screen had 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:05:00.069
 an apia indicator showed accounts 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.539
 you could handle it before your 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.119
 bible of breaking 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.759
 coming at the end of said h sink know 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:08.679
 broke but only in that game 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.209
 because when you went back up on 

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.469
 Instead of building alone, you 

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:14.169
 You will need to pay nothing. 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:15.639
 announcing a story mode that some 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.589
 Sometimes you have to repair samsung 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.020
 bleed to continue following the 

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:22.569
 championship but to claim the usual 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.119
 be cheap and also has a demonstrator 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.009
 of sp which showed the speed at which 

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:29.800
 only the bible where it was and when this 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:33.009
 speed dropped that number drooping 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.169
 The bridge climb stopped and also 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:37.990
 of a lp sampler that was his 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:40.599
 special and you could miss beast bid 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.860
 if I'm not mistaken when lp arrived 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:44.979
 no 25 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.990
 You could miss them, they're beasts. Bid the fights. 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:50.349
 are best of three that neither the 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.969
 anime and its victories are classified 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.219
 by medals 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:55.839
 for example the gold medal means 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.759
 you won your opponent 

00:05:55.839 --> 00:06:01.089
 playing out of the korea or breaking 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.699
 his law the silver medal is when the 

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:04.869
 Bible your opponent to say and 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.550
 bronze medal 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:09.789
 happened but loses control of the 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:13.479
 for example you just start to 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:16.209
 struggle and their bible goes out of wedge 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.909
 I did not like it at the time, I was just the 

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:22.300
 battle of the game that only had a wedge 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:25.110
 it was always she did not expect it to be 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.309
 which are not unanimous with gigantic wedges and 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:30.819
 obstacles but it's not just one thing 

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:33.639
 small and always repeats the soundtrack 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:36.219
 it is also repetitive but it until it is 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.009
 Good, she's sick but not so much. 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:40.779
 The sound of the game is good, it 's just the noise of 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:44.349
 hit metal metal 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:47.349
 The dubbing of the game is also good the game is 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:50.469
 repetitive but this day buy system 

00:06:47.349 --> 00:06:53.079
 the piece and become stronger it vitiates 

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:56.889
 Dude and you're only gonna stop when you gone 

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:58.629
 the best and remembering this game was 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:00.729

 a game without commitment but that will 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.600
 take hours of gambling 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:40.240
