 hello today will tell you the end 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.559
 to the board game the cat has not cheated before and 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.270
 trashes telling you about the version I'm cooking 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.610
 on made of wood 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.650
 this time the developers have shared 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.930
 half the playing field component 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.570
 made of plastic players waiting 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.570
 duels and solving three-dimensional tasks 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.940
 inside bright rectangular boxes you 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.160
 you will find two game fields with partitions 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.860
 two sets of plastic figures for 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.070
 players 60 double-sided cards and 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.579
 booklet with rules 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.670
 players 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.350
 8 pentamines will come each figure 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.800
 consists of 5 cubes 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.850
 5 credits for each figure consists of 4 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:52.910
 cubes and 6 minimi on consisting of 3 2 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.790
 or 1 card dice in the game can be 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.760
 divided into two types of 12 double-sided 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.670
 cards are used in three-dimensional duels and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.640
 48 double-sided cards are used for 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.890
 Competition card contests can be 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.270
 divided into 9 groups which differ 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.079
 contour color 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 There are 4 levels of difficulty 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:15.499
 simple level is yellow green and 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.020
 brown outline 

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.950
 medium difficulty is blue and 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.740
 red outline 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.520
 complex it is purple and black outline a 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.950
 expert 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.859
 This is a pink and gray map outline. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.529
 competition paired paired cards have 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.679
 same color contour same color 

00:01:30.529 --> 00:01:36.139
 background and the same number in the upper right 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.139
 corner of the card on each card 

00:01:36.139 --> 00:01:41.149
 competitions are the figures that the player 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.939
 must use in order to 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.849
 finish first pint ate penta 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.209
 this group of several shapes is perfect 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:51.499
 filling the area separated 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:52.099
 limiter pay attention to 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:54.499
 symbol and 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.079
 centrally located cards 

00:01:54.499 --> 00:02:00.380
 characters used when playing with children 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.959
 the child chooses one card in yellow or 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.119
 brown outline and an adult instead 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.609
 order to take a steam card period 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.880
 card with a red or blue outline 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:13.250
 with the same background color as the child and 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.350
 similar symbol in this way 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.910
 the child will play at a simple level 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.700
 difficulties as an adult 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.100

 put the shape field in the center of the table 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.460
 select the difficulty level and take 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.350
 corresponding dependency cards 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.020
 on selected difficulty level 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.660
 place the limiters on the game 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.400
 the fields we chose the easiest level

 have through numbering from one to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.400
 nine on cards with the same background 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.380
 task numbering is the same but 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.290
 task content is different 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.150
 for example the player on the left collects his 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.230
 parallelepiped in the first task 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.500
 of five pentamino and 1 captions on a player 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.500
 on the right performs a similar task from

 way you will exchange figures 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.950
 after the exchange the player should be 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.360
 set specified in his 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.000
 job cards 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.430
 besides the figures of the specified tasks are not 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.340
 forget to take the figures drawn on 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.890
 card end up all the figures 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.770
 included games will be shared 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.920
 between the players of these figures

 the results of three duels determined 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:52.200
 the winner in cats cheated can play 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.660
 even one for solo 3d games 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:57.330
 used cards with black and white 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.770

 collect the figures indicated in the task 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:09.270
 of these figures is the parallelepiped given in 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.150
 top left of the card for solo 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.630

 tasks during which you have to 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.770
 switch between three-dimensional mode and 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.290
 puzzle mode the player will build 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.720
 several parallelepipeds and collect 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.240
 few pints of the smallest 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.820
 players from the age of three can 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.689
 compose two-dimensional models from a booklet 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.239
 and so 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:41.939
 build three-dimensional designs for tan 

00:06:39.239 --> 00:06:44.610
 need this new version of world hit 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.649

 plastic players are waiting for complex 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:59.339
 three-dimensional tasks 

00:06:56.249 --> 00:07:00.569
 cats will need to be interesting to players in 

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.849
