you<00:03:06.820> should<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:07.120> already<00:03:07.330> done<00:03:07.840> it<00:03:08.310> not

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
you should have already done it not

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.340 
you should have already done it not
everything<00:03:09.820> translates<00:03:10.570> from<00:03:10.810> taking<00:03:11.260> the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
everything translates from taking the

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.880 
everything translates from taking the
old<00:03:11.500> high<00:03:12.070> to<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.400> low<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:12.940> do<00:03:13.060> appreciate

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
old high to the low but I do appreciate

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.990 
old high to the low but I do appreciate
the<00:03:14.890> fact<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.280> they're<00:03:15.519> not<00:03:15.700> just

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
the fact that they're not just

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.199 
the fact that they're not just
re-releasing<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:16.959> same<00:03:17.350> shoe<00:03:17.880> which<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.090> me

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
re-releasing the same shoe which to me

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.910 
re-releasing the same shoe which to me
pollutes<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.780> whole<00:03:20.760> everything<00:03:22.799> value<00:03:23.799> of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
pollutes the whole everything value of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.229 
pollutes the whole everything value of
the<00:03:24.040> shoe<00:03:24.280> value<00:03:24.790> of<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:26.110> whole<00:03:26.290> system

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
the shoe value of the the whole system

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.360 
the shoe value of the the whole system
but<00:03:28.239> not<00:03:28.420> everything<00:03:28.720> translates<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.860> okay<00:03:30.220> we

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
but not everything translates to okay we

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.070 
but not everything translates to okay we
had<00:03:30.549> it<00:03:30.670> in<00:03:30.760> a<00:03:30.850> high<00:03:31.000> will<00:03:31.269> release<00:03:31.570> it<00:03:31.840> a<00:03:31.930> low

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
had it in a high will release it a low

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.020 
had it in a high will release it a low
and<00:03:32.290> vice<00:03:32.440> versa<00:03:32.830> this<00:03:33.190> what<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.459> think<00:03:33.489> turned

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
and vice versa this what I think turned

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.350

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
out better and I think if they do the

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.720 
out better and I think if they do the
skunk<00:03:37.720> right<00:03:37.959> it's<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.860> to<00:03:38.890> translate<00:03:39.400> very
