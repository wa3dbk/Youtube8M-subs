00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
only so I'll just mix that in with the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.080 
only so I'll just mix that in with the
rest<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.599> these<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:18.159> know<00:02:18.249> what's<00:02:18.549> left<00:02:18.819> after

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
rest of these you know what's left after

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.599 
rest of these you know what's left after
doing<00:02:19.450> my<00:02:19.569> roots<00:02:19.780> I'll<00:02:20.019> mix<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.489> just

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
doing my roots I'll mix that in and just

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:25.470
