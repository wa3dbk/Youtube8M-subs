00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.420
 my goal here is that he is not now 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.509
 for a long time standing in the kitchen 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.089
 for blogs button of course you can do that 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:25.679
 sometimes, but not always and 

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:27.509
 That's why I give you so lightning 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.609
 he then on the already one 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.340
 The woman can keep to it 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.980
 her just finished youth action 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 lay down and get a fill this time 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.750
 I then have my favorite with 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.000
 Sheep cheese was filled and was right 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 yummy you can do that too, of course 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.359
 make mincemeat then let times 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.870
 Watch how fast that works 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:53.010
 I have 100 milliliters of milk here 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.949
 liter of mineral water rarely because many 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 ask me what it is then I have here 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.070
 so about 80 milliliters of oil 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:08.190
 I will do that now 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:13.130
 mix together and then enter 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.130
 bit of pepper and salt with no 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.550
 who does not know that you have im 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.870
 Turkish shop juve buys and the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.780
 fall apart 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.180
 Unfortunately, the boys are not here 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 Shed in Turkey 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.990
 but what no problem for the recipe 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.360
 I'll show you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.730
 is that exactly fitting important 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.940
 Of course, that will provide you with a few 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:42.150
 can leave pieces throughout 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.770
 that is not so bad then fills 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.530
 is 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.939
 I leave you here I have one 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.409
 Coated pan 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:59.990
 then I would have a choice what 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:02:02.590
 still remained so important throughout 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.149
 is that the ground is nicely covered 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.810
 so now you can of this 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:14.360
 liquid easily spread out into the sea 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.459
 about keeping any other airmail can 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:21.170
 then just make it small with it 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:26.110
 they are already small anyway and then 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.110
 right with a lot of fluid 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:40.480
 after that I have potato now 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.360
 filling I've taken an onion 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.250
 beautifully grilled meat 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.280
 potato just go there 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:54.410
 Give and season with spices 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.760
 tasted so now comes the rest 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.760
 again was one 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.000
 Now you can just view the pages too 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.000
 fold 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:30.269
 and once again something like that completely 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.269
 has remained 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.210
 then you can just go to the pages 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.210
 burst down 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.750
 so that's so easy to do and 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.750
 is also very fast 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.340
 for all who say I want to now 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.220
 do not want to make a stove but want to 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.740
 Eat cheap food that 's really 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.190
 ideal 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:12.130
 Now I have that covered nicely 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:12.130
 then you will simply brush with oil 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:30.350
 you can of course also from the milk 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:33.169
 guidance is still on the heart 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:37.820
 on medium heat from both sides 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:40.280
 bake roast golden brown like you would 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.419
 you may call that question how will 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:46.220
 I then go to sheep's milk film if you 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.880
 of course you can have several flags 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:53.860

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.860
 have a lot of visit also give 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.149

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:24.909
 I still have the recipe so now 

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:28.569
 you can just turn the pages again 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:28.569
 leave behind 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:51.610

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:54.849
 you can just turn that around 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.800
 you could just watch it 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:59.069

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.069

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:21.090

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:34.740
