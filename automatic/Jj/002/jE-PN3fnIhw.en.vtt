the moment now the last feature I want
to<00:03:42.720> talk<00:03:42.810> about<00:03:43.110> is<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.410> simplest<00:03:43.800> and<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.070> my

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
to talk about is the simplest and in my

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.890 
to talk about is the simplest and in my
opinion<00:03:44.310> by<00:03:44.670> far<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.090> biggest<00:03:45.270> upgrade<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
opinion by far the biggest upgrade the

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.660 
opinion by far the biggest upgrade the
system<00:03:46.020> has<00:03:46.350> compared<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.860> ps3<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
system has compared to the ps3 and

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.580 
system has compared to the ps3 and
that's<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.209> standby<00:03:48.570> mode<00:03:48.690> which<00:03:49.350> not<00:03:49.560> only

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that's the standby mode which not only

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.380 
that's the standby mode which not only
uses<00:03:49.980> less<00:03:50.160> power<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.580> doesn't<00:03:51.090> produce<00:03:51.180> as

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
uses less power and doesn't produce as

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.090 
uses less power and doesn't produce as
much<00:03:51.540> heat<00:03:51.810> but<00:03:52.290> by<00:03:52.380> doing<00:03:52.440> this<00:03:52.800> you<00:03:53.070> can

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
much heat but by doing this you can

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.770 
much heat but by doing this you can
still<00:03:53.490> charge<00:03:53.940> your<00:03:54.120> controller<00:03:54.480> when<00:03:54.690> you're
