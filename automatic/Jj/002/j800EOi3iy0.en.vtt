00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.780
 Finish in 2014 and we want to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.379
 that we are really good at that 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.559

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.730

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.340
 secure balance 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 the stint that it still has to be completed 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.720
 before the first grenadiers start 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.750
 July leave home is huge

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.500
 and there we become the barrio 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.670
 weld together big together 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.380

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.060

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.920
 if you are such a dignified one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.710
 We also had a good time with us 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.180
 the good words in recognition of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.530
 own personality in your own 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.960
 performance that one has provided here and 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.729
 then goodbye looks like the soldiers 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.369
 trellis stand to say goodbye 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.869
 many in many eyes look a lot 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.850
 friendly and happy faces 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.100
 looks sad faces the 1 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.290
 say goodbye then it's already done in the heart 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.110
 even if you have a good perspective 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:19.260
 has a free time after the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.150
 serving time as a family can 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.000
 now on a nice time together 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.530
 look forward to other soldier families need 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.810
 Now again on a long separation 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.640
 if I'm right he mean 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.280
 Woman I think we have to say that a lot 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.720
 proud of what you already have in many missions 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.580
 had done again now 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.400
 She takes over the work for two 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.320
 takes care of the children and that must 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.550
 master it alone and without the 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.989
 Support our families 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.940
 We could not do our job that way 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.530
 afford and I believe they carry 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.209
 at least as heavy as a load 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.220
 Of course the family is too 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:54.000
 become more professional too 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:58.950
 family knows something with us meanwhile 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.780
 happens and the feeling is out 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 a little easier than the last time 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.220
 many see regenerations in the meantime 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.989
 grenadier so and the prospect that 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.000
 this isaf mission the last one 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.920
 Hindu Kush will also inspire the 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.930
 mood was the most important thing in the end 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.989
 always be that we all heal and 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.850
 and healthy the link with the 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.590
 intention order met again here are 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.360
 and that our goal will be us then 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.600
 will be back here at the end of the year 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.040
 be and then celebrate the good wishes 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.170
 they will stay at home 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.060
 to accompany because goodbye there was the 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.640
 obligatory place names of the godfather 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:37.459
 municipalities a greeting from the home in 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.459
 almost 6,500 kilometers away from the camp
