and I have a little bit of downtime at
the<00:00:31.570> moment<00:00:31.900> so<00:00:32.260> I<00:00:32.290> thought<00:00:32.500> I'd<00:00:32.650> just<00:00:32.800> film

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
the moment so I thought I'd just film

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.650 
the moment so I thought I'd just film
what<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.510> got<00:00:34.750> at<00:00:35.080> Waverley<00:00:35.710> outlet<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:36.400> time

what I got at Waverley outlet this time

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.070 
what I got at Waverley outlet this time
so<00:00:37.660> I<00:00:38.940> didn't<00:00:39.940> get<00:00:40.030> as<00:00:40.150> much<00:00:40.180> this<00:00:40.660> year<00:00:40.870> as<00:00:40.989> I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
so I didn't get as much this year as I

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.830 
so I didn't get as much this year as I
did<00:00:41.230> last<00:00:41.500> year<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:43.059> because<00:00:43.210> I<00:00:43.450> went<00:00:43.629> to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
did last year just because I went to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.209 
did last year just because I went to
more<00:00:43.960> stores<00:00:44.350> this<00:00:44.590> year<00:00:44.649> than<00:00:44.980> I<00:00:45.010> did<00:00:45.190> last

straightener and or curling iron in

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.630 
straightener and or curling iron in
there<00:01:28.390> so<00:01:28.929> when<00:01:29.080> you<00:01:29.110> travel<00:01:29.649> they<00:01:30.340> don't<00:01:30.520> get

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
there so when you travel they don't get

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.790 
there so when you travel they don't get
scuffed<00:01:31.090> or<00:01:31.569> they<00:01:32.080> don't<00:01:32.229> burn<00:01:32.349> your<00:01:32.590> clothes

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.889 
scuffed or they don't burn your clothes
if<00:01:33.069> they're<00:01:33.280> still<00:01:33.580> hot<00:01:33.789> or<00:01:34.149> anything<00:01:34.630> like

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899 
if they're still hot or anything like

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.290 
if they're still hot or anything like
that<00:01:34.959> but<00:01:35.410> I<00:01:35.619> think<00:01:36.160> it's<00:01:36.429> meant<00:01:36.610> to<00:01:36.789> only<00:01:36.910> hold

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
that but I think it's meant to only hold

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.609 
that but I think it's meant to only hold
one<00:01:37.780> item<00:01:39.630> either<00:01:40.630> a<00:01:40.869> straightener<00:01:41.410> or<00:01:41.590> a

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
one item either a straightener or a

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.969 
one item either a straightener or a
curling<00:01:41.979> iron<00:01:42.160> but<00:01:42.520> I<00:01:42.910> put<00:01:43.300> both<00:01:43.509> in<00:01:43.979> because

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
curling iron but I put both in because

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.219 
curling iron but I put both in because
both<00:01:45.819> my<00:01:46.209> straightener<00:01:46.599> and<00:01:46.750> curling<00:01:47.080> iron

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
both my straightener and curling iron

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.249 
both my straightener and curling iron
are<00:01:47.380> small<00:01:47.709> and<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:48.489> they<00:01:48.670> both<00:01:48.849> fit<00:01:49.259> curling

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
are small and so they both fit curling

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.219 
are small and so they both fit curling
iron<00:01:50.759> straightening<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:52.750> then<00:01:52.899> what<00:01:52.989> see<00:01:53.170> me

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
iron straightening and then what see me

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.839 
iron straightening and then what see me
is<00:01:53.560> there's<00:01:53.770> a<00:01:53.830> little<00:01:54.039> pocket<00:01:54.220> back<00:01:54.580> here

00:01:54.839 --> 00:01:54.849 
is there's a little pocket back here

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.180 
is there's a little pocket back here
that<00:01:54.970> holds<00:01:55.300> the<00:01:55.360> cords<00:01:55.869> a<00:01:56.140> little<00:01:57.099> bit

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
that holds the cords a little bit

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.070 
that holds the cords a little bit
because<00:01:57.429> then<00:01:58.060> you<00:01:58.119> have<00:01:58.179> to<00:01:58.330> wrap<00:01:58.569> your<00:01:58.750> court

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
because then you have to wrap your court

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.389 
because then you have to wrap your court
around<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.380> thing<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.160> don't<00:02:00.280> talk

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
around the thing and you don't talk

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.770 
around the thing and you don't talk
about<00:02:00.459> the<00:02:00.610> cord<00:02:00.849> getting<00:02:01.270> burnt

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
about the cord getting burnt

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.130 
about the cord getting burnt
it's<00:02:02.560> pretty<00:02:02.770> nice<00:02:03.239> that<00:02:04.239> I<00:02:04.270> got<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.750> towel
