 Hi everyone, in this video I'll show you 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.360
 How do you start the pc by the pen drive? 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.790
 or know how to boot the pen drive 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.349
 I'll be showing you both ways 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:22.090
 let it be done 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:24.640
 one is to enter the mills debut menu to 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.599
 to set bad start the mode by 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.180
 pen drive 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.130
 the second option is to go directly to the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.770
 table and make this same configuration 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.489
 through buddh friends menu 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.789
 the most common keys for this are f12 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.249
 f11 but depending on the brand of the 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.820
 equipment is to jump it may vary 

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:47.199
 may be different with the pen drive 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.449
 prepared with the operating system of 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.510
 your choice but we will plug in the 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.510
 computer 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.269
 then we will restart the 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.269
 machine 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:12.310
 computer will restart next. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.310
 we will apply several times in f12 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:21.299
 choose the hdd usb option then the pc 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.600

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.600
 operational 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.960
 the intention here and show just how 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.380
 initial 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.859
 so let's go to the second part 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.459
 in the second option we will access 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:40.789
 computer paths so that we can 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.890
 configure the configuration 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:49.670
 We'll plug the pen drive into the 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.670
 and restart the machine. 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:02:01.210
