feeler<00:01:07.780> gauge<00:01:07.960> in<00:01:08.140> there<00:01:08.260> so<00:01:08.979> I<00:01:09.039> have<00:01:09.219> a<00:01:09.280> gap

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
feeler gauge in there so I have a gap

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.260 
feeler gauge in there so I have a gap
and<00:01:09.880> thus<00:01:10.360> my<00:01:10.659> spindle<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.500> not<00:01:12.310> trimmed<00:01:12.789> to<00:01:13.149> my

cnc<00:02:00.009> mountain<00:02:00.310> I<00:02:00.399> have<00:02:00.520> a<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:00.850> have<00:02:01.149> a<00:02:01.329> shroud

cnc mountain I have a I have a shroud
over<00:02:01.689> mine<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.039> really<00:02:03.460> can't<00:02:03.700> see<00:02:03.789> but

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
over mine so you really can't see but

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.550 
over mine so you really can't see but
for<00:02:04.299> a<00:02:04.329> lot<00:02:04.420> of<00:02:04.479> you<00:02:04.719> that<00:02:04.899> don't<00:02:05.049> have<00:02:05.319> that

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
for a lot of you that don't have that

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.919 
for a lot of you that don't have that
this<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> two<00:02:07.179> or<00:02:07.210> three<00:02:07.509> minute<00:02:07.749> process

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
this is a two or three minute process

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
this is a two or three minute process
and<00:02:08.380> not<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.770> maybe<00:02:09.369> took<00:02:09.610> me<00:02:09.789> 10<00:02:10.000> minutes<00:02:10.179> so

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
and not a maybe took me 10 minutes so

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.420 
and not a maybe took me 10 minutes so
but<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:13.300> 3,000<00:02:14.140> inch<00:02:14.290> gap<00:02:14.530> that<00:02:14.740> I<00:02:14.770> found<00:02:15.130> on

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
but the 3,000 inch gap that I found on

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.080 
but the 3,000 inch gap that I found on
the<00:02:16.150> back

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
the back

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.600 
the back
a<00:02:17.230> 10,000th<00:02:18.230> inch<00:02:18.379> feeler<00:02:18.680> gauge<00:02:18.980> on<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.459> back

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
a 10,000th inch feeler gauge on the back

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.559 
a 10,000th inch feeler gauge on the back
of<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:20.030> the<00:02:20.180> top<00:02:20.390> back<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.230> my<00:02:22.060> mount<00:02:23.060> there<00:02:23.360> and

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
of on the top back of my mount there and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.559 
of on the top back of my mount there and
then<00:02:24.349> I<00:02:24.500> retighten<00:02:25.129> doll<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> bolts<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.510> a

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
then I retighten doll the bolts in a

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.690 
then I retighten doll the bolts in a
pattern<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.349> retorque<00:02:28.040> them<00:02:28.220> all<00:02:28.430> about

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
pattern and I retorque them all about

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.240 
pattern and I retorque them all about
same<00:02:29.090> same<00:02:29.599> hand<00:02:29.870> torque<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.709> make<00:02:30.860> sure<00:02:30.980> that

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
same same hand torque to make sure that

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.089 
same same hand torque to make sure that
nothing<00:02:31.430> is<00:02:31.730> over<00:02:32.629> torqued<00:02:32.959> or<00:02:33.110> pulling<00:02:33.349> oddly

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
nothing is over torqued or pulling oddly

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.430 
nothing is over torqued or pulling oddly
and<00:02:34.370> now<00:02:35.330> I<00:02:35.360> can't<00:02:35.720> fit<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.959> one<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.349> a<00:02:36.410> half

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
and now I can't fit a one and a half

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.440 
and now I can't fit a one and a half
thousand<00:02:36.950> all<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.519> way<00:02:37.610> around<00:02:37.730> this<00:02:38.150> which

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
thousand all the way around this which

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.960 
thousand all the way around this which
is<00:02:39.049> pretty<00:02:39.860> much<00:02:39.980> as<00:02:40.160> parallels<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.849> go

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
is pretty much as parallels I can go

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.949 
is pretty much as parallels I can go
because<00:02:41.150> I<00:02:41.299> only<00:02:41.420> have<00:02:41.569> a<00:02:41.629> one<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.930> half

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
because I only have a one and a half

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.970

really<00:02:48.379> depends<00:02:48.709> on<00:02:48.890> what<00:02:49.069> you're<00:02:49.190> doing<00:02:49.220> this

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
really depends on what you're doing this

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.430 
machine is going to be used basically
for<00:02:52.209> a4<00:02:53.209> sheet<00:02:53.390> material<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.260> whatnot<00:02:55.010> so<00:02:56.440> not

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
for a4 sheet material and whatnot so not

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.710 
for a4 sheet material and whatnot so not
as<00:02:57.620> a<00:02:57.650> big<00:02:57.890> deal<00:02:58.099> for<00:02:58.130> me<00:02:58.459> compared<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.450> someone

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
as a big deal for me compared to someone

as a big deal for me compared to someone
else<00:02:59.959> that<00:03:00.380> may<00:03:00.530> be<00:03:00.590> milling<00:03:01.040> some<00:03:01.610> molds<00:03:02.030> or

something<00:03:02.989> like<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.170> but<00:03:03.640> it's<00:03:04.640> pretty<00:03:04.790> good

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
something like that but it's pretty good

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.199 
something like that but it's pretty good

vacuum jigger or whatever I wear so

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.520 
vacuum jigger or whatever I wear so
happen<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:57.980> use<00:03:58.190> but<00:03:58.489> um<00:03:59.139> really<00:04:00.139> quick<00:04:00.380> and

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
happen to use but um really quick and

happen to use but um really quick and
easy<00:04:00.709> like<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.280> said<00:04:01.340> took<00:04:02.000> me<00:04:02.150> 10<00:04:02.329> minutes

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
easy like I said took me 10 minutes

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:03.879 
easy like I said took me 10 minutes
probably<00:04:02.870> take<00:04:03.109> you<00:04:03.260> two<00:04:03.410> or<00:04:03.440> three<00:04:03.739> minutes

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
probably take you two or three minutes

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.740 
probably take you two or three minutes
there's<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.880> lot<00:04:04.910> of<00:04:05.060> different<00:04:05.389> tools<00:04:05.540> out

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
there's a lot of different tools out

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.030 
there's a lot of different tools out
there<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.079> a<00:04:06.109> lot<00:04:06.139> of<00:04:06.290> different<00:04:06.620> ways<00:04:06.650> to<00:04:06.769> do

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
there and a lot of different ways to do

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.530 
there and a lot of different ways to do
it<00:04:07.190> but<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.150> a<00:04:08.209> really<00:04:08.419> nice

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
it but this is a really nice

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.710 
it but this is a really nice
straightforward<00:04:09.049> easy<00:04:09.349> way<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:11.299> know<00:04:11.419> when

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
straightforward easy way you know when

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.229 
straightforward easy way you know when
the<00:04:11.840> two<00:04:11.989> flat<00:04:12.500> surfaces<00:04:12.980> meet<00:04:13.280> together<00:04:13.430> you

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
the two flat surfaces meet together you

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.729 
the two flat surfaces meet together you
can't<00:04:14.450> fit<00:04:14.660> a<00:04:14.690> feeler<00:04:14.959> gauge<00:04:15.169> under<00:04:15.470> it<00:04:15.560> you

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
can't fit a feeler gauge under it you

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.610 
can't fit a feeler gauge under it you
know<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:16.340> really<00:04:16.519> idiot-proof<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.930> I'm<00:04:18.470> no

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
know it's really idiot-proof and I'm no

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.219 
know it's really idiot-proof and I'm no
machinist<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:19.430> this<00:04:20.180> this<00:04:20.690> helps<00:04:20.989> me<00:04:21.109> out<00:04:21.139> a

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
machinist so this this helps me out a

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.659 
machinist so this this helps me out a
lot<00:04:21.410> and<00:04:21.560> really<00:04:21.739> helps<00:04:22.130> you<00:04:22.220> understand<00:04:22.610> the

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:22.669 
lot and really helps you understand the

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:25.370 
lot and really helps you understand the
concepts<00:04:23.180> of

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
concepts of

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.380 
concepts of
true<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:26.650> spindle<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.730> table<00:04:27.880> so

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 
true the spindle to the to the table so

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.360 
true the spindle to the to the table so
hopefully<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.710> can<00:04:29.800> check<00:04:29.980> that<00:04:30.010> out<00:04:30.190> if

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
hopefully you can check that out if

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.740 
hopefully you can check that out if
anybody<00:04:30.790> else<00:04:30.910> has<00:04:31.120> questions<00:04:31.510> you<00:04:31.660> know

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
anybody else has questions you know

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.990 
anybody else has questions you know
leave<00:04:31.990> into<00:04:32.140> my<00:04:32.230> comments<00:04:32.650> and<00:04:32.860> it's<00:04:33.850> a<00:04:33.910> good
