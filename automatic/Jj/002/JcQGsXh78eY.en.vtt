00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
adapter so that's very easy to do also I

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.410 
adapter so that's very easy to do also I
have<00:05:01.340> been<00:05:01.610> told<00:05:01.790> because<00:05:01.970> this<00:05:02.240> was<00:05:02.390> a

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
have been told because this was a

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.310 
have been told because this was a
question<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.990> had<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:04.580> you<00:05:04.730> can<00:05:04.970> get<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.810> bumper

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
question I had that you can get a bumper

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.410 
question I had that you can get a bumper
bar<00:05:06.640> if<00:05:07.640> you'd<00:05:08.000> like

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:08.420 
bar if you'd like

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.060 
bar if you'd like
so<00:05:08.600> you'd<00:05:08.780> be<00:05:08.900> getting<00:05:09.200> the<00:05:09.320> bumper<00:05:09.710> bar<00:05:09.860> that

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
so you'd be getting the bumper bar that

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.590 
so you'd be getting the bumper bar that
it's<00:05:10.160> meant<00:05:10.340> for<00:05:10.430> the<00:05:10.640> Swift<00:05:10.940> stroller<00:05:11.330> but

using it on a mini that's that is

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.580 
using it on a mini that's that is
something<00:05:13.460> that<00:05:13.520> would<00:05:13.730> work<00:05:14.050> so<00:05:15.050> that's<00:05:15.350> the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
something that would work so that's the

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.050 
something that would work so that's the
new<00:05:15.710> Mountain<00:05:16.040> Buggy<00:05:16.130> mini<00:05:16.430> stroller<00:05:16.910> I've
