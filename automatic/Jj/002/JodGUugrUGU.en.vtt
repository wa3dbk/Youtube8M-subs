00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:29.559 
connectors from the back one by one
start<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.790> your<00:03:22.849> radio<00:03:28.269> sorry<00:03:29.269> not<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
start with your radio sorry not the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.860 
start with your radio sorry not the
radio<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.140> fog<00:03:30.530> light<00:03:30.709> switches<00:03:34.420> why<00:03:35.420> not

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
radio the fog light switches why not

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:41.309 
radio the fog light switches why not
and<00:03:36.530> then<00:03:36.680> you've<00:03:36.859> got<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:39.410> aerial<00:03:39.769> for<00:03:40.280> the

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:41.319 
and then you've got the aerial for the

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.470 
and then you've got the aerial for the
radio<00:03:42.319> which<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.799> down<00:03:42.980> here<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:46.030> here<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.180> our

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
radio which is down here and here is our

00:03:47.480 --> 00:04:00.640 
radio which is down here and here is our
connectors<00:03:49.959> on<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:51.049> back<00:03:51.109> left<00:03:59.290> I'm<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.500> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
connectors on the back left I'm not that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.890 
connectors on the back left I'm not that
easy<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:00.920> get<00:04:01.159> out<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:06.639> then<00:04:07.639> right<00:04:08.630> at<00:04:08.780> the

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
easy to get out with then right at the

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:44.920 
easy to get out with then right at the
bottom<00:04:09.230> just<00:04:09.849> the<00:04:10.849> cigarette<00:04:11.780> lighter

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:05:04.970 

so<00:04:45.930> there's<00:04:46.230> a<00:04:46.290> cliff<00:04:46.560> level<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:04.560> then<00:05:04.860> the

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:04.980 
so there's a cliff level and then the

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.410 
so there's a cliff level and then the
more<00:05:05.130> difficult<00:05:05.580> one<00:05:05.730> is<00:05:05.880> the<00:05:05.970> power<00:05:06.150> cable

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:06.420 
more difficult one is the power cable

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.400 
more difficult one is the power cable
for<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.520> radio<00:05:08.520> which<00:05:09.210> is<00:05:09.240> down<00:05:10.020> at<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.260> back

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.410 
for the radio which is down at the back

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.110 
for the radio which is down at the back
here<00:05:12.320> went<00:05:13.320> down<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.710> there's<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.550> little<00:05:14.760> screw

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
here went down it there's a little screw

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:44.350 
here went down it there's a little screw
ler<00:05:15.800> hopefully<00:05:16.800> you<00:05:16.860> can<00:05:16.920> see<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.160> all<00:05:17.430> right

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:55.310 

so<00:05:45.360> now<00:05:46.640> that's<00:05:47.640> that<00:05:47.850> part<00:05:48.030> removed<00:05:54.080> the<00:05:55.080> next

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
so now that's that part removed the next

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.950 
so now that's that part removed the next
bits<00:05:55.500> to<00:05:55.650> remove<00:05:55.890> the<00:05:56.100> climate<00:05:56.610> control<00:05:57.000> unit

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 
bits to remove the climate control unit

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.770 
bits to remove the climate control unit
and<00:05:58.670> I've<00:05:59.670> already<00:05:59.880> taken<00:06:00.270> out<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.420> screws

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
and I've already taken out the screws

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.750 
and I've already taken out the screws
for<00:06:01.320> these<00:06:02.190> of<00:06:02.370> the<00:06:02.460> video<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.140> with<00:06:04.140> this

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
for these of the video and with this

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.160 
for these of the video and with this
tool<00:06:05.760> they're<00:06:06.620> two<00:06:07.620> at<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.830> front<00:06:07.950> here<00:06:08.280> and

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
tool they're two at the front here and

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:12.680 
tool they're two at the front here and
to<00:06:10.170> the<00:06:10.380> other<00:06:10.530> side<00:06:10.820> and<00:06:11.820> that<00:06:11.880> makes<00:06:12.510> it

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:12.690 
to the other side and that makes it

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:18.940 
to the other side and that makes it
possible<00:06:12.840> to<00:06:13.140> remove<00:06:13.470> this<00:06:13.650> full<00:06:14.250> cage

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:18.950 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.530 

and<00:06:19.950> then<00:06:20.640> you've<00:06:20.790> just<00:06:20.910> got<00:06:21.060> your<00:06:21.090> connectors

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
and then you've just got your connectors

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.300 
and then you've just got your connectors
at<00:06:21.690> the<00:06:21.750> back<00:06:21.900> here<00:06:24.740> but<00:06:25.740> hopefully<00:06:25.890> I'll<00:06:26.190> be

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
at the back here but hopefully I'll be

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:56.640 
at the back here but hopefully I'll be
able<00:06:26.370> to<00:06:26.580> remove

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:56.650 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:07.630 

all<00:06:57.650> makes<00:06:57.830> it<00:06:57.980> easier<00:07:06.340> and<00:07:07.340> you've<00:07:07.490> got<00:07:07.610> a

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:07.640 
all makes it easier and you've got a

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.480 
all makes it easier and you've got a
tube<00:07:07.880> for<00:07:08.090> your<00:07:08.210> temperature<00:07:08.750> sensor<00:07:09.710> just

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
tube for your temperature sensor just

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.720 
tube for your temperature sensor just
part<00:07:10.730> the<00:07:10.850> climate<00:07:11.240> control<00:07:12.490> should<00:07:13.490> just

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
part the climate control should just

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:24.670 
part the climate control should just
pull<00:07:13.940> straight<00:07:14.210> off<00:07:18.310> line<00:07:19.310> up<00:07:21.310> is<00:07:22.310> that<00:07:22.490> out
