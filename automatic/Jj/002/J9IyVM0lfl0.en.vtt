 with 103 trick goals best is if it arrives in 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.670
 play and well it's always been caught by our 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.829
 member is worse than a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.700
 My great friend and every hour brings several 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 three good for us to give 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.719
 a little about the formal advance wars 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.850
 about the multiplayer that we had to 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.960
 multiplayer revelation is the day do not me 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:02.730
 I remember the day to day it was not 5 let's go 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.589
 have here a live of dissemination of 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.240
 presentation because they did there 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.880
 set a live event like this on the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.920
 internet showing trail and I think I went 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.290
 there are games with in germany if not me 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 cheating is game with and come I was watching 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:20.100
 so with a friend it 's 9 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.810
 commenting with him and me that I was a 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 person I said not only in a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.579
 video of the interview that was 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:31.170
 looking at what I have with very very good 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.570
 so I want to apologize there because I 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.360
 said he was putting off sending too much 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
 expectant but I like 2010 that I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.189
 said that it was not his cause but rather 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.409
 it's broth and nuclear has already left 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.270
 nuclear snipers injection site 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.700
 one was a gap site if I do not 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 there you go wrong because I 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.460
 I think it's a futuristic game. 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.110
 futuristic but it is a very cool game of 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.030
 It will be a very good game to play or 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:09.810
 brother did not miss because he has that up 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:12.260
 those titular trick have their match 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.409
 in why 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.090
 So, xbox, for me, it's more 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.400
 like 10m because I threw open 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.959
 deficit in bs-4 and was very 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.680
 I 'm definitely going to get one. 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.120
 tenth 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.769
 But neither the subject I wanted to talk to 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.230
 You as I said it is about multiplayer 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.159
 one thing I'm commenting on 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.560
 the trailer is not 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.239
 I did not like we can swim is 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.700
 view is not much like beige 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.500
 for those who do not know we can swim and 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.299
 play think anything does not match the 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.440
 second cut and in all 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.159
 last six seven eight code will be that the 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.159
 people had 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:52.099
 I do not know how many numbers we could not 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.829
 swim on and I think it's going to be a 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:57.859
 Little new thing, we'll go swimming. 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:00.379
 and few people using that business day 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.959
 of planar di as a jet star of a 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.299
 kind of fly because a code player 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.379
 he always thinks he has been walking or 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:10.430
 running and few people will remember in 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.980
 hour so do not 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.870
 fight or from somewhere that stay flying 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.760
 Because we're going to fix it, remember. 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.709
 that that building there side gives 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.419
 You climb up, you're on, so I guess. 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.889
 that if he puts this away from the next 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.209
 yes, be the next one 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.989
 many people will be using it because 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:31.340
 staff will already have become accustomed to giving 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.739
 there is a great advantage of cipullo because it is a 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:38.299
 fait like you said is you want to escape from 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.199
 a boy is going to die is personal is very 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.959
 benefit from it 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.340
 but I think the games of fps are now 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.310
 having to vote for it because they are all 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.010
 futuristic games have already been on twitter 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.099
 So I have a lot of people complaining. 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.040
 on the ex the skeleton face does not complain 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.569
 that is the future of the earth connected in 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.709
 neither 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.810
 as you can see in the 2014 World Cup 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.819
 here in Brazil I had the one to flash 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.190
 who walked with a paralytic I do not know 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.590
 the difference that walked with an ex-want 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:17.150
 who kicked a ball with his left foot and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:19.159
 one thing we study science outside 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.419
 of the body think the crab August 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:25.560
 they have it and well you do 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.960
 An example is going to 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.580
 I was thinking that the fast 500 would 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.800
 improve the avaí has ​​an appearance 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.600
 different from the hand of your ex the skeleton or 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.120
 for example you my team a great 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.740
 genius marathon go leg will be more 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.230
 strong such a grandson the skeleton 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.450
 but I still do not know if that but for 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.669
 get there because as you can see it is 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.250
 an armor for example is a species 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.540
 skeleton all games are now 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.330
 having this then it's no use complaining 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.010
 because it will be so and I agree that 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.980
 It has to be this way but one thing I do not 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.720
 I agree they are kind agree that 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:59.340
 I do not like this was a website of 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.410
 weapons that we had in the tenth and 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.880
 also and does not get out of focus I do not like 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.150
 a lot of air a website that is kind of 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.500
 open kind of mapfre that has the 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.210
 code I do not like much anymore on the site 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.190
 on that way but I think 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.950
 people will get used to it and in the trailer 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.690
 had other ways there then beauty and 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:16.919
 Another thing I wanted to talk about is how you 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.889
 must have seen in the trailer 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.660
 dynamic chord of the maps are already 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.820
 changing for example that 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.900
 tsunami is more like a tsunami of the 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.300
 Japan 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.889
 I thought it was cool, but it's not 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.110
 I really liked the maps I saw. 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:33.300
 who had a sign with them and the square 2 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.340
 connected but I do not know there did not see great 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.590
 thing on the maps of that game but the 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.500
 graphics is not very good and I 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:43.860
 I saw some videos there like said video 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.360
 about the nuclear asn video and I loved the 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.250
 I really liked the chart 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:50.880
 but even this company does not reach the end 103 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.380
 goose trick for the worse and you liked it 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.120
 This video did not like the comment on 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.440
 channel for that inscription I have I think 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.060
 than half that neither this has not 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.340
 much in place in some clients but if 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:01.320
 You want to see but it's talking about 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.600
 multiplayer trailer I did half a 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.940
 video of the andu trailer narrating over 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.770
 Playing with them, they want to see you there. 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.810
 my channel and the default also the inscription 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.729
 for various cleaning and goiás that people 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.720
 could be a beauty or stayed here and 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.720
 thanks
