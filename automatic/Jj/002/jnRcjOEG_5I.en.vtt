anybody<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:11.760> yet<00:06:11.910> I<00:06:12.060> believe<00:06:12.090> we<00:06:12.570> got<00:06:12.750> some

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
anybody and yet I believe we got some

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.390 
anybody and yet I believe we got some
good<00:06:13.200> baskets<00:06:13.620> out<00:06:13.770> of<00:06:13.920> it<00:06:14.010> too

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
good baskets out of it too

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.860 
good baskets out of it too
you<00:06:14.820> know<00:06:14.940> if<00:06:15.090> you<00:06:15.210> were<00:06:15.330> to<00:06:15.420> count<00:06:15.660> them<00:06:15.780> all

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
you know if you were to count them all

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.270 
you know if you were to count them all
I'd<00:06:16.080> say<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.920> know<00:06:18.530> Kennedy<00:06:19.530> had<00:06:19.710> two<00:06:19.920> assists

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
I'd say you know Kennedy had two assists

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.610 
I'd say you know Kennedy had two assists
Bryce<00:06:20.580> had<00:06:20.820> one<00:06:21.030> Jill<00:06:21.300> had<00:06:21.600> one<00:06:21.870> and<00:06:22.290> I<00:06:22.380> think

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
Bryce had one Jill had one and I think

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.990 
Bryce had one Jill had one and I think
every<00:06:22.860> one<00:06:22.890> of<00:06:23.010> those<00:06:23.190> assists<00:06:23.640> we're<00:06:23.850> on

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
every one of those assists we're on

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.480 
every one of those assists we're on
double<00:06:24.690> big<00:06:25.080> on<00:06:25.230> big<00:06:25.470> but<00:06:26.070> we<00:06:26.160> had<00:06:26.310> some

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
double big on big but we had some

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.570 
double big on big but we had some
turnovers<00:06:26.640> too<00:06:27.380> you<00:06:28.380> know<00:06:28.500> again<00:06:28.770> Kennedy

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.300 

gave<00:06:32.580> him<00:06:32.730> fluids<00:06:32.880> I<00:06:33.270> think<00:06:33.480> all<00:06:33.630> day<00:06:34.310> didn't

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.310 
gave him fluids I think all day didn't

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.670 
gave him fluids I think all day didn't
even<00:06:35.430> come<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.610> pregame<00:06:36.060> meal<00:06:36.300> so<00:06:36.630> it's<00:06:37.410> a<00:06:37.500> lot

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
even come to pregame meal so it's a lot

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.290 
even come to pregame meal so it's a lot
to<00:06:37.890> ask<00:06:37.920> for<00:06:38.220> him<00:06:38.370> to<00:06:38.550> be<00:06:38.700> able<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:38.940> do<00:06:39.030> but<00:06:39.180> he's

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
to ask for him to be able to do but he's

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:41.480 
to ask for him to be able to do but he's
our<00:06:39.450> best<00:06:39.630> passer<00:06:40.110> so<00:06:40.350> I<00:06:40.620> felt<00:06:41.130> like<00:06:41.280> that<00:06:41.430> he

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:41.490 
our best passer so I felt like that he

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.410 
our best passer so I felt like that he
would<00:06:41.670> be<00:06:41.850> able<00:06:41.940> to<00:06:42.030> handle<00:06:42.150> it<00:06:42.300> better

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
would be able to handle it better

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.960 
would be able to handle it better
anybody<00:06:42.780> else
