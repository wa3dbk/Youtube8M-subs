00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.690
 following speech started in the previous movie 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.850
 let's see other things now 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.240
 the stern unit menu then we must immediately to you to specify that a little 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.369
 few minutes 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.519
 for a pop-up menu 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 that it is possible to hate being realized only is only in a blu-ray environment 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.199
 that is, share but sent a ebay menu that appears 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:27.649
 using a remote control command 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.709
 which overlaps the movie 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:34.080
 without blocking the movie itself 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.850
 normally when I want to change scene 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.500
 in a normal one 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.530
 DVD 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.120
 I have to go back to the initial menu and everything stops 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.010
 e15 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.100
 I choose to opt for the choice 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.390
 which I wish to do in this case with the pop up mine. instead it is possible 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.400
 continue viewing the link of the crimes and why we are seeing e 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.010
 we are going to superimpose a new menu with him that we exercise ours 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.010
 choice 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 then now we are going to import ours 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.420
 menu 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.700
 I can import it directly as - of pop-up or as a normal menu e 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.990
 insecure we import it as the normal menu 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.460
 because so we see what are the operations to do to transform a - 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 a normal in an amen a pop up 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.530
 first of all I highlight here the darkness at 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.910
 here er seen in the monitor 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.020
 my menu is currently pop 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.230
 here that 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.020
 but not yet with a pump because it's a pop up for a menu that doesn't 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.660
 hides because 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.250
 the only things that must be seen are the keys that will be superimposed on the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.200
 file that is playing at that moment 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.660
 so the attraction I have to do 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.390
 the highlight 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.280
 self 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.410
 now 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.910
 the project window 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.220
 my high stern menu and after you match --ediedi 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.959
 here you see 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.740
 in the pop art p7s blu-ray 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 pop art - I repeat 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.529
 this function is possible only teen 

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:20.949
 with a blu-ray share is not possible here you see that has disappeared 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:23.949
 the bottom is the 4 keys left 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.569
 now I have to do another for action 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.150
 here is the operation I have to do is to match now --edevi ikke 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.119
 this time line 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:36.950
 what I work 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.780
 will 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 have a saeco a pop art - 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.189
 it this 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.809
 once this is done 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:46.459
 return here 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.819
 and I will tell him that this menu pump must be combined with time light 1 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.509
 so by showing why 

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:55.669
 finally I managed to see 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.929
 mine 

00:02:56.929 --> 00:03:01.289
 pop up - a superimposed on my faella naturally the position here 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:07.939
 with the time colbert count all at 0 but if I move answered here 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.269
 or better, I can trade an operation of this type I can go to define them 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.699
 in which position I am that desire for things positioned on 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:24.999
 the 15 seconds here is samochod and finally we found a position 

00:03:25.529 --> 00:03:29.249
 my prof at least now is visible of course unfortunately here and it is not 

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:32.609
 possible to verify the functioning of the 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.870
 long ago because eni sessanio have a remote control available here in mine 

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:37.909
 disk 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:41.860
 d amore must run on an ebook reader 168 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.519
 and then I will be able to go activate 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.659
 realpopup - at this point on the image I am viewing 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:54.119
 will appear - stelio here I will be able to go + toilet the choice 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:02.259
 ok at this point I can do to be ready to do ours 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.869
 burning 

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.309
 I go here in the window 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:08.759
 in the menu 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:13.469
 alice the window is ridiculous open the window billa ie pronounced builds 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.949
 and this window opens 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:19.370
 and now I highlight more 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.360
 snow then telling me what you want to do you want to do a blu-ray yes because we have 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.779
 said that this evening hours 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.309
 the alcohol output can be uu fondant 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.900
 ok or a love picture 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.520
 or a disc image here is up to you to choose whether one or the other with 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.930
 the other. 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.930
 suppose we make a blu-ray movie 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.409
 the doctors 

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:48.679
 let's build a blu-ray fashion image that you can as much as I can photo 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:54.870
 percentage plus couple anyway i can go to eeeee check if everything 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.460
 it works properly 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.930
 I do some logging bye 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.839
 here we do the verification by going to take his sparta 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:05.169
 and we see that there are errors 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.330
 go to correct so now I will correct them 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.580
 in fact what tells me that it doesn't work tells me it wasn't 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.009
 accepted return link 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:15.240
 of the dari 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.120
 balanite ok 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.069
 this badoo do it right away 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.189
 I'll come back here and tell him 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:26.839
 d be with the inglots I can do graphically and tell him 

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:30.469
 I don't want this to come back to this - a little 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.889
 now it will be forgiving of saving all the passages of the various connections 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.779
 I missed the final action 

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.779
 tits completed. network this is it 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:51.620
 that this 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.550
 that this final relationship here always returns to the 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.339
 to the first below - 

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:03.009
 of course, that is, if I want then I can also add 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.620
 inna a key 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.889
 here at the sub menu to get it back to the main menu va well this is it 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:10.629
 an operation what to do 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:14.279
 here then we see if indeed the operation we have done 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.610
 complete and allows me to create the disc 

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.439
 so I go on TV 

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:26.110
 bild 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.110
 bild we said 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.909
 these parameters we have already set before 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.909
 so let's do a certain project kahn 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.559
 let's say it was verified 

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:38.490
 the 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.400
 the project now 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.470
 you have that does not make a world so it means that my project is fine as well as a 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:48.809
 this point can burn it 

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:50.699
 so I repeat again 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:54.990
 it is enough for me to go here and tell him, since he knows that he has come right 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.919
 but from here he combined 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:02.599
 he should check how much it costs. name is earl presences I should media 

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.119
 close x do 

00:07:04.119 --> 00:07:07.830
 eclik ok so it means that at this point he is ready to leave 

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:08.999
 make me 

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:12.009
 create me blu-ray disc this time I don't delete 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.169
 because in reality I don't want to create a blu-ray but I want to create a font 

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.409
 then 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:20.789
 instead of saying blurent 

00:07:20.789 --> 00:07:22.219
 I will tell you 

00:07:22.219 --> 00:07:25.219
 re create a blu-ray i'm enci 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.740
 naturally creating a blu-ray manager 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.330
 I have to define the destination so I say browse 

00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:41.489
 and he rolli creates me a folder creates new print folder 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.460
 and I'll tell him blu-ray blu-ray 

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:50.080
 didol ok 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.349
 save 

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.789
 like Scotland 

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:55.300
 at this point he leaves 

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:58.300
 to create all the necessary files for me 

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.960
 to then be able to burn them
