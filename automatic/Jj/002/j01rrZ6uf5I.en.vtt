00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello very welcome to tutorials 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.189
 jj today I'm going to teach you how to record a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.290
 iso image on a cd or on a dvd a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 iso image is the container for example 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.289
 of the installer of an operating system or 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.420
 of a video game is worth to record the 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.359
 iso image we are going to need a program 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.980
 and I recommend that it is free will 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.230
 I will leave the link in the description of 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.520
 video and we're only going to give you here 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.280
 download the latest version 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.040
 and I tell you it 's free you keep it 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.540
 where you want and the installation is the same 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.420
 of simple that to download it they are 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.010
 just a couple of steps goes for 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.040
 install it we simply double 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.890
 click on the icon and we will see a 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.360
 normal installation menu here in the 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.650
 installation menu we will give to 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.950
 following 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.840
 accepted the following next agreement and 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.870
 here in the languages â€‹â€‹we are going to unmark 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.550
 everyone here and we're going to mark just our 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.730
 language so that others do not install 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.150
 in my case Spanish from Spain we are 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.670
 next install here you have to 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.680
 mark does not want to install this program 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.229
 You can even appear here at the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.980
 right so that we do not equally and we give 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.960
 following 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.090
 As you can see the installation is very 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.270
 simple and occupies very little space in the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.660
 hard drive of the program and is worth once 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.000
 installed simply now we need 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.950
 the iso image that we want to record in my 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.230
 case I'm going to record this iso image that is 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.450
 of the Linux debian operating system 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.880
 that as you can see here 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.070
 well you can not see it now here they have 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.280
 the image extension has the 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.730
 extension iso is worth then we only go 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.370
 to start the program and how can you 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.820
 see the program has a very basic menu 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.410
 that puts all the options here 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:55.640
 we are going to go to this burn image 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:58.159
 iso we mark it and we will accept 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.250
 Once here we have to get well 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:04.159
 the cd in the cd player and we are going to give 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.740
 here select the iso image that you want 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:10.910
 record we give you to explore my case I'll 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.890
 to the desk and devia we give to open and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.950
 now we have to mark good in my 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.870
 case I will mark close the disk 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.280
 verify the data and eject the disk 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.370
 after recording now simply 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.870
 let's record the album I'm going to stop it and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.450
 When I finish recording, I go back to 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.879
 put 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.849
 once the process is finished as there will be 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.590
 passed to you will go directly to you 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.569
 the CD player outside so you can see 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.220
 that has already finished and you will leave 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.959
 message like this saying that the 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.019
 recording process has finished 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.989
 correctly and that it has taken a total 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.489
 of 20 minutes in my case I say that I 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.880
 it has taken so long because it was an image 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.980
 of 4 gigabytes good you give accept and here 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.460
 you can close and you already have your cd 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.440
 Recorded 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.790
