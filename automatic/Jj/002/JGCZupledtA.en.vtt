00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 

and<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.310> movement<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.060> easy<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.930> her<00:01:10.080> and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
and that movement is easy for her and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
and that movement is easy for her and
she<00:01:10.770> fell<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.490> suppose<00:01:11.970> that's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.390> lack

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
she fell on it I suppose that's a lack

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.730

of<00:01:12.810> concentration

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of concentration

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.130 
of concentration
perhaps<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:15.060> she<00:01:15.270> concentrated<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
perhaps that she concentrated on the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.430 
perhaps that she concentrated on the
difficult<00:01:16.590> thing<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.010> then<00:01:17.250> moved<00:01:17.700> into<00:01:17.910> this

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
difficult thing and then moved into this

difficult thing and then moved into this
this<00:01:19.440> is<00:01:19.620> a<00:01:19.650> wonderful<00:01:20.310> strong<00:01:20.700> area<00:01:21.210> her

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this is a wonderful strong area her

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.469 
this is a wonderful strong area her
