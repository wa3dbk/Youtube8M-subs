00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.519
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.750
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.090
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.009
 You must travel in the car if you are traveling 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 are and they are fumbling with their shirts 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.480
 pocket around or pants pocket bring her 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.400
 phone out and hold that to your ear 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.080
 is annoying if someone says well pay well 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 I just pinch that 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.519
 but there are also points one somewhere 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.289
 it is true if you on the 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.809
 highway as experienced as some 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.290
 therefore chauffeured just because a phone on 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.710
 ear has 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.940
 I thought it was right but you can 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 on the other hand, you do that and look at it 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.329
 here have a plug versed 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.340
 that comes in the car in the 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.340
 Cigarette lighter socket into it 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.530
 and that's exactly what he's thinking of coming here 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.350
 the rhine at the other end is here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.760
 a gooseneck is called that because he 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 is just as flexible during 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.280
 Gooseneck and then at the end of 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.620
 swan house is located something 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.280
 strange at first not to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 to explain 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.290
 you can push this apart 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.570
 down here that's probably coming 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.000
 iphone owners are known before here 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.570
 I can right now a iphone 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.520
 just plug it in so and so on 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 then I press this bracket again 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 together 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.840
 really strong and now this holds 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.960
 even now I have done so it holds 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.829
 that it really happened there too 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.049
 nothing at all 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.840
 yes, that was all right now 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.329
 the whole device comes into the socket 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.920
 from the car the cigar lighter and at 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.880
 most people think so too 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.439
 really stable firm that are so built 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.659
 and or you have a great beautiful 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.399
 attitude 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:53.310
 in addition they have here now 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:55.979
 one more bush then and that one can 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.979
 because the supplied cable and use 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 can still have a navigation system or a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.840
 another mobile phone from the partner 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.619
 rider or something and connect 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.780
 charge or whatever so 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.789
 ideal part and above all they are 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.890
 can then 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.469
 keep your fingers off the phone and that 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:20.840
 saves money and points in flensburg from 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.430
 calls tel a good idea you look at 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.780
 really should look closer 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.780
 I wish you a lot of fun
