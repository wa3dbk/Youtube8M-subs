00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
to people who are obese but I don't

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.160

think the diet coke caused obesity I

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
think the diet coke caused obesity I
think<00:00:49.620> those<00:00:49.800> obese<00:00:50.219> people<00:00:50.489> went<00:00:51.000> on<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> diet

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
think those obese people went on a diet

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.090 
think those obese people went on a diet
at<00:00:51.539> one<00:00:51.690> point<00:00:51.930> switched<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.500> regular<00:00:52.590> coke

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
at one point switched from regular coke

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.910 
at one point switched from regular coke
-<00:00:53.280> Diet<00:00:53.309> Coke<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.820> then<00:00:54.230> never<00:00:55.230> lost<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
- Diet Coke and then never lost the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.189 
- Diet Coke and then never lost the
weight<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.239> why<00:00:57.600> diet<00:00:57.840> coke<00:00:58.019> was

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
weight so that's why diet coke was

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
weight so that's why diet coke was
associated<00:00:58.859> with<00:00:58.890> gaining<00:00:59.460> weight<00:00:59.609> at<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
associated with gaining weight at the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.080 
associated with gaining weight at the
end<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> day<00:01:00.890> it's<00:01:01.890> truly<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.429> can<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
end of the day it's truly a can of

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.830 
end of the day it's truly a can of
chemicals<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.250> to<00:01:05.250> me<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:05.489> decided<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.270> there

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
chemicals and to me I decided that there

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.380 
chemicals and to me I decided that there
can't<00:01:07.080> be<00:01:07.140> anything<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.210> me

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
can't be anything good about it for me

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.230 
can't be anything good about it for me
so<00:01:09.960> why<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.039> give<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.340> Diet<00:01:11.580> Coke<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.119> at
