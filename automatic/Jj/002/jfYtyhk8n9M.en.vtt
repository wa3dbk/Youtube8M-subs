useful and I think a lot of that's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.080 
useful and I think a lot of that's
misinformation<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.009> that<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.250> say<00:01:47.700> oh<00:01:47.850> the

misinformation and that they say oh the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.539 
misinformation and that they say oh the
root<00:01:48.270> has<00:01:48.509> a<00:01:48.540> lot<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:48.899> iron<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.950> don't

root has a lot of iron in it I don't

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.429 
root has a lot of iron in it I don't

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.679 
think it's that the root has a wide iron
it<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.770> helps<00:01:53.280> your<00:01:53.369> body<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.759> absorb<00:01:54.000> iron

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
it that helps your body to absorb iron

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.679 
it that helps your body to absorb iron
so<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.649> know<00:01:55.799> anybody<00:01:56.159> who's<00:01:56.340> anemic<00:01:56.939> if

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
so if you know anybody who's anemic if

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.510 
so if you know anybody who's anemic if
they're<00:01:57.930> taking<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.469> iron<00:01:58.860> supplements<00:01:59.399> and

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
they're taking like iron supplements and

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.920 
they're taking like iron supplements and
stuff<00:01:59.670> like<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.119> odds<00:02:00.299> are<00:02:00.570> those<00:02:00.780> on

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
stuff like that the odds are those on

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.389 
stuff like that the odds are those on
that<00:02:00.960> iron<00:02:01.320> someone's<00:02:01.619> just<00:02:01.829> passing<00:02:02.250> right

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
that iron someone's just passing right

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
that iron someone's just passing right
through<00:02:02.430> their<00:02:02.700> body<00:02:02.939> but<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.750> get<00:02:03.930> them

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
through their body but if you get them

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
through their body but if you get them
to<00:02:04.200> start<00:02:04.439> taking<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.490> root<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:05.969> on<00:02:06.180> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
to start taking the root of this on a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.990 
to start taking the root of this on a
regular<00:02:06.420> basis<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.459> they<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.670> take

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
regular basis that when they do take

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900 
regular basis that when they do take
iron<00:02:09.270> into<00:02:09.660> their<00:02:09.810> body<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:11.009> helps<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> bring

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
iron into their body it helps to bring

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.720 
iron into their body it helps to bring
it<00:02:12.030> into<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.360> cyst

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it into the cyst

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.940 
it into the cyst
be<00:02:12.940> absorbed<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.170> often<00:02:14.590> that's<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
be absorbed and so often that's the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.100 
be absorbed and so often that's the
problem<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.459> people<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.360> know<00:02:16.450> wake<00:02:16.690> up<00:02:16.900> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
problem is people you know wake up and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.330 
problem is people you know wake up and
start<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.379> shift<00:02:17.590> their<00:02:17.799> lives<00:02:18.010> but<00:02:18.220> they

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
start to shift their lives but they

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.009 
start to shift their lives but they
don't<00:02:18.519> go<00:02:18.670> through<00:02:18.879> a<00:02:18.909> cleansing<00:02:19.269> process<00:02:19.450> in

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
don't go through a cleansing process in

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.070 
don't go through a cleansing process in
the<00:02:20.140> mean<00:02:20.319> time<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.799> so<00:02:21.430> as<00:02:21.730> they're<00:02:22.120> doing

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
the mean time and so as they're doing

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.600 
the mean time and so as they're doing
this<00:02:23.319> good<00:02:23.560> stuff<00:02:23.860> they<00:02:24.069> have<00:02:24.220> this<00:02:24.370> like

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
this good stuff they have this like

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.580 
this good stuff they have this like
whole<00:02:24.940> coding<00:02:25.510> through<00:02:25.720> their<00:02:25.870> entire<00:02:26.170> body

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
whole coding through their entire body

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.520 
whole coding through their entire body
of<00:02:26.950> what<00:02:27.430> we<00:02:27.580> call<00:02:27.760> mucoid<00:02:28.180> plaque<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:29.049> it<00:02:29.410> can

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
of what we call mucoid plaque and it can

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.650 
of what we call mucoid plaque and it can
be<00:02:29.650> up<00:02:29.799> to<00:02:29.830> like<00:02:30.099> that<00:02:30.580> thick<00:02:31.000> through<00:02:31.510> your

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
be up to like that thick through your

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.960 
be up to like that thick through your
whole<00:02:31.900> digestive<00:02:32.110> system<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.489> you<00:02:33.549> can't<00:02:33.849> even

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
whole digestive system so you can't even

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.380 
whole digestive system so you can't even
absorb<00:02:34.530> nutrients<00:02:35.530> anymore<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.280> so<00:02:37.030> you've

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
absorb nutrients anymore and so you've

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.970 
absorb nutrients anymore and so you've
got<00:02:37.420> to<00:02:37.720> go<00:02:37.780> through<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> cleansing<00:02:38.349> in<00:02:38.739> order

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
got to go through a cleansing in order

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.309 
got to go through a cleansing in order
to<00:02:39.129> really<00:02:39.340> open<00:02:39.700> yourself<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.299> to<00:02:41.110> being

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
to really open yourself up to to being

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.259 
to really open yourself up to to being
able<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.680> absorb<00:02:41.920> nutrients<00:02:42.640> again<00:02:42.940> and

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
able to absorb nutrients again and

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.020 
able to absorb nutrients again and
there's<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.569> whole<00:02:43.720> process<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.349> that<00:02:44.849> this<00:02:45.849> can

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
there's a whole process to that this can

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.690 
there's a whole process to that this can
be<00:02:46.150> helpful<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.959> getting<00:02:47.560> my<00:02:47.709> on<00:02:47.890> can<00:02:48.579> I<00:02:48.670> just

that's not too much of an issue for you
yeah<00:03:12.549> if<00:03:12.790> it's<00:03:12.970> an<00:03:13.090> edible<00:03:13.359> plant<00:03:13.780> then<00:03:14.609> what

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
yeah if it's an edible plant then what

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.520 
yeah if it's an edible plant then what
is<00:03:15.730> if<00:03:16.329> you<00:03:16.420> haven't<00:03:16.599> been<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.959> plants<00:03:17.319> for<00:03:17.500> a

is if you haven't been to plants for a

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.240 
is if you haven't been to plants for a
future<00:03:17.560> PFA<00:03:18.489> or<00:03:19.419> amazing<00:03:20.319> resource<00:03:21.569> 77,000

plants are on there that they talk about
it<00:03:26.019> they're<00:03:26.169> a<00:03:26.200> little<00:03:26.319> coffee<00:03:26.620> overly

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
it they're a little coffee overly

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.440 
it they're a little coffee overly
cautious<00:03:27.489> because<00:03:27.849> they're<00:03:28.030> trying<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.239> cover

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
cautious because they're trying to cover

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.809 
cautious because they're trying to cover
themselves<00:03:28.690> being<00:03:29.380> sued<00:03:29.680> or<00:03:29.859> whatever<00:03:30.190> but

they're still really broad

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.550 
they're still really broad
I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:33.069> it's<00:03:33.190> an<00:03:33.310> evolutionary<00:03:33.970> thing<00:03:34.299> if

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
I think it's an evolutionary thing if

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.280 
I think it's an evolutionary thing if
you<00:03:35.560> are<00:03:35.799> have<00:03:36.310> only<00:03:36.519> been<00:03:36.849> eating<00:03:37.290> refined

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
you are have only been eating refined

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.890 
you are have only been eating refined
flour<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.919> sugars<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.730> you<00:03:40.419> know<00:03:40.540> things

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
flour and sugars and you know things

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.470 
flour and sugars and you know things
like<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.109> your<00:03:41.440> whole<00:03:41.590> life<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:43.209> kind<00:03:43.419> of

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
like that your whole life it's kind of

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.720 
like that your whole life it's kind of
really<00:03:43.720> shock<00:03:44.049> your<00:03:44.260> system<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:45.130> try<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.519> go

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
really shock your system to try to go

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.759 
really shock your system to try to go
out<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.120> start<00:03:46.359> wild<00:03:46.810> forging<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> next<00:03:47.620> day

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
out and start wild forging the next day

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.920 
out and start wild forging the next day
or<00:03:47.950> something<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:48.880> it's<00:03:49.090> an<00:03:49.180> evolutionary

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
or something so it's an evolutionary

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.599 
or something so it's an evolutionary
thing<00:03:50.230> but<00:03:50.380> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.950> can<00:03:51.099> bring<00:03:51.250> a<00:03:51.400> bond

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:51.609 
thing but you can you can bring a bond

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.729 
thing but you can you can bring a bond
bring<00:03:52.180> upon<00:03:52.419> that<00:03:52.569> evolution<00:03:53.169> in<00:03:53.319> yourself

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
bring upon that evolution in yourself

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.759 
bring upon that evolution in yourself
you<00:03:54.700> know<00:03:54.819> over<00:03:55.120> years<00:03:55.450> of<00:03:55.540> time<00:03:55.900> I<00:03:56.200> always<00:03:56.620> say

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
you know over years of time I always say

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.490 
you know over years of time I always say
that<00:03:56.950> if<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.849> give<00:03:58.000> a<00:03:58.030> month<00:03:58.419> for<00:03:58.750> every<00:03:58.870> year

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
that if you give a month for every year

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.559 
that if you give a month for every year
of<00:03:59.650> your<00:03:59.769> life<00:04:00.010> that<00:04:00.310> you<00:04:00.430> weren't<00:04:00.669> awake<00:04:01.299> to

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:01.569 
of your life that you weren't awake to

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.050 
of your life that you weren't awake to
your<00:04:01.900> digestion<00:04:02.349> and<00:04:02.680> all<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:02.980> then<00:04:03.730> like<00:04:03.940> if

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
your digestion and all that then like if

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.940 
your digestion and all that then like if
you<00:04:04.150> were<00:04:04.269> thirty<00:04:04.599> by<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.959> time<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.440> realized

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
you were thirty by the time you realized

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.650 
you were thirty by the time you realized
oh<00:04:06.310> my<00:04:06.609> gosh<00:04:06.790> I<00:04:06.970> need<00:04:07.150> to<00:04:07.180> like<00:04:07.450> pay<00:04:07.629> attention

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
oh my gosh I need to like pay attention

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.559 
oh my gosh I need to like pay attention
to<00:04:08.109> what<00:04:08.260> I<00:04:08.290> eat<00:04:08.620> then

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
to what I eat then

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.239 
to what I eat then
then<00:04:11.260> you<00:04:11.439> should<00:04:11.620> give<00:04:11.769> yourself<00:04:11.859> what

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:12.249 
then you should give yourself what

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.300 
then you should give yourself what
almost<00:04:12.670> three<00:04:12.879> years<00:04:12.909> to<00:04:13.620> transition<00:04:14.620> so<00:04:15.280> I

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
almost three years to transition so I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.099 
almost three years to transition so I
think<00:04:15.430> it's<00:04:15.639> a<00:04:15.760> it's<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:16.090> it's<00:04:16.120> a<00:04:16.449> time<00:04:16.750> thing

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
think it's a it's a it's a time thing

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.689 
think it's a it's a it's a time thing
and<00:04:17.289> really<00:04:17.500> sticking<00:04:17.979> with<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.609> not

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
and really sticking with it and not

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.249 
and really sticking with it and not
because<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.539> that's<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.840> problem<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.139> lot<00:04:20.199> of

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:20.259 
because and that's the problem a lot of

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.479 
because and that's the problem a lot of
people<00:04:20.320> wake<00:04:20.650> up<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:20.949> then<00:04:21.100> they<00:04:21.190> just<00:04:21.280> want

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
people wake up and then they just want

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.909 
people wake up and then they just want
to<00:04:21.609> like<00:04:21.729> shift<00:04:22.120> immediately<00:04:22.539> and<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.740> think

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
to like shift immediately and I think

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:25.650 
to like shift immediately and I think
it's<00:04:24.009> something<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.310> really<00:04:24.669> something

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
it's something that really something

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.390 
it's something that really something
that<00:04:25.780> takes<00:04:26.050> some<00:04:26.259> time<00:04:26.500> but<00:04:27.070> we're<00:04:27.220> all

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
that takes some time but we're all

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.150 
that takes some time but we're all
individuals<00:04:28.210> we<00:04:28.599> all<00:04:28.630> need<00:04:29.080> to<00:04:29.110> it's<00:04:30.009> a

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
individuals we all need to it's a

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.909 
individuals we all need to it's a
relationship<00:04:30.910> and<00:04:31.750> we<00:04:32.050> don't<00:04:32.560> have<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.740> lot<00:04:32.860> of

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
relationship and we don't have a lot of

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.560 
relationship and we don't have a lot of
time<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.160> do<00:04:33.280> that<00:04:33.400> today<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:33.970> just<00:04:34.479> to

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
time to do that today but just to

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.629 
time to do that today but just to
realize<00:04:34.840> that<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.889> not<00:04:35.919> just<00:04:36.430> some

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
realize that this is not just some

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.580 
realize that this is not just some
innocuous<00:04:36.970> thing<00:04:37.570> that's<00:04:37.810> hanging<00:04:38.259> out<00:04:38.349> here

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
innocuous thing that's hanging out here

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.070 
innocuous thing that's hanging out here
this<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:38.919> a<00:04:38.949> living<00:04:39.280> entity<00:04:39.610> that's<00:04:40.509> evolved

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
this is a living entity that's evolved

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.659 
this is a living entity that's evolved
with<00:04:41.259> humans<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.830> it's<00:04:41.919> been<00:04:42.099> with<00:04:42.310> humans

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
with humans so it's been with humans

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.150 
with humans so it's been with humans
forever<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.270> so<00:04:44.229> to<00:04:44.289> have<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> relationship

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
forever and so to have a relationship

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.210 
forever and so to have a relationship
with<00:04:45.340> it<00:04:45.610> to<00:04:45.970> be<00:04:46.090> able<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.889> in<00:04:47.889> a<00:04:48.009> sense

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
with it to be able to in a sense

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.249 
with it to be able to in a sense
communicate<00:04:48.820> with<00:04:49.000> it<00:04:49.150> and<00:04:49.300> be<00:04:49.389> able<00:04:49.509> to<00:04:49.720> say

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
communicate with it and be able to say

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.290 
communicate with it and be able to say
hey<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.530> need<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:51.099> for<00:04:51.310> food<00:04:51.520> I<00:04:51.759> need<00:04:51.970> you<00:04:52.090> for

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
hey I need you for food I need you for

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.570 
hey I need you for food I need you for
medicine<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:52.840> and<00:04:53.289> what<00:04:53.919> what<00:04:54.130> am<00:04:54.220> i<00:04:54.280> giving

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
medicine and and what what am i giving

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.830 
medicine and and what what am i giving
back<00:04:54.729> to<00:04:54.759> you<00:04:55.090> I'm<00:04:55.240> giving<00:04:55.360> back<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.630> you

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
back to you I'm giving back to you

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.710 
back to you I'm giving back to you
restart<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.620> doing<00:04:56.830> back<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.160> you<00:04:57.280> is

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
restart and doing back to you is

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.990 
restart and doing back to you is
recognizing<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.870> from<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.919> fold<00:05:00.190> and<00:05:00.550> in

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
recognizing you from the fold and in

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.810 
recognizing you from the fold and in
some<00:05:01.570> ways<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.440> know<00:05:02.500> helping<00:05:02.979> you<00:05:03.130> to

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
some ways and you know helping you to

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.200 
some ways and you know helping you to
live<00:05:04.030> is<00:05:04.870> something<00:05:05.349> that<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:06.460> a<00:05:06.520> mutualistic

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
live is something that is a mutualistic

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.990 
live is something that is a mutualistic
kind<00:05:07.690> of<00:05:07.810> way<00:05:07.960> of<00:05:08.110> relating<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.610> think<00:05:09.759> that

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
kind of way of relating so I think that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.189 
kind of way of relating so I think that
evolution<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.750> as<00:05:11.139> part<00:05:11.470> of<00:05:11.530> it<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.419> and<00:05:13.419> not

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
evolution is as part of it and and not

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:15.510 
evolution is as part of it and and not
everything<00:05:14.590> is<00:05:14.680> for<00:05:14.860> everybody<00:05:15.190> so<00:05:15.340> you<00:05:15.400> have

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
everything is for everybody so you have

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.659 
everything is for everybody so you have
to<00:05:15.639> kind<00:05:15.820> of<00:05:15.880> find<00:05:16.090> out<00:05:16.240> what<00:05:16.389> works
