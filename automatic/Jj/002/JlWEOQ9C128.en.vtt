it a go you don't really need too many
tools<00:01:50.040> just<00:01:50.490> two<00:01:50.700> wrenches<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:52.170> ten<00:01:53.070> millimeter

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
tools just two wrenches a ten millimeter

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.910 
tools just two wrenches a ten millimeter
an<00:01:53.909> eight<00:01:54.060> millimeter<00:01:54.380> which<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.530> course<00:01:55.619> I

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
an eight millimeter which of course I

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
an eight millimeter which of course I
don't<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.280> an<00:01:56.520> 8<00:01:56.610> millimeter<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.149> I'll<00:01:57.270> try

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
don't have an 8 millimeter so I'll try

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.520 
don't have an 8 millimeter so I'll try
using<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> socket<00:01:59.090> and<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:02.240> Philips<00:02:03.240> screwdriver

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
using a socket and a Philips screwdriver

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.010 
using a socket and a Philips screwdriver
so<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.799> should<00:02:05.490> mount<00:02:05.700> fairly<00:02:06.090> easily<00:02:06.240> let's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
so this should mount fairly easily let's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410 
so this should mount fairly easily let's
hope<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.350> anyway

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.559 

okay<00:02:11.420> so<00:02:11.480> this<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:12.019> the<00:02:12.230> finished<00:02:12.680> product

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
okay so this is the finished product

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.770 
okay so this is the finished product
which<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.690> say<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.019> completed<00:02:15.560> product<00:02:16.780> and

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
which I say the completed product and

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.570 
which I say the completed product and
the<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:18.680> thing<00:02:18.830> I<00:02:18.920> liked<00:02:19.129> about<00:02:19.280> this

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
the one thing I liked about this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.740 
the one thing I liked about this
installation<00:02:21.069> was<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.459> fact<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.790> I<00:02:23.180> did<00:02:23.599> not

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
installation was the fact that I did not

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.390 
installation was the fact that I did not
have<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:24.110> remove<00:02:24.379> the<00:02:24.590> wheel<00:02:24.769> at<00:02:25.159> all<00:02:27.400> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
have to remove the wheel at all that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.460 
have to remove the wheel at all that
plenty<00:02:28.700> of<00:02:28.849> clearance<00:02:29.180> between<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:31.190> wheel

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
plenty of clearance between the wheel

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.670 
plenty of clearance between the wheel
the<00:02:33.470> tire<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.790> fender<00:02:35.440> which<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.530> can

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the tire and the fender which I can

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.259 
the tire and the fender which I can
adjust<00:02:36.920> upward<00:02:37.400> if<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.670> really<00:02:37.970> need<00:02:38.120> to

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
adjust upward if I really need to

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.039 
adjust upward if I really need to
because<00:02:38.569> there's<00:02:38.750> plenty<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.079> room<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.440> adjust

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
because there's plenty of room to adjust

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:48.099 
because there's plenty of room to adjust
front<00:02:42.049> and<00:02:42.319> back<00:02:43.299> see<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.420> mudflat<00:02:44.930> there<00:02:47.109> so

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
front and back see the mudflat there so

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.589 
front and back see the mudflat there so
all<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.769> space<00:02:49.040> here<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.640> potential
