I<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.809> had<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:46.110> when<00:00:46.440> writing<00:00:47.039> in

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
I that you had right when writing in

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.850 
I that you had right when writing in
subject<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:48.180> something<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:49.710> going

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
subject or something so I'm just going

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.260 
subject or something so I'm just going
to<00:00:49.920> start<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.879> up<00:00:51.360> two<00:00:52.079> down<00:00:53.270> sorry

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to start from going up two down sorry

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.810 
to start from going up two down sorry
this<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> curly<00:00:55.110> paper<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.770> use<00:00:56.309> different

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this is the curly paper I use different

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.459 
this is the curly paper I use different
like<00:00:56.969> there<00:00:57.239> for<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> frame<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.230> made<00:00:58.440> it

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
like there for the frame and it made it

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.520 
like there for the frame and it made it
curl

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.630 

so<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.180> extensions<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:07.070> intend<00:01:07.369> to<00:01:07.460> see

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
so the extensions really intend to see

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.600 
so the extensions really intend to see
when<00:01:07.880> I<00:01:07.909> draw<00:01:08.210> my<00:01:08.240> letters<00:01:08.720> are<00:01:10.390> arrows<00:01:11.390> or

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
when I draw my letters are arrows or

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.130 
when I draw my letters are arrows or
these<00:01:13.610> kind<00:01:13.909> of<00:01:13.970> curl<00:01:14.720> clock<00:01:15.229> and<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:15.799> stuff

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
these kind of curl clock and this stuff

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.620 
these kind of curl clock and this stuff
another<00:01:18.140> extension<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:18.830> will<00:01:19.130> see<00:01:19.369> is<00:01:19.700> the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
another extension you will see is the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.740 
another extension you will see is the
curling<00:01:21.140> here<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.210> gives<00:01:23.360> them<00:01:23.600> more

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
curling here it just gives them more

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.680 
curling here it just gives them more
Gotham<00:01:24.259> look<00:01:24.470> or<00:01:25.390> elfish<00:01:26.390> kinda<00:01:27.310> style<00:01:28.310> and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
Gotham look or elfish kinda style and

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.760 
Gotham look or elfish kinda style and
that's<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.899> main<00:01:30.140> reason<00:01:30.200> why<00:01:30.619> I'm<00:01:30.680> doing

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
that's the main reason why I'm doing

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.710 
that's the main reason why I'm doing
this<00:01:31.009> because<00:01:31.159> I<00:01:31.490> like<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.880> sell<00:01:32.180> for<00:01:32.540> that

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
this because I like this sell for that

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.130 
this because I like this sell for that
reason<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:33.890> was<00:01:34.430> using<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:34.940> style<00:01:35.270> for<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.810> battle

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
reason I was using a style for a battle

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.180 
reason I was using a style for a battle
entry<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:38.240> tactical<00:01:38.869> styles<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:39.679> it<00:01:39.860> didn't

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
entry to tactical styles but it didn't

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.330 
entry to tactical styles but it didn't
turn<00:01:40.220> out<00:01:40.490> well<00:01:40.960> I<00:01:41.960> didn't<00:01:42.830> really<00:01:43.009> take<00:01:43.190> much

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
turn out well I didn't really take much

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.130 
turn out well I didn't really take much
time<00:01:43.640> on<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.210> I'm<00:01:44.330> not<00:01:44.479> sure<00:01:44.539> if<00:01:44.990> I'm<00:01:45.080> going

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
time on it so I'm not sure if I'm going

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.760 
time on it so I'm not sure if I'm going
to<00:01:45.289> be<00:01:45.320> joining<00:01:45.409> it<00:01:47.200> see<00:01:48.200> I<00:01:48.229> right<00:01:48.530> now<00:01:48.649> I'm

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
to be joining it see I right now I'm

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.249 
to be joining it see I right now I'm
just<00:01:48.830> doing<00:01:49.810> pretty<00:01:50.810> much<00:01:50.899> all<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
just doing pretty much all the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:54.340 
just doing pretty much all the
extensions<00:01:51.940> this<00:01:52.940> one<00:01:53.149> goes<00:01:53.600> outwards<00:01:54.080> and

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
extensions this one goes outwards and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.430 
extensions this one goes outwards and
curls<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.940> adds<00:01:56.350> length<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:58.450> variety<00:01:59.450> also

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
curls it adds length and variety also

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.380 
curls it adds length and variety also
looks<00:02:00.800> pretty<00:02:01.069> good<00:02:01.280> I<00:02:01.310> think<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.970> don't<00:02:05.149> have

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
looks pretty good I think you don't have

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.590 
looks pretty good I think you don't have
to<00:02:05.569> do<00:02:05.720> it<00:02:05.869> I<00:02:06.050> just<00:02:06.619> imagined<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.399> like<00:02:07.549> that<00:02:07.820> it

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
to do it I just imagined it like that it

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.789 
to do it I just imagined it like that it
looks<00:02:08.780> kind<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.110> born<00:02:09.440> so<00:02:10.190> I<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.429> out<00:02:10.610> of<00:02:10.759> that

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
looks kind of born so I just out of that

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.910 
looks kind of born so I just out of that
adds<00:02:12.799> a<00:02:12.980> little<00:02:13.070> more<00:02:13.220> space

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
adds a little more space

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.089 
adds a little more space
so<00:02:15.400> yeah<00:02:15.690> here<00:02:16.690> we<00:02:16.810> go<00:02:16.840> this<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.770> main

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
so yeah here we go this is the main

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:23.220 
so yeah here we go this is the main
structure<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.420> are<00:02:21.540> another<00:02:22.540> thing<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.020> add

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
structure of the are another thing I add

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.190 
structure of the are another thing I add
are<00:02:23.680> these<00:02:23.980> little<00:02:24.130> stackers<00:02:25.020> it<00:02:26.020> looks

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
are these little stackers it looks

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.250 
are these little stackers it looks
pretty<00:02:26.380> cool<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.709> think<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:28.420> add<00:02:28.690> an<00:02:28.870> extension

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
pretty cool I think to add an extension

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320 
pretty cool I think to add an extension
and<00:02:29.650> not<00:02:29.830> just<00:02:30.040> one<00:02:30.280> area<00:02:30.550> you<00:02:30.790> can<00:02:30.970> be<00:02:31.090> little

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and not just one area you can be little

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.380 
and not just one area you can be little
space<00:02:31.720> it<00:02:32.620> shows<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.100> it's<00:02:33.250> connected<00:02:33.580> but

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.030 

you<00:02:37.390> don't<00:02:37.600> have<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.780> like<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.650> said<00:02:38.860> you<00:02:39.010> can

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
you don't have to like I said you can

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.009 
you don't have to like I said you can
just<00:02:39.870> keep<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.019> close<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:42.370> I've<00:02:43.300> tend<00:02:43.720> to

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
just keep it close that I've tend to

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:47.160 
just keep it close that I've tend to
have<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.349> open<00:02:44.709> in<00:02:44.920> some<00:02:45.340> areas<00:02:45.690> not<00:02:46.690> every

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
have it open in some areas not every

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.680 
have it open in some areas not every
area<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.530> don't<00:02:47.739> want<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.980> overdose<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.790> but

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
area you don't want to overdose it but

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.210 
area you don't want to overdose it but
you<00:02:50.290> can<00:02:50.500> use<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.890> occasionally<00:02:53.220> another

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
you can use it occasionally another

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.360 
you can use it occasionally another
thing<00:02:54.489> I'm<00:02:54.640> trying<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.420> try<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.810> do<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:56.950> my

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
thing I'm trying to try to do in my

later to come videos is to stop saying

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.070 
later to come videos is to stop saying

really working out on my end so yeah I'm
doing<00:03:15.730> the<00:03:16.000> curl<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:18.400> don't<00:03:18.610> want<00:03:18.880> to<00:03:19.150> just<00:03:19.359> be

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
doing the curl you don't want to just be

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.599 
doing the curl you don't want to just be
a<00:03:19.630> curling<00:03:19.959> an<00:03:20.320> extension<00:03:21.010> leaving<00:03:21.280> out<00:03:21.400> to

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
a curling an extension leaving out to

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.780 
a curling an extension leaving out to
show<00:03:21.820> the<00:03:22.000> finish<00:03:22.329> of<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:23.519> kind<00:03:24.519> of<00:03:24.579> maze

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
show the finish of the kind of maze

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.340 
show the finish of the kind of maze
looking<00:03:25.180> thing<00:03:25.390> um

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.120 

I<00:03:30.470> had<00:03:31.010> these<00:03:31.190> little<00:03:31.340> blocks<00:03:31.730> dad<00:03:32.920> what's<00:03:33.920> it

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
I had these little blocks dad what's it

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.260 
I had these little blocks dad what's it
called<00:03:35.350> tight<00:03:36.350> extension<00:03:36.950> pretty<00:03:37.190> much<00:03:37.340> the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
called tight extension pretty much the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.860 
called tight extension pretty much the
adds<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.600> little<00:03:38.690> more<00:03:38.810> flow<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:41.630> shows

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
adds a little more flow and it shows

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.670 
adds a little more flow and it shows
that<00:03:42.080> it's<00:03:42.260> like<00:03:42.410> two<00:03:42.680> separate<00:03:44.260> items<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.620> the

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
that it's like two separate items of the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.120 
that it's like two separate items of the
letter<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:46.490> is<00:03:46.790> still<00:03:47.030> connected<00:03:47.830> if<00:03:48.830> you

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
letter but is still connected if you

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.800 
letter but is still connected if you
didn't<00:03:49.520> add<00:03:49.640> this<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.180> would<00:03:50.270> just<00:03:50.390> be<00:03:50.630> this

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
didn't add this it would just be this

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.380 
didn't add this it would just be this
thin<00:03:51.230> line<00:03:51.560> it<00:03:51.950> doesn't<00:03:52.340> really<00:03:52.430> look<00:03:52.640> good<00:03:52.850> so

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
thin line it doesn't really look good so

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.090 
thin line it doesn't really look good so
if<00:03:53.480> you<00:03:53.570> add<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.780> little<00:03:54.200> arrow<00:03:54.590> it<00:03:54.890> shows

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
if you add that little arrow it shows

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.160 
if you add that little arrow it shows
that<00:03:55.250> all<00:03:55.460> this<00:03:55.730> is<00:03:55.880> connected<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.690> a<00:03:56.750> success

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
that all this is connected to a success

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.950 
that all this is connected to a success
in<00:03:57.410> one<00:03:58.000> yeah<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.180> like<00:03:59.540> it

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.900 

yep<00:04:03.880> that's<00:04:04.880> pretty<00:04:05.210> much<00:04:05.420> they<00:04:05.660> are<00:04:06.910> very

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
yep that's pretty much they are very

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.060 
yep that's pretty much they are very
simple<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.690> an<00:04:09.020> arrow<00:04:09.260> here<00:04:09.710> for<00:04:09.980> an

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
simple and an arrow here for an

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.150 
simple and an arrow here for an
extension<00:04:10.460> more<00:04:10.940> space<00:04:11.890> overlapping<00:04:12.890> is

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
extension more space overlapping is

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.220 
extension more space overlapping is
another<00:04:13.400> good<00:04:13.610> thing<00:04:13.670> I<00:04:14.030> had<00:04:14.270> this<00:04:14.840> kind<00:04:15.110> of

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
another good thing I had this kind of

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.520 
another good thing I had this kind of
thing<00:04:15.440> over<00:04:15.740> here<00:04:15.770> too<00:04:16.390> it<00:04:17.390> can<00:04:17.870> be<00:04:18.140> connected

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
thing over here too it can be connected

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.830 
thing over here too it can be connected
to<00:04:18.950> another<00:04:19.040> letter<00:04:19.460> connectors<00:04:20.390> are<00:04:20.600> good

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
to another letter connectors are good

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.180 
to another letter connectors are good
don't<00:04:21.140> use<00:04:21.320> them<00:04:21.470> too<00:04:21.620> much<00:04:21.800> and<00:04:22.070> are

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
don't use them too much and are

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.280 
don't use them too much and are
essential<00:04:22.760> but<00:04:24.100> they<00:04:25.630> can<00:04:26.630> make<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.080> piece

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
essential but they can make the piece

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.870 
essential but they can make the piece
look<00:04:27.500> a<00:04:27.530> little<00:04:27.710> better<00:04:27.920> and<00:04:28.220> flow<00:04:28.670> better

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
look a little better and flow better

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.960 
look a little better and flow better
which<00:04:29.210> is<00:04:29.240> the<00:04:29.630> key<00:04:29.870> priority<00:04:30.500> to<00:04:31.040> drawing

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
which is the key priority to drawing

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.990 
which is the key priority to drawing
from<00:04:32.270> work<00:04:32.450> for<00:04:33.110> most<00:04:33.230> graffiti<00:04:33.740> writers<00:04:34.100> so

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
from work for most graffiti writers so

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.580 
from work for most graffiti writers so
now<00:04:35.150> I'm<00:04:35.240> just<00:04:35.330> going<00:04:35.450> to<00:04:35.570> do<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.810> shadow<00:04:36.080> or

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
now I'm just going to do the shadow or

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.950 
now I'm just going to do the shadow or
the<00:04:36.830> 3d<00:04:37.070> effect<00:04:37.390> if<00:04:38.390> you<00:04:38.510> don't<00:04:38.690> know<00:04:38.780> how<00:04:38.930> to

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
the 3d effect if you don't know how to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.750 
the 3d effect if you don't know how to
do<00:04:39.290> it<00:04:39.470> you<00:04:39.770> can<00:04:39.980> check<00:04:40.220> out<00:04:40.370> my<00:04:40.580> other
