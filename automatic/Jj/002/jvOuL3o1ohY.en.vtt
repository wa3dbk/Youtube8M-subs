00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.380
 hello to the video on the topic 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.380
 replication of the DNA at the level of lk 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:12.980
 content we discuss the question why 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.839
 where the dna replication 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.720
 we go to all enzymes involved 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:19.820
 and discuss the running of the dna 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.860
 replication 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.400
 Also, we go to the correction of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.400
 faults one 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.070
 This video wait following prescientific 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 It should already be with the cell cycle 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.230
 be familiar 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.660
 besides, you should have a good basic knowledge 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.660
 have the construction dna 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.370
 under the dna replica 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.090
 now one understands the doubling of the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.160
 entire dna of a cell 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.680
 this process takes place during the inter 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 phase of the cell cycle city again 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.910
 already has divided the 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.780
 cell cycle into the mitosis in the nucleus 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.130
 division takes place and the interphase 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.739
 more precisely, the dna finds 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:06.610
 replication during the s phase of 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.610
 interphase 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.640
 We now come to the basic principle of 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.539
 dna applications before replication 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.799
 exists that dna molecule consists of two 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.510
 complementary single strict the one 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.430
 form double strand 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.130
 this one is greatly simplified here 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 shown 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.890
 At the beginning of the replication, the individual 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.470
 strict separate from each other 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.810
 These are strict as templates for 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.720
 the synthesis of a new complementary 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.000
 Strictly the two strands of the as 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.570
 Full of borrowed matrices are strict 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.570
 called 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.820
 the newly created double stringent 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.440
 have the same credit order 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.840
 and are therefore identical 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:54.390
 by the attachment of complementary 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.390
 nucleotides creates a double strand 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.240
 this model of dna replication in 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.240
 semi conservative 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.600
 separates from the other conceivable 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.600
 conservative model in which the 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.630
 original dna molecule intact so 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.310
 conserved remains the entire film
