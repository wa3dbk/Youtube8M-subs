00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
box and let's take a look at some of the

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.900 
box and let's take a look at some of the
some<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.170> these<00:00:35.239> athearn<00:00:36.320> freight<00:00:37.320> cars<00:00:37.559> here

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.430 

i'm<00:00:41.910> guessing<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:42.540> are<00:00:42.690> probably<00:00:42.930> about<00:00:43.020> 20

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
i'm guessing these are probably about 20

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
i'm guessing these are probably about 20
to<00:00:43.559> 30<00:00:43.739> years<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.160> age<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:46.039> they're<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.190> tank

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
to 30 years in age and they're all tank

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.209 
to 30 years in age and they're all tank
cars<00:00:48.920> so<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.399> one<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.670> here<00:00:51.410> it's<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> black

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
cars so this one right here it's a black

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.459 
cars so this one right here it's a black
triple<00:00:53.940> dome<00:00:54.090> tank<00:00:54.420> car<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.930> started<00:00:55.320> working

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
triple dome tank car I started working

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.069 
triple dome tank car I started working
on<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:55.829> myself<00:00:56.280> once<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.030> got<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.050> mail

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
on this myself once I got it in the mail

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.450 
on this myself once I got it in the mail
and<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.050> kind<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.320> hard<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> put<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.829> NHO

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
and it's kind of hard to put a NHO

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.700 
and it's kind of hard to put a NHO
freight<00:01:03.270> car<00:01:03.510> together<00:01:03.660> because<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.619> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
freight car together because you have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.719 
freight car together because you have
all<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:05.090> small<00:01:06.090> parts<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.830> worry<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
all these small parts to worry about and

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.050 
all these small parts to worry about and
put<00:01:09.450> together<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.020> not<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.470> easiest<00:01:11.060> thing

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
