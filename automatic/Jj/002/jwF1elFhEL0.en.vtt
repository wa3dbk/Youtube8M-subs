00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.669
 false myths about the public spirit 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:12.440
 wild 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.919
 unpredictable and aggressive 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.570
 the dangerousness of his race is always determined by the character of his 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.659
 owner 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.609
 the american pit bull terrier 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.919
 It has a beneficial and very active nature 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.630
 given the character of its owner 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.949
 it may reflect this activity 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.390
 do not confuse 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.460
 This young ton character of the american pit bull terrier 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.750
 since it is a dog 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 where you can be totally trusted and you can leave your children even 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 around her 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.800
 jaws that are blocked when biting 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.290
 the head of the PRIISM he is long 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.920
 and powerful 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:57.989
 your jaws 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.119
 they are very strong but there is no change in blocking mechanism 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.930
 myths of this feature have edited distort the image of this 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 dog breed 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.410
 ap 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.370
 before this race it does not have advisors and life 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.060
 I know there are dogs that are aggressive 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.430
 This is due to the inadequate care and responsibility of their 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.430
 dreams 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.190
 the american pit bull terrier 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.240
 this food for the america our part 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.340
 but nevertheless 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.179
 although they share origins 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:43.179
 not even him regarding standards the selection criteria 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.570
 I explain it nowadays 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.350
 they work in the detection of narcotics in the services of 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.200
 security 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.510
 and also 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 and mostly as pets 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 confuses children with animals 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.989
 this race has a great physical power that can hurt death today 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.409
 of small animals by even other dogs 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.519
 but it's different from the behavior with humans 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.430
 the american pit bull terrier 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.780
 was raised for 155 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.590
 and manipulated for the man wants to win in the pit but loving with the family 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 ready to kill 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.379
 min products jun 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.519
 the standard the race does not specify a certain height 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.419
 but it prioritizes the harmonic construction of the body 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.129
 that's why there are dogs of very heterogeneous sizes 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 is more aggressive than other races 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:29.259
 this is not demonstrating the aggressiveness of the american pit bull terrier it depends on 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.229
 your owner 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:33.760
 not everyone has an adequate profile to have these types of races 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:36.759
 so vigorous that is what makes them dangerous 

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.339
 the race does not have any problem with aggressiveness 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.849
 All dogs can show signs of aggressiveness at some time 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.849
 that does not make them dangerous dogs 

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:11.679
 the owners cut their ears to encourage their aggressiveness 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:20.269
 percent 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:25.050
 but no 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.270
 the cut of ears is something purely aesthetic 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.970
 although the old one was amputated to avoid hemorrhages now they are something for 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.970
 improve with changing the appearance of dogs 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.460
 it is dangerous to have it as a pet
