00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 the first stitch 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.519
 they took over the first year of life 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:21.519
 stabbing in the second race 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.739
 especially osn after the newspaper didn't pass 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.130
 that is the same as with the costs 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.180
 the dispute is not yet 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.630

 and this slogan 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.290
 after even right too 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 by the ruling 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.160
 looked at 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.110
 in stabbing 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.130
 our plan 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.200
 Get on 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.320
 and cook 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.320
 Pentecost

 hoeksma 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.250
 thorn 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.300
 audience 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.440
 by the first 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.670
 these stitches 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.720
 main village fixed 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.310
 and is 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.079
 small bearing 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.079
 then the fixed 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.150
 to plug in 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.070
 dog with them 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.070

 in the curriculum 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 disagree 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.220
 this region is also widely used osn 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.070
 in a pattern 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.380
 to move to the other 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 place because 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.900
 because this stitch unfortunately gives a small first collapse in the end not very 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.900
 could see a lot 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 nevertheless it cannot show 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.429
 but at the last
