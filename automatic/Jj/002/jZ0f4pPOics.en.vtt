world because I want to show you guys
this<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:20.320> a<00:00:20.470> cannon<00:00:20.919> I<00:00:21.039> built<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.750> nothing

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
this it's a cannon I built it's nothing

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.820 
this it's a cannon I built it's nothing
fancy

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830

I'm<00:00:24.010> sure<00:00:24.300> millionaire<00:00:25.300> people<00:00:25.630> have<00:00:25.750> done

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
I'm sure millionaire people have done

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.609 
I'm sure millionaire people have done
something<00:00:26.170> similar<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.539> like<00:00:29.230> building<00:00:29.470> a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
something similar what I like building a

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.979 
something similar what I like building a
cannon<00:00:29.890> showing<00:00:30.759> you<00:00:30.849> guys<00:00:32.519> so<00:00:33.519> what<00:00:34.420> does<00:00:34.690> is

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
cannon showing you guys so what does is

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.670 
cannon showing you guys so what does is
a<00:00:35.019> hit<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.100> button<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:38.290> sends<00:00:38.470> down<00:00:38.620> a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
a hit the button and it sends down a

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.610 
a hit the button and it sends down a
redstone<00:00:39.070> signal<00:00:39.250> to<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:40.049> these<00:00:41.049> four

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
redstone signal to you these four

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.460 
redstone signal to you these four
dispensers<00:00:42.250> each<00:00:43.030> which<00:00:43.330> dispense<00:00:43.930> one<00:00:46.470> feel

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
dispensers each which dispense one feel

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.430 
dispensers each which dispense one feel
TNT<00:00:49.080> into<00:00:52.290> fuel<00:00:53.290> bet<00:00:53.500> here

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
TNT into fuel bet here

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.280 
TNT into fuel bet here
so<00:00:56.340> we've<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:56.970> total<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.480> four<00:00:58.910> field<00:00:59.910> there

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
so we've got a total of four field there

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.900 
so we've got a total of four field there
and<00:01:01.290> then<00:01:02.100> we<00:01:02.370> have<00:01:04.309> six<00:01:05.309> redstone<00:01:06.560> repeaters

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
and then we have six redstone repeaters

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.250 
and then we have six redstone repeaters
yeah<00:01:08.910> six<00:01:09.410> set<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.500> max<00:01:10.740> delay<00:01:11.869> and<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:13.050> goes

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
yeah six set to max delay and that goes

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.590 
yeah six set to max delay and that goes
into<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:14.040> redstone<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:15.740> think<00:01:17.270> what's<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> called

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
into a redstone I think what's it called

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.620 
into a redstone I think what's it called
a<00:01:18.900> comparator<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.840> what<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.990> does<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:23.630> it

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
a comparator and what this does is it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.969 
a comparator and what this does is it
basically<00:01:25.190> takes<00:01:26.190> input<00:01:27.119> from<00:01:27.150> this<00:01:28.110> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
basically takes input from this and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.249 
basically takes input from this and
because<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> switch<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.660> lets<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> go

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
because this is switch on it lets it go

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.100 
because this is switch on it lets it go
through<00:01:31.610> but<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.060> loops<00:01:33.270> back<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.810> itself

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
through but then it loops back to itself

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.010 
through but then it loops back to itself
and<00:01:34.320> creates<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.680> quick<00:01:34.920> pulse<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> lights<00:01:36.869> out

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
and creates a quick pulse so lights out

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.529 
and creates a quick pulse so lights out
five<00:01:37.229> quick<00:01:37.530> pulses<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:39.320> that<00:01:40.320> goes<00:01:40.530> to<00:01:41.539> these

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
five quick pulses and that goes to these

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:49.270 
five quick pulses and that goes to these
eight<00:01:43.080> dispensers<00:01:43.830> here<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:47.539> each<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.750> diesel

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
eight dispensers here and each of diesel

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.590 
eight dispensers here and each of diesel
put<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.430> five<00:01:50.880> TMT<00:01:52.880> except<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.149> one<00:01:54.210> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
put out five TMT except for this one I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.620 
put out five TMT except for this one I
don't<00:01:54.990> know<00:01:55.140> why<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.649> I<00:01:56.030> tried<00:01:57.030> fixing<00:01:57.300> it

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
don't know why it's I tried fixing it

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.330 
don't know why it's I tried fixing it
it's<00:01:57.780> acting<00:01:58.140> buggy<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.649> one<00:01:58.830> only<00:01:58.920> puts<00:01:59.190> out

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's acting buggy this one only puts out

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.639 
it's acting buggy this one only puts out
one<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.700> some<00:01:59.819> reason<00:02:00.090> all<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> rest<00:02:01.410> bout

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
one for some reason all the rest bout

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.580 
one for some reason all the rest bout
five<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:03.539> in<00:02:03.660> theory<00:02:03.869> it's<00:02:04.080> supposed<00:02:04.349> to<00:02:04.440> put

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
five so in theory it's supposed to put

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.930 
five so in theory it's supposed to put
out<00:02:04.709> 40<00:02:05.300> but<00:02:06.300> it's<00:02:06.479> only<00:02:06.630> putting<00:02:06.990> out<00:02:08.569> 37<00:02:10.940> ammo

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
out 40 but it's only putting out 37 ammo

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
out 40 but it's only putting out 37 ammo
TNT<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:16.099> yeah<00:02:17.099> it's<00:02:17.690> simple<00:02:18.690> design<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.319> was

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
TNT and yeah it's simple design I was

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.190 
TNT and yeah it's simple design I was
trying<00:02:20.640> to<00:02:20.670> create<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.800> almost<00:02:22.800> like<00:02:22.920> a<00:02:24.200> book

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
trying to create like almost like a book

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.410 
trying to create like almost like a book
effect

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
effect

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.410 
effect
with<00:02:28.050> just<00:02:29.010> pumping<00:02:29.490> out<00:02:29.610> TNT<00:02:30.060> really<00:02:30.420> fast

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
with just pumping out TNT really fast

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.420 
with just pumping out TNT really fast
and<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.570> could<00:02:33.780> done<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.960> huge<00:02:34.560> cannon<00:02:35.130> design

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
and I could done a huge cannon design

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.280 
and I could done a huge cannon design
but<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.700> want<00:02:35.940> something<00:02:36.150> simple<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:37.050> show<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
but I want something simple to show you

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.630 
but I want something simple to show you
guys<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:39.450> range<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.930> about<00:02:40.020> a<00:02:40.640> hundred

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
guys this range is about a hundred

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.400 
guys this range is about a hundred
blocks<00:02:41.930> long

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:53.350 

let's<00:02:46.410> give<00:02:46.830> this<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.010> fire<00:02:49.490> dumpster<00:02:50.490> fuel<00:02:50.790> TNT

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:07.430 

fires<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.620> TNT<00:03:05.130> behavior<00:03:05.670> is<00:03:06.440> always

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
fires and the TNT behavior is always

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.240 
fires and the TNT behavior is always
gonna<00:03:07.800> be<00:03:09.230> kind<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.290> random<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:10.860> this<00:03:11.010> thing

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
gonna be kind of random with this thing

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.550 
gonna be kind of random with this thing
after<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.820> fires<00:03:12.440> because<00:03:14.600> you<00:03:15.600> got<00:03:15.840> all<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
after it fires because you got all the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.610 
after it fires because you got all the
TNT<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.370> they<00:03:17.520> have<00:03:17.700> slightly<00:03:17.940> different

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
TNT and they have slightly different

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.699 
TNT and they have slightly different
exploding<00:03:19.620> times<00:03:20.750> very<00:03:21.750> close<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.260> different

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
exploding times very close but different

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.809 
exploding times very close but different
because<00:03:23.580> of<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.530> pulse

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.890 

I<00:03:30.549> just<00:03:31.549> love<00:03:31.730> watching<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.060> thing<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.239> good

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
I just love watching this thing a good

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.380 
I just love watching this thing a good
cook

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.869 

that's<00:03:38.390> collab<00:03:38.689> if<00:03:38.840> punch<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.859> for<00:03:40.760> the

00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 
that's collab if punch to it for the
