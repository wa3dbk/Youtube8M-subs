00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and it's also the reason we don't stop

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.179

carnism<00:02:36.750> blocks<00:02:37.260> our<00:02:37.560> awareness<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.460> it

internal<00:04:06.570> moral<00:04:07.490> often<00:04:08.490> unconscious

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
internal moral often unconscious

internal moral often unconscious
discomfort<00:04:10.440> I<00:04:10.970> had<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.180> maintain<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> gap<00:04:13.260> in<00:04:13.560> my

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
discomfort I had to maintain a gap in my

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.410 
discomfort I had to maintain a gap in my
consciousness<00:04:14.400> when<00:04:14.640> it<00:04:14.760> came<00:04:14.910> to<00:04:15.120> eating

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
consciousness when it came to eating

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.070 
consciousness when it came to eating
meat<00:04:15.570> as<00:04:16.100> a<00:04:17.100> young<00:04:17.430> adult<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:18.150> learned<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.810> lot

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
meat as a young adult I learned a lot

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.740 
meat as a young adult I learned a lot
about<00:04:19.320> meat<00:04:19.739> production<00:04:20.070> and<00:04:20.580> I<00:04:21.270> came<00:04:21.570> to

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
about meat production and I came to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.020 
about meat production and I came to
realize<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.680> was<00:04:22.979> unable<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.310> maintain

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
realize that I was unable to maintain

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.480 
realize that I was unable to maintain
the<00:04:24.240> psychic<00:04:24.630> numbing<00:04:24.930> necessary

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
the psychic numbing necessary

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.270 
the psychic numbing necessary
to<00:04:25.729> continue<00:04:26.150> eating<00:04:26.300> animals<00:04:27.139> I<00:04:27.280> experienced

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
to continue eating animals I experienced

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.089 
to continue eating animals I experienced
a<00:04:28.400> profound<00:04:28.910> paradigm<00:04:29.750> shift<00:04:30.110> shift<00:04:30.889> of

00:04:31.089 --> 00:04:31.099 
a profound paradigm shift shift of

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.580 
a profound paradigm shift shift of
consciousness<00:04:31.630> what<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.660> had<00:04:32.900> once<00:04:33.110> seen<00:04:33.410> as

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
consciousness what I had once seen as

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.850 
consciousness what I had once seen as
food<00:04:33.919> I<00:04:34.340> now<00:04:34.639> saw<00:04:34.970> as<00:04:35.270> a<00:04:35.330> dead<00:04:35.660> animal<00:04:35.840> well<00:04:36.830> I

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
food I now saw as a dead animal well I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.730 
food I now saw as a dead animal well I
had<00:04:37.160> never<00:04:37.400> questioned<00:04:38.090> my<00:04:38.330> food<00:04:38.810> choices<00:04:39.440> I

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
had never questioned my food choices I

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.650

now came to become conscious of the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.620 
now came to become conscious of the
decisions<00:04:42.199> about<00:04:42.470> what<00:04:42.590> I<00:04:42.800> ate<00:04:43.099> I<00:04:43.539> wanted<00:04:44.539> to

longer able to eat meat and this
awareness<00:05:48.710> gave<00:05:49.580> birth<00:05:49.969> to<00:05:50.000> my<00:05:50.479> understanding

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
awareness gave birth to my understanding

awareness gave birth to my understanding
of<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.919> invisible<00:05:52.460> system<00:05:52.880> that<00:05:53.090> I've<00:05:53.210> come

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
of the invisible system that I've come

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:56.110 
of the invisible system that I've come
to<00:05:53.599> call<00:05:53.750> carnism<00:05:54.259> my<00:05:55.219> hope<00:05:55.520> is<00:05:55.819> that<00:05:55.849> by

to call carnism my hope is that by

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.510 
to call carnism my hope is that by
understanding<00:05:56.300> the<00:05:57.289> invisible<00:05:57.860> system<00:05:58.400> of

understanding the invisible system of
carnism<00:05:59.000> people<00:05:59.900> will<00:06:00.020> be<00:06:00.139> able<00:06:00.289> to<00:06:00.530> step

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
carnism people will be able to step

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.860 
carnism people will be able to step
outside<00:06:00.979> of<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.580> system<00:06:01.969> to<00:06:02.449> make<00:06:02.630> their

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
outside of that system to make their

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.110 
outside of that system to make their
choices<00:06:03.169> more<00:06:03.590> freely<00:06:04.069> because<00:06:04.759> without

choices more freely because without

choices more freely because without
