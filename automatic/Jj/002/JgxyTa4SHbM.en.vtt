I<00:04:12.389> think<00:04:12.689> that's<00:04:12.810> so<00:04:13.019> cool<00:04:13.049> because<00:04:13.319> I<00:04:13.889> will

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
I think that's so cool because I will

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.819 
I think that's so cool because I will
have<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.220> Polaroid<00:04:14.699> camera<00:04:14.729> so<00:04:15.419> it's<00:04:15.569> like<00:04:15.829> the

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
have a Polaroid camera so it's like the

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.439 
have a Polaroid camera so it's like the
closest<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.430> can<00:04:17.669> get<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.090> then<00:04:18.209> I<00:04:18.269> have

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
closest that I can get and then I have

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.379 
closest that I can get and then I have
after<00:04:18.810> focus<00:04:19.229> which<00:04:19.650> basically<00:04:20.220> what<00:04:21.090> you<00:04:21.209> can

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
after focus which basically what you can

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.150 
after focus which basically what you can
do<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:23.039> can<00:04:23.190> take<00:04:23.370> any<00:04:23.520> picture

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
sure like I am right now and you can

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.610

focus<00:04:28.210> it<00:04:28.480> on<00:04:28.510> one<00:04:28.780> part<00:04:29.050> and<00:04:29.230> then<00:04:29.350> you<00:04:29.380> can

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
focus it on one part and then you can

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.470 
focus it on one part and then you can
make<00:04:29.740> their<00:04:29.920> breasts<00:04:30.190> like<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.640> blurry

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
but you guys get the idea it like brings

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.170 
but you guys get the idea it like brings
it<00:04:38.170> in<00:04:38.290> focus<00:04:38.560> which<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.070> really<00:04:39.460> useful<00:04:39.670> and
