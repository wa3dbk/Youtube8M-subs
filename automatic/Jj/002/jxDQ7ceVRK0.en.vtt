00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 as in an apartment as if bright bright 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.850
 light and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.809
 and then it means I'm looking looked strip 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:54.290
 here in the sky like smoke and from here 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:58.309
 something that's glowing is so reddish 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.979
 colors means and since you left and then I 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.030
 I think I should call my wife and when I 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:08.890
 became his wife explosions blew up somewhere 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:15.200
 3-4 again and under and then like this 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:18.409
 leaving this here is what the comments 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.619
 because it is over the sky if 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.170
 look now at the sky here in 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.590
 mean a lot of smoke after it 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.950
 and there it is like these are arcuate from 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.090
 haze and they is about to go out and 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.360
 to the direction here 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:40.500
 there are 3-4 things like that in the sky so how 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.500
 the light and here you see everything exploded 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
 and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.700
 standing here on 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.990
 at the crossroads and behind the house 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:12.989
 just as if some kind of ball 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:16.660
 fell to the ground here and then this train and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.970
 after a certain time of the explosion some that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.480
 all three words all already several explosions 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:28.900
 as some kind of cannonade was not clear 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:33.209
 now hard to think about what to think not 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:36.549
 You know that today, even on this 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:39.400
 asteroid numbers flew about the wreckage from 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.950
 him some kind of black 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.239
 the nearest distance is not what 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.950
 industrial it cannot be 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:51.489
 industrial explosions this is something to do with 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:54.090
 cosmos probably nothing other tattoo 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.090
 think up
