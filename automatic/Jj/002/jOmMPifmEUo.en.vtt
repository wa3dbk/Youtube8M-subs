00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
because that really isn't the objective

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.330 
because that really isn't the objective
of<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.289> anyway<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.800> begin<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.190> review

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
of them so anyway let's begin the review

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.029 
of them so anyway let's begin the review
he<00:00:56.730> has<00:00:56.969> good<00:00:57.300> pace<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.079> good<00:00:58.410> pace<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:59.010> a

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
he has good pace so good pace for a

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.610 
he has good pace so good pace for a
six-foot-tall<00:00:59.969> player<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.780> think<00:01:01.109> he's<00:01:01.230> 6<00:01:01.469> foot

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
six-foot-tall player I think he's 6 foot

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
six-foot-tall player I think he's 6 foot
1<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.190> very<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:02.850> pace<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> he<00:01:04.140> has<00:01:04.260> really

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
1 so very good pace and he has really

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.070 
1 so very good pace and he has really
good<00:01:04.949> height<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.549> what<00:01:05.820> that<00:01:05.850> means<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.600> he's

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
good height so what that means is he's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.020 
good height so what that means is he's
gonna<00:01:07.290> win<00:01:07.740> you<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> love<00:01:08.400> headers<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
gonna win you a love headers in the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.420 
gonna win you a love headers in the
penalty<00:01:09.330> area<00:01:09.530> although<00:01:10.530> his<00:01:10.770> work<00:01:11.010> rate<00:01:11.220> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
penalty area although his work rate is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
penalty area although his work rate is
medium<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.090> medium<00:01:12.210> which<00:01:12.570> is<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> very<00:01:13.140> bad

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
medium and medium which is a very bad

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
medium and medium which is a very bad
disadvantage<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.909> it's<00:01:15.240> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
disadvantage what it was it's a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.410 
disadvantage what it was it's a
disadvantage<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.500> opinion<00:01:16.740> because

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
disadvantage in my opinion because

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.609 
disadvantage in my opinion because
sometimes<00:01:18.420> he<00:01:18.570> doesn't<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.170> runs<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
sometimes he doesn't make the runs in

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.560 
sometimes he doesn't make the runs in
the<00:01:19.650> into<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.189> penalty<00:01:20.460> area<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.240> can't

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the into the penalty area so you can't

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.600 
the into the penalty area so you can't
always<00:01:21.720> rely<00:01:22.080> on<00:01:22.350> him<00:01:22.560> being<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.159> penalty

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
always rely on him being in that penalty

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.550 
always rely on him being in that penalty
area<00:01:23.700> sometimes<00:01:24.600> he<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.780> hangs<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> midfield

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
area sometimes he just hangs in midfield

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.789 
area sometimes he just hangs in midfield
so<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.580> is<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.729> big<00:01:27.090> disadvantage<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:28.110> my

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
so that is a big disadvantage in my

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.940 
so that is a big disadvantage in my
opinion<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.310> very<00:01:30.240> decent<00:01:30.720> power<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.500> his

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
opinion and very decent power so his

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.160 
opinion and very decent power so his
shop<00:01:32.189> power<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.030> deadly<00:01:33.420> in<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> 30

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
shop power is really deadly in that 30

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.859 
shop power is really deadly in that 30
yards<00:01:34.500> area<00:01:34.770> but<00:01:35.369> anything<00:01:36.060> before<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> tour

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
yards area but anything before that tour

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.499 
yards area but anything before that tour
further<00:01:37.290> out<00:01:37.530> he<00:01:37.860> won't<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.250> those<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.729> his

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
further out he won't get those in his

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289 
further out he won't get those in his
shop<00:01:39.720> our<00:01:39.930> isn't<00:01:40.409> too<00:01:40.619> great<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.119> very<00:01:42.119> good

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
shop our isn't too great so very good

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.179 
shop our isn't too great so very good
finisher<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> well<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> penalty<00:01:43.590> area<00:01:43.740> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
finisher is well in the penalty area you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
finisher is well in the penalty area you
could<00:01:44.520> definitely<00:01:44.970> rely<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.630> him<00:01:45.750> finishing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
could definitely rely on him finishing

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.370 
could definitely rely on him finishing
most<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.369> his<00:01:47.490> shots<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.000> finesse<00:01:48.840> shorts<00:01:49.229> or

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
most of his shots or finesse shorts or

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.740 
most of his shots or finesse shorts or
anything<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.950> as<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.850> finisher<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.420> think

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
anything like that as a finisher I think

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
anything like that as a finisher I think
he<00:01:51.840> should<00:01:51.990> have<00:01:52.229> even<00:01:52.649> higher<00:01:52.860> finishing

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
he should have even higher finishing

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.639 
he should have even higher finishing
because<00:01:54.090> his<00:01:54.270> finishing<00:01:54.600> seems<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.290> deadly

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
because his finishing seems very deadly

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.280 
because his finishing seems very deadly
in<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> penalty<00:01:56.430> area<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.880> also<00:01:57.299> he<00:01:57.630> has<00:01:57.780> 89

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
in that penalty area and also he has 89

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.469 
in that penalty area and also he has 89
strength<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.100> game<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.759> really<00:01:59.969> shows<00:02:00.270> on

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
strength in game and it really shows on

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.149 
strength in game and it really shows on
the<00:02:00.570> pitch<00:02:00.810> he's<00:02:01.049> holding<00:02:01.500> off<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.920> defender

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the pitch he's holding off a defender

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.480 
the pitch he's holding off a defender
such<00:02:02.610> as<00:02:02.790> Felipe<00:02:03.180> Santana<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.810> for<00:02:04.469> 19<00:02:04.890> k<00:02:05.100> for

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
such as Felipe Santana and for 19 k for

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.130 
such as Felipe Santana and for 19 k for
a<00:02:05.520> strike<00:02:05.969> at<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.210> kept<00:02:06.420> hold<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.689> Santana

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
a strike at that kept hold of Santana

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.859 
a strike at that kept hold of Santana
that<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.670> bargain<00:02:09.239> because<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.720> you

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that is a bargain because as you

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.530 
that is a bargain because as you
guys<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.099> Santana<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> very<00:02:11.910> big<00:02:12.270> problem

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
guys know Santana is a very big problem

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.309 
guys know Santana is a very big problem

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
and so is David Luiz but this guy gives

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.110 
and so is David Luiz but this guy gives
them<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.140> very<00:02:16.650> hard<00:02:16.980> time<00:02:17.249> trying<00:02:17.549> to<00:02:17.670> stop<00:02:17.939> him

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
you're coming up against him he's just

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
really good very complete other than his

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.899 
really good very complete other than his
work<00:02:27.989> rates<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.530> another<00:02:29.189> thing<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.730> his

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
work rates and another thing is his

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.179 
work rates and another thing is his
dribbling<00:02:30.389> his<00:02:30.659> dribbling<00:02:31.049> can<00:02:31.290> feel<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.680> bit

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
dribbling his dribbling can feel a bit

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.910 
dribbling his dribbling can feel a bit
stiff<00:02:32.549> in<00:02:32.760> my<00:02:32.909> opinion<00:02:33.209> he<00:02:33.420> wasn't<00:02:33.780> one<00:02:34.709> of<00:02:34.739> the

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
stiff in my opinion he wasn't one of the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.379 
stiff in my opinion he wasn't one of the
greatest<00:02:35.159> drummers<00:02:35.609> I've<00:02:35.760> tried<00:02:36.030> or<00:02:36.239> he

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:36.389 
greatest drummers I've tried or he

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:38.629 
greatest drummers I've tried or he
wasn't<00:02:36.569> really<00:02:37.170> bad<00:02:37.439> but<00:02:37.680> he<00:02:37.859> just<00:02:38.040> felt<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.400> bit

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:38.639 
wasn't really bad but he just felt a bit

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.729 
wasn't really bad but he just felt a bit
stiff<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.329> dribble<00:02:39.569> the<00:02:39.689> ball<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:40.290> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
stiff to dribble the ball with so you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.170 
stiff to dribble the ball with so you
might<00:02:40.919> have<00:02:41.069> a<00:02:41.129> hard<00:02:41.430> time<00:02:41.609> trying<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:41.969> dribble

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
might have a hard time trying to dribble

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.209 
might have a hard time trying to dribble
past<00:02:42.510> defenders<00:02:42.780> with<00:02:43.109> him<00:02:43.260> also<00:02:43.709> his<00:02:43.980> long

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:44.219 
past defenders with him also his long

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:45.740 
past defenders with him also his long
shots<00:02:44.459> aren't<00:02:44.700> that<00:02:44.849> great<00:02:44.999> like<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.419> said<00:02:45.629> his

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
shots aren't that great like I said his

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.050 
shots aren't that great like I said his
shop<00:02:45.959> power<00:02:46.169> isn't<00:02:46.739> too<00:02:47.099> bad<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:47.370> his<00:02:47.790> long

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
shop power isn't too bad but his long

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.720 
shop power isn't too bad but his long
shots<00:02:48.329> are<00:02:48.540> really<00:02:48.599> hard<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.439> get<00:02:49.620> in<00:02:49.799> like<00:02:50.519> if

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
shots are really hard to get in like if

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300 
shots are really hard to get in like if
you're<00:02:50.879> going<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> shoot<00:02:51.269> from<00:02:51.629> 40<00:02:52.500> yards<00:02:52.889> you
