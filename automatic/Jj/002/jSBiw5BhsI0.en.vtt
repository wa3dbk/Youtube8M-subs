00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
what that is so yeah it's just realized

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.630 
what that is so yeah it's just realized
the<00:01:54.090> icon<00:01:54.420> making<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:54.750> lot<00:01:54.960> more<00:01:54.990> obvious

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
the icon making a lot more obvious

they've<00:01:56.640> been<00:01:56.790> doing<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.090> for<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> while<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
they've been doing this for a while and

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.300 
they've been doing this for a while and
if<00:01:58.079> I<00:01:58.170> were<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.439> cynical<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.040> say<00:01:59.189> this

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
if I were to be cynical I would say this

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.569 
if I were to be cynical I would say this
is<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> response<00:01:59.850> to<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:00.299> mod<00:02:00.689> starting<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
is a response to like mod starting to

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.520 
is a response to like mod starting to
you<00:02:02.579> know<00:02:02.610> actually<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> more<00:02:03.990> visualize

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you know actually kind of more visualize

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.319 
you know actually kind of more visualize
things<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.729> data<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.240> you

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
things that like data that you

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.559 
things that like data that you
technically<00:02:06.810> have<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.320> game<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:09.030> maybe<00:02:09.209> right

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
technically have in game so maybe right

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.660 
technically have in game so maybe right
is<00:02:09.780> just<00:02:09.810> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.649> know<00:02:10.679> pre-empting

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
is just kind of you know pre-empting

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.520 
is just kind of you know pre-empting
that<00:02:11.790> before<00:02:12.000> mods<00:02:12.239> start<00:02:12.540> showing<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
that before mods start showing up that

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.480 
that before mods start showing up that
visualize<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:14.370> these<00:02:14.520> buffs<00:02:14.819> or<00:02:16.100> D<00:02:17.100> buffs<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
stuff like that a bit better now

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.070 
stuff like that a bit better now
something<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:20.970> suppose<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.360> can<00:02:21.480> see<00:02:21.660> some

something I suppose I can see some

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.360 
something I suppose I can see some
people<00:02:22.200> arguing<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.980> know<00:02:23.069> dumbing

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
people arguing this is you know dumbing

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.440 
people arguing this is you know dumbing
down<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.640> game<00:02:23.760> are<00:02:23.850> making<00:02:24.090> easier

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
down the game are making easier

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
down the game are making easier
something<00:02:24.690> I<00:02:24.930> don't<00:02:25.290> think<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:25.590> is<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.800> know

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
something I don't think this is you know
