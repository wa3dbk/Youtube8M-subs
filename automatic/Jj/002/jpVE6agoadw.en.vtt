back<00:03:26.440> here<00:03:26.739> which<00:03:26.950> could<00:03:27.909> possibly<00:03:28.269> be<00:03:28.420> a<00:03:28.450> fuel

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
back here which could possibly be a fuel

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:38.399 
back here which could possibly be a fuel
line<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:32.879> anyways<00:03:33.879> so<00:03:35.159> turn<00:03:36.159> it<00:03:36.280> on<00:03:37.319> put<00:03:38.319> on

choke<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:40.330> let's<00:03:41.110> see<00:03:41.230> what<00:03:41.379> she<00:03:41.470> does

00:04:33.079 --> 00:04:33.089

on<00:04:36.009> this<00:04:36.339> one<00:04:36.549> I'm<00:04:36.729> still<00:04:36.969> waiting<00:04:37.360> on<00:04:37.479> a<00:04:38.039> bolt

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
on this one I'm still waiting on a bolt

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.749 
on this one I'm still waiting on a bolt
gasket<00:04:39.669> that<00:04:39.879> goes<00:04:41.189> to<00:04:42.189> the<00:04:42.279> bottom<00:04:42.429> of<00:04:42.669> the

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
gasket that goes to the bottom of the

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.329 
gasket that goes to the bottom of the
bowl<00:04:42.939> of<00:04:43.089> the<00:04:43.179> carburetor<00:04:43.889> still<00:04:44.889> waiting<00:04:45.159> for

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:45.339 
bowl of the carburetor still waiting for

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:48.949 
bowl of the carburetor still waiting for
a<00:04:45.369> gasket<00:04:45.849> for<00:04:46.089> it

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:48.959 

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:54.029 

so<00:04:49.959> I<00:04:51.779> might<00:04:52.779> possibly<00:04:52.989> get<00:04:53.319> a<00:04:53.379> new<00:04:53.529> fuel<00:04:53.799> line

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
so I might possibly get a new fuel line

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:57.389 
so I might possibly get a new fuel line
for<00:04:54.429> it<00:04:55.319> so<00:04:56.319> I<00:04:56.379> noticed<00:04:56.679> on<00:04:56.769> the<00:04:56.889> end<00:04:57.099> it<00:04:57.309> was
