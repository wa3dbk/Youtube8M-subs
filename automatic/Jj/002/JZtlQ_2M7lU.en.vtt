00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
1985 and so you think it make a house of

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.400 
1985 and so you think it make a house of
course<00:04:05.790> as<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.630> said<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.900> acknowledge<00:04:07.290> this

course as you said you acknowledge this
in<00:04:07.530> 85<00:04:07.920> maybe<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.490> had<00:04:08.640> a<00:04:08.670> prior<00:04:09.060> I'm<00:04:09.300> sure<00:04:09.600> I

did

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.410 
did
but<00:04:10.560> that's<00:04:10.740> when<00:04:10.980> my<00:04:11.130> family<00:04:11.670> just<00:04:12.030> said<00:04:12.270> mom

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
but that's when my family just said mom

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.610

you've<00:04:12.600> got<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.840> have<00:04:12.960> something<00:04:13.290> done<00:04:13.470> about

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
you've got to have something done about

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.190 
you've got to have something done about
that<00:04:14.070> job<00:04:14.370> hopping<00:04:14.610> because<00:04:14.940> it's<00:04:15.900> annoying

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
that job hopping because it's annoying

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.170 
that job hopping because it's annoying
to<00:04:16.380> us<00:04:16.680> while<00:04:17.010> we<00:04:17.250> share<00:04:17.549> dinner<00:04:17.820> teach<00:04:18.060> each

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.750 
to us while we share dinner teach each
other<00:04:18.269> and<00:04:19.140> so<00:04:19.680> that's<00:04:19.890> when<00:04:20.130> I<00:04:20.160> formally

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
other and so that's when I formally

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.060 
other and so that's when I formally
started<00:04:21.120> trying<00:04:21.450> to<00:04:21.600> fix<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:22.019> okay<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.860> that's

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
started trying to fix it okay so that's

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.840 
started trying to fix it okay so that's
been<00:04:23.280> how<00:04:23.610> many<00:04:23.640> years<00:04:24.120> and<00:04:24.390> up<00:04:25.230> until<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.980> saw

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
been how many years and up until I saw

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.300 
been how many years and up until I saw
you<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.390> we<00:04:27.570> ultimately<00:04:27.840> have<00:04:28.830> progressed

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
you and we ultimately have progressed

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.250 
you and we ultimately have progressed
over<00:04:29.520> this<00:04:29.670> last<00:04:29.880> three<00:04:30.180> years

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
over this last three years

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.910 
over this last three years
nothing<00:04:32.010> was<00:04:32.160> improved<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:34.170> what<00:04:34.650> would<00:04:34.770> you

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
nothing was improved so what would you

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.950 
nothing was improved so what would you
tell<00:04:35.130> folks<00:04:35.490> that<00:04:36.030> have<00:04:36.300> they're<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.930> a

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
tell folks that have they're in a

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.600 
tell folks that have they're in a
position<00:04:37.140> to<00:04:37.530> evaluate<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.010> statement<00:04:38.520> not

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
position to evaluate the statement not

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.830 
position to evaluate the statement not
the<00:04:38.730> people<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.030> wrote<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.360> necessarily

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
the people that wrote it necessarily

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.350 
the people that wrote it necessarily
what<00:04:40.770> would<00:04:40.950> you<00:04:41.070> tell<00:04:41.250> them<00:04:41.460> about<00:04:41.730> making

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
what would you tell them about making

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.960 
what would you tell them about making
that<00:04:42.810> statement<00:04:43.710> as<00:04:43.950> the<00:04:44.310> standard<00:04:44.670> of<00:04:44.760> care

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that statement as the standard of care

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.080 
that statement as the standard of care
for<00:04:45.030> all<00:04:45.330> dentists<00:04:45.810> I<00:04:46.550> think<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:47.640> can't<00:04:47.910> make

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
for all dentists I think you can't make

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.790 
for all dentists I think you can't make
a<00:04:48.120> flat<00:04:48.450> statement<00:04:48.690> like<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.260> about<00:04:49.440> anyone

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
a flat statement like that about anyone

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.670 
a flat statement like that about anyone
we're<00:04:50.040> all<00:04:50.220> different<00:04:51.470> we<00:04:52.470> have<00:04:52.650> different

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
we're all different we have different

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.850 
we're all different we have different
situations<00:04:53.640> I<00:04:53.880> think<00:04:54.290> people<00:04:55.290> need<00:04:55.470> to<00:04:55.650> seek

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
situations I think people need to seek

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.490 
situations I think people need to seek
out<00:04:56.040> a<00:04:56.070> dentist<00:04:56.490> they<00:04:56.640> feel<00:04:56.820> comfortable<00:04:57.030> with

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
out a dentist they feel comfortable with

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.920 
out a dentist they feel comfortable with
one<00:04:58.500> who<00:04:58.950> they<00:04:59.880> can<00:05:00.090> agree<00:05:00.390> upon<00:05:00.660> treatment

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
one who they can agree upon treatment

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.530 
one who they can agree upon treatment
with<00:05:01.220> who<00:05:02.220> follows<00:05:02.669> their<00:05:02.910> line<00:05:03.120> of<00:05:03.300> thinking

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
with who follows their line of thinking

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.290 
with who follows their line of thinking
and<00:05:04.520> then<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:05.700> can<00:05:05.880> make<00:05:06.030> an<00:05:06.180> ultimate

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
and then they can make an ultimate

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.960 
and then they can make an ultimate
decision<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.290> don't<00:05:08.130> think<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:08.520> can<00:05:08.700> just<00:05:08.910> make

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
decision I don't think you can just make

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.310 
decision I don't think you can just make
a<00:05:09.120> flat<00:05:09.419> statement<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:10.020> applies<00:05:10.290> to

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
a flat statement that applies to

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.130 
a flat statement that applies to
everyone<00:05:10.800> so<00:05:11.490> well<00:05:11.880> if<00:05:12.060> I<00:05:12.210> understand<00:05:13.050> you

everyone so well if I understand you
correctly<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.530> feel<00:05:13.860> like<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.460> is<00:05:14.580> ultimately

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
correctly you feel like it is ultimately

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.850 
correctly you feel like it is ultimately
that<00:05:15.180> patients<00:05:15.900> are<00:05:16.020> the<00:05:16.140> people<00:05:16.530> that<00:05:16.680> make

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860 
that patients are the people that make

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.640 
that patients are the people that make
the<00:05:17.010> decisions<00:05:17.180> not<00:05:18.180> that<00:05:18.540> a<00:05:18.810> group<00:05:19.470> of

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
the decisions not that a group of

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.110 
the decisions not that a group of
dentists<00:05:20.010> telling<00:05:20.340> what<00:05:20.490> they<00:05:20.610> should<00:05:20.820> all

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
dentists telling what they should all

dentists telling what they should all
that<00:05:21.419> again<00:05:21.660> should<00:05:21.930> be<00:05:21.960> good

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
that again should be good

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.050 
that again should be good
of<00:05:22.620> course<00:05:22.950> I<00:05:23.130> would<00:05:23.280> hope<00:05:23.430> that<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:23.730> all<00:05:23.910> of

our everyday lives we make our own
