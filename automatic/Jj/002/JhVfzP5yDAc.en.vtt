 few words the work is structured 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.910
 in this way on that side e 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.190
 on the other we have the preparation where 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.120
 all the products are amalgamated 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.890
 fresh cream milk and cheese 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.479

 this process like who is being done 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.680
 very fast because having fresh radio 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.450
 of which, however, the concentrate 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.950
 Sunday must be cooled 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.360
 in a hurry not to ruin his 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.620
 property and to ensure that everything 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.800
 come 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.080
 ok 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.850
 this part that an important part the 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.860
 packaging since the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.800
 car prepared me all the infila 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.750
 of the slices she packs into 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.030
 environment protected skillfully over the 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 production lot from that lot ii 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.470
 dates all the history of the milk that is there 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.090
 inside everything is cheese 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.960
 attached in documents when it comes 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.670
 sold it 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.910
 this is because we guarantee security 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.910
 feed 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.900
 of this part are two sections 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.790
 important as I explained before 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.920
 there is the reception the control of the 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.440
 the king unload and decide from that 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.940
 part where the milk is stored though 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.590
 before arriving this we need that 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 of the laboratory to this laboratory 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.000
 what does it do a quick analysis of 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.250
 samples arriving on the cistern e 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.110
 on individual conferences from which then 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.970
 decide if there were any problems from 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.400
 pass it to the other external laboratory 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.079
 that makes the microbiological one there is the 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 however the most important part is the 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.340
 heart once from here is ok 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.349
 sent to work and then if there are 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.090
 of the small parts that can be there 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.920
 of the variables and to send to 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 check enter into specific e 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.459
 therefore daily check all the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.540
 mornings square bank to the other and does not have 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.099
 made as many checks 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.170

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.489
 standard controls that are those of the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.530
 milk after that we do those 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.720
 microbiological we can get up to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.250
 over 20 to 25 checks on all 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.250
