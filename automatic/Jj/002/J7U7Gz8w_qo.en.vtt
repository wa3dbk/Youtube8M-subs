00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
now you're going to notice that I didn't

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.370 
now you're going to notice that I didn't
make<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.280> huge<00:01:47.640> batch<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.930> was<00:01:49.049> for<00:01:49.200> two

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
make a huge batch of it that was for two

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.219 
make a huge batch of it that was for two
reasons<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.369> reason<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.970> because<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:52.110> I

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
reasons one reason is because like I

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.480 
reasons one reason is because like I
said<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.470> was<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.680> first<00:01:52.860> time<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.430> don't

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
said it was my first time and I don't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.160 
said it was my first time and I don't
want<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.820> make<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.149> big<00:01:54.540> back<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> something

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
want to make this big back to something

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.200 
want to make this big back to something
that<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.470> possibly<00:01:55.920> could<00:01:56.219> not<00:01:56.430> use<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.939> I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
that I possibly could not use because I

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.139 
that I possibly could not use because I
floss<00:01:57.649> but<00:01:58.649> there's<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.860> second<00:01:59.280> reason<00:01:59.310> it's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
floss but there's a second reason it's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.090 
floss but there's a second reason it's
because<00:02:00.299> it's<00:02:00.869> my<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.439> mixer<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.860> not<00:02:01.979> gonna

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
because it's my the mixer is not gonna

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.990

last forever and a day so as you'll see
before<00:02:06.420> at<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.719> end<00:02:06.930> I<00:02:07.200> did<00:02:07.439> include<00:02:07.740> about

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
before at the end I did include about

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.430 
before at the end I did include about
two<00:02:08.550> tiny<00:02:09.179> drops<00:02:09.569> up<00:02:09.840> by

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
two tiny drops up by

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.070 
two tiny drops up by
the<00:02:10.530> oil<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.430> vitamin<00:02:11.910> e<00:02:12.030> oil<00:02:12.210> is<00:02:12.480> proven<00:02:12.960> to

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
the oil the vitamin e oil is proven to

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.400 
the oil the vitamin e oil is proven to
be<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.260> very<00:02:13.620> good<00:02:13.940> antioxidant<00:02:15.050> so<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.080> will

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
be a very good antioxidant so it will

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.950 
be a very good antioxidant so it will
help<00:02:16.680> with<00:02:16.980> prolong<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:18.060> shelf<00:02:18.090> life<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.870> the

with mold that's just holidays so that's

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.610 
with mold that's just holidays so that's
why<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> lot<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.240> those<00:02:42.390> products<00:02:42.960> but<00:02:43.320> already

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
why a lot of those products but already

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.490 
why a lot of those products but already
has<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.950> very<00:02:44.310> good<00:02:44.610> amount<00:02:44.850> of<00:02:45.500> preservatives

has a very good amount of preservatives

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.730 
has a very good amount of preservatives
to<00:02:46.800> keep<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.060> I'm<00:02:48.150> talking<00:02:49.020> about<00:02:49.110> oil

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
to keep it but I'm talking about oil

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.470 
to keep it but I'm talking about oil
mixture<00:02:50.780> vitamin<00:02:51.780> E<00:02:51.930> oil<00:02:52.170> will<00:02:52.680> help<00:02:52.710> with

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
mixture vitamin E oil will help with

therefore<00:02:59.700> prolong<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:00.870> bit<00:03:01.050> longer

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
didn't made a small batch of it I'll use

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
didn't made a small batch of it I'll use
that<00:03:05.490> I'll<00:03:05.730> make<00:03:05.880> another<00:03:06.090> small<00:03:06.420> batch<00:03:06.690> use

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
now this is the way the top of the oil

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.930 
now this is the way the top of the oil
looks<00:03:37.020> I<00:03:37.379> wasn't<00:03:37.920> really<00:03:38.040> expecting<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.760> to

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
looks I wasn't really expecting it to

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.780 
looks I wasn't really expecting it to
look<00:03:39.120> like<00:03:39.150> this<00:03:39.660> but<00:03:40.080> yeah<00:03:40.800> that's<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.430> there

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
look like this but yeah that's it there

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.750

it's<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.180> glass<00:03:42.660> bottle<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:43.560> I<00:03:44.010> wanted<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.519> use

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
it's a glass bottle and I wanted to use

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.839 
it's a glass bottle and I wanted to use
two<00:03:45.390> drops<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.590> lavender<00:03:46.620> oil<00:03:47.250> in<00:03:47.610> the

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
two drops of the lavender oil in the

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.360 
two drops of the lavender oil in the
castor<00:03:48.239> oil<00:03:48.379> so<00:03:49.379> I<00:03:49.410> turned<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:49.980> upside<00:03:50.340> down

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
castor oil so I turned it upside down

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.420 
castor oil so I turned it upside down
and<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.720> was<00:03:51.840> able<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.170> get<00:03:52.349> one<00:03:52.860> drop<00:03:53.160> out

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and I was able to get one drop out

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.199 
and I was able to get one drop out
eventually<00:03:53.970> and<00:03:54.900> I<00:03:55.620> wanted<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.580> get<00:03:56.790> one

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
eventually and I wanted to get one

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.259 
eventually and I wanted to get one
additional<00:03:57.599> drop<00:03:58.290> out<00:03:58.560> I<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.549> having<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.940> hard

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.479 
additional drop out I was having a hard
time<00:04:00.390> getting<00:04:00.930> product<00:04:01.470> out<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.980> bottle

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
so I turned it up and then I turn it

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.300 
so I turned it up and then I turn it
completely<00:04:05.220> upside<00:04:05.610> down<00:04:06.239> again<00:04:07.010> shaking<00:04:08.010> and
