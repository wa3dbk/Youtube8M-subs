plant arrow has a 100% chance to drop a
temple<00:00:42.719> key<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.170> with<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> you'll<00:00:43.800> be<00:00:43.950> able

to<00:00:44.250> open<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.640> lizard<00:00:44.940> door<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.629> can

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to open the lizard door so that you can

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.020 
to open the lizard door so that you can
get<00:00:45.899> inside<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> temple<00:00:46.649> once<00:00:47.579> inside<00:00:47.879> you

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
get inside the temple once inside you

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
get inside the temple once inside you
should<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.210> very<00:00:48.300> cautious<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:48.989> all<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.320> traps

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
should be very cautious of all the traps

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.139 
should be very cautious of all the traps
so<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.160> recommend<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.700> use<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.879> wire

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
so I would recommend that you use a wire

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.150 
so I would recommend that you use a wire
cutter<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> can<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.590> wiring<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
cutter so you can see all the wiring and

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.500 
cutter so you can see all the wiring and
cut<00:00:53.399> them<00:00:53.550> before<00:00:53.760> getting<00:00:54.000> killed<00:00:54.210> by<00:00:54.329> them

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
cut them before getting killed by them

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.689 
cut them before getting killed by them
you<00:00:55.500> could<00:00:55.649> also<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> pickaxe<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
you could also use the pickaxe to

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.130 
you could also use the pickaxe to
destroy<00:00:56.969> all<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> pressure<00:00:57.480> plates<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:58.079> well

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
destroy all the pressure plates as well

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
destroy all the pressure plates as well
as<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.559> spike<00:00:58.770> tracks<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.579> done<00:00:59.699> in<00:00:59.850> my

as the spike tracks as I have done in my
temple<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.510> now<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:01.920> summon<00:01:02.160> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
with the frost armor which gives you

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.899

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759

you're using a higher defense armor set
then<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.219> probably<00:02:02.460> won't<00:02:02.610> need<00:02:02.790> these

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
but they aren't as necessary now since

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 
but they aren't as necessary now since
this<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.120> last<00:02:12.150> boss<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:12.930> are<00:02:13.020> a<00:02:13.050> lot<00:02:13.200> of

this is the last boss there are a lot of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
you don't have high defense like turtle

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.350 
you don't have high defense like turtle
armor<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.190> highly<00:02:17.550> recommend<00:02:17.910> using<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.240> weapon

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
armor I highly recommend using a weapon

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.000 
armor I highly recommend using a weapon
that<00:02:18.540> will<00:02:18.660> put<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:18.990> much<00:02:19.110> space<00:02:19.380> between<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that will put as much space between you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.740 
that will put as much space between you
and<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.190> golem<00:02:20.520> as<00:02:20.640> possible<00:02:21.150> since<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> will

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
and the golem as possible since it will

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.090 
and the golem as possible since it will
make<00:02:21.900> dodging<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.410> blocking<00:02:22.740> his<00:02:22.860> attacks

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
make dodging and blocking his attacks

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.030 
make dodging and blocking his attacks
much<00:02:23.340> easier<00:02:23.990> so<00:02:24.990> what<00:02:25.140> I<00:02:25.170> used<00:02:25.500> was<00:02:25.740> the<00:02:25.860> easy

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
much easier so what I used was the easy

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.710 
much easier so what I used was the easy
with<00:02:26.370> crystal<00:02:26.760> bullets<00:02:27.090> but<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.390> Mega<00:02:27.630> Shark

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
with crystal bullets but the Mega Shark

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.840 
with crystal bullets but the Mega Shark
Venus<00:02:28.290> Magnum<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.890> flamethrower<00:02:29.370> are<00:02:29.640> also

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
Venus Magnum and flamethrower are also

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.040 
Venus Magnum and flamethrower are also
very<00:02:30.180> much<00:02:30.420> viable

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
very much viable

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.500 
very much viable
just<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.320> name<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.470> few<00:02:31.560> range<00:02:31.920> weapons<00:02:32.420> but<00:02:33.420> if

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
just to name a few range weapons but if

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.730 
just to name a few range weapons but if
you<00:02:33.570> want<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.810> go<00:02:33.900> with<00:02:34.050> melee<00:02:34.440> I<00:02:34.470> would

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
you want to go with melee I would

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.470 
you want to go with melee I would
recommend<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.250> Terra<00:02:35.490> blade<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.210> shoots<00:02:36.330> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
recommend the Terra blade as it shoots a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.270 
recommend the Terra blade as it shoots a
projectile<00:02:36.570> or<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.500> could<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> vampire

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
projectile or you could use the vampire

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.040 
projectile or you could use the vampire
knives<00:02:38.490> or<00:02:38.730> testicle<00:02:39.300> or<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.720> could<00:02:39.840> also<00:02:39.960> use

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
knives or testicle or you could also use

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.870 
knives or testicle or you could also use
an<00:02:40.290> endgame<00:02:40.530> boomerang<00:02:41.130> like<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.490> paladin's

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880
