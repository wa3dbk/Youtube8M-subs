Ellis 8 string baritone tricone

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.560 
Ellis 8 string baritone tricone
resonator<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.700> the<00:00:14.700> main<00:00:14.820> differences<00:00:15.330> of

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
resonator and the main differences of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.410 
resonator and the main differences of
course<00:00:16.110> it<00:00:16.320> has<00:00:16.439> 8<00:00:16.619> strings<00:00:17.040> so<00:00:18.000> it's<00:00:18.240> actually

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
course it has 8 strings so it's actually

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.269 
course it has 8 strings so it's actually
treaded<00:00:18.900> I<00:00:19.080> trade<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.680> seven<00:00:20.040> string

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
treaded I trade it like a seven string

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.710 
treaded I trade it like a seven string
guitar<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.820> I've<00:00:20.939> got<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.650> low<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.340> a<00:00:24.500> B<00:00:25.500> a

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
guitar so I've got a low a a a B a

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.600 
guitar so I've got a low a a a B a
c-sharp<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.079> then<00:00:28.320> two<00:00:28.560> e<00:00:28.590> strings<00:00:29.189> strung<00:00:29.430> up

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:29.610 
c-sharp and then two e strings strung up

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.260 
c-sharp and then two e strings strung up
together<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.250> reason<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.640> double<00:00:32.910> up<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
together the reason we double up on the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
together the reason we double up on the
e<00:00:33.300> string<00:00:33.450> there<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.739> we<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.100> get<00:00:35.220> some

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
e string there is so we can get some

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.840 
e string there is so we can get some
cool<00:00:36.329> chorus<00:00:36.750> type<00:00:37.079> effects<00:00:37.440> happening<00:00:37.850> which

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
cool chorus type effects happening which

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.869 
cool chorus type effects happening which
which<00:00:39.660> then<00:00:39.870> turns<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:41.340> cones<00:00:41.579> they

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
which then turns the the cones they

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
which then turns the the cones they
start<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.600> resonate<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.260> sympathy<00:00:43.620> with<00:00:44.070> each

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
start to resonate in sympathy with each

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.390 
start to resonate in sympathy with each
other<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.730> we<00:00:44.940> get<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.269> sound<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.690> this

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
other so we get the sound like this

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.340 

that's<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.390> advantage<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:08.780> having<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.110> two

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
that's the advantage of having the two

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.660 
that's the advantage of having the two
strings<00:01:09.710> strung<00:01:09.950> up<00:01:10.100> next<00:01:10.340> to<00:01:10.430> each<00:01:10.520> other

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
strings strung up next to each other

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.060 
strings strung up next to each other
there<00:01:11.020> the<00:01:12.020> next<00:01:12.260> interesting<00:01:12.680> thing<00:01:13.040> about

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
there the next interesting thing about

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.800 
there the next interesting thing about
this<00:01:13.340> guitar<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.090> actually<00:01:14.210> a<00:01:14.390> baritone

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
this guitar is it's actually a baritone

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.290 
this guitar is it's actually a baritone
scale<00:01:15.170> length<00:01:15.410> which<00:01:15.590> means<00:01:15.830> it's

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
scale length which means it's

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.220 
scale length which means it's
twenty-seven<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:17.360> a<00:01:17.450> half<00:01:17.630> inches<00:01:17.900> long<00:01:17.960> as

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
twenty-seven and a half inches long as

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.700 
twenty-seven and a half inches long as
opposed<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.940> 25<00:01:19.940> on<00:01:20.150> a<00:01:20.180> standard<00:01:20.690> scale<00:01:20.900> guitar

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
opposed to 25 on a standard scale guitar

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.910 
opposed to 25 on a standard scale guitar
so<00:01:22.520> what<00:01:22.730> this<00:01:22.850> means<00:01:23.120> is<00:01:23.270> I<00:01:23.360> can<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.960> can<00:01:24.680> tune

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
so what this means is I can I can tune

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.650 
so what this means is I can I can tune
as<00:01:25.040> low<00:01:25.220> as<00:01:25.280> this<00:01:25.490> a<00:01:25.670> string<00:01:26.000> here<00:01:26.240> which<00:01:26.360> is<00:01:26.510> as

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
as low as this a string here which is as

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.190 
as low as this a string here which is as
low<00:01:26.690> as<00:01:26.870> the<00:01:27.260> a<00:01:27.500> string<00:01:27.890> on<00:01:28.010> a<00:01:28.040> bass<00:01:28.250> guitar<00:01:28.610> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
low as the a string on a bass guitar and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.900 
low as the a string on a bass guitar and
it'll<00:01:30.200> snap<00:01:30.380> back<00:01:30.620> really<00:01:30.920> nicely<00:01:31.160> if<00:01:31.700> this

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
it'll snap back really nicely if this

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.790 
it'll snap back really nicely if this
was<00:01:32.120> a<00:01:32.150> shorter<00:01:32.510> scale<00:01:32.780> length<00:01:33.020> that<00:01:33.560> would<00:01:33.650> be

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
was a shorter scale length that would be

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.880 
was a shorter scale length that would be
flopping<00:01:34.100> around<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.400> bit<00:01:34.520> more<00:01:34.730> so<00:01:35.650> what<00:01:36.650> I<00:01:36.680> can

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
flopping around a bit more so what I can

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.620 
flopping around a bit more so what I can
do<00:01:37.010> with<00:01:37.160> this<00:01:37.250> is<00:01:37.460> treat<00:01:37.760> this<00:01:37.940> guitar<00:01:38.270> as<00:01:38.420> two

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
do with this is treat this guitar as two

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.570 
do with this is treat this guitar as two
guitars<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:39.410> I<00:01:39.620> can<00:01:40.100> have<00:01:40.250> my<00:01:40.370> bass

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
guitars in one I can have my bass

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.480 
guitars in one I can have my bass
strings<00:01:40.910> here<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:42.220> normal<00:01:43.220> strings<00:01:43.490> up<00:01:43.610> here

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
strings here and normal strings up here

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.860 
strings here and normal strings up here
so<00:01:46.490> when<00:01:46.729> I'm<00:01:46.820> using<00:01:46.850> it<00:01:47.180> as<00:01:47.240> a<00:01:47.300> bass<00:01:47.479> guitar<00:01:47.840> I

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
so when I'm using it as a bass guitar I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:02:00.010 
so when I'm using it as a bass guitar I
can<00:01:47.960> do<00:01:48.170> things<00:01:48.350> like<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:58.570> it<00:01:59.570> sounds<00:01:59.870> like<00:01:59.990> a

so<00:03:09.989> that's<00:03:10.170> a<00:03:10.379> quick<00:03:11.480> demonstration<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.989> how

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
so that's a quick demonstration of how

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.830 
so that's a quick demonstration of how
our<00:03:14.190> guitar<00:03:14.459> such<00:03:14.700> as<00:03:14.849> this<00:03:15.060> by<00:03:15.299> just<00:03:15.360> stepping

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
our guitar such as this by just stepping

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.449 
our guitar such as this by just stepping
outside<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.290> boundaries<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:16.860> using<00:03:17.159> a<00:03:17.220> few

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
outside the boundaries and using a few

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.759 
outside the boundaries and using a few
different<00:03:18.450> tools<00:03:18.599> such<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.140> stomp<00:03:19.379> box<00:03:19.590> it

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
different tools such as the stomp box it

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.979 
different tools such as the stomp box it
can<00:03:19.920> now<00:03:20.099> it<00:03:21.090> can<00:03:21.269> really<00:03:21.480> expand<00:03:21.930> your

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
can now it can really expand your

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.220 
can now it can really expand your
playing<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.530> what<00:03:22.650> I'll<00:03:22.769> do<00:03:23.010> now<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:24.200> put<00:03:25.200> a

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
playing so what I'll do now is put a

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.860 
playing so what I'll do now is put a
capo<00:03:25.650> on<00:03:25.830> this<00:03:25.980> guitar<00:03:26.209> because<00:03:27.209> it<00:03:27.330> was<00:03:27.420> was

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
capo on this guitar because it was was

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.420 
capo on this guitar because it was was
actually<00:03:28.110> initially<00:03:28.319> inspired<00:03:28.650> by<00:03:29.040> a<00:03:29.069> harp

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
actually initially inspired by a harp

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.910 
actually initially inspired by a harp
guitar<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.690> what<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.049> do<00:03:31.170> is<00:03:31.290> put<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.470> capo

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.390 

so<00:03:52.700> by<00:03:52.880> doing<00:03:53.210> that<00:03:53.360> I've<00:03:53.680> basically<00:03:54.680> changed

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
so by doing that I've basically changed

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.250 
so by doing that I've basically changed
this<00:03:55.520> into<00:03:55.880> a<00:03:55.910> it's<00:03:56.600> almost<00:03:56.720> like<00:03:56.960> a<00:03:56.990> tenor

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
this into a it's almost like a tenor

this into a it's almost like a tenor
guitar<00:03:57.350> now<00:03:57.800> instead<00:03:58.100> of<00:03:58.160> baritone<00:03:58.760> up<00:03:59.630> there

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
guitar now instead of baritone up there

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.680 
guitar now instead of baritone up there
and<00:04:01.250> now<00:04:01.430> I've<00:04:01.520> got<00:04:01.640> a<00:04:01.670> low<00:04:01.880> bass<00:04:02.360> string<00:04:02.570> as

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
and now I've got a low bass string as

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.860 
and now I've got a low bass string as
well<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.770> if<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:03.890> take<00:04:04.040> my<00:04:04.100> slide<00:04:04.520> off<00:04:04.730> we<00:04:05.720> can

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
well so if I take my slide off we can

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:06.670 
well so if I take my slide off we can
start<00:04:06.110> to<00:04:06.200> get<00:04:06.320> some<00:04:06.440> interesting

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
start to get some interesting

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.940 
start to get some interesting
possibilities

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
possibilities
