00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.009
 now the cloud name does not 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.480
 continues he is in the casting the 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.780
 casting his 10 years and Kurds 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.730
 we absolutely need to have the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.070
 minimum of friction so we use 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.000
 it is not as small as possible 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.910
 we can use 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
 if they are well done fishing I 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.890
 take my son in 60 hundredths and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.480
 always and I well not burn it 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.740
 but bring very close to the flame 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 once his little balls form I 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.079
 come from a veneer on the lighter that makes 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.660
 a small dish just wait three 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.719
 seconds that it offers to 10 and there I 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.930
 come on the wire of the reel he 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.020
 be aware that for those only need 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.610
 the snatch is the double in diameter of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.210
 son of the reel so if I had to 30 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:57.350
 hundredths winding I need 60 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:01:02.930
 hundredths in tearing off here I come to do 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 a loop I just pinch and I come 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:15.150
 turn in the loop that I'm going to the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.450
 do it at least this time it's a 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.450
 minimum 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:36.890
 of a minimum will be here and here I have more 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.890
 to come and shake this knot 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:51.670
 and to come the haras coupe this is what 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.660
 it gives it's true that we are very 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.880
 small but the problem if it is badly done 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.000
 and when we shoot very hard on it 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.830
 he's going to break at the knot if he's fine 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.060
 does not break longer will have two rounds 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.500
 in the loop 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.500
 the better he will finish
