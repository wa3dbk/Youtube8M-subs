not<00:00:38.530> really<00:00:38.710> a<00:00:38.740> topic<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.220> such<00:00:39.400> residue<00:00:39.820> but

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
not really a topic of such residue but

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.590 
not really a topic of such residue but
I'm<00:00:41.830> just<00:00:42.040> testing<00:00:42.160> out<00:00:42.370> a<00:00:42.430> new<00:00:42.490> camera<00:00:42.850> BOTS

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.180 

I<00:00:45.690> suppose<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.739> probably<00:00:46.949> see<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I suppose you can probably see a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.830 
I suppose you can probably see a
difference<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> really

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
difference a really

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.200 
difference a really
I'd<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.500> think<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.940> particular<00:00:50.940> camera

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
I'd you think this particular camera

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.830

that<00:00:51.570> I've<00:00:51.690> got

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.110 

it's<00:00:55.470> actually<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.740> lot<00:00:55.830> sharper<00:00:56.040> than<00:00:56.400> my

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
it's actually a lot sharper than my

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.320 
it's actually a lot sharper than my
previous<00:00:57.330> one<00:00:57.660> which<00:00:57.930> was<00:00:58.140> unbranded<00:00:59.240> but<00:01:00.240> it

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
previous one which was unbranded but it

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.009 
previous one which was unbranded but it

was a really monstrous camera when he

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.130 
was a really monstrous camera when he
saw<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.440> pleasure<00:01:04.650> as<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:06.140> bit

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
seems to work quite well because the one

can<00:02:55.910> actually<00:02:56.180> rotate<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.600> lens<00:02:56.780> around<00:02:57.020> so

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
can actually rotate the lens around so

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.990 
can actually rotate the lens around so
that<00:02:57.260> if<00:02:57.500> your<00:02:57.650> horizon<00:02:58.130> isn't<00:02:58.670> straight<00:02:58.880> and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
that if your horizon isn't straight and

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.880 
that if your horizon isn't straight and
we<00:02:59.060> look<00:02:59.180> me<00:02:59.270> a<00:02:59.330> little<00:02:59.420> bit<00:02:59.570> wonky<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.740> can

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
we look me a little bit wonky you can

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.880 
we look me a little bit wonky you can
actually<00:03:02.170> adjust<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.470> to<00:03:03.530> your<00:03:03.709> heart's

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
actually adjust that to your heart's

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.420 
actually adjust that to your heart's
content<00:03:04.010> with<00:03:04.400> the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
content with the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.000 
content with the
adjustable<00:03:06.269> lens<00:03:06.450> for<00:03:06.959> this<00:03:07.079> one<00:03:07.230> hasn't<00:03:07.829> got

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
adjustable lens for this one hasn't got

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.280 
adjustable lens for this one hasn't got
there<00:03:08.159> so<00:03:08.780> there<00:03:09.780> might<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.049> reason<00:03:10.079> why

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
there so there might be a reason why

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.160 
there so there might be a reason why
it's<00:03:10.469> a<00:03:10.500> little<00:03:10.680> bit<00:03:10.769> cheaper<00:03:12.170> although

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
it's a little bit cheaper although

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.539 
it's a little bit cheaper although
price-wise<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.420> had<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> little<00:03:15.629> look<00:03:15.750> on<00:03:15.900> amazon

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
price-wise I had a little look on amazon

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.770 
price-wise I had a little look on amazon
and<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.640> seemed<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.819> be<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.150> cheapest<00:03:18.629> place

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
and that seemed to be the cheapest place

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.920 
and that seemed to be the cheapest place

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.070 

which<00:06:19.970> is<00:06:20.090> okay<00:06:20.210> but<00:06:20.479> of<00:06:20.720> course<00:06:20.870> you<00:06:20.930> never

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
which is okay but of course you never

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.350 
which is okay but of course you never
get<00:06:21.290> some<00:06:21.500> sort<00:06:22.370> of<00:06:22.400> barreled<00:06:22.729> in<00:06:22.850> effect<00:06:23.180> on

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 
get some sort of barreled in effect on

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.180 
get some sort of barreled in effect on
them<00:06:23.570> on<00:06:24.290> the<00:06:24.440> lens<00:06:24.560> it's<00:06:24.770> going<00:06:24.889> to<00:06:24.949> be<00:06:25.010> quite

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
them on the lens it's going to be quite

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.760 
them on the lens it's going to be quite
distorted<00:06:25.669> the<00:06:26.030> edge<00:06:26.150> of<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.560> edge<00:06:27.560> of<00:06:27.650> the

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:29.500 
distorted the edge of the edge of the
screen<00:06:27.949> so<00:06:28.250> that's<00:06:28.669> not<00:06:28.760> really<00:06:28.910> my<00:06:29.120> thing<00:06:29.150> I

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510
