00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
seriously if you do like the series but

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.240 
seriously if you do like the series but
you<00:05:04.930> know<00:05:05.020> this<00:05:05.199> is<00:05:05.349> for<00:05:05.560> games<00:05:05.800> it's

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
you know this is for games it's

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.620 
you know this is for games it's
something<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.729> I<00:05:06.759> enjoy<00:05:07.120> doing<00:05:07.150> it's

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
something that I enjoy doing it's

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.790 
something that I enjoy doing it's
something<00:05:07.720> that<00:05:07.990> doesn't<00:05:08.410> take<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.740> long

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
something that doesn't take that long

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.240 
something that doesn't take that long
and<00:05:09.810> so<00:05:10.810> hopefully<00:05:11.560> you<00:05:11.800> know<00:05:11.830> hopefully<00:05:12.039> the

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
and so hopefully you know hopefully the

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.950 
and so hopefully you know hopefully the
series<00:05:12.490> will<00:05:12.610> go<00:05:12.699> over<00:05:12.880> pretty<00:05:13.000> well<00:05:13.120> here<00:05:13.509> but

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
series will go over pretty well here but

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.790 
series will go over pretty well here but
I<00:05:14.250> this<00:05:15.250> guy<00:05:15.690> pretty<00:05:16.690> decent<00:05:17.110> side<00:05:17.259> three<00:05:17.650> back

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
I this guy pretty decent side three back

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.140 
I this guy pretty decent side three back
he<00:05:17.949> was<00:05:18.039> far<00:05:18.250> tougher<00:05:18.460> to<00:05:18.610> break<00:05:18.789> down<00:05:18.940> than<00:05:19.090> I

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
he was far tougher to break down than I

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.520 
he was far tougher to break down than I
thought<00:05:19.300> he<00:05:19.419> would<00:05:19.449> be<00:05:19.630> but<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.930> triple<00:05:20.349> tap

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
thought he would be but the triple tap

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.960 
thought he would be but the triple tap
cross<00:05:20.860> when<00:05:21.099> you<00:05:21.190> can<00:05:21.340> get<00:05:21.460> all<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.849> way<00:05:21.940> to

right<00:05:24.159> back's<00:05:24.370> name<00:05:24.610> is<00:05:24.759> right<00:05:24.940> now<00:05:25.060> but<00:05:25.210> he

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
right back's name is right now but he

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.210 
right back's name is right now but he
has<00:05:25.449> he's<00:05:25.990> made<00:05:26.199> some<00:05:26.380> big<00:05:26.620> plays<00:05:26.830> for<00:05:27.130> me

has he's made some big plays for me

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.100 
has he's made some big plays for me
moving<00:05:27.430> you<00:05:27.909> know<00:05:27.940> moving<00:05:28.300> up<00:05:28.569> the<00:05:28.750> pitch<00:05:28.930> and

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
moving you know moving up the pitch and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.360 
moving you know moving up the pitch and
all<00:05:29.199> offensively<00:05:29.590> he's<00:05:29.740> a<00:05:29.770> great<00:05:30.039> player<00:05:30.280> and

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
all offensively he's a great player and

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.999 
all offensively he's a great player and
this<00:05:30.460> is<00:05:30.610> a<00:05:30.639> brilliant<00:05:31.060> cross<00:05:31.740> that's<00:05:32.740> not<00:05:32.889> my

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:33.009 
this is a brilliant cross that's not my

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.230 
this is a brilliant cross that's not my
right<00:05:33.159> but<00:05:33.310> I<00:05:33.340> think<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.699> was<00:05:33.789> Taylor<00:05:34.090> but

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
right but I think that was Taylor but

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.700 
right but I think that was Taylor but
Taylor's<00:05:34.509> gonna<00:05:34.659> outpace<00:05:35.080> song<00:05:35.349> every<00:05:35.680> time

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
Taylor's gonna outpace song every time

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.350 
Taylor's gonna outpace song every time
those<00:05:36.099> two<00:05:36.159> guys<00:05:36.460> on<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:36.669> right<00:05:36.849> side<00:05:37.090> are

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
those two guys on the right side are

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.680 
those two guys on the right side are
quite<00:05:37.870> good<00:05:38.080> but<00:05:38.500> that's<00:05:38.650> how<00:05:38.800> that<00:05:39.070> one<00:05:39.250> ended

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
quite good but that's how that one ended

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.510 
quite good but that's how that one ended
1-0<00:05:40.690> on<00:05:40.900> a<00:05:40.930> brilliant<00:05:41.530> triple<00:05:41.800> tap<00:05:41.919> cross<00:05:42.250> all

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the way across you know to face a goal

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
shooting is totally deceptive just

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.450 
shooting is totally deceptive just
ignore<00:05:48.940> it<00:05:48.969> because<00:05:49.150> it's<00:05:49.330> not<00:05:49.479> a<00:05:49.539> real<00:05:49.659> stat

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460

but we head on into the finals here
finally<00:05:54.460> I<00:05:54.490> guess<00:05:54.729> and<00:05:55.500> eventually<00:05:56.500> I<00:05:56.530> think

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
finally I guess and eventually I think

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.860 
finally I guess and eventually I think
it<00:05:57.219> took<00:05:57.520> forever<00:05:57.789> to<00:05:58.120> match<00:05:58.270> up<00:05:58.479> with<00:05:58.599> someone

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
it took forever to match up with someone

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.540 
it took forever to match up with someone
last<00:05:59.110> night<00:05:59.229> I<00:05:59.500> don't<00:05:59.919> know<00:05:59.979> why<00:06:00.130> I<00:06:00.159> was<00:06:00.280> taking

last night I don't know why I was taking

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.070 
last night I don't know why I was taking
so<00:06:00.669> long<00:06:00.699> but<00:06:00.880> we<00:06:01.030> eventually<00:06:01.150> match<00:06:01.719> up<00:06:01.930> with

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
so long but we eventually match up with
