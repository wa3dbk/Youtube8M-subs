open<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:10.080> up<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.830> slide<00:01:11.130> them<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
open these up as you slide them so you

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
open these up as you slide them so you
can<00:01:12.689> put<00:01:12.900> maybe<00:01:13.140> your<00:01:13.320> chlorines<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.040> damage

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
can put maybe your chlorines or damage

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.920 
can put maybe your chlorines or damage
counters<00:01:14.880> here<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.170> inside<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.159> two<00:01:17.430> packs

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
counters here and inside just two packs

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
counters here and inside just two packs
both<00:01:18.930> primal<00:01:19.680> clash<00:01:20.659> and<00:01:21.659> I'll<00:01:21.960> put<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.619> deck

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
both primal clash and I'll put this deck

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.740 
both primal clash and I'll put this deck
shield<00:01:23.880> back<00:01:24.119> together<00:01:25.220> and<00:01:26.220> show<00:01:27.150> both<00:01:27.420> packs

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
shield back together and show both packs

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.960 
shield back together and show both packs
I<00:01:28.220> should<00:01:29.220> spread<00:01:29.430> them<00:01:29.579> out<00:01:29.610> a<00:01:29.670> little<00:01:29.850> bit

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
I should spread them out a little bit

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.330 
I should spread them out a little bit
mega<00:01:30.689> Gardevoir<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.560> I've<00:01:31.740> had<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.070> best
