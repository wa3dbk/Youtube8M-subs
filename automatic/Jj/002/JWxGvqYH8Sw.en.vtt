00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.610
 most manufacturers send a review 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.860
 copies to us so that we can 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.420
 could then test but apple would 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.340
 apple if they are just that 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.470
 otherwise doing at apple there may stuff 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.900
 namely you could pick it yourself so you 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.090
 device and any new functions 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.110
 right to demonstrate as though 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.150
 were late for the two 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.850
 pick up the latest ipads with the rhine 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.320
 time spent on the apple ipad air 2 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.419
 but why actually a lot is done 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.219
 with this ipad mini 3 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.020
 simply doesn't fall that much either 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.969
 to tell about it 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.249
 because we submit the specification list of 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.989
 this mini 3 in addition to that of the mini 2 de 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.190
 predecessor of this device 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.980
 yes we will see a lot 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.460
 same dimensions themselves 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.489
 thickness 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.530
 same weight the same 7.9 in ten 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.059
 screen but also on the inside 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.510
 remained much the same 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.489
 same a 7 64-bit processor same 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.499
 same 5 megapixel to the main memory 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.649
 camera on the back and the same income 2 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:06.020
 megapixel camera for on well I hear you 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.240
 already thinking what is different then 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.280
 this mini 3 differs from a total of three 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.750
 parts of its predecessor 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.850
 First of all , that is the color because this too 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.080
 small ipad is available nowadays 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.670
 in gold 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.620
 there is also a fingerprint scanner 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.270
 added to that makes me a fan 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.080
 from since been introduced at the 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 iphone 5s 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.830
 but now 100 euros more for that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.940
 fingerprint scanner and possibly the 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.230
 pay gold color 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.270
 I personally would not for that either 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.160
 and that is point three 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.870
 he costs 100 euros more than the 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.880
 ipad mini 2 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.530
 then this ipad mini 3 so awful lot 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.940
 resembles its predecessor 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.370
 incidentally does not immediately make this one 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.840
 bad device is also this little ipad 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.830
 is perhaps the nicest little one 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.020
 tablet on the market 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.430
 the retina screen looks rather beautiful 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.590
 it is clear and sharp one has 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.390
 very good viewing angle and thanks to the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 a7 processor there is also just a lot 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.600
 strength in laying was next to the new 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.100
 ipad air 2 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.720
 and launch an application on the corner 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.730
 yes, that great temple often does that 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.660
 just a bit faster but the differences are 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.580
 small 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.080
 in short , you can also use this ipad mini 3 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.360
 just in a lot of need 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.230
 also provided for your law actually 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.420
 again a great guarantee 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.099
 user experience and already exists of 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.560
 everything pre-installed on this device 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.870
 pagers for your keynote text files 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.720
 for presentations and are in Grasse 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.830
 can you enjoy your musical moment 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.830
 life how did that want of course 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.360
 thanks to its great entertainment you are too 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.400
 really an ideal travel companion and thanks 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.420
 them the or a new feature that allows the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.310
 synergy between the different 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.570
 apple products is getting better 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.400
 For example, you can type an email at 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.350
 your macbook but then on to it 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.210
 work on the ipad mini because you like that 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.410
 for example just want to do in the bank and 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.750
 I open on my iphone 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.430
 now a page but I want it on one 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.150
 large screen for example see this ipad 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.560
 mini 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.570
 that is also possible through them de or whole 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.190
 happen easily 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.930
 and so I can easily go there that way 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.010
 continue working 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.480
 the device is of course fine 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.440
 suitable for a little browsing one 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.020
 play games 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.430
 watch a movie or some facetimen 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.890
 and on a full battery you can do it too 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.810
 another day in a row 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.550
 did you want previous to the most powerful ipad 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.709
 who was the then you had the choice of the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.150
 ipad air and the ipad mini 2 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.070
 because despite that, those two differ in 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.480
 they were just as powerful in size 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.010
 equipped 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.120
 Do you want the best of the best this year? 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.440
 on ipad area 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.350
 and then you are actually sentenced to 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.970
 the larger ipad air 2 that is not only 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.709
 faster than this device but also one 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.230
 anti-reflective coating on the screen 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.300
 and is incredibly thin 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.620
 do you necessarily want an ipad mini yes choose 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.780
 about the ipad mini 2 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.370
 that compared to this ipad mini 3 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.050
 illuminates the fingerprint scanner is missing 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.480
 but therefore just 100 euros 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.890
 this ipad mini 3 is cheaper for your score 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.420
 therefore especially poor on price 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.430
 quality ratio and that attracts the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.430
 score down to three and half stars
