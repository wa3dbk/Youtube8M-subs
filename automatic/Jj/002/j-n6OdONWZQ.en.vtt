00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.099
 he is welcome at first if I am 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.839
 am back with soft me has a 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.250
 question reached about my dancers 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.170
 I have to improve myself 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.350
 a two month break for one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.699
 decided renewed creatine chur I 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.470
 but I'm traveling a lot and one 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.390
 in powder form for me as 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.849
 extremely cumbersome 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.230
 me for creativity in capsule form 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.270
 decided 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.590
 it is actually about this question 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.480
 a dosage recommendation and one 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 Take recommendation when and how and where 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.290
 Anyway, that's really an issue 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.760
 for another video because there is 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 meanwhile quite already 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 new things and people creatine because 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 maybe try before training 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.199
 There is a study that says 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.730
 creative is stable at 90 percent since 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.190
 is there any other study that says this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.390
 90% unstable most of them so that 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.010
 you look at it from behind who has the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.020
 funded study and then you know 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.480
 why the study has which result 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.150
 That's why I keep my income 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.560
 recommendation mostly but long talk 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.570
 short sense I want here from this 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.200
 ask a bit different and that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 it was about the topic creatine 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.090
 capsules 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.710
 I know that it was written here 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 human beings have it easy for me 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.150
 not as favorable as I proved 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.180
 just can not do it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.570
 but I still want to be on with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.470
 give away what you should consider 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.509
 when you creatively isolate themselves anschafft 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.229
 and we just look at each other now 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:41.520
 times the comparison at the kreher polikum 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:45.570
 from alex we have on the one hand the dose 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.090
 for the 18 90 we are still watching and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.210
 once we have the small dose encapsulate 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.790
 for 14 90 you may already see it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.240
 what I want out there so we have 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.939
 So in the powder dose 7 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.860
 50 grams contain a very large dose 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.110
 relatively big for a creative break 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.990
 creative usually 500 grams 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.490
 but here is a maximum of 50 man me 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.979
 I think you have to change that 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.290
 All Max Baumann wants 500 on it 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.900
 but the future must be lowered 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:20.660
 be with the capsules we have just 130 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.599
 capsules are 09 28 degrees 928 milligrams 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.120
 in there that's 21 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:28.850
 so and now is exactly the point on the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.459
 I also want to pay at the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:40.850
 Creative for powder 25 euro 20 per kilo 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:45.709
 and with the capsules 123 euro 14 per kilo 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:48.709
 that is five times as expensive 48 x 488 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.350
 times so expensive for and I want that 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.349
 Now say again 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.170
 for a small dose and in the end 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:59.989
 the same content except that a few 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.170
 gelatin capsules are outside so well 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.780
 Please think carefully 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.570
 calculate it as well with yours 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.730
 Creatine capsules if you use them 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.200
 often do not have the powder of the same 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.970
 Manufacturer and it is now as I said 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.700
 just an exemplary example with 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.709
 a max if not your manufacturer exactly 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.829
 the same thing but clean 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:26.290
 the gelatine and the small tin with the 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:26.290
 pay five times the price
