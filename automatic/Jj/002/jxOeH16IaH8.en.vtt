00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:04.473
Hi Bananas

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:09.212
Today we're going to learn about the 15th letter of the alphabet

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:12.316
Do you know what letter it is?

00:00:12.316 --> 00:00:14.985
The letter O

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:19.156
This is a capital O

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:23.159
and this is a lowercase o

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.797
Hey, the letter O looks like a circle

00:00:27.797 --> 00:00:34.603
O makes the sound o o o

00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:38.018
like Olives

00:00:38.018 --> 00:00:41.312
and October

00:00:41.312 --> 00:00:44.269
October is when we have Halloween

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:47.684
I love October

00:00:47.684 --> 00:00:52.622
I can think of four animals that start with the letter O

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:58.018
Two land animals and two water animals

00:00:58.018 --> 00:01:04.518
The two land animals are Ostrich and Ox

00:01:04.518 --> 00:01:08.639
Ostrich and Ox both start with the letter O

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.683
An Ostrich has a really long neck

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:20.518
The two water animals that start that with the letter O are Otter and Octopus

00:01:20.518 --> 00:01:23.887
An Octopus has eight arms

00:01:23.887 --> 00:01:26.956
I only have two!

00:01:26.956 --> 00:01:31.435
Wow, what a pretty shape

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:35.565
That shape starts with the letter O

00:01:35.565 --> 00:01:38.186
It's an Octagon

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:41.268
Octagon starts with the letter O

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:45.742
Let's count how many sides are on the Octagon

00:01:45.742 --> 00:02:01.625
1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8

00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:05.162
There are eight sides on an Octagon

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:08.851
That's the same number of arms on an Octopus

00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:10.904
Cool!

00:02:10.904 --> 00:02:13.852
Let's review the letter O

00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:18.100
This is a capital O

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.146
and this is a lowercase o

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:26.983
Remember the letter O looks like a circle

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:33.768
O makes the sound o o o

00:02:33.768 --> 00:02:36.493
like Olives

00:02:36.493 --> 00:02:39.229
October

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:41.801
Ostrich

00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:45.005
Ox

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.519
Otter

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.435
Octopus

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:53.184
and Octagon

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:58.048
Oh boy there are a lot of words that start with the letter O

00:02:58.048 --> 00:03:01.601
I bet you can think of a whole bunch more

00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:06.684
Post your favorite word that starts with the letter O in the comments

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:09.060

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.630
