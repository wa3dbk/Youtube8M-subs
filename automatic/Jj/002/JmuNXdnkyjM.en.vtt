first step a lot of the the bikes that
you<00:03:41.890> see<00:03:42.100> from<00:03:42.400> other<00:03:42.670> brands<00:03:42.940> are<00:03:43.330> basically

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
you see from other brands are basically

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.980 
you see from other brands are basically
too<00:03:43.930> short<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.470> so<00:03:45.340> they're<00:03:45.760> difficult<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
too short and so they're difficult to

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.010 
too short and so they're difficult to
make<00:03:47.140> it<00:03:47.320> comfortable<00:03:48.190> adjustments<00:03:48.910> but<00:03:49.420> if

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
make it comfortable adjustments but if

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.540
