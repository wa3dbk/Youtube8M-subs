going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> show<00:00:05.220> you<00:00:05.250> how<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.460> use<00:00:05.520> the<00:00:05.850> virtual

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
going to show you how to use the virtual

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.960 
going to show you how to use the virtual
camera<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.830> video<00:00:08.099> cameras<00:00:08.429> assemble<00:00:08.849> which

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
camera the video cameras assemble which

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.290 
camera the video cameras assemble which
can<00:00:09.179> use<00:00:09.360> at<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.570> camera<00:00:11.120> what<00:00:12.120> I've<00:00:12.210> done

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
can use at the camera what I've done

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.880 
can use at the camera what I've done
first<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:13.490> this<00:00:14.490> page<00:00:15.650> I'm<00:00:16.650> going<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
first in this page I'm going to

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.779 
first in this page I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:16.980> how<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.400> use<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.670> virtual

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
demonstrate how to use the virtual

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.060 
demonstrate how to use the virtual
camera<00:00:18.320> and<00:00:19.550> in<00:00:20.550> doing<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.859> we're<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.010> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
camera and in doing so we're going to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.279 
camera and in doing so we're going to
make<00:00:23.130> some<00:00:23.189> animated<00:00:23.789> topography<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
make some animated topography and

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.200 
make some animated topography and
basically<00:00:25.650> what<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.970> gonna<00:00:27.060> have

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
basically what this is we're gonna have

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.769 
basically what this is we're gonna have
the<00:00:27.269> words<00:00:28.250> moving<00:00:29.250> uphill<00:00:29.849> then<00:00:30.330> going<00:00:30.570> down

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
the words moving uphill then going down

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.540 
the words moving uphill then going down
a<00:00:30.810> hill<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.320> sure<00:00:32.130> what<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.340> mean<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> you

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
a hill I sure what I mean so you

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.770 
a hill I sure what I mean so you
download<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> V<00:00:36.180> came<00:00:36.450> what<00:00:36.660> you're

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
download the V came what you're

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.319 
download the V came what you're
searching<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.110> v<00:00:37.350> came<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> Google<00:00:38.329> and

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
searching for v came and Google and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
searching for v came and Google and
basically<00:00:39.690> what<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.050> ficam<00:00:40.649> as<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
basically what this ficam as it's just a

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720 
basically what this ficam as it's just a
symbol<00:00:42.980> going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> right<00:00:44.219> click<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
symbol going to right click on the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.220 
symbol going to right click on the
symbol<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> library<00:00:45.840> i'm<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> copy

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
symbol in the library i'm going to copy

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
symbol in the library i'm going to copy
it<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.559> paste<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:47.010> into<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.960> library<00:00:48.960> over

here now i'll close this window so i've
only<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:55.949> page<00:00:56.219> up<00:00:57.620> okay<00:00:58.620> i'm

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
only got the this one page up okay i'm

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
only got the this one page up okay i'm
going<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.949> add<00:00:59.100> another<00:00:59.309> layer<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> v<00:01:00.510> cam

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
going to add another layer for the v cam

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.049 
going to add another layer for the v cam
and<00:01:01.170> rename<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.530> v<00:01:01.800> chem<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.640> important<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and rename it v chem it's important to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.579 
and rename it v chem it's important to
rename<00:01:03.390> or<00:01:03.539> your<00:01:03.660> Laius<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.110> know<00:01:04.229> what's<00:01:04.439> on

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
rename or your Laius you know what's on

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.719 
rename or your Laius you know what's on
each<00:01:04.680> layer<00:01:05.600> now<00:01:06.600> i'm<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> add<00:01:06.990> fice

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
each layer now i'm going to add fice

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
each layer now i'm going to add fice
seconds<00:01:08.729> roughly<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:10.760> time<00:01:12.229> to<00:01:13.229> frame<00:01:13.500> 100<00:01:15.020> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
seconds roughly of time to frame 100 and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.390 
seconds roughly of time to frame 100 and
unlock<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> other<00:01:16.500> layers<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.220> don't

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
unlock the other layers so I don't

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.190 
unlock the other layers so I don't
affect<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.820> layers<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.450> wanna<00:01:18.570> click<00:01:19.049> on<00:01:19.140> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
affect those layers I wanna click on the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.840 
affect those layers I wanna click on the
became<00:01:19.590> layer<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.159> trick<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.700> V<00:01:20.970> kemon<00:01:22.850> when

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
became layer on a trick the V kemon when

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.370 
became layer on a trick the V kemon when
resize<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> v<00:01:24.479> chem<00:01:24.780> using<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> free

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
resize the v chem using the free

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.780 
resize the v chem using the free
transform<00:01:25.650> tool<00:01:26.009> i'm<00:01:26.310> holding<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.729> shift

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
transform tool i'm holding down shift

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.410 
transform tool i'm holding down shift
and<00:01:27.509> resizing<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.670> stays<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> proportion

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
and resizing so it stays in proportion

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.179 
and resizing so it stays in proportion
alright<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> i'm<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
alright so i'm going to do is going to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
alright so i'm going to do is going to
rotate<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.729> slightly<00:01:36.829> under<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> opposite

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
rotate this slightly under the opposite

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.410 
rotate this slightly under the opposite
of<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.030> i'm<00:01:39.270> going<00:01:39.360> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
of what you think of my so i'm going to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.789 
of what you think of my so i'm going to
tilt<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> down<00:01:39.720> thinking<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.560> downhill

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
tilt it down thinking is going downhill

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.350 
tilt it down thinking is going downhill
but<00:01:41.130> it's<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.750> going<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> be<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
but it's actually going to be going up

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.270 
but it's actually going to be going up
and<00:01:45.360> now<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.659> motion<00:01:45.899> tween<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.950> across

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and now in a motion tween this across

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.080 
and now in a motion tween this across
here<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:48.000> rotate<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:50.490> let's<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.939> do

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
here and then rotate it so let's just do

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
here and then rotate it so let's just do
that<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.509> understand<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:51.930> i<00:01:51.960> mean<00:01:52.170> i'm

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
that so you understand what i mean i'm

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.149 
that so you understand what i mean i'm
going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.310> go<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> insert<00:01:53.759> motion<00:01:54.210> tween<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:56.100> a

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
going to go to insert motion tween on a

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.730 
going to go to insert motion tween on a
drag<00:01:56.520> time<00:01:57.710> halfway<00:01:58.710> along

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.050 

all<00:02:02.740> right<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.340> drag<00:02:06.550> times<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.970> the

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
all right now going to drag times to the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.560 
all right now going to drag times to the
end<00:02:07.330> and<00:02:08.430> then<00:02:09.430> and<00:02:09.610> now<00:02:10.090> I'm<00:02:10.180> going<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.420> rotate

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
end and then and now I'm going to rotate

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.680 
end and then and now I'm going to rotate
the<00:02:10.869> camera<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:12.820> other<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:16.270> basically

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
the camera the other way so basically

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.000 
the camera the other way so basically
all<00:02:17.760> you'll<00:02:18.760> see<00:02:19.200> when<00:02:20.200> we<00:02:20.380> look<00:02:20.620> at<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010
