in<00:00:37.650> between<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> two<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.610> keep<00:00:38.790> them<00:00:39.000> more

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
in between the two to keep them more

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.870 
in between the two to keep them more
secure<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.960> then<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.680> am<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.160> rolling<00:00:41.700> out

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
secure and then I am just rolling out

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.160 
secure and then I am just rolling out
some<00:00:42.270> clay<00:00:42.660> for<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:43.590> feet

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.470 

and<00:00:48.710> then<00:00:49.040> I<00:00:49.130> just<00:00:49.340> kind<00:00:49.579> of<00:00:49.640> shaping<00:00:49.910> it<00:00:50.120> onto

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
and then I just kind of shaping it onto

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.220 
and then I just kind of shaping it onto
the<00:00:50.570> body<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:50.899> it's<00:00:51.200> more<00:00:51.440> secure

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.869 

and<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.469> I'm<00:00:56.559> also<00:00:56.770> going<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.219> roll<00:00:57.489> out<00:00:57.699> the

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
and that I'm also going to roll out the

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.209 
and that I'm also going to roll out the
other<00:00:58.090> two<00:00:58.420> balls<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.840> mint<00:00:59.140> clay<00:00:59.530> and<00:00:59.829> add

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:00.219 
other two balls of mint clay and add

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.060 
other two balls of mint clay and add
them<00:01:00.520> for<00:01:00.940> the<00:01:01.059> arms<00:01:01.510> what<00:01:02.260> I<00:01:02.289> found<00:01:02.500> later<00:01:02.800> is

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
them for the arms what I found later is

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.460 
them for the arms what I found later is
that<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.550> probably<00:01:04.030> best<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.659> add<00:01:04.930> the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
that it's probably best to add the

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.760 
that it's probably best to add the
redneck<00:01:06.400> strap<00:01:06.759> about<00:01:07.119> now<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.930> then<00:01:08.350> add<00:01:08.590> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
redneck strap about now and then add the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.380 
redneck strap about now and then add the
arms<00:01:09.009> on<00:01:09.130> afterwards<00:01:09.670> because<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.970> kind<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.240> had

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
arms on afterwards because I kind of had

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.469 
arms on afterwards because I kind of had
some<00:01:10.630> difficulty<00:01:11.320> cutting<00:01:11.800> at<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:11.979> red<00:01:12.909> but

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
some difficulty cutting at the red but

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.010 
some difficulty cutting at the red but
it<00:01:13.780> worked<00:01:14.020> on<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.259> end<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.720> then<00:01:16.869> you're

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
it worked on the end so then you're

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.590 
it worked on the end so then you're
going<00:01:17.200> to<00:01:17.290> need<00:01:17.740> a<00:01:17.800> D<00:01:18.070> at<00:01:18.190> red<00:01:18.430> coil<00:01:18.850> or<00:01:19.270> snake

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
going to need a D at red coil or snake

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.899 
going to need a D at red coil or snake
and<00:01:19.899> then<00:01:20.380> you<00:01:20.530> can<00:01:20.710> wrap<00:01:21.070> it<00:01:21.100> around<00:01:21.399> be<00:01:21.880> a

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
and then you can wrap it around be a

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.070 
and then you can wrap it around be a
scrump<00:01:22.420> neck

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.710 

and<00:01:27.620> I'm<00:01:27.920> just<00:01:28.100> using<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:28.640> small<00:01:28.880> blade<00:01:29.240> to

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.410 

and<00:01:41.710> then<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.130> can<00:01:42.399> go<00:01:42.729> around<00:01:42.850> to<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.270> back

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420

you have a bow and then you can insert
an<00:03:07.580> eye<00:03:07.730> pin<00:03:08.030> and<00:03:08.060> put<00:03:09.050> this<00:03:09.200> little<00:03:09.260> guy<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.980> at

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
an eye pin and put this little guy in at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.750 
an eye pin and put this little guy in at
the<00:03:10.310> oven<00:03:10.760> for<00:03:11.239> about<00:03:11.810> 20<00:03:12.410> minutes<00:03:12.590> at<00:03:12.920> 275

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
the oven for about 20 minutes at 275

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.910 
the oven for about 20 minutes at 275
degrees<00:03:14.650> and<00:03:16.570> now<00:03:17.570> we<00:03:17.630> can<00:03:18.019> move<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.380> to<00:03:18.560> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
degrees and now we can move on to the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.540 
degrees and now we can move on to the
painting<00:03:19.519> part<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:20.570> this<00:03:21.050> is<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.769> bit<00:03:22.220> difficult
