out in this whole motion this had to

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
out in this whole motion this had to

have an effect on something although

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.539 
have an effect on something although
they<00:01:54.960> say<00:01:55.170> it's<00:01:55.320> highly<00:01:55.680> unlikely<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
they say it's highly unlikely that it

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.539 
they say it's highly unlikely that it
caused<00:01:56.790> anything<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.479> happen<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.430> find<00:01:59.430> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
caused anything to happen I find that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.399 
caused anything to happen I find that
just<00:02:01.369> ridiculous<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.149> red<00:02:03.630> dwarf<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:04.079> a

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
just ridiculous that a red dwarf and a

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
just ridiculous that a red dwarf and a
brown<00:02:04.619> dwarf<00:02:04.829> pass<00:02:05.579> through<00:02:05.880> this<00:02:05.939> or<00:02:06.210> cloud

brown dwarf pass through this or cloud

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.949 
brown dwarf pass through this or cloud
and<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.229> didn't<00:02:07.619> disturb<00:02:07.979> anything<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and it didn't disturb anything and it

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.809 
and it didn't disturb anything and it
only<00:02:10.080> happened<00:02:10.500> 70,000<00:02:11.160> years<00:02:11.220> ago<00:02:11.340> now<00:02:11.700> they

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
only happened 70,000 years ago now they

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.340 
only happened 70,000 years ago now they
say<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.060> they<00:02:12.420> would<00:02:12.599> expect

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
say that they would expect

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.980 
say that they would expect
a<00:02:13.440> star<00:02:13.980> system<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:15.030> pass<00:02:15.300> through<00:02:15.630> our<00:02:15.750> Oort

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
a star system to pass through our Oort

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.210 
a star system to pass through our Oort
cloud<00:02:16.110> every<00:02:17.420> hundred<00:02:18.420> thousand<00:02:18.810> years<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.950> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
cloud every hundred thousand years so it

cloud every hundred thousand years so it
is<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.610> bit<00:02:20.820> surprising<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.630> see<00:02:21.780> that<00:02:21.960> this

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
is a bit surprising to see that this

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.920 
is a bit surprising to see that this
happened<00:02:22.470> only<00:02:22.590> 70,000<00:02:23.460> years<00:02:23.550> ago<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:24.630> thing

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
happened only 70,000 years ago my thing

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.170 
happened only 70,000 years ago my thing
is<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:26.220> way<00:02:26.370> that<00:02:26.520> they<00:02:26.640> released<00:02:27.000> this

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
is the way that they released this

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.770 
is the way that they released this
information<00:02:28.670> they<00:02:29.670> just<00:02:29.880> slide<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.360> out<00:02:30.450> there

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
information they just slide it out there

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.930 
information they just slide it out there
just<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.460> rest<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.790> big

the<00:02:34.920> place<00:02:35.130> space.com<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.480> have<00:02:36.750> all<00:02:36.900> these

stories but they're not focusing in on
something<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.840> believe<00:02:43.140> could<00:02:43.650> have<00:02:43.770> very<00:02:44.280> well

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
something I believe could have very well

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.890 
something I believe could have very well
been<00:02:44.520> a<00:02:44.910> major<00:02:45.240> event<00:02:45.510> some<00:02:46.350> 70,000<00:02:47.220> years<00:02:47.340> ago

been a major event some 70,000 years ago
it<00:02:48.900> could<00:02:49.020> have<00:02:49.140> affected<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.590> lot<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.860> things

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
it could have affected a lot of things

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.060 
it could have affected a lot of things
we<00:02:51.870> all<00:02:51.990> know<00:02:52.170> how<00:02:52.320> we're<00:02:52.470> kept<00:02:52.650> in<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:52.890> dark

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
we all know how we're kept in the dark

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.340 
we all know how we're kept in the dark
we<00:02:53.430> all<00:02:53.580> know<00:02:53.730> how<00:02:53.850> relied<00:02:54.210> to<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:54.900> much<00:02:55.110> about

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
we all know how relied to so much about

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.240 
we all know how relied to so much about
space<00:02:57.050> so<00:02:58.050> every<00:02:58.380> little<00:02:58.560> bit<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.830> they<00:02:59.040> put

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
space so every little bit that they put

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.870 
space so every little bit that they put
out<00:02:59.280> there<00:02:59.660> is<00:03:00.660> key<00:03:01.650> we'll<00:03:02.400> see<00:03:02.610> what<00:03:02.760> they

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
out there is key we'll see what they

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.970 
out there is key we'll see what they
admit<00:03:03.180> from<00:03:03.360> here<00:03:03.630> at<00:03:03.810> first<00:03:04.410> glance<00:03:04.710> they

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
admit from here at first glance they

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.200 
admit from here at first glance they
said<00:03:05.190> they<00:03:05.310> didn't<00:03:05.550> know<00:03:05.640> if<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.820> thing<00:03:06.060> was

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
said they didn't know if this thing was

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.300 
said they didn't know if this thing was
heading<00:03:06.480> away<00:03:06.690> from<00:03:06.900> us<00:03:07.050> or<00:03:07.200> coming<00:03:07.980> toward<00:03:08.190> us

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
heading away from us or coming toward us

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.640 
heading away from us or coming toward us
again<00:03:08.750> because<00:03:09.750> when<00:03:09.900> they<00:03:09.990> were<00:03:10.080> tracking<00:03:10.350> it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
again because when they were tracking it

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.960 
again because when they were tracking it
its<00:03:11.220> movements<00:03:11.880> were<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:12.810> slow<00:03:13.730> but<00:03:14.730> then<00:03:14.880> they

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
its movements were so slow but then they

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.700 
its movements were so slow but then they
said<00:03:15.180> finally<00:03:15.570> they<00:03:15.720> figured<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.140> velocities

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
said finally they figured the velocities

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.560 
said finally they figured the velocities
showed<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.400> was<00:03:17.520> heading<00:03:17.940> away<00:03:18.210> from<00:03:18.420> us

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
showed that it was heading away from us

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.490 
showed that it was heading away from us
I<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:21.810> want<00:03:21.960> to<00:03:22.050> share<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.290> information

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
I just want to share the information

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
I just want to share the information
with<00:03:22.800> you<00:03:23.010> guys<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.220> think<00:03:23.550> it's<00:03:23.730> interesting

with you guys I think it's interesting

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.300 
with you guys I think it's interesting
you<00:03:24.720> never<00:03:24.930> know<00:03:25.200> what's<00:03:25.440> out<00:03:25.650> there<00:03:25.680> what's

you never know what's out there what's

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.820 
you never know what's out there what's
creeping<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.940> or<00:03:27.360> what's<00:03:27.810> been<00:03:28.050> here<00:03:28.320> in<00:03:28.470> the
