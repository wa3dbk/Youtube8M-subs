00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.199
 in Greek literature the emergence of 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.269
 man on earth is explained with 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:17.579
 very different myths giving the impression 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.529
 that it was a difficult concept and so 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:22.050
 which diverse explanations were sought 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.490
 however in Roman times ovidio 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.380
 transmitted at the beginning of his 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.539
 metamorphosis a much more version 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.189
 coherent and elaborate that must have been 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 the one that had spread like the most 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.239
 widespread and accepted until that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.129
 moment according to this version once 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.170
 the earth was ordered and each one of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.329
 its parts had the living beings that it 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.250
 corresponded came a being of a 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.320
 superior nature well because the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.449
 architect of nature will create it from 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.010
 divine germs or because the earth what 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.809
 hold back from heaven 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.030
 said germs were modeled by the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.159
 japeto stem I promise this being 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.379
 human lived its first phase at an age 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.750
 of gold in which I had everything and I do not know 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.180
 they did not even need judges but they 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.189
 He was corrupting progressively moving 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.170
 for the ages of silver and bronze for 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:06.150
 get to the iron counterpoint 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.560
 absolute the golden men 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.509
 they had become so evil that the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.700
 justice that lived among men 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.800
 had had to take refuge in heaven 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.540
 and zeus decided to send a punishment 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.850
 exemplary in the form of deluge level 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.860
 only a couple of righteous people were saved 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.420
 of eukal or ni pirra that regenerated the 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.070
 land with new men 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.900
 theoretically better than those that had 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.760
 in the iron age these new 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
 inhabitants arose from the stones that 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.930
 they had the mother earth the stones 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.750
 thrown by duch to lyon they became 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.250
 in men and women's legs 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.770
 the Greeks do not transmit a version 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.630
 uniform about the origin of man the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.700
 literature collects traditions of 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.760
 different origin and content both 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.830
 local as universal traditions 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.320
 locals try to explain the first 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.690
 residents of that particular place do not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.560
 they pretend to give an explanation 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.229
 eschatological of the origin of humanity 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.570
 for example the arcade explained to you the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.210
 human origin from trees rocks 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.310
 and stones but they had another tradition for 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.619
 which were considered descendants of the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.520
 pelas gogh and the first inhabitants of 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.740
 Greece 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.229
 velasco was son of zeus so this 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.209
 village had divine origin on the other hand 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.310
 universal traditions the accounts 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.110
 of pseudo in the works and the days and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.209
 they differ from the tradition or bibiana so 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.620
 only in the details and in what narrates them 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.660
 without connection to each other 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.490
 seeming independent myths 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.680
 regarding the myth of the ages for 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.990
 all gods and men had 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.970
 the same origin although the gods were 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.220
 those who created a golden lineage of 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.920
 mortal men who lived in times 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.350
 of chrono without need of anything the earth 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.690
 He buried this race and another 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.180
 much worse the silver one that he destroyed 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.820
 zeus is followed by the bronze to which only 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 they were interested in violent acts 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.630
 disappeared to this one zeus created another one 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.610
 fair and virtuous that of the heroes of the 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.070
 which dispensed video in its preparation 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.830
 later and then came the age of 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.020
 iron 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.970
 the myth of prometheus is the one that explain 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.490
 more clearly the origin of the being 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.530
 human was this of divine origin who 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.540
 modeled the man with water and mud and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.330
 then stole the celestial fire to give it to him 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.310
 to zeus irritated by his audacity he decided 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.710
 punish her by sending her a woman who 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.410
 they extracted the misfortunes that is why he created 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.630
 pandora provided with all the gifts and 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.180
 he gave it to Epimetheus brother of Prometheus 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.130
 and who owned a jar or box in whose 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.170
 inside all evils were kept 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.420
 although he was warned that never 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.640
 admit gifts of zeus epimetheus 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.860
 pandora amazed accepted it not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.690
 he could avoid curiosity he opened the jar 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.730
 and all the evils that came out 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.040
 they spread through the scared land to the 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.380
 he covered quickly but could only leave 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.720
 trapped in hope only consolation 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.670
 what is left to men with this 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.330
 myth would explain the origin and 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.720
 miseries of the human race 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.720
 ah
