00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:13.960
 the kingdom of custom 125 abandoned by 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.010
 the Japanese opens its doors wide at 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.260
 Chinese constructor 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.060
 they even pay the luxury of 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.279
 diversify a market to style a little 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.990
 frozen in partnership with the magazine 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.669
 generation 125 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.140
 we have gathered for you four 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.239
 machines from the worst of 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:37.450
 middle to play bad boy at a price 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:38.920
 tight this bike and the 125 king lifan 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.140
 it is equipped with a single-cylinder engine 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.879
 liquid-cooled and for the 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.620
 lou who she is inspired by the big custom to 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.140
 the American in their classic version 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.120
 chrome is just wanting too much 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.679
 to play the mythical card we find 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 finishing details sometimes a little 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.530
 kitsch 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.629
 in return the engine is 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.339
 surprisingly effective the rounds well 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.749
 filled and we take full advantage of his 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.730
 performance thanks to a cycle part 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.019
 easy and comfort above the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.309
 average 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.080
 this custom wants to be statutory and 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.310
 has an ultra complete equipment 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.600
 since the dashboard is found 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.640
 even the battery charge indicator 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.740
 up to the gas gauge and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.970
 the report indicator engaged what they 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.830
 be an interview will appreciate in 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.570
 plus the presence of a center stand 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.310
 what I will remember after this test 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.560
 it's the really efficient engine 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.850
 fun with a good sound and then 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.590
 ease of handling 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.240
 on the contrary, I did not like it at all 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.770
 some finishing details like 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.180
 sheaths that come to protect the 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.680
 Cooling system 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.660
 so in the end we still have a custom 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.080
 very nice for the price of a machine 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.080
 utilities 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.870
 so today I was riding on 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.690
 the home is 125 arc super light with 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.330
 an air-cooled single cylinder of 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.190
 valve nailed it unlike the 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.570
 leaf years inspires wisely 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.580
 trends come 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 across the Atlantic 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.630
 with this beautiful matte black paint that 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.120
 really does its effect so a 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.760
 matte black paint of the most beautiful effect and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.720
 up to the commodo which are exactly the 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.009
 same as on a motor question harley 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.490
 even if it's not a lightning war 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.580
 at startup it then has a good 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:18.620
 mid-range fishing and especially an elongated 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.510
 interesting that allows him to take him to 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.000
 daily on fast lanes without 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.790
 problem despite its generous curves 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.010
 Installed above no worries 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.410
 for small templates especially we 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.270
 found on the other hand to a handlebars a 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.350
 little bit too much a little too much right to 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.650
 the way of a roadster 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.570
 it's less obvious to take in hand 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.700
 on the other hand the steps with the 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.410
 slightly advanced commands does pose 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.380
 no problem the saddle is comfortable on 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.200
 regret a little bit of shock 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.360
 back a little too firm to conclude 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.450
 what I really liked about this 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.830
 machine is first of all his look that is 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.870
 really apart 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.670
 on the other hand what I have much less 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.769
 appreciated is the feeling and the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.100
 braking power that really make 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.100
 fault 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.629
 so me today I drove on 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:17.459
 this vast roa and 125 custom which is a 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.689
 model that are getting closer among our 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.040
 quartet was still the one who got 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.340
 Closer to a utility bike 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.870
 in that the look is less extreme 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.569
 than the other models we tried 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.340
 today is also at the level of 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.900
 the equipment we are on a motorcycle enough 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.430
 well equipped with saddlebags to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.049
 the back a folder for the passenger 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.939
 this motorcycle is powered by a 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.709
 air-cooled twin engine 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:39.780
 develops 11 horses so like all 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.760
 125 motorcycles equipped with engines 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.519
 bicylinders it's true that there vastro to 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.840
 a motor a bit sharp so you do not have to 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.639
 not hesitate to ride in the towers for 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.139
 to have the power so it's nice 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:51.859
 for the sporty side of the thing 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.879
 on the other hand it requires a little more 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.469
 the use of the gearbox at the 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.810
 daily in town or for example when 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:02.310
 we want comfortable covers on the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.659
 road to ergonomics 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.370
 finally it's a pretty bike 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:07.260
 classic foot rests are enough in 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.799
 before the handlebar is still a small 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.590
 not wide 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.180
 so we stay in a custom spirit 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.319
 utility we will say it's still 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.370
 not as marked as some models 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.930
 we could test today 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
 so in the end what I appreciated about 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.919
 this bike is really the ease of 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.419
 taken in hand namely ergonomics which 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.620
 is ultimately very suitable very 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.340
 easy to handle for the little ones 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.650
 as for the big ones 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.060
 the engine that is not very 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.449
 awesome at low speeds so easy 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.130
 to be dosed 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:31.020
 you must also whip it to get the 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.520
 power so sometimes it's a small 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.670
 little pain in the long run 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.980
 but the same spirit 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.020
 I drove today on the bear 125 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.070
 the only representative of gender in the 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:51.050
 cubic so a hellish look with the 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.650
 mechanical well in the open air 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.900
 its 21-inch front wheel and its pretty 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.330
 was chrome and therefore the engine to 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.680
 twin cylinder liquid cooling 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.050
 develops 11 horses 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.300
 he does not speak too badly down 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.250
 scheme for a two-cylinder engine that 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.470
 of course does not tend to work 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.600
 although in the towers then he is 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.910
 obvious that this exclusivity 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.270
 pays ergonomics and comfort 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.310
 to start the single seat you 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.170
 will forget your passenger 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.580
 although the small dampers located in 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.570
 below limits a little bit the damage 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.210
 for vertebrae 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.430
 of course she will distract you 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.720
 totally with feet far ahead 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.880
 the arms tight 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.530
 it's really america so on the road 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.080
 the rigid frame imposing a comfort 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.170
 rather spartan but the road holding 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.580
 is not surprising so far then 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.630
 of course the highlight of this 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:47.210
 machine is its hellish look that gets 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:49.070
 pay per counterparty deficit 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.900
 of equipment actually it is rather 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.700
 minimalist you do not have a gauge to 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.520
 essence the passage in reserve 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.740
 emmanuel in any case this bike remains 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.220
 a favorite machine is the case 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.960
 to say it 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.700
 she often goes for a bigger 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.830
 cubic and she always attracts the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.980
 sympathy of passersby so precisely in 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.650
 125 cm cube is really the best 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.450
 way to ride different this is paid 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.210
 a little question price and we get 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.310
 closer to the price of some motorcycles 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.320
 more upscale but in any case 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.380
 question exclusivity is the best 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.600
 the complete subject the precise numbers and 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.250
 all the details of this comparative are at 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.759
