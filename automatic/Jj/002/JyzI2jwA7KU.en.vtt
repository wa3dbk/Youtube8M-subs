when<00:00:00.210> you're<00:00:00.329> down<00:00:00.599> in<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.050> cave<00:00:01.290> how<00:00:01.620> do<00:00:01.680> you

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
when you're down in a cave how do you

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.430 
when you're down in a cave how do you
know<00:00:01.979> what<00:00:02.310> time<00:00:02.610> it<00:00:02.820> is<00:00:02.850> up<00:00:03.149> above<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:04.080> clock

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
know what time it is up above the clock

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.230 
know what time it is up above the clock
so<00:00:04.920> old-fashioned<00:00:05.700> we're<00:00:05.850> gonna<00:00:05.940> talk<00:00:06.210> about

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
so old-fashioned we're gonna talk about

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.990 
so old-fashioned we're gonna talk about
daylight<00:00:06.810> sensors

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
oMG Chad today we're gonna be looking at

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.830 
oMG Chad today we're gonna be looking at
daylight<00:00:17.560> sensors<00:00:18.040> one<00:00:18.520> of<00:00:18.640> the<00:00:18.850> interesting

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
daylight sensors one of the interesting

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.880 
daylight sensors one of the interesting
redstone<00:00:20.470> blocks<00:00:20.860> that<00:00:21.250> uses<00:00:21.820> analog

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
redstone blocks that uses analog

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.230 
redstone blocks that uses analog
redstone<00:00:23.890> wah<00:00:24.490> hah

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
redstone wah hah

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.780 
redstone wah hah
it's<00:00:25.990> a<00:00:26.080> very<00:00:26.320> very<00:00:26.770> interesting<00:00:27.130> redstone

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:27.790 
it's a very very interesting redstone

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.060 
it's a very very interesting redstone
block<00:00:28.060> so<00:00:28.329> let's<00:00:28.599> check<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.810> out<00:00:28.960> so<00:00:29.349> here<00:00:29.950> we

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:30.070 
block so let's check it out so here we

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.639 
block so let's check it out so here we
are<00:00:30.099> in<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.460> tiny<00:00:30.640> little<00:00:30.880> world<00:00:31.450> I<00:00:31.599> made<00:00:31.779> four

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:32.649 
are in a tiny little world I made four

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.280 
are in a tiny little world I made four
it's<00:00:32.920> still<00:00:33.160> loading<00:00:33.460> in<00:00:33.610> all<00:00:33.880> the<00:00:34.720> squid<00:00:35.079> they

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
it's still loading in all the squid they

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.299 
it's still loading in all the squid they
look<00:00:35.500> so<00:00:35.800> happy

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
look so happy

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.680 
look so happy
so<00:00:36.969> we're<00:00:37.090> going<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.270> be<00:00:37.390> talking<00:00:37.660> about

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
so we're going to be talking about

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.690 
so we're going to be talking about
daylight<00:00:38.140> sensors<00:00:38.590> and<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.860> first<00:00:39.100> thing<00:00:39.399> is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
daylight sensors and the first thing is

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.569 
daylight sensors and the first thing is
how<00:00:40.120> to<00:00:40.149> craft<00:00:40.450> them<00:00:40.690> pretty<00:00:41.469> simple<00:00:41.860> you<00:00:42.370> can

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
how to craft them pretty simple you can

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.020 
how to craft them pretty simple you can
use<00:00:42.910> glass<00:00:43.690> on<00:00:44.140> top<00:00:44.679> that<00:00:45.219> first<00:00:45.460> layer<00:00:45.730> the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
use glass on top that first layer the

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.790 
use glass on top that first layer the
nether<00:00:46.300> quartz<00:00:46.570> from<00:00:46.899> the<00:00:47.079> nether<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.379> then

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
nether quartz from the nether and then

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.119 
nether quartz from the nether and then
slabs<00:00:48.429> on<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:49.120> bottom<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.719> you<00:00:50.649> get<00:00:50.890> a

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:51.129 
slabs on the bottom and you get a

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.549 
slabs on the bottom and you get a
daylight<00:00:51.789> sensor<00:00:52.059> another<00:00:52.899> nice<00:00:53.230> thing<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
daylight sensor another nice thing to

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.729 
daylight sensor another nice thing to
note<00:00:53.739> is<00:00:53.920> that<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.730> slabs<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.480> stuff<00:00:55.749> a<00:00:55.960> that

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
note is that the slabs and stuff a that

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.649 
note is that the slabs and stuff a that
doesn't<00:00:56.949> matter<00:00:57.280> so<00:00:57.429> you<00:00:57.730> can<00:00:58.030> get<00:00:58.179> that<00:00:58.359> with

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
doesn't matter so you can get that with

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.369 
doesn't matter so you can get that with
here<00:00:59.559> I<00:00:59.589> have<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.780> acacia<00:01:01.780> wood

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
here I have the acacia wood

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.920 
here I have the acacia wood
I<00:01:02.409> think<00:01:02.679> it's<00:01:02.769> acacia<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.909> that<00:01:04.269> also<00:01:04.510> makes

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
I think it's acacia and that also makes

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.340 
I think it's acacia and that also makes
a<00:01:05.140> daylight<00:01:05.560> sensor<00:01:06.130> as<00:01:06.280> well<00:01:07.200> here's<00:01:08.200> what

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
a daylight sensor as well here's what

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.190 
a daylight sensor as well here's what
they<00:01:08.440> look<00:01:08.470> like<00:01:08.620> on<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.670> ground<00:01:09.820> and<00:01:10.330> you<00:01:11.020> can

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
they look like on the ground and you can

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.110 
they look like on the ground and you can
hook<00:01:11.380> up<00:01:11.590> some<00:01:11.770> redstone<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.460> them<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:12.820> they

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
hook up some redstone to them and they

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.630 
hook up some redstone to them and they
will<00:01:13.360> show<00:01:13.630> you<00:01:13.690> what<00:01:14.590> time<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:15.130> day<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.490> is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
will show you what time of day it is

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.090 
will show you what time of day it is
I've<00:01:15.820> decided<00:01:16.600> see<00:01:17.290> how<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:17.650> Sun<00:01:17.920> isn't

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
I've decided see how the Sun isn't

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.930 
I've decided see how the Sun isn't
moving<00:01:18.310> just<00:01:18.730> the<00:01:18.850> clouds<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:20.350> have<00:01:21.130> turned<00:01:21.610> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
moving just the clouds I have turned the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.780 
moving just the clouds I have turned the
day<00:01:22.570> light<00:01:22.750> -<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:23.440> it<00:01:23.590> doesn't<00:01:23.710> just<00:01:24.070> change<00:01:24.130> on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
day light - so it doesn't just change on

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
day light - so it doesn't just change on
me<00:01:25.060> this<00:01:26.050> is<00:01:26.260> its<00:01:26.440> maximum<00:01:27.160> setting<00:01:27.610> of<00:01:27.790> 15

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
me this is its maximum setting of 15

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.050 
me this is its maximum setting of 15
blocks<00:01:29.650> away<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.280> can<00:01:30.520> see<00:01:30.670> this<00:01:30.790> one<00:01:30.940> doesn't

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
blocks away you can see this one doesn't

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.730 
blocks away you can see this one doesn't
have<00:01:31.150> any<00:01:31.240> particles<00:01:31.750> on<00:01:31.900> it<00:01:31.930> at<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.230> 16th

have any particles on it at the 16th
block<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.250> could<00:01:33.400> put<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> repeater<00:01:33.910> here<00:01:33.970> and

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
block you could put a repeater here and

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.650 
block you could put a repeater here and
then<00:01:34.330> repeat<00:01:34.660> the<00:01:34.780> signal<00:01:34.990> if<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.560> need<00:01:35.860> it<00:01:36.010> to

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
then repeat the signal if you need it to

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.090 
then repeat the signal if you need it to
but<00:01:37.660> 15<00:01:38.200> blocks<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:39.280> maximum<00:01:39.850> distance<00:01:40.150> of

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
the daylight sensor you can change

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.250 
the daylight sensor you can change
let's<00:01:45.460> do<00:01:45.670> time<00:01:46.740> set<00:01:47.740> and<00:01:48.870> let's<00:01:49.870> change<00:01:50.080> this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
let's do time set and let's change this

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:56.180 
let's do time set and let's change this
to<00:01:51.090> 5000<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.780> see<00:01:52.930> that'll<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:53.290> down<00:01:53.320> oh

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.810 

it<00:01:57.190> will<00:01:57.430> go<00:01:58.060> down<00:01:58.300> at<00:01:58.510> 4,000<00:01:59.430> there<00:02:00.430> we<00:02:00.520> go<00:02:00.640> and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
it will go down at 4,000 there we go and

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.160 
it will go down at 4,000 there we go and
we<00:02:01.060> lost<00:02:01.360> one<00:02:01.690> block<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:03.340> is<00:02:03.400> kind<00:02:03.760> of<00:02:03.790> like<00:02:03.970> a

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
we lost one block this is kind of like a

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.650 
we lost one block this is kind of like a
a<00:02:05.170> curve<00:02:05.920> this<00:02:06.430> isn't<00:02:06.880> just<00:02:07.120> a<00:02:07.240> perfect

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
a curve this isn't just a perfect

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.280 
a curve this isn't just a perfect
straight<00:02:07.930> line<00:02:08.170> between<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.599> morning<00:02:10.989> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
straight line between the morning and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.520 
straight line between the morning and
the<00:02:11.530> afternoon<00:02:11.560> that<00:02:12.190> was<00:02:12.310> down<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.840> 3000<00:02:13.840> and

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
the afternoon that was down to 3000 and

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.559 
the afternoon that was down to 3000 and
we<00:02:14.950> can<00:02:15.099> bring<00:02:15.250> this<00:02:15.370> down<00:02:15.430> to<00:02:15.670> 2,000<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.390> we

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
we can bring this down to 2,000 so we

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.420 
we can bring this down to 2,000 so we
will<00:02:16.780> start<00:02:17.050> losing<00:02:17.230> more<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.680> more<00:02:18.099> blocks

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
will start losing more and more blocks

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.259 
will start losing more and more blocks
faster<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:19.510> faster<00:02:19.749> as<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:21.159> get<00:02:21.340> down<00:02:21.579> to

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
faster and faster as we get down to

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.960 
faster and faster as we get down to
earlier<00:02:23.049> in<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.709> day

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
earlier in the day

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.930 
earlier in the day
a so<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:25.050> lost<00:02:25.200> two<00:02:25.530> right<00:02:25.860> there<00:02:26.190> we

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
a so we just lost two right there we

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.470 
a so we just lost two right there we
could<00:02:27.120> go<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.800> 500<00:02:28.800> which<00:02:29.010> is<00:02:29.160> only<00:02:29.310> half<00:02:29.480> which

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
could go to 500 which is only half which

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.760 
could go to 500 which is only half which
we<00:02:30.690> were<00:02:30.840> doing<00:02:31.110> steps<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:33.050> 1000<00:02:34.050> before<00:02:34.200> I

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
we were doing steps of 1000 before I

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.130 
we were doing steps of 1000 before I
mean<00:02:35.490> if<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.700> go<00:02:35.820> all<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.150> way<00:02:36.180> down<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.840> set

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
mean if we go all the way down to set

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.000 
mean if we go all the way down to set
time<00:02:37.350> zero<00:02:38.900> right<00:02:39.900> we're<00:02:40.470> over<00:02:40.500> here

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
time zero right we're over here

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.660 
time zero right we're over here
and<00:02:41.100> it's<00:02:41.820> starting<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.360> pretty<00:02:42.600> dark<00:02:43.670> so

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
and it's starting to get pretty dark so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
and it's starting to get pretty dark so
we're<00:02:44.760> going<00:02:44.850> to<00:02:44.940> go<00:02:45.060> ahead<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.330> set<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
we're going to go ahead and set that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.570 
we're going to go ahead and set that
back<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> high<00:02:47.130> noon<00:02:47.490> and<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.450> was<00:02:48.600> at

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
back up to high noon and that was at

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.330 
back up to high noon and that was at
6000<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:51.090> we<00:02:51.210> go<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.600> it's<00:02:52.290> all<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.950> way<00:02:53.100> up

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
6000 there we go and it's all the way up

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.520 
6000 there we go and it's all the way up
now<00:02:53.610> what<00:02:53.820> could<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.090> use<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.840> daylight

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
now what could you use this daylight

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.600 
now what could you use this daylight
sensor<00:02:56.100> for<00:02:56.750> well<00:02:57.750> other<00:02:58.290> than<00:02:58.520> since<00:02:59.520> the

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
sensor for well other than since the

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.530 
sensor for well other than since the
daylight<00:02:59.910> it's<00:03:00.030> really<00:03:00.209> not<00:03:00.330> good<00:03:00.510> for

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
daylight it's really not good for

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.170 
daylight it's really not good for
anything<00:03:00.870> because<00:03:01.560> if<00:03:02.459> we<00:03:02.580> go<00:03:02.670> ahead<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.970> set

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
anything because if we go ahead and set

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.660 
anything because if we go ahead and set
this<00:03:03.330> back<00:03:03.630> down<00:03:04.020> very<00:03:04.500> far<00:03:04.920> actually<00:03:05.520> let's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
this back down very far actually let's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.210 
this back down very far actually let's
set<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.000> time<00:03:07.490> for<00:03:08.490> night<00:03:09.470> time<00:03:10.470> set<00:03:11.130> night

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
set the time for night time set night

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.420 
set the time for night time set night
you<00:03:14.220> can<00:03:14.459> see<00:03:14.820> that<00:03:15.420> dah<00:03:15.930> dah<00:03:16.230> dah<00:03:16.430> there's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
you can see that dah dah dah there's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.360 
you can see that dah dah dah there's
very<00:03:17.790> few<00:03:18.500> right<00:03:19.500> here<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:19.830> Sun<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.160> still

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
very few right here the Sun is still

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.610 
very few right here the Sun is still
maybe<00:03:20.790> visible<00:03:21.690> let's<00:03:21.870> let's<00:03:22.200> go<00:03:22.320> ahead<00:03:22.410> and

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
maybe visible let's let's go ahead and

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.550 
maybe visible let's let's go ahead and
set<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:26.300> 18000<00:03:27.300> there<00:03:27.959> we<00:03:28.080> go<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.410> now

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
set that to 18000 there we go so now

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.120 
set that to 18000 there we go so now
there's<00:03:28.830> absolutely<00:03:29.040> no<00:03:29.700> Sun<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.300> be<00:03:30.450> seen

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
there's absolutely no Sun to be seen

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.729 
there's absolutely no Sun to be seen
this<00:03:32.130> will<00:03:32.370> not<00:03:32.640> detect<00:03:33.230> torchlight<00:03:34.230> it'll

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
this will not detect torchlight it'll

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:39.500 
this will not detect torchlight it'll
only<00:03:35.160> detect<00:03:35.550> sunlight<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.980> that<00:03:38.880> is<00:03:39.000> useful

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
only detect sunlight so that is useful

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.420 
only detect sunlight so that is useful
in<00:03:39.780> knowing<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.860> light<00:03:41.040> up<00:03:41.160> around

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
in knowing that you can light up around

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.520 
in knowing that you can light up around
it<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.570> only<00:03:42.750> thing<00:03:43.019> it's<00:03:43.170> ever<00:03:43.350> going<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
it and the only thing it's ever going to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.800 
it and the only thing it's ever going to
mess<00:03:43.739> with<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> daylight<00:03:44.280> sensor<00:03:44.700> is<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
mess with the daylight sensor is the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.420 
mess with the daylight sensor is the
daylight<00:03:46.230> it's<00:03:46.530> self

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
daylight it's self

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.030 
daylight it's self
now<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.870> daylight<00:03:49.320> sensor<00:03:49.530> was<00:03:49.650> added<00:03:49.980> in

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
now this daylight sensor was added in

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.789 
now this daylight sensor was added in
1.5<00:03:50.610> but<00:03:51.150> there<00:03:51.420> is<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.570> new<00:03:51.810> function<00:03:52.140> with<00:03:52.620> it

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
1.5 but there is a new function with it

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.180 
1.5 but there is a new function with it
OOP<00:03:53.220> look<00:03:54.180> at<00:03:54.330> that<00:03:54.600> you<00:03:55.019> can<00:03:55.230> basically<00:03:55.410> turn

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
OOP look at that you can basically turn

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.180 
OOP look at that you can basically turn
off<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.910> daylight<00:03:57.209> sensor<00:03:57.630> but<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.709> one

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
off the daylight sensor but it's one

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.660 
off the daylight sensor but it's one
step<00:03:59.820> cooler<00:04:00.540> because<00:04:01.170> not<00:04:01.590> only<00:04:01.620> does<00:04:02.610> it

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
step cooler because not only does it

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.390 
step cooler because not only does it
change<00:04:03.060> colors<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:04.080> really<00:04:04.380> neat<00:04:04.590> pattern

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
change colors to a really neat pattern

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.080 
change colors to a really neat pattern
part<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.299> me<00:04:06.390> wants<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:07.310> make<00:04:08.310> this<00:04:08.489> like<00:04:08.820> some

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
part of me wants to make this like some

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.630 
part of me wants to make this like some
sort<00:04:09.360> of<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:10.220> look<00:04:11.220> at<00:04:11.310> that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
sort of a look at that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.420 
sort of a look at that
wait<00:04:11.970> no<00:04:12.330> there<00:04:12.630> yeah<00:04:13.350> it'd<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.860> cool<00:04:14.130> floor

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
wait no there yeah it'd be cool floor

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.289 
wait no there yeah it'd be cool floor
basically<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:15.390> that's<00:04:15.600> all<00:04:15.780> I'm<00:04:15.900> saying<00:04:16.169> here

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
basically so that's all I'm saying here

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.650 
basically so that's all I'm saying here
but<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.840> is<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.500> nighttime<00:04:19.979> sensor<00:04:20.729> so<00:04:21.390> if

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
but now it is a nighttime sensor so if

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.210 
but now it is a nighttime sensor so if
we<00:04:21.870> sent<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.200> time<00:04:22.440> back<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:23.690> 18,000<00:04:24.690> BAM<00:04:25.290> here

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
we sent the time back to 18,000 BAM here

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.930 
we sent the time back to 18,000 BAM here
we<00:04:26.370> go

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
we go

we go
it<00:04:27.180> used<00:04:27.360> to<00:04:27.419> be<00:04:27.570> that<00:04:27.690> you'd<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:27.960> to<00:04:28.080> invert

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
it used to be that you'd have to invert

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.330 
it used to be that you'd have to invert
the<00:04:28.890> signal<00:04:29.300> from<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.840> daylight<00:04:31.590> sensor<00:04:32.070> to

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
the signal from the daylight sensor to

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.790 
the signal from the daylight sensor to
be<00:04:32.460> able<00:04:32.580> to<00:04:32.970> do<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.450> but<00:04:34.140> now<00:04:34.380> with<00:04:34.650> the

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
be able to do this but now with the

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.030 
be able to do this but now with the
nighttime<00:04:35.400> sensor<00:04:35.880> you<00:04:36.090> get<00:04:36.390> every

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
nighttime sensor you get every

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.790 
nighttime sensor you get every
thing<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.670> ever<00:04:37.910> wanted<00:04:38.540> because<00:04:39.530> you<00:04:39.650> can

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
thing you ever wanted because you can

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.130 
thing you ever wanted because you can
tell<00:04:39.980> exactly<00:04:40.100> when<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.610> moon<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.180> at<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
tell exactly when the moon is at the

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.570 
tell exactly when the moon is at the
highest<00:04:42.290> point<00:04:42.890> which<00:04:43.100> is<00:04:43.220> something<00:04:43.490> you

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
highest point which is something you

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.930 
highest point which is something you
couldn't<00:04:43.850> do<00:04:44.290> with<00:04:45.290> just<00:04:46.130> the<00:04:46.280> inverted

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
couldn't do with just the inverted

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.680 
couldn't do with just the inverted
daylight<00:04:47.600> sensor<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:49.280> may<00:04:49.820> be<00:04:49.880> simpler<00:04:50.420> for

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
daylight sensor it may be simpler for

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.860 
daylight sensor it may be simpler for
you<00:04:50.840> to<00:04:51.740> invert<00:04:52.640> it<00:04:52.790> or<00:04:52.940> if<00:04:53.120> you<00:04:53.270> want<00:04:53.510> to<00:04:53.570> see

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
you to invert it or if you want to see

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.560 
you to invert it or if you want to see
how<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.140> invert<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.800> it's<00:04:55.310> very<00:04:55.580> simple<00:04:56.060> let's

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
how you invert it it's very simple let's

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.070 
how you invert it it's very simple let's
go<00:04:56.690> ahead<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.080> give<00:04:57.410> us<00:04:57.560> some<00:04:57.770> light<00:04:57.950> here

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
go ahead and give us some light here

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.630 
go ahead and give us some light here
inverting<00:05:00.080> the<00:05:00.200> signal<00:05:00.560> is<00:05:00.740> just<00:05:01.130> as<00:05:01.340> simple

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
inverting the signal is just as simple

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.180 
inverting the signal is just as simple
as<00:05:01.940> it<00:05:02.090> has<00:05:02.360> always<00:05:02.660> been<00:05:03.080> all<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:03.830> have<00:05:03.920> to<00:05:04.040> do

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
as it has always been all you have to do

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.970 
as it has always been all you have to do
is<00:05:04.460> put<00:05:04.940> down<00:05:05.120> a<00:05:05.150> block<00:05:05.600> with<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.560> redstone

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
is put down a block with the redstone

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.910 
is put down a block with the redstone
pointing<00:05:07.340> into<00:05:07.640> the<00:05:07.760> block<00:05:08.000> and<00:05:08.270> then<00:05:08.930> a<00:05:09.290> torch

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
pointing into the block and then a torch

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.310 
pointing into the block and then a torch
on<00:05:10.220> top<00:05:10.400> of<00:05:10.610> that<00:05:10.730> so<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.720> torch<00:05:11.990> will<00:05:12.170> be

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
on top of that so the torch will be

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.170 
on top of that so the torch will be
turned<00:05:12.590> off<00:05:12.770> when<00:05:13.310> there<00:05:13.490> is<00:05:13.640> a<00:05:13.670> redstone

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
turned off when there is a redstone

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.700 
turned off when there is a redstone
signal<00:05:14.390> applied<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.140> if<00:05:15.230> we<00:05:15.320> just<00:05:15.530> go<00:05:15.650> ahead

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
signal applied and if we just go ahead

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.440 
signal applied and if we just go ahead
and<00:05:15.890> turn<00:05:15.980> that<00:05:16.010> off<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.880> torch<00:05:17.120> will<00:05:17.270> turn

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
and turn that off the torch will turn

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.510 
and turn that off the torch will turn
back<00:05:17.690> on<00:05:17.960> if<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.320> stick<00:05:18.590> of<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.770> block<00:05:19.040> is<00:05:19.280> in

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 
back on if the stick of the block is in

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.870 
back on if the stick of the block is in
side<00:05:20.060> of<00:05:20.590> the<00:05:21.590> block<00:05:22.190> of<00:05:22.430> the<00:05:22.550> stick<00:05:22.730> of<00:05:22.850> the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
side of the block of the stick of the

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.490 
side of the block of the stick of the
torch<00:05:23.270> is<00:05:23.450> inside<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.840> the<00:05:23.960> block<00:05:24.170> I<00:05:24.320> should

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
torch is inside of the block I should

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.220 
torch is inside of the block I should
say<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:26.210> that<00:05:26.390> is<00:05:26.570> a<00:05:26.600> little<00:05:26.840> bit<00:05:27.050> about

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
say so that is a little bit about

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.920 
say so that is a little bit about
daylight<00:05:27.620> sensors<00:05:27.980> what<00:05:28.340> can<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.390> make<00:05:29.690> with

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
daylight sensors what can you make with

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.260 
daylight sensors what can you make with
these<00:05:30.340> well<00:05:31.340> of<00:05:31.550> course<00:05:31.610> you<00:05:31.970> can<00:05:32.120> make

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
these well of course you can make

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.140 
these well of course you can make
automatic<00:05:32.690> lights<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.380> turn<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.920> once<00:05:34.820> it<00:05:35.090> is

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
automatic lights that turn on once it is

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.040 
automatic lights that turn on once it is
nighttime<00:05:35.690> in<00:05:36.140> fact<00:05:36.380> it<00:05:36.530> is<00:05:36.680> very<00:05:37.130> simple<00:05:37.490> now

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
nighttime in fact it is very simple now

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.710 
nighttime in fact it is very simple now
with<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.430> redstone<00:05:40.430> lamp<00:05:40.850> and<00:05:41.150> a<00:05:41.420> daylight

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
with a redstone lamp and a daylight

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.710 
with a redstone lamp and a daylight
sensor<00:05:41.930> on<00:05:42.410> top<00:05:42.770> turn<00:05:43.310> that<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.910> nighttime

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
sensor on top turn that to nighttime

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.780 
sensor on top turn that to nighttime
mode<00:05:44.990> and<00:05:45.380> whenever<00:05:46.250> it's<00:05:46.550> night

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
mode and whenever it's night

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:50.380 
mode and whenever it's night
doo-doo-doo-doo<00:05:47.890> the<00:05:48.890> blocks<00:05:49.280> turn<00:05:49.670> on<00:05:49.880> which

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
doo-doo-doo-doo the blocks turn on which

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.660 
doo-doo-doo-doo the blocks turn on which
is<00:05:50.540> really<00:05:50.870> really<00:05:51.200> neat<00:05:51.530> very<00:05:51.950> simple<00:05:52.460> and

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:52.670 
is really really neat very simple and

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.020 
is really really neat very simple and
compact<00:05:53.180> now<00:05:53.770> you<00:05:54.770> could<00:05:54.920> do<00:05:55.010> that<00:05:55.160> and

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
compact now you could do that and

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.180 
compact now you could do that and
there's<00:05:56.300> of<00:05:56.420> course<00:05:56.450> other<00:05:56.990> things<00:05:57.320> where<00:05:57.710> you

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
there's of course other things where you

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.650 
there's of course other things where you
could<00:05:58.370> set<00:05:58.670> up<00:05:58.700> so<00:05:59.180> that<00:05:59.660> maybe<00:06:00.410> once<00:06:00.860> the

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660 
could set up so that maybe once the

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.650 
could set up so that maybe once the
redstone<00:06:02.660> signal<00:06:02.840> is<00:06:03.170> tripped<00:06:03.500> twice<00:06:03.800> or<00:06:04.220> so

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:04.660 
redstone signal is tripped twice or so

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.720 
redstone signal is tripped twice or so
that<00:06:05.830> something<00:06:06.830> happens<00:06:07.100> oh<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:07.400> means

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
that something happens oh that means

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.210 
that something happens oh that means
like<00:06:07.910> two<00:06:08.120> days<00:06:08.300> have<00:06:08.570> passed<00:06:08.840> then<00:06:09.410> it<00:06:09.800> could

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
like two days have passed then it could

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.730 
like two days have passed then it could
turn<00:06:11.150> on<00:06:11.300> water<00:06:11.600> and<00:06:11.870> auto<00:06:12.200> harvest<00:06:12.620> your

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
turn on water and auto harvest your

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.980 
turn on water and auto harvest your
potatoes<00:06:13.310> or<00:06:15.160> maybe<00:06:16.160> every<00:06:16.700> second<00:06:17.270> day<00:06:17.450> the

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.990 
potatoes or maybe every second day the

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.830 
potatoes or maybe every second day the
door<00:06:18.710> is<00:06:18.980> unlocked<00:06:19.190> or<00:06:19.730> maybe<00:06:19.970> the<00:06:20.450> doors

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
door is unlocked or maybe the doors

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.520 
door is unlocked or maybe the doors
become<00:06:21.410> locked<00:06:21.710> at<00:06:21.950> night<00:06:21.980> so<00:06:22.820> that<00:06:23.530> moms

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
become locked at night so that moms

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.770 
become locked at night so that moms
can't<00:06:24.860> get<00:06:25.010> in<00:06:25.160> but<00:06:25.370> during<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:25.730> day<00:06:25.910> all<00:06:26.600> your

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:26.780 
can't get in but during the day all your
