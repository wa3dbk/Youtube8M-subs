00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.040 
clear acrylic unit what I like it with
the<00:00:59.640> acrylic<00:01:00.300> is<00:01:00.450> the<00:01:00.570> fact<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:00.840> they're

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
the acrylic is the fact that they're

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.579 
the acrylic is the fact that they're
clear<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.800> can<00:01:01.950> see<00:01:02.190> through<00:01:02.460> them<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.589> um

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
clear you can see through them and um

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.520 
clear you can see through them and um
yeah<00:01:05.460> they<00:01:05.759> like<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:07.020> through<00:01:07.320> them

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
yeah they like you can see through them

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.160 
yeah they like you can see through them
so<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:07.800> they're<00:01:08.610> not<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:09.000> visually<00:01:09.270> heavy<00:01:09.899> as

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
so they they're not as visually heavy as

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.620 
so they they're not as visually heavy as
something<00:01:10.860> solid<00:01:11.340> would<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.149> of<00:01:12.600> course

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
something solid would be and of course

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.600 
something solid would be and of course
it<00:01:12.899> wouldn't<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.259> Juliet<00:01:13.860> video<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.399> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
it wouldn't be a Juliet video if the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.800 
it wouldn't be a Juliet video if the
battery<00:01:14.880> didn't<00:01:15.119> run<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.509> soon<00:01:15.630> as<00:01:15.720> I

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
use this section here for cotton pads

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.180 
use this section here for cotton pads
because<00:02:49.870> i<00:02:50.049> don't<00:02:50.230> use<00:02:50.379> cotton<00:02:50.620> balls<00:02:50.889> i<00:02:51.040> use

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
because i don't use cotton balls i use

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.680 
because i don't use cotton balls i use
cotton<00:02:51.400> pad<00:02:51.670> so<00:02:51.909> they<00:02:52.000> don't<00:02:52.150> really<00:02:52.329> fit<00:02:52.599> in

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
cotton pad so they don't really fit in

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.030 
cotton pad so they don't really fit in
here<00:02:52.870> properly<00:02:53.109> there's<00:02:53.530> they're<00:02:53.829> just

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
here properly there's they're just

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.710 
here properly there's they're just
they're<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.459> little<00:02:54.790> bit<00:02:54.970> smaller<00:02:55.299> than<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
they're a little bit smaller than the

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.789

than<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.650> than<00:02:57.639> the<00:02:57.790> space<00:02:58.030> so<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:59.530> kind<00:02:59.739> of

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
than the than the space so it's kind of

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.460 
than the than the space so it's kind of
wasted<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.489> have<00:03:00.639> them<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:00.909> there<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:02.170> i<00:03:02.200> just
