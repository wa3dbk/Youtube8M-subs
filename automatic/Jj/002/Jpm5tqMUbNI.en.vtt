00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.780
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.370
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.500
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.730
 solmecke and it is sunday for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 ask your users and we start 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.680
 directly with a user question from 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.780
 sargent aggression I have asked for one 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 ask how is the legal situation 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.740
 if a friend is wrong about that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.190
 portal music and movies right for you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:33.089
 pulls down and then me the usb stick 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:36.199
 I can say very clearly if you 

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:39.899
 know that he illegal the films 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.539
 downloaded then you know that 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.059
 These privately copy to be made out 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.999
 has been obvious from one 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.859
 comes from illegal source and then it is 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:50.460
 no private copy the whole thing would be 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:52.710
 illegal 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.909
 but if you do not know where he came from 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.949
 where did the music came from? 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.289
 a private copy and you are more or 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.719
 less off the tailor 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.110
 he expands the question says and what is 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.880
 if the friend is in holland 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.130
 has downloaded or in Switzerland in 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 Austria let's say holland there 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.200
 it is not a rule that you are illegal 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.060
 sources can not download anything 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.310
 and then brings it draws me on 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 the usb-stick and he brings me with 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.659
 I would say okay now if you 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.119
 that was allowed in Holland then that was not 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 illegal copy and then for that too 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.780
 make a copy of it but that is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.789
 that should be very tricky 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.929
 litigation are coming to us, we 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.079
 check this in a particular case 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.200
 next question from two player he says to 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.719
 it is also legal to rip a topic 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.039
 cd and welded to purchase them 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.590
 to move home and then again 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.749
 to exchange 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.579
 that should be legal right of withdrawal 

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:53.420
 Amazon for example and as long as he does not 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.549
 a seal breaks and a seal can 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.710
 already the welded cd can see that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.990
 some dishes different but careful 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.270
 I say a welded to fed 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.409
 cd is a seal if you break that 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.719
 you have no right of revocation anymore 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.000
 So take a non-welded cd 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.899
 You can buy them and if I can you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.299
 thereafter 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.340
 he made a copy of it and afterwards 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.510
 you decide that you are the one 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.370
 Do not want to have more then you can 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.610
 make use of the right of revocation and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.049
 the private copy which you are allowed to keep 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.239
 because you have a copy of one 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.819
 made legal source, it would be too 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.569
 Often the flies out at Amazon 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.549
 last question comes from decorative 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:37.370
 decorative operates a blog about 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:39.950
 deco items admired 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.079
 nomen est omen the name says it already 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.549
 and he or she says I had one 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.959
 problem that people have my pictures on 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.090
 I want to publish interest 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.799
 not really because I lose it 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.549
 according to pinter of the agb the rights to the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.769
 how can I counter it? 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.659
 protect and what do I do about that 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.790
 already published pictures now clear 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:58.379
 oh you have the rights to your pictures 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.790
 no matter where they are published 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.079
 however, you can defend yourself 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.090
 because you have that on your blog 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.340
 pinterits button included 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.590
 then I say yes that is a license 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.239
 issuing a license granting that 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.709
 People are allowed to share interest 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.060
 you can not get the button 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.340
 also do not use 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.419
 two ways either you know those 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.310
 then you can say people is one 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.949
 copyright infringement would even be 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.870
 get money or if you are the people 

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.639
 who do not identify the fatal 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.379
 then you can synonymous interest 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.299
 please contact me directly please take it 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.510
 then do not take this down 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.970
 then you can also warn there if 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.280
 the all too complicated comes 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.290
 to us we can also help you 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.229
 We thank others for the users' questions 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.030
 post it here under youtube video 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.209
 We take the users with the questions 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.109
 Most thumbs up so we drive them 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.359
 some can answer that way 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.889
 complicated and complex that we do 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.690
 not even ask a user 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:53.400
 then we can call and we call 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.019
