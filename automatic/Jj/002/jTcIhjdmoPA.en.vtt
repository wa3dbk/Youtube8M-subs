hello I'm Tony mama with airflo research
cylinder<00:00:03.659> heads<00:00:03.870> and<00:00:04.460> give<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> quick<00:00:06.120> tour

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
cylinder heads and give you a quick tour

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.870 
cylinder heads and give you a quick tour
of<00:00:06.839> our<00:00:07.109> cylinder<00:00:07.529> heads<00:00:07.770> here<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.040> SEMA<00:00:08.280> 2012

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:10.880 
of our cylinder heads here at SEMA 2012

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.580 
of our cylinder heads here at SEMA 2012
23-degree<00:00:11.880> heads<00:00:12.120> would<00:00:12.450> kind<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.019> start<00:00:13.320> here

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
23-degree heads would kind of start here

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.820 
23-degree heads would kind of start here
we<00:00:13.740> have<00:00:13.889> our<00:00:14.160> 180<00:00:15.000> heads<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.740> of

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
we have our 180 heads and we kind of

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.250 
we have our 180 heads and we kind of
move<00:00:16.980> up<00:00:17.190> in<00:00:17.310> CCS<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.090> valve<00:00:18.330> size<00:00:18.630> depending

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
move up in CCS and valve size depending

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.140 
move up in CCS and valve size depending
on<00:00:19.400> displacement<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.430> engines<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.910> you<00:00:21.029> know

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

you<00:00:21.449> guys<00:00:21.630> might<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.990> building<00:00:22.230> we<00:00:23.189> also<00:00:23.369> have

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
you guys might be building we also have

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
you guys might be building we also have
different<00:00:25.350> levels<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.920> porting<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> pricing

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
different levels of porting and pricing

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.900 
different levels of porting and pricing
as<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.840> good<00:00:28.080> example<00:00:28.439> of<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.640> our

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
as a good example of that this is our

the<00:00:33.989> CNC<00:00:34.350> porting<00:00:34.829> levels<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> little

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the CNC porting levels are a little

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.220 
the CNC porting levels are a little
rougher<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.570> still<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:36.840> full<00:00:37.290> CNC<00:00:38.190> piece

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
rougher it's still a full CNC piece

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.920 
rougher it's still a full CNC piece
great<00:00:40.230> value<00:00:40.620> for<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.860> money<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
great value for the money this is the

great value for the money this is the
this<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.290> bang<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.829> buck

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
this would be the bang for the buck

you we have a competition ported version
of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> same<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.760> flows<00:01:00.180> 10<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.629> 15<00:01:00.989> more<00:01:01.170> CFM

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
of the same it flows 10 or 15 more CFM

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.639 
of the same it flows 10 or 15 more CFM
you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> CNC<00:01:03.239> levels<00:01:03.629> are<00:01:03.750> finer

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
you can see the CNC levels are finer

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.710 
you can see the CNC levels are finer
chamber<00:01:06.399> almost<00:01:06.670> looks<00:01:06.880> polish<00:01:07.329> this<00:01:07.600> is

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
chamber almost looks polish this is

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.889 
chamber almost looks polish this is
actually<00:01:08.049> a<00:01:08.079> very<00:01:08.229> fine<00:01:08.590> C&amp;C<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.720> head

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
actually a very fine C&amp;C and this head

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.270 
actually a very fine C&amp;C and this head
is<00:01:10.990> about<00:01:11.140> five<00:01:11.409> hundred<00:01:11.560> dollars<00:01:11.890> more<00:01:12.130> and

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
is about five hundred dollars more and

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.649 
is about five hundred dollars more and
again<00:01:12.520> it's<00:01:12.670> for<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.000> guy<00:01:13.180> that's<00:01:13.390> looking

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
again it's for that guy that's looking

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.249 
again it's for that guy that's looking
for<00:01:14.079> every<00:01:14.920> edge<00:01:15.070> he<00:01:15.310> can<00:01:15.460> get<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:16.329> to<00:01:17.079> make

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
for every edge he can get to to make

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.330 
for every edge he can get to to make
more<00:01:17.439> horsepower<00:01:18.539> this<00:01:19.539> kind<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:20.340> scenario

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
race line of cylinder heads are 227 our

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.800 
race line of cylinder heads are 227 our
235<00:01:46.100> in<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.579> particular<00:01:48.119> case<00:01:48.299> we<00:01:48.509> start

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
235 in this particular case we start

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.809 
235 in this particular case we start
moving<00:01:48.960> valves<00:01:49.590> for<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:49.979> performance<00:01:50.159> well

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
moving valves for more performance well

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.599 
moving valves for more performance well
we'll<00:01:51.600> move<00:01:51.719> the<00:01:51.899> intake<00:01:52.229> valve<00:01:52.469> closer<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
we'll move the intake valve closer to

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:55.370 
we'll move the intake valve closer to
the<00:01:53.729> center<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.209> chamber<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.840> should<00:01:55.259> say

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the center of the chamber I should say

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.779 
the center of the chamber I should say
to<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> center<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.829> the<00:01:55.890> cylinder<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.459> it

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
to the center of the cylinder so it

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:58.339 
to the center of the cylinder so it
makes<00:01:56.969> more<00:01:57.119> room<00:01:57.179> around<00:01:57.539> here<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> allow

00:01:58.339 --> 00:01:58.349 
makes more room around here to allow
