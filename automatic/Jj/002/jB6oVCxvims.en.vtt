00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:05.060
 hello you love i am mira again 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.529
 and today with a very special one 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.960
 chocolate cake recipe and one 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.809
 library is a chocolate cake that is 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.910
 super delicious and super juicy and great 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.570
 and you really leave the flour 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.670
 not in it 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.980
 it's only important that you do that 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.060
 especially good chocolate take 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 One must be fed up with the chocolate 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.119
 his 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.170
 with at least 70 percent 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.910
 cocoa and just a little something 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.009
 higher quality chocolate that's worth it 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 in retrospect for the taste and the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.629
 I hacked and chopped chocolate 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.570
 Add butter and over the water 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.070
 then melt both now, so to speak 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.660
 to the water is still to say that it 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.850
 it is best if the bowl that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.219
 Water does not touch directly, so to speak 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.449
 only the steam heated the bowl 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.050
 in the chocolate around the butter 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.520
 are grint 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.379
 and while that's going on 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.820
 We're already melting 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.100
 time to separate eggs 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.829
 That's our next task 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.420
 both need egg yolk and protein and 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.960
 I have two keys here for that 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 trains the eggs later on 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.850
 It's all about beating a meringue 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.689
 important that in the protein really only 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.600
 So even no money come 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.470
 since the very strict at the meeting 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.659
 chocolate and butter are ready 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.000
 melted and during that now at 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.290
 cools us down a bit I take 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.720
 me the pc before 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.890
 I have the protein for that 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.079
 I have been very careful 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 that there is no yolk in it and 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.500
 It is also important that the bowl in 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.880
 you beat the egg white nice and dry 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.710
 and there are all now in 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.649
 and beat that up to the point 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.509
 to a scary white not breezy 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.079
 mass forms and would then slowly the 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.079
 great for that 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.400
 if all this then about one 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 consistency is so beautiful is very strong 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.020
 you do not know any more about the color 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.380
 away then we face each other 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.869
 page 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.760
 he is finished and take us 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.290
 the chocolate is back as is now 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.270
 so cool down from the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.670
 temperature could be wonderful for 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.980
 continue processing and now I take 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:28.510
 me a lot that I still left here 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:30.070
 I have to and have to do that now 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.050
 we both still connect them together 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:36.220
 and for that I leave the chocolate now 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:42.040
 to the essence to how they've all 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:43.540
 with a spatula under this can 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.070
 In any case, no whisk 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.500
 used and no hand mixer 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.400
 you really just have to do it completely 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.840
 Take care and run 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.410
 Danger that the protein is in itself again 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.410
 coincides 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.060
 this is our finished product now 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 chocolate cake part just fantastic 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.480
 and here I have my springform 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.640
 Finished buttered and with baking paper 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.739
 designed that she is a twenties 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.439
 springform is enough for the dough now 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.150
 as he is exactly when you are a 26 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.489
 he jumps tree at home so have one 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.290
 normal big then you just have to 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.620
 half of the ingredients again above 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.459
 on it count therefore instead of 46 eggs and so 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.530
 on and on 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.069
 and now that was just nice 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:37.440
 here in my wife purely because the whole 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:40.019
 then come in the oven and the whole 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.209
 now comes at 180 degrees air circulation in the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.310
 preheated oven for 20 minutes 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.290
 about if you have a bigger one 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.109
 springform used then it takes 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.970
 Of course a little longer probably like that 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.069
 30 minutes and this is the finished one 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.079
 chocolate cake and if you are a bit 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:57.079
 more comes then I'll cut it 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:08.520
 oh my god is so chocolate 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.520
 Do not wait to try 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.690
 a dream that is so chocolat has become 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.940
 the hammer almost did a lot of chocolates 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.820
 or just so juicy 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.440
 just great makes him necessarily 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.210
 I can only recommend you tell me how 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.740
 it has become with you who let 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.120
 Comments also look at the others
