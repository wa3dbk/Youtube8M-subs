 well block everything and all kinds at her for the first time 

00:00:09.069 --> 00:00:12.939
 it's not a simple evolution of the legendary model four times 

00:00:12.939 --> 00:00:15.919
 winner of the paris-dakar rally in the 80s 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.089
 on the contrary 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:23.229
 thaksin shinawatra and the 2004 vintage it marks the starting point of a 

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.779
 true revolution 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.500
 focused on efficiency 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.500
 performance and above all driving pleasure 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.340
 opening lines this piece picks up all the elements already 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.750
 existing on previous versions paul minn 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 starting with the fairing reduced to its simplest expression 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.630
 it has an adjustable protection bubble and the mudguard before standby 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.480
 two ducks 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.630
 or other rich according to the imagination 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.260
 the party-cycle keeps the same architecture very sober with a 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.190
 suspension system peter the breeder front snails of aubrac for the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.190
 rear gimbal transmission 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.720
 the dashboard equipped with a control computer proves to be very 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.450
 functional and readable 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 g not to mention the presence of a gps really reliable 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.500
 a particularly practical option for traveling but rather expensive 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.990
 look at another well-thought-out element the variable volume rear panniers 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.000
 a clever idea so simple and functional we wonder why 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.119
 nobody thought about maurepas and gold 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.090
 surmounted by a tank of synthetic materials the twin-cylinder flat 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.520
 now displays a cylinder capacity of 170 cubic centimeters it is 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.640
 spent an electronic injection with his club during a pot control 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.080
 catalytic exhaust system and delivers a power of 98 horsepower 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 18% better than the old version 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.280
 although she announces a weight loss of 30 kilos 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.720
 she still remains so we propose with her 225 kilos 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.869
 its heavyweight gauge inspires respect 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.670
 but just as much as it sounds all the apprehensions 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.670
 disappear from the first few laps 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.929
 an excellent distribution of masses to combine a standing position 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:22.379
 adjustable an exemplary motor flexibility make it possible to feel very 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.209
 quickly at ease 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.209
 the fact remains that they remain physical in Baden-Baden 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.019
 comfortable and powerful at 60 hours acts it displays no defect 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:35.939
 known 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.119
 his handling is as perfect as his braking 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.209
 the gearbox and more accurate and reports well storied 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.159
 so we take a lot of fun to swing the contents of a turn to 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.509
 the other in the manner of a real sportswoman 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:50.320
 under the eye of a few spectators 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.409
 always very attentive 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.369
 real beast to devour the bitumen of diabetes 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.069
 it is also she also think outside the box 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.989
 that we commit to the South African rolling tracks to the sets 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:01.849
 grandiose 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.509
 when passing the text 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.509
 it can adapt to all types of terrain without mentioning 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.039
 to make a difference 

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:16.489
 and a versatility that smells of perfection the gs all we go as 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.139
 main defect because high purchase price 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:22.129
 indeed it is displayed at 13,800 barberot 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:24.180
 without women quasi variable bag 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.689
 indispensable and the gps 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.219
 a rate that can slow down your desires for escape and wide open spaces 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:32.859
