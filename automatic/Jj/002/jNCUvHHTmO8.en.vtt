00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.920
 how about movie friends gamers and 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.900
 Welcome to a new Monday of Monday 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.180
 of design in villages and if so it's friends 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.610
 as many have been asking here for 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.240
 end we bring a city hall design 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.220
 level 8 this destination of memory is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.779
 anti farming then I hope that what 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.630
 enjoy as you can see good I'm 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.970
 using my account from the second village to 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.820
 the one that looks gamer the one in which 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.460
 incurred 1.0 to see that there is no 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.710
 I have everything I need because if then 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.780
 I half doubted him about repeating 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.579
 I do not have this then you know that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.429
 to not make me balls better I'm going to my 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.329
 second account and here you can see then what 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.949
 that we are going to need this one 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.929
 considering that we are using 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:48.140
 this air traffic controller as a point of 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.940
 base if you feel that I put them in the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.589
 part of below if you feel that you are attacked 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.960
 more for the top part then 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.780
 you simply move it nothing else so 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.719
 you want for the top part there's no 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.969
 so much that to think about it there I feel that 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.630
 this design will like you very much I hope 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:08.270
 so be it and this is not for trolling 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.710
 it is simply this farming of the old 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.850
 school that I've also seen that I 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.179
 they had been asking for two brains 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.149
 antillon and here is a 10 and a new 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:20.270
 design as good the four goalkeepers 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.830
 this air traffic controller and if they have 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.140
 Any doubt or comment I can 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.719
 leave here below also while 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:32.960
 put them music without copyright is 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.000
 I always remembered I already made another design 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.259
 then that design curiously first 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.869
 I'm uploading this before the other 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.270
 design I do not understand why but good 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.219
 I already have another design ready then 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.780
 is going to be with you is not all ready 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.850
 so that they simply put it on 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.670
 unlock button and you can 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.310
 enjoy and can use it is a design 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.409
 for wars and I'm not going to tell you this 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.140
 what levels for it to be present 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.960
 with a little curiosity the idea is 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 arrive 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 to this video today if you are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.270
 seeing my friends from Spain who are 7 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.430
 hours apart and that they are already 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.170
 doing a little late remember that the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.539
 goal is to keep the schedule 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.340
 from mexico then you here with the 7 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.640
 hours - of your schedule when you are 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.010
 seeing but good if it is in the idea of 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.319
 today is to reach 200 likes with 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 this video we have reached 300 to 400 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.190
 we have reached 1,000 likes in this 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.440
 channel friends then 200 are made to me 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.010
 very very simple we are almost two thousand 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.830
 people 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.019
 these subscribers and all then I think 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.360
 that then a very very easy goal 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.250
 If you arrive even if it's eleven thirty 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.680
 night I promise that I give to 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.600
 unlock button and they will have this 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.269
 War design I just give you a clue 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.820
 this town hall the level that can be 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.290
 the city â€‹â€‹hall 7 up I do not know if 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:50.000
 the only clue that school can be the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.000
 7 of 08/09/10 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.050
 So, well , I'll leave you homework 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.670
 if the idea beats them and that hopefully 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.870
 achieves in those 200 lex and not so good 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.879
 this video is created the following week 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.560
 I think that with that is all we are going to 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.580

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.060
 work they can have in the 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.680
 comments that worked so much for me 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.500
