00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.250
 think of the excess of peace to the point fr it is necessary to make a small presentation 

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:05.390
 of our francophone school 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.670
 to start I just want to put his own in the oar to prove that 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.750
 we are of course a ready to know the patient is private or whatever 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.249
 is 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.119
 one as you can see he has a lot of people left right 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:17.419
 so he does not really have any doubt possible ensures 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.640
 I'm just going to give it a little bit longer to show the end the 

00:00:20.639 --> 00:00:24.320
 amount the group has accumulated on this character so this person 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.860
 it's a character terms of the conquered alliance to make your text about 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.990
 technical enrichment plans that are in the guide allah like you 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.170
 can see it i'm just going to put myself in sion must generate not far from 35 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.079
 minutes is above all that is not bad at least if it is widely 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.100
 enough to do a lot of things 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.020
 and that's really funny next we already buy everything it was 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.570
 rare so it's 35 miles more to the big near field 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.790
 so our guide more fr fr is actually a french version of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.050
 our guide for the English-speaking public 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.000
 there is a lot of talk about bordeaux for trade which deals with the school of an ex-star 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.240
 ac 'but in fact we noticed that it does not really peter much for the 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.760
 french nothing there some stuff on ip liked it's frankly not 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.520
 interesting and in general it's not my poor in content and none of 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 operating techniques so the fight fully adapted our guide 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.840
 to Francophones he is 100% French with the French team that deals 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.940
 to make ecce terra updates 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.750
 with our guide we guarantee you can generate not far from 600 more 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.070
 their top easily because this technique of the wealthiest players 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.960
 a duty still work hard so talk 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.990
 you do not need for that to have a class - particular stage the guide 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.050
 really suitable for all players solo or in group et cetera it is also 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.580
 optimistic both for the alliance and for europe 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.010
 we do not use illegal technique all summer at the highest point won 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.960
 with our guides are 100% legitimate otherwise the guide was created when 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.060
 the new extension is out now that could not content for 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.640
 down after two years and with each significant minor update since 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.290
 that we put the guide added the release of the patch with the news 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.090
 heads 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.720
 and we skip those that could not really be used 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.830
 Guide updates are available for free download for 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.320
 all the players already done in 2010 and his aunt or existing 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.729
 so that's just briefly what our graduates offer I leave you 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.920
 directly on the site of peace point fr for more information and 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.220
 to have a little overview of the techniques present in the team 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.610
 this is a very good day
