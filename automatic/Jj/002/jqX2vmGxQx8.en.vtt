yeah<00:00:01.110> I<00:00:01.140> was<00:00:01.319> testing<00:00:01.740> out<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.040> little

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
yeah I was testing out this little

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.840 
yeah I was testing out this little
theory<00:00:03.230> normally<00:00:04.230> sometimes<00:00:04.710> I'll<00:00:04.980> use<00:00:05.009> a

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
theory normally sometimes I'll use a

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.160 
theory normally sometimes I'll use a
charge<00:00:06.779> controller<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.269> son<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.750> know<00:00:09.929> a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
charge controller with a son you know a

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.249 
charge controller with a son you know a
panel<00:00:10.980> solar<00:00:11.250> panel<00:00:11.700> because<00:00:12.450> if<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:12.929> have<00:00:13.110> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
panel solar panel because if you have to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.560 
panel solar panel because if you have to
have<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.410> charge<00:00:13.740> controller<00:00:13.920> or<00:00:14.490> else<00:00:14.730> you'll

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
have a charge controller or else you'll

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
have a charge controller or else you'll
overcharge<00:00:16.279> the<00:00:17.570> you<00:00:18.570> know<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.779> battery<00:00:18.990> you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
overcharge the you know the battery you

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.950 
overcharge the you know the battery you
know<00:00:19.710> normal<00:00:20.070> battery<00:00:20.430> that<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.390> panel<00:00:21.810> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
know normal battery that is panel you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.480 
know normal battery that is panel you
don't<00:00:22.109> need<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> charge<00:00:22.680> controller<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.369> it

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
don't need a charge controller with it

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
don't need a charge controller with it
because<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.850> pretty<00:00:24.240> small<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:25.410> know

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
because it's pretty small but you know

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.529 
because it's pretty small but you know
what<00:00:25.710> it's<00:00:25.920> about<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.430> right<00:00:26.640> exact<00:00:27.119> size<00:00:27.359> I'm

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
what it's about the right exact size I'm

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.700 
what it's about the right exact size I'm
going<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.720> show<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.990> dimensions<00:00:28.140> here

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
going to show you the dimensions here

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.160 
going to show you the dimensions here
you<00:00:29.340> can<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.730> it's<00:00:30.119> about<00:00:30.269> eleven<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> half

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you can see it's about eleven and a half

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.500 
you can see it's about eleven and a half
inches<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:32.340> say<00:00:32.550> twelve<00:00:32.880> inches<00:00:33.210> with<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
inches well say twelve inches with the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
inches well say twelve inches with the
plastic<00:00:34.050> you<00:00:34.829> know<00:00:34.950> like<00:00:35.219> not<00:00:35.399> showing<00:00:35.850> it's

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
plastic you know like not showing it's

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.600 
plastic you know like not showing it's
probably<00:00:36.329> underneath<00:00:36.690> there<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.829> about

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
probably underneath there and about

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.119 
probably underneath there and about
three<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> half<00:00:39.480> four<00:00:39.750> inches<00:00:40.110> wide<00:00:40.170> so

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
three and a half four inches wide so

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.380 
three and a half four inches wide so
basically<00:00:41.550> you're<00:00:41.820> probably<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.329> probably

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
basically you're probably it's probably

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.010 
basically you're probably it's probably
advertised<00:00:43.200> by<00:00:43.500> twelve<00:00:43.860> inches<00:00:44.160> long<00:00:44.520> and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.020 
advertised by twelve inches long and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.959 
advertised by twelve inches long and
four<00:00:46.020> inches<00:00:46.200> wide

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
four inches wide

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.910 
four inches wide
now<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.210> have<00:00:48.390> not<00:00:48.570> checked<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:49.079> battery<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
now I have not checked this battery I

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.580 
now I have not checked this battery I
have<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> thing<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:50.969> see<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.809> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
have on this thing you see it's on it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.740 
have on this thing you see it's on it's
up<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.829> top<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> here<00:00:53.670> it's<00:00:54.000> facing<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.510> Sun

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
up on top to here it's facing the Sun

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.080 
up on top to here it's facing the Sun
pretty<00:00:55.020> good<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:56.190> not<00:00:56.309> super<00:00:56.730> clean<00:00:56.940> or

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
pretty good it's not super clean or

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.490 
pretty good it's not super clean or
nothing<00:00:57.390> either<00:00:57.510> it's<00:00:57.989> probably<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
nothing either it's probably going to

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.380 
nothing either it's probably going to
get<00:00:58.649> cleaned<00:00:58.890> right<00:00:59.100> now<00:00:59.309> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
get cleaned right now you can see the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.110 
get cleaned right now you can see the
wire<00:01:00.570> goes<00:01:00.780> down<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.680> right<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.039> it's<00:01:02.969> just

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
wire goes down all right and it's just

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
wire goes down all right and it's just
attached<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> battery<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> battery

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
attached to a battery now this battery

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.810 
attached to a battery now this battery
is<00:01:05.820> actually<00:01:06.210> old<00:01:06.689> as<00:01:06.930> all<00:01:07.229> hell<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.070> I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is actually old as all hell it's it's I

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.789 
is actually old as all hell it's it's I
know<00:01:09.570> that's<00:01:09.780> probably<00:01:09.869> five<00:01:10.229> years<00:01:10.260> old<00:01:10.590> when

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
know that's probably five years old when

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
know that's probably five years old when
it's<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:11.010> still<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.369> excellent<00:01:11.610> shape<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:12.869> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
it's in still in excellent shape but I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.130 
it's in still in excellent shape but I
just<00:01:13.170> keep<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.430> keep<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:15.140> solar

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
just keep it like just keep this solar

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440 
just keep it like just keep this solar
panel<00:01:16.229> attached<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.280> now<00:01:17.790> I'm<00:01:18.090> talking

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
panel attached to it now I'm talking

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690 
panel attached to it now I'm talking
about<00:01:18.540> cost<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.500> panel<00:01:19.979> might<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.610> don't

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
about cost that panel might be I don't

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.950 
about cost that panel might be I don't
know<00:01:21.000> ten<00:01:21.509> bucks<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:24.600> don't<00:01:24.780> need<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
know ten bucks and you don't need a

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
know ten bucks and you don't need a
charge<00:01:25.350> controller<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.220> because<00:01:26.310> it's<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
charge controller with it because it's a

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
charge controller with it because it's a
very<00:01:26.670> low<00:01:27.119> output<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.900> sometimes<00:01:28.350> they're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
very low output but sometimes they're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.670 
very low output but sometimes they're
too<00:01:28.770> low<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.729> seems<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.210> be<00:01:30.360> just<00:01:30.930> right

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
too low it seems to be just right

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.310 
too low it seems to be just right
because<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.850> like<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.270> put<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.750> battery

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
because it like I put the battery

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.069 
because it like I put the battery
charger<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:36.390> didn't<00:01:36.540> charge<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
charger on it and I didn't charge it I

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.109 
charger on it and I didn't charge it I
was<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.500> was<00:01:37.740> expecting<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.729> down<00:01:39.090> a

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
was I was expecting to see it down a

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.200 
was I was expecting to see it down a
little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:40.040> because<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.520> another<00:01:41.759> panel

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
little bit because I have another panel

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.060 
little bit because I have another panel
that<00:01:42.240> always<00:01:42.689> on<00:01:42.930> another<00:01:43.380> battery<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.040> I

that always on another battery that I

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
that always on another battery that I
have<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.460> keep<00:01:44.610> charging<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.240> every<00:01:45.540> once<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.869> a

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
size solar panel and it's like we have a

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.569 
size solar panel and it's like we have a
combination<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:03.350> what<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.409> call<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.710> overcast

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
combination of what we call it overcast

to overcook them or nothing because
they're<00:02:35.250> too<00:02:35.400> small<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.330> don't

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
they're too small for that you don't

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.729 
they're too small for that you don't
really<00:02:36.569> need<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> charge<00:02:37.140> controller<00:02:37.260> with

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739

this thing that's the beauty of it so
you<00:02:40.349> get<00:02:40.799> these<00:02:40.950> panels<00:02:41.430> for<00:02:41.610> light<00:02:41.819> they're

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
you get these panels for light they're

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.780 
you get these panels for light they're
under<00:02:42.840> ten<00:02:43.019> bucks<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.590> mean<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.519> they're

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
under ten bucks I mean I think they're

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
under ten bucks I mean I think they're
even<00:02:45.000> cheaper<00:02:45.180> than<00:02:45.329> that<00:02:45.599> depends<00:02:46.049> on<00:02:46.140> where

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
even cheaper than that depends on where

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.339 
even cheaper than that depends on where
you<00:02:46.379> go<00:02:46.760> but<00:02:47.760> that's<00:02:48.269> all<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.540> need<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.810> do<00:02:48.959> so

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
you go but that's all you need to do so

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.259 
you go but that's all you need to do so
I<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:49.769> that's<00:02:50.099> extremely<00:02:50.579> handy<00:02:51.030> tip

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
I think that's extremely handy tip

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.839 
I think that's extremely handy tip
because<00:02:51.599> a<00:02:51.629> lot<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.989> people<00:02:52.230> doing<00:02:52.410> this

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
because a lot of people doing this

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.009 
because a lot of people doing this
survival<00:02:53.849> type<00:02:54.030> stuff<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.569> keeping<00:02:54.900> some

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
survival type stuff and keeping some

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.710 
survival type stuff and keeping some
emergency<00:02:55.590> things<00:02:55.920> on<00:02:56.160> hand<00:02:56.579> that's<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.540> way

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
emergency things on hand that's the way

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.869 
emergency things on hand that's the way
to<00:02:57.780> go<00:02:58.019> now<00:02:58.799> what<00:02:59.069> I'm<00:02:59.160> going<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.340> do<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.730> like

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
to go now what I'm going to do is like

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.280 
to go now what I'm going to do is like
I'm<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.269> take<00:03:00.450> this<00:03:00.599> battery<00:03:01.079> out<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
I'm going to take this battery out I

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.420 
I'm going to take this battery out I
have<00:03:01.650> a<00:03:01.680> 1200<00:03:02.459> watt<00:03:02.640> inverter<00:03:03.560> and<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:05.250> going

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
have a 1200 watt inverter and I'm going

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.520 
have a 1200 watt inverter and I'm going
to<00:03:05.489> use<00:03:05.579> it<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:05.879> the<00:03:05.940> electric<00:03:06.359> weed<00:03:07.230> whacker

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
to use it with the electric weed whacker

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.800 
to use it with the electric weed whacker
where<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.340> don't<00:03:08.489> have<00:03:08.670> to<00:03:08.790> use<00:03:08.970> long<00:03:09.239> extension

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
where I don't have to use long extension

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.080 
where I don't have to use long extension
cords<00:03:10.170> on<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:10.980> other<00:03:11.099> side<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.549> property

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
cords on the other side of the property

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.479 
cords on the other side of the property
so<00:03:13.049> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.500> you<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.769> take<00:03:14.129> this<00:03:14.280> little

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
so you know you just take this little

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:15.589 
so you know you just take this little
thing<00:03:14.579> it's<00:03:14.910> almost<00:03:15.060> like<00:03:15.239> taking<00:03:15.359> a<00:03:15.569> little

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
thing it's almost like taking a little

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.569 
thing it's almost like taking a little
can<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.049> gas<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.620> you<00:03:16.799> know<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.280> just

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:17.579 
can of gas with you you know so I just

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.940 
can of gas with you you know so I just
connect<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.030> inverter<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> pick<00:03:19.590> it<00:03:19.680> up<00:03:19.799> by

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
connect the inverter to it pick it up by

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.400 
connect the inverter to it pick it up by
the<00:03:19.980> handle<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.810> can<00:03:21.959> use<00:03:22.079> the<00:03:22.230> weed

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
the handle and I can use the weed

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.140 
the handle and I can use the weed
whacker<00:03:22.650> but<00:03:23.010> this<00:03:23.250> thing<00:03:23.459> keeps<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.910> nice

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
whacker but this thing keeps a nice

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.930 
whacker but this thing keeps a nice
charge<00:03:24.810> without<00:03:25.590> overcharging<00:03:26.579> with<00:03:26.760> that

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
charge without overcharging with that

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330 
charge without overcharging with that
little<00:03:27.239> panel<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:28.500> don't<00:03:28.799> need<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> charge

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
little panel you don't need a charge

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.520 
little panel you don't need a charge
controller<00:03:29.549> because<00:03:30.329> it's<00:03:30.989> not<00:03:31.260> that

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
controller because it's not that

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.289 
controller because it's not that
powerful<00:03:31.799> but<00:03:32.340> it's<00:03:32.459> strong<00:03:32.760> enough<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.030> keep

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
powerful but it's strong enough to keep

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.470 
powerful but it's strong enough to keep
it<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.599> to<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.109> hundred<00:03:35.099> percent<00:03:35.250> so<00:03:35.849> that

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
it up to a hundred percent so that

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.479 
it up to a hundred percent so that
that's<00:03:36.870> great<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.500> didn't<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.280> was<00:03:38.340> going

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
that's great I didn't think it was going

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.449 
that's great I didn't think it was going
to<00:03:38.579> keep<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.910> at<00:03:39.000> 100%<00:03:40.040> because<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.250> one

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
to keep it at 100% because I have one

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.099 
to keep it at 100% because I have one
that's<00:03:41.639> just<00:03:41.760> a<00:03:42.090> little<00:03:42.120> bit<00:03:42.569> smaller<00:03:42.930> than

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
that's just a little bit smaller than

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.610 
that's just a little bit smaller than
that<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.480> it's<00:03:45.480> every<00:03:45.720> couple<00:03:46.079> months<00:03:46.230> or<00:03:46.410> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
that and it's every couple months or so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.530 
that and it's every couple months or so
I<00:03:46.650> got<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:46.950> put<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.130> charge<00:03:47.370> on<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:47.700> battery<00:03:48.180> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
I got to put a charge on the battery it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.509 
I got to put a charge on the battery it
doesn't<00:03:48.900> like<00:03:49.019> detour<00:03:49.590> discharge<00:03:50.220> all<00:03:50.489> the

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
doesn't like detour discharge all the

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.909 
doesn't like detour discharge all the
way<00:03:50.760> but<00:03:51.540> it<00:03:51.630> starts<00:03:51.900> going<00:03:52.019> down<00:03:52.169> to<00:03:52.530> like<00:03:52.680> you

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:52.919 
way but it starts going down to like you

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.759 
way but it starts going down to like you
know<00:03:53.040> 75%<00:03:53.790> or<00:03:54.599> so<00:03:54.720> it's<00:03:54.930> not<00:03:55.049> that<00:03:55.290> bad<00:03:55.500> it

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
know 75% or so it's not that bad it

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.920 
know 75% or so it's not that bad it
doesn't<00:03:55.950> go<00:03:56.099> down<00:03:56.250> at<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:57.299> keeps<00:03:57.629> it<00:03:57.780> up

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
doesn't go down at that this keeps it up

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.619 
doesn't go down at that this keeps it up
just<00:03:58.109> perfect<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.650> that's<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:58.980> 12<00:03:59.310> inch<00:03:59.609> long<00:03:59.790> by

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
just perfect so that's a 12 inch long by

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:02.539 
just perfect so that's a 12 inch long by
4<00:04:01.019> inch<00:04:01.290> wide

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
4 inch wide

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.650 
4 inch wide
solar<00:04:03.510> panel<00:04:03.900> works<00:04:04.139> perfect
