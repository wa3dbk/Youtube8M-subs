a<00:01:56.409> few<00:01:56.649> tweaks<00:01:57.039> to<00:01:57.340> change<00:01:57.670> what<00:01:58.119> i<00:01:58.149> used

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329

instead of using some triangles I think
there's<00:02:01.509> triangle<00:02:01.899> things<00:02:02.140> i<00:02:02.320> have<00:02:02.469> there

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
there's triangle things i have there

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.099 
there's triangle things i have there
originally<00:02:03.219> i<00:02:03.249> changed<00:02:03.909> it<00:02:04.090> for<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.390> starfish

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109

and<00:02:05.289> that's<00:02:05.469> how<00:02:05.619> i<00:02:05.649> brought<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.219> back<00:02:06.399> but

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
and that's how i brought it back but

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.950

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
the lines in the face the proper so you

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.450 
the lines in the face the proper so you
get<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:27.840> square<00:02:28.260> you<00:02:28.440> max<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.830> out<00:02:28.860> back<00:02:29.280> to
