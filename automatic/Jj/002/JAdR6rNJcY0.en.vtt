00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.049
 the alive and brown 92 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.139
 there are very good to all vaquitas we are 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 here 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.230
 guys today I'll explain how 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.780
 create this mechanism of flying boats 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.480
 whores for boats for all and good 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 I'm in the new caption of 1.8 the 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.140
 previous and good what they have achieved 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.720
 basically I explain to you very fast that you 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.980
 can unite the sticky ratatouille 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.840
 with the slide block that is here 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 it's worth it so good going through 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.790
 here a little bit of the rest when we passed 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.620
 cha cha by ropes which activates 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 would be the block is line vale and this what 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.730
 that makes it fly away worth and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.800
 well I will explain first of all the 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.719
 measures because this goes off like 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.579
 you have seen it, I'm going to do it again and 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.780
 I will explain what comes from far and 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.210
 otherwise you are going to see this 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.610
 then the server is from the hunger games 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 and of little things so it's worth looking at everything 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.120
 jumps is really crazy, my mother 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.890
 it has been put there is an octopus before 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.690
 it was worth one I say I blow it and good 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.059
 basically long and I think it takes 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.879
 like 11 is worth from the sly block 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.590
 it would arrive 11 long and high it arrives 6 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 ok anyway you must play here 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.890
 I'll put the life for you 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.409
 right in the middle and you're going to see that without 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.240
 problem what happened to sense I'm going to see 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.160
 I've checked it before and there has not been 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.350
 problem I say that I will not stick anymore 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.900
 lame of runway anyway and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.290
 you are going to see you are going to see how like that is 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.300
 I only pass here here we go we go there and 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.110
 good you will see is to look for first 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.110
 person for you to see 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.229
 it happened skimming that is the one of above it happens 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.710
 rubbing do not fuck me to see to see calm down 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.600
 bacchanal 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.860
 and well I will explain how it is done 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.350
 the mechanism is worth it because I know that a lot 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.869
 people want to know and we are going to do it 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.700
 I want to do it in such a way that the 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.590
 mechanism go to the other side it's worth 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.259
 to go like a swing is worth saying 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.080
 that would jump moore from here and from 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.460
 there here then to be able to do this 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.740
 mechanism ok let's start doing 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.660
 a base is worth it because it practically carries 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.100
 more to use any solid block 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.100
 I'm going to use the diamond block 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.900
 It's worth because I like the price 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.850
 because as I want it to do so 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.759
 I'm going to take it a little bit 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.500
 down here down and ok let's go to 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.770
 start by placing a base of 5 x 5 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.720
 say 3 4 or 5 for another 5 and now 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.310
 we simply go down to the one below it's worth and 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.959
 well more created it takes a little bit of 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.970
 time but it's worth it, you see 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.120
 which is cool and good towards 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:30.080
 down we're going to go down 5 val that is 1 2 3 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:33.020
 4 and 5 is ok and obviously we fill 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.459
 everything so that a base stays and then 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.020
 because inside we will have to 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.239
 remove the water that is a pain in the ass but 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.140
 good is what is there, that's why we're 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:45.590
 in the sea under humor then so 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:50.860
 ok and now we cover here that is 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.860
 easy if not my mother it's worth great 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.580
 You see that more than anything is time but 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.050
 well then the mechanism you already know 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:01.580
 that is nothing is a little bit of 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.459
 remains seen sticky and little bit better 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.450
 and now here below we also cover for 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.450
 that a cube is left 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.010
 ok and now what we can do inside 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.240
 fill in whatever it is worth for later 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.160
 remove it and let the water go 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.470
 because the water has to be removed 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.230
 obviously if not it will not be left 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.050
 neither nor anything then we put any 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.750
 material inside that is another one goes for 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.300
 Do not forget to remove it 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.360
 and now we remove the clean water 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.610
 and it stays hollow as I wanted then 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.610
 here we remove remove 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.090
 it's great 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.610
 and we already have it, it's already 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.710
 we have and now I explain 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.470
 we are going to place here in the middle a piston 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.270
 sticky and then we'll take the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.840
 block of es line and there will be two 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.920
 blocks of line 1 and 2 are worth 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.840
 thus 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.940
 you will ask because he carries pumpkins 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.980
 around and good is simply because 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.260
 the pumpkins are not activated with the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.000
 piston block when activated if 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.550
 We put pumpkins are going to stay 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.200
 stops then is what what is going to 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.150
 make us jump without if there is another 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.799
 block will not work, it's because it's 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:20.220
 is going to activate now you will understand when 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.550
 you see it but good cojemos pumpkins and 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.370
 We are putting them like this as I do not know anymore 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.110
 we have what would be the basis now 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.880
 if we can break here it is 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.020
 say here because then where are you going to 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.669
 enter the water 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.830
 we are going to place any block 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:37.620
 before what would the jump be saying 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:41.070
 here and good simply because we take and 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.100
 the little button as the chub says and he 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:47.800
 and we put it two ropes 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.960
 and cross out we already have it in such a way 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.100
 that when we touch the thread it activates what 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.140
 that would be the mechanism now simply 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.480
 we take them from the right side of the 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:57.000
 left 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.090
 with rest down towards the piston and 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.730
 We already have it, I'll tell you, it's worth, it's worth it 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.710
 here you will go through here 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:11.430
 here I will break here here or it is worth 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.320
 it is already and now we cover 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.110
 crystal so fast it not me 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.500
 I'm going to take it very seriously then I 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.300
 I think that's how it is with glass and it goes 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:25.520
 suck great 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.569
 and we already have it, you see, the 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.909
 water now we just have to 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:31.069
 remove what is inside cover here 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:33.440
 because as it centers the water does not 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:35.539
 grace then we have removed the water 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.550
 little by little and we already have it and now 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.780
 we simply send the signal to the 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.540
 break here 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:49.700
 and that is because the water is from where 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:49.700
 comes there are bullets great ay ay 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.840
 Look, he forgot to put a value and now 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.250
 they were just worth this what 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.460
 we remove that the bets that 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:00.870
 they left and here I can remove great voucher 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.730
 we do so here we can put a 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.160
 repeater if we want is worth so that 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.870
 get the strongest energy or you know 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.180
 or arrive that sometimes falls short 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.560
 so if you want to put it and 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.240
 now the rest simply we are not going it 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.190
 leading up we're going out here 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.350
 from the cave of the grandmother's 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.289
 this is no longer necessary we put here not you 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:24.669
 forget to put a pumpkin 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.229
 and here we have it, you see me 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.529
 He forgot to put here for that seeped 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:31.080
 Water 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:33.539
 you see but we can remove 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.919
 and we raise the energy up and already 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.960
 we have it guys we are already going to 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:37.800
 check that it works by going from 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.750
 forth 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.310
 Let's see how we take a bucket of water 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.379
 also because you are going to see that here 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.240
 it is hollow 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:53.979
 then as it is now when we pass 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:57.110
 here we go let's see if I do this 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.720
 Trampoline goes from one place to another 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:03.700
 and there one 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:07.660
 of the perfect perfect 10 you like no 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.660
 let's go out there 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.340
 if we go to the little mermaid 

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:16.610
 perfect perfect perfect guys has me 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.770
 It was great and nothing guys remember 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.360
 that you can vote a lake to help me 

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.819
 grow the channel that brings things like that 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.740
 that this does not look much that we say and 

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.449
 well we see it in upcoming gameplay a 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.099
 Greetings left with job tutorials 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:30.099
 iu pad to the next people
