00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
and by ova I think thin blood yup there

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.130 
and by ova I think thin blood yup there
you<00:01:35.430> go<00:01:35.579> file<00:01:35.820> thin<00:01:36.180> blood<00:01:36.420> from<00:01:36.630> farming<00:01:36.960> here

what<00:01:37.710> job<00:01:37.970> both<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.150> these<00:01:39.270> crafting

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
what job both of these crafting

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.260 
what job both of these crafting
materials<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.409> worth<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.119> bit

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
materials are worth I think a little bit

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.609 
materials are worth I think a little bit
over<00:01:42.390> our<00:01:42.540> silver<00:01:42.990> apiece<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.500> that's

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
over our silver apiece so that's

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
all you know in one setting you probably

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.409 
all you know in one setting you probably
blow<00:04:00.069> your<00:04:00.250> brains<00:04:00.489> out<00:04:00.699> by<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:00.970> time<00:04:01.150> you<00:04:01.299> are

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:01.419 
blow your brains out by the time you are

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.479 
blow your brains out by the time you are
before<00:04:01.750> you<00:04:01.989> actually<00:04:02.199> got<00:04:02.620> done<00:04:02.919> because

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
before you actually got done because

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.949 
before you actually got done because
that's<00:04:03.699> a<00:04:03.819> lot<00:04:04.120> of<00:04:04.150> bats<00:04:04.449> I<00:04:04.629> think<00:04:04.780> it's<00:04:04.870> a

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
that's a lot of bats I think it's a

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.050 
that's a lot of bats I think it's a
thousand<00:04:05.500> yeah<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.680> would<00:04:05.769> be<00:04:05.859> 1000<00:04:06.579> bats<00:04:06.790> all

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
in one sitting which would take probably

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:11.490 
in one sitting which would take probably
over<00:04:09.459> 10<00:04:09.729> hours<00:04:09.909> to<00:04:10.239> do<00:04:10.419> which<00:04:10.659> is<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:11.079> crazy

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
over 10 hours to do which is just crazy

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.149 
over 10 hours to do which is just crazy
nah<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:13.629> bats<00:04:13.900> layer<00:04:14.229> is<00:04:14.409> one<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.859> few

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
nah the bats layer is one of the few

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.979 
nah the bats layer is one of the few
Slayer<00:04:15.729> achievements<00:04:16.329> that<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.539> won't<00:04:16.840> be

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
Slayer achievements that you won't be

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.800

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
able to get in your times in a you know

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.569 
able to get in your times in a you know
just<00:04:20.049> naturally<00:04:20.650> playing<00:04:20.889> the<00:04:21.099> game<00:04:21.280> because

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
just naturally playing the game because

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.670 
just naturally playing the game because
there's<00:04:21.789> not<00:04:21.940> many<00:04:22.090> things<00:04:23.020> that<00:04:23.139> require<00:04:23.500> you

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
there's not many things that require you

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.090 
there's not many things that require you
to<00:04:23.770> actually<00:04:23.830> kill<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.400> bats

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
to actually kill the bats

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
to actually kill the bats
so<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.700> definitely<00:04:26.390> one<00:04:26.480> of<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.690> Slayer

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
so this is definitely one of the Slayer

so this is definitely one of the Slayer
