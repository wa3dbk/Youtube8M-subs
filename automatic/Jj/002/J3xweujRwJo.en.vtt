00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.900
 muriel colonia jesus alfonso álvarez al 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.970
 vardar and rodríguez sara immense carla 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.010
 severe and are already a bit honestly 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.689
 they asked me very much greetings and not 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 I want to make longer videos I'm going to 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.260
 divide in two to put them in the 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.760
 next video for people who do not 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.380
 they read the title that is down here 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's talk we told him one thing that 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.470
 it was really impressive in some 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.880
 times or good at least people 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.070
 that were born in the beautiful times of 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.079
 the nineties 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.969
 and good this video is basically going to be 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.100
 my top 3 of the best seasons of 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.290
 slime since they are a shit are more than 7 and 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.750
 degrades a lot of eggs talk because then 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.430
 Most of them are crap and good 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.989
 let's let's start with a brief 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.789
 explanation of what I say because of 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.559
 Are there really people who do not know they 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.539
 We said practically for people 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.610
 that are not digimon and confuse 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.710
 a lot of digimon with pokemon is a series 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.899
 where then supposedly elected owners of 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 nothing get mothers to go to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.220
 another world pulls out of what fucking head fits 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.550
 that half winter is going to be a wave in 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.920
 a bowl 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.020
 and good come an unknown world that 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 it's like the digital world and the fuck and 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.310
 they have superpowers and good without more than 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.900
 say let's start with the top in the number 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.880
 350 we said frontil that basically 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.830
 break with the scheme of what is lemon 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.900
 because the scheme is to have your partner 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.640
 of lemon and the girl and in this there is no 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.500
 lemon mate as such simply 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.780
 are transformed into lemon is already a 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 pretty story somehow 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.590
 very square but then the chiles that 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 the main characters stand out 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.490
 that are just two others 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.650
 Real characters is not worth a whistle 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.090
 because they do not literally do anything 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.800
 last they give their powers to the 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.700
 protagonists so that they have the bad 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.320
 and ready 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.810
 the only one but I must admit that in 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.040
 It is astonishing that in a matter of 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.050
 some part of the history of the 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.090
 history of the creation of the world and of 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.890
 the archangels of the world is also 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.690
 pretty interesting in some way 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.760
 for me already team is everyone is 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.370
 used to see digimon some lemons 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.990
 I got money and they saw that what 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.120
 fucking so if you do not have a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.890
 guard and monción ham or something in the 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.900
 another devolution of the ieh will not be more 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.160
 strong that war grimón in the number of se 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.989
 so you find a lot also I'm going to 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.819
 annihilate by putting the number two it 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.769
 find the rudder 1 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.299
 no, it's like the beginning of what 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:18.299
 it would be all this giant franchise 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.950
 called digimon and well it's cool 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.930
 everything you want but from some people 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.700
 it could have been better and then it came 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.469
 We said 02 that was also a disappointment 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.900
 because the final base does not seem 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.370
 final battle they simply could 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.439
 have gotten a shame with the 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.829
 bastard as it is called this land of 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.659
 scratching the balls and not just with 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.909
 the wait is that she was a fag that 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.409
 with the hope of the hearts of the 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.269
 children who do not have lemon won 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.700
 a bastard who could have given him the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.379
 sprig of his life and good of some 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.969
 way I must admit that the soundtrack and 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.159
 the plot and all that have theirs 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:52.230
 but they do not come as the feeling 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.669
 that I have in which I grew up with said no 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.560
 they do not arrive like what I 'm going for 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.180
 first put the number is not found 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.650
 dismantling is many will say by 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.239
 what because in some way the universe 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.919
 of origin mounts months like the universe 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.290
 that any child would like to have all 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.750
 your life imagine power from nothing having 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.060
 a device that you put almost out of nothing 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.530
 there is not a child chosen as such that of 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.319
 nothing the world 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.810
 god this opaque or whatever the son want 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.569
 to different children in the world so that 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.049
 have a lemon and the best you can 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.760
 lemon and go chingón come I 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.200
 really I imagine I would love 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.239
 have a demon and really me 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.650
 I would love to be able 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.989
 have done everything that guy did 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.749
 because normally you imagine is going to be 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.969
 your evolutions have your own device and 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.709
 that you control it with letters that is in 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:39.299
 that universe already of a marketing of 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.889
 digimon already there is a series of digimon in 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.139
 that universe since a posteriori to 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.209
 letters there was already everything about lemon is like 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.950
 if at this moment they make me a whore 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.709
 letter was passed on my mother this 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.109
 magical accountant of July- and yards 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:59.849
 that would be super chic for me and I think 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:04:02.219
 that for paco and cross-questions and 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.750
 brotherhoods and somehow I think that 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:06.810
 the end has something to do because it happens 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.639
 for real or is there not found a 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.409
 computer virus that in the 80s 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.389
 existed and that to date it continues 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.010
 existing and really come out 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.689
 we said no in the language that come out 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.370
 simmons in the city is something that 

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:19.109
 true nobody would imagine that you spend 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.400
 apart from that they have has nothing to 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.710
 see with digimon one does not have anything that 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.479
 to see with the world is like a thing apart 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.570
 I really liked that and it goes a lot 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:29.130
 friend 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.530
 something of nostalgia valleys and sight between 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.910
 the nineties and in 2000 you know what 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.560
 that I'm talking about because they're going to be 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.639
 personally allowed to play that you see and 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.139
 Follow me and they are also spreading 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.580
 around here on twitter from paco so that 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.560
 go follow them and their page does not call 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.590
 time since it is loading likes 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.840
 but also the boy is doing well today 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.039
 in day and good in the description not 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.780
 are the recommended channels that 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.490
 basically because this one you gamer and more or 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.110
 It will make them and those channels that help us 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.340
 just in some way that will shuffle 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.600
 and that are not worth cock 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.300
 I do not know if they want to leave me here in the 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.970
 comments something like there is no talk of 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.770
 this speaks of the other since then I do not 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.389
 like to talk a lot about what I 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.220
 they cooked like the videos of to types of 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.620
 teachers because my March is not worth verga 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.030
 somehow nor typical things anymore 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.680
 I do not like anything like remembering those 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.479
 old times in which we saw 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.580
 cartoons we liked to play cases 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.110
 bayley etcetera etcetera with nothing else 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.789
 to say then thank you very much for the 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.039
 video and do not forget to subscribe if you 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.820
 liked to give him handle up and until the 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.820
 next video 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.890
 for him
