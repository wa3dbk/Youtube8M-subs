 part of the competition the first place 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.850
 however at the lack of 500 meters 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.739
 but decisive moments so that the 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.260
 soybean iván enderica takes the triumph 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.460
 seconds of breaking the record he achieved 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.460
 the same athlete 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.540
 in ladies the best time was recorded

 samantha arévalo from brands 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.720
 holding the pressure of swimming 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.990
 taking into account that its strength is 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:34.270
 tests of the 400 and 800 meters which 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:34.270
 It even allows to be in London 2012 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.460
 among the five most prominent guilds to 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.810

 hugo bonilla sport crossing 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.270
 after the development of edition 52 of 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.070
 crossing to san pablo lake 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.920
 organizers made a balance of 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.420
 the test leaving positive balance both 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.990
 in the number of participants as 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.220
 also because of the quality that prevailed 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.290
 really the expectation is always 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.030
 big here in san pablo and for the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.280
 organization a satisfaction 180 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.630
 swimmers several swimmers stayed 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.330
 outside they did not send in time the 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.830
 documents or they lacked some requirement 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.930
 we had to leave them out but in 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.300
 reality in the study part 107 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.959
 I think they were very good now 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.610
 the winners prepared in their times 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.709
 the great but all within the hour 15 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.600
 very few have retired I think that 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.880
 this gives us the pattern that they are paulo 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.680
 is always trying to improve 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.060
 the times and lower that record that is already 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.850
 an awesome time for the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.950
 external analysts on their part the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.930
 scammers analyzed the result of their 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.250
 good victory and the truth that at 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.650
 beginning I started first I tried 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.030
 get away as I say but I saw that no 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.340
 well and bars was not going to turn out that way 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.739
 from the beginning and they put down a 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.200
 pretty strong rhythm but good more than 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.400
 everything I tried to change strategy for 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.610
 be second you that place 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.980
 I tried to separate myself again but the 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.930
 strategies are you have to always look for 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.750
 something different because it's a sport 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.610
 pretty of pretty smart it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.470
 says all that and the truth that the 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.519
 experience most of all has given me 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.680
 so many years of competing 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:24.140
 internationally so many achievements 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.030
 triumphs and that the truth gives me a 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.890
 very great happiness because it is a 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.329
 seventh victory but I do not think only 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.519
 in a seventh I think about it there are many 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.290
 I'm only 21 years old and I want to continue 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.769
 earning good I'm happy with the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.500
 result and happy to be here in 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.329
 otavalo crossing San Pablo lake by 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.810
 the first experience in open waters 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.690
 for me 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:49.560
 is what has stopped me 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.560
 a good result 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.240
 seeing that it's the first time I've 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.000
 had the opportunity to cross the lake 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.860
 and they do not carry a nice memory of our 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.170
 youthful values in favorites too 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.390
 they exposed their good talent the 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.060
 competition was very strong very 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.440
 tired as water temperature and 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.030
 the opponents who came in 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.350
 different parts of the country are very 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.350
 strong break with prize prepared 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.489
 As for the official results , 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.210

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.030

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.030
 they relied on this competition 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.940
 I think they gave a fight and a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.250
 war from the beginning you saw in 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.160
 the departure then the pointer platoon came out 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.620
 and none of the swimmers to loose 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.969
 everyone kept up the pace until 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.009
 getting to the finish line 

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.800
