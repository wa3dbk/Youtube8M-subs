 very good morning girls today we are going to do 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.820
 a very simple manicure very easy and 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.050
 very fast I present the materials 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.289
 what are we going to need 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:25.009
 as it is always bad base to take care 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.890
 our nails a white enamel for 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:32.149
 make the French manicure a glaze 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.320
 blue and another blue glaze with a little 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.840
 more than brightness to give a final touch 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:43.840
 top coat to protect our design 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.110
 black acrylic paint and 2 brush and cough 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 one like this finite and another like this 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.809
 finite yet for the details 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.090
 let's see the design inside video 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.449
 as well I told you the first thing 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.290
 we have to do is apply the facebook 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.409
 to protect our nails and then what 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.590
 What we will do is a French manicure 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.440
 simple blank 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.010
 a white enamel 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.950
 ok and let it dry once we have 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.350
 finished the french manicure we are going to 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.870
 start making leopard spots 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.650
 to make leopard spots let's go 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.490
 to use this blue enamel 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.490
 we will take 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.580
 this brush 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:43.310
 and we are going to apply a little of the enamel in 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.510
 a palette like this so we can 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.510
 work more comfortably 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.480
 we apply the glaze a few drops 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.480
 we close them 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.550
 here we have it and let's start 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.800
 work with him we put the brush together 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.010
 and the only thing we have to do 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.010
 is 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.109
 some little circles 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:17.630
 without having a way 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:20.380
 concrete just a few spots 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.530
 that will go from the cuticle 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.300
 of the nail 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.300
 going through the French manicure 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.730
 well once we have our 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.860
 blue spots made 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.799
 all we have to do is catch 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.989
 our black acrylic paint and cast 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.630
 a little on the palette and with this 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:51.480
 brush to make details 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.769
 go delineating our blue spots 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.769
 as follows 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.390
 a hairline here to a hairline here and 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:04.690
 other hairline 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.690
 another here here and here 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.230
 you see 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.210
 we are forming the leopard we are going to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.950
 finish all the nails and we come back with 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.220
 the result to give it a touch 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.650
 personal and a little bit more special to 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.080
 our leopard spots 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.420
 what I'm going to do is apply a little 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:34.069
 of this blue holographic glaze also 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.950
 with this same brush 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:38.590
 I put a little on the palette and what 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.310
 only 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.160
 I'm doing is 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.680
 Apply on top of the blue spots 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.680
 a little bit in the holographic enamel 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:58.460
 well girls we have already applied the doctor 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.460

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:06.310
