00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
motion really poor calf mobility I've

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.110 
motion really poor calf mobility I've
done<00:00:31.260> videos<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.769> them<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.160> how<00:00:32.489> to<00:00:32.520> assess<00:00:33.090> for

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

done videos on them on how to assess for
that<00:00:33.420> as<00:00:33.510> well<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.960> might<00:00:34.440> look<00:00:34.739> back<00:00:34.920> on

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
that as well so you might look back on

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.100 
that as well so you might look back on
those<00:00:35.309> then<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.600> sort<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.809> stuff<00:00:36.960> you

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
those then that's the sort of stuff you

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110 
those then that's the sort of stuff you
need<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.380> sort<00:00:37.620> at<00:00:37.770> first<00:00:38.100> shoes<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:39.030> not

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.190 
need to sort at first shoes are not
going<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> make<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.480> blind<00:00:39.809> bit<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> difference

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
going to make a blind bit of difference

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
really don't want to be in something

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.719 
really don't want to be in something
that<00:01:02.129> has<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> huge<00:01:02.879> amount<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> heel

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
that has a huge amount of heel

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.530 
that has a huge amount of heel
difference<00:01:05.729> between<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> heel<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.240> toe

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
difference between the heel the toe

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.690 
difference between the heel the toe
unless<00:01:07.080> you're<00:01:07.260> doing<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.530> massive<00:01:08.340> amount<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
unless you're doing a massive amount of

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.219 
unless you're doing a massive amount of
running<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.090> just<00:01:09.299> need<00:01:09.479> an<00:01:09.630> awful<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.170> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
running you just need an awful lot of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
running you just need an awful lot of
support<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:11.729> then<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.720> don't

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
support but even then I really don't

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.109 
support but even then I really don't
think<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.229> necessary<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.729> should<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.030> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
think it's necessary as you should be in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.550 
think it's necessary as you should be in
that<00:01:15.270> four<00:01:15.540> foot<00:01:15.780> position<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.409> you're

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
that four foot position when you're

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
that four foot position when you're
landing<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.040> running<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:18.030> take<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
landing and running as you take a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
landing and running as you take a
skipping<00:01:19.020> rope<00:01:19.170> but<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.439> run<00:01:19.590> across<00:01:19.740> some

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
skipping rope but you run across some

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.830 
skipping rope but you run across some
grass<00:01:20.430> or<00:01:20.729> some<00:01:20.850> sand<00:01:21.119> you'll<00:01:21.540> naturally

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
grass or some sand you'll naturally

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050 
grass or some sand you'll naturally
learn<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:22.950> forefoot<00:01:23.369> position<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:23.939> you're

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
learn in the forefoot position if you're

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
learn in the forefoot position if you're
learning<00:01:24.330> your<00:01:24.479> heel<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.930> time<00:01:25.200> it's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
learning your heel all the time it's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.050 
learning your heel all the time it's
going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.920> cause<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> lot<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.460> problems<00:01:26.970> with

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
going to cause a lot of problems with

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
because this huge amount of force coming

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.569 
because this huge amount of force coming
through<00:01:31.350> kind<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> straight<00:01:32.100> leg<00:01:32.310> as

difference between the heel on the toe I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.910 
difference between the heel on the toe I
think<00:02:13.540> should<00:02:13.750> only<00:02:13.900> be<00:02:14.110> reserved<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:14.650> let's

really cut down sir issue just because

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
really cut down sir issue just because
those<00:02:24.700> sort<00:02:24.940> of<00:02:24.970> shoes<00:02:25.560> don't<00:02:26.560> offer<00:02:26.739> any<00:02:27.010> kind

of like sort of lateral support at all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.330 
of like sort of lateral support at all
normally<00:02:30.810> so<00:02:31.810> just<00:02:32.530> if<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.709> go<00:02:32.800> on<00:02:32.860> over<00:02:32.950> rocks

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
normally so just if you go on over rocks

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.550 
normally so just if you go on over rocks
onto<00:02:33.670> trails<00:02:34.180> maybe<00:02:34.810> something<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.380> that

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
onto trails maybe something like that

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.250 
onto trails maybe something like that
might<00:02:35.800> be<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> little<00:02:36.160> bit<00:02:36.340> more<00:02:36.489> beneficial<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
might be a little bit more beneficial to

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.130 
might be a little bit more beneficial to
you<00:02:38.380> put<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.890> know<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.220> general<00:02:39.400> I've<00:02:39.760> run<00:02:40.360> in

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
you put you know in general I've run in

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.800 
you put you know in general I've run in
all<00:02:41.290> sorts<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.069> types<00:02:42.280> of<00:02:42.459> shoes<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:42.880> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
all sorts of types of shoes and the

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.720 
all sorts of types of shoes and the
water<00:02:43.989> probably<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.709> worst<00:02:44.920> my<00:02:45.340> opinion

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
water probably the worst my opinion

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.030 
water probably the worst my opinion
would<00:02:45.940> be<00:02:46.000> something<00:02:46.360> like<00:02:46.510> hattori<00:02:47.470> or<00:02:47.739> or<00:02:48.010> or

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
would be something like hattori or or or

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.890 
would be something like hattori or or or
a<00:02:48.700> yeah<00:02:49.950> vibram<00:02:51.120> because<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.299> think<00:02:52.600> there's

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
a yeah vibram because I think there's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.630 
a yeah vibram because I think there's
just<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.290> little<00:02:53.319> support<00:02:53.950> there<00:02:54.130> at<00:02:54.250> all<00:02:54.370> that

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
just so little support there at all that

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.550 
just so little support there at all that
it's<00:02:55.000> very<00:02:55.239> easy<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.690> kind<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:55.989> turn<00:02:56.170> over<00:02:56.470> and

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
it's very easy to kind of turn over and

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.680 
it's very easy to kind of turn over and
Ryan<00:02:56.799> goal<00:02:57.010> or<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.850> feel<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.600> know

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
Ryan goal or just feel like you know

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.630 
Ryan goal or just feel like you know
something<00:02:58.959> could<00:02:59.230> go<00:02:59.290> through<00:02:59.620> your<00:02:59.709> shoe<00:02:59.980> and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
something could go through your shoe and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.750 
something could go through your shoe and
plus<00:03:01.600> as<00:03:01.750> well<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.930> would<00:03:02.470> never<00:03:02.760> encourage

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
plus as well I would never encourage

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.339 
plus as well I would never encourage
people<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.209> transition<00:03:04.810> from<00:03:04.840> something<00:03:05.319> like

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
people to transition from something like

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.960 
people to transition from something like
that<00:03:05.620> into<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.160> because<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.580> difference

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
that into that because the difference

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.500 
that into that because the difference
between<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.810> heel<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.410> toe<00:03:08.769> is<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:09.850> huge

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
between the heel and the toe is so huge

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.569 
between the heel and the toe is so huge
as<00:03:10.810> it<00:03:10.870> kind<00:03:11.350> of<00:03:11.410> stepped<00:03:11.709> down<00:03:11.920> that<00:03:12.430> your

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:12.579 
as it kind of stepped down that your

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.039 
as it kind of stepped down that your
calves<00:03:12.820> we<00:03:13.060> turn<00:03:13.299> up<00:03:13.420> for<00:03:13.630> days<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.930> I<00:03:13.989> think

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
calves we turn up for days so I think

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.199 
calves we turn up for days so I think
something<00:03:14.470> like<00:03:14.590> these<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.100> sekonic<00:03:15.549> hattori

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
something like these the sekonic hattori

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.150 
something like these the sekonic hattori
or<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.540> vibrams<00:03:16.959> should<00:03:17.470> be<00:03:17.590> really<00:03:17.829> kind<00:03:18.100> of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
or the vibrams should be really kind of

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
squatting then you really should have

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.230

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
you're not I kind of find these two are

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.830 
you're not I kind of find these two are
probably<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.370> best<00:04:15.580> all-rounder<00:04:16.330> if<00:04:16.450> you<00:04:16.660> to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
probably the best all-rounder if you to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.840 
probably the best all-rounder if you to
have<00:04:17.020> these<00:04:17.830> you'll<00:04:18.160> burn<00:04:18.370> through<00:04:18.640> quite

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
have these you'll burn through quite

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.140 
have these you'll burn through quite
quick<00:04:19.150> because<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.510> base<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:19.810> quite<00:04:21.150> quite

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
quick because the base is quite quite

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.390 
quick because the base is quite quite
soft<00:04:22.480> I<00:04:22.780> think<00:04:23.590> these<00:04:23.680> are<00:04:23.890> kind<00:04:23.920> of<00:04:24.130> a<00:04:24.220> better

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
soft I think these are kind of a better

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.870 
soft I think these are kind of a better
overall<00:04:24.820> shoe<00:04:26.130> but<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.340> know<00:04:27.430> those<00:04:27.640> are

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
overall shoe but you know those are

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850 
overall shoe but you know those are
incredibly<00:04:28.660> comfortable<00:04:29.170> but<00:04:29.590> good<00:04:29.740> in

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
incredibly comfortable but good in

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.680 
incredibly comfortable but good in
betweens<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.490> would<00:04:30.700> be<00:04:30.820> something<00:04:31.060> like<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
betweens you would be something like the

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.190 
betweens you would be something like the
Asik's<00:04:32.170> like<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.100> d/s<00:04:33.490> type<00:04:33.820> trainer<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.450> so

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
Asik's like a d/s type trainer and so

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.140 
Asik's like a d/s type trainer and so
it's<00:04:35.350> again<00:04:35.680> quite<00:04:35.920> cut<00:04:36.190> down<00:04:36.460> but<00:04:36.700> if<00:04:36.850> I<00:04:36.970> might

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
it's again quite cut down but if I might

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.390 
it's again quite cut down but if I might
I<00:04:37.390> think<00:04:37.930> you<00:04:38.050> might<00:04:38.170> kind<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.470> burn<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.220> them

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
I think you might kind of burn to them

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.400 
I think you might kind of burn to them
quite<00:04:39.610> quick<00:04:39.880> so<00:04:40.360> they'd<00:04:40.510> be<00:04:40.660> kind<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:40.990> like<00:04:41.140> my

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
quite quick so they'd be kind of like my

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.390 
quite quick so they'd be kind of like my
top<00:04:41.740> picks<00:04:42.300> so<00:04:43.300> and<00:04:43.710> hopefully<00:04:44.710> that's<00:04:45.190> been

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
top picks so and hopefully that's been

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.220 
top picks so and hopefully that's been
have<00:04:45.520> helped<00:04:45.790> you<00:04:45.910> and<00:04:46.120> any<00:04:46.780> comments<00:04:47.170> or
