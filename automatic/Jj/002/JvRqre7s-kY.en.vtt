00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.480
 welcome 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.309
 I'm Thomas Brockmeier that 's back 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.309
 a new video about jazz solo 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.040
 guitar and I want to explain how 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.320
 this funny piece comes about because 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.420
 that can also be called improvisations 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.830
 basis use the base is a 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:54.250
 blues now in cee 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:57.059
 I'll say smaller in kottan b777 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.730
 Vorhalt f7 Now something new is coming 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.200
 diminished is not unusual 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:09.930
 but so far never used now 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.930
 chromatically again under the 7 b 7 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:17.560
 and again it goes beyond 6 when their on 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.150
 my fingers peeks we see that the 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.860
 rohmarge be moved and the 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.190
 BasstÃ¶ne the actual memory 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.190
 bring 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.460
 can i separate what that too? 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.460
 we have already played several times 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.370
 no matter where I want it is always 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 the same interval 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.510
 what a little bit 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:53.960
 the number sounds 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.340
 you all know something similar has hendrix 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.700
 once started one of his hits 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.580
 that's exactly the same sound and that 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 you can just describe a whole 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.110
 if that's my c7 and i want one 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.560
 playing melody would be nice if 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.270
 this one as deep as possible goes if I am 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.940
 I do not have seven pages so I will 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:16.310
 set the tower to there 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.470
 and then I have this something deep 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.130
 the 7th c7 sounded then 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.920
 completely like this and then I have to 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.240
 sell as f7 that does not sound like it 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.400
 not wrong but is a bit 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.800
 bulky if I but the melody on it 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:38.160
 then it sounds like going on 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.210
 federal dinkhoff after c 7 and 11 7 11 7 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.540
 si 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.540
 11 7 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.120
 I can even sell that from Asia 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.680
 the lnb 77 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.359
 7 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.849
 I now have the goal here and there 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.219
 below is this interval 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.799
 interval haunts everyone 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:07.409
 music history parts in europe and 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.349
 It is well known that tritone does not mean the 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.629
 tritonus but the tritone and if 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:16.849
 I now you as rhythm goes in there 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:16.849
 a bigband with the thumb player 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:30.419
 not completely 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:36.000
 the sound is all the beatles 

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:37.829
 Guitarist with four punch the rhythm 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.629
 Load up a bit and hold together 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.159
 then i can only get the ones on it and 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:43.159
 the melody is not difficult 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.220
 123 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.410
 mu 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.129
 thank you in the next episode show 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.449
 I'll teach you how to improvise with it 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.449
 that may sound like that
