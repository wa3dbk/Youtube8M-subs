00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
multiple weeks now is that I highly

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.569 
multiple weeks now is that I highly
doubt<00:01:26.460> Carl<00:01:26.759> sensei<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> person<00:01:28.080> that

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
doubt Carl sensei is the person that

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:30.679 
doubt Carl sensei is the person that
destroyed<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> movement<00:01:29.939> or<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.270> destroyed

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
destroyed the movement or he destroyed

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
destroyed the movement or he destroyed
the<00:01:30.869> moon<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.259> he's<00:01:31.409> not<00:01:31.590> gonna<00:01:31.740> be<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
the moon but he's not gonna be the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
the moon but he's not gonna be the
person<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.310> kills<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.790> earth<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.360> like<00:01:33.689> one

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
person that kills the earth in like one

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.350 
person that kills the earth in like one
year's<00:01:34.170> time<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.530> highly<00:01:35.159> doubt<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.640> because

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
year's time I highly doubt that because

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.410 
year's time I highly doubt that because
once<00:01:36.810> again<00:01:36.960> more<00:01:37.439> evidence<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.880> could<00:01:39.240> be

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
once again more evidence or it could be

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
once again more evidence or it could be
a<00:01:39.450> vendetta<00:01:39.930> where<00:01:40.290> he<00:01:40.439> wants<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.860> revenge

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
a vendetta where he wants to get revenge

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950 
a vendetta where he wants to get revenge
that's<00:01:41.549> another<00:01:41.880> reason<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.390> could<00:01:42.570> see<00:01:42.720> course

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
that's another reason I could see course

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.270 
that's another reason I could see course
and<00:01:43.140> say<00:01:43.229> wanting<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.829> something<00:01:44.189> like

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and say wanting to do something like

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.880

body and then put those tentacles on to
the<00:03:15.389> kid<00:03:15.650> that's<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.799> possibility<00:03:17.310> maybe

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
the kid that's a possibility maybe

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.699 
the kid that's a possibility maybe
that's<00:03:17.879> why<00:03:18.090> Coral<00:03:18.449> since<00:03:18.629> it<00:03:18.750> was<00:03:18.840> so<00:03:19.049> angry

that's why Coral since it was so angry

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.469 
that's why Coral since it was so angry
because<00:03:20.250> maybe<00:03:20.699> the<00:03:20.940> tentacles<00:03:21.359> were

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:21.479 
because maybe the tentacles were

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.000 
because maybe the tentacles were
identical<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.229> her<00:03:22.409> because<00:03:22.650> we<00:03:22.739> don't<00:03:22.919> know

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010

because they know way too much about

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.660 
because they know way too much about
korosensei<00:05:24.630> they<00:05:24.930> know<00:05:25.080> way<00:05:25.440> too<00:05:25.500> much<00:05:25.830> I'm

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
korosensei they know way too much I'm

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.850 
korosensei they know way too much I'm
assuming<00:05:27.270> coral<00:05:27.540> since<00:05:27.750> they<00:05:27.840> broke<00:05:28.110> out<00:05:28.410> oh

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
assuming coral since they broke out oh

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:30.650 
assuming coral since they broke out oh
like<00:05:29.280> some<00:05:29.520> form<00:05:29.760> of<00:05:29.850> facility<00:05:30.450> he<00:05:30.540> was

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
like some form of facility he was

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.060 
like some form of facility he was
getting<00:05:30.870> experimented<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.560> since<00:05:31.830> he<00:05:31.890> says

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
getting experimented on since he says

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.770 
getting experimented on since he says
he's<00:05:32.220> an<00:05:32.310> artificial<00:05:32.760> life-form<00:05:33.180> I'm<00:05:33.600> guess

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
he's an artificial life-form I'm guess

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.060 
he's an artificial life-form I'm guess
he<00:05:33.930> was<00:05:34.080> experimented<00:05:34.740> on<00:05:34.800> he<00:05:35.100> broke<00:05:35.430> out<00:05:35.700> and

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
he was experimented on he broke out and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.230 
he was experimented on he broke out and
that's<00:05:38.070> why<00:05:38.310> he's<00:05:38.550> like<00:05:38.730> he<00:05:38.910> is<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.180> that's

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
that's why he's like he is and that's

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.760 
that's why he's like he is and that's
why<00:05:39.420> why<00:05:39.660> they<00:05:39.900> know<00:05:40.020> so<00:05:40.230> much<00:05:40.290> information

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
why why they know so much information

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.930 
why why they know so much information

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
episode they're kind of walking weapons

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.960 
episode they're kind of walking weapons
they<00:05:54.810> are<00:05:55.230> really<00:05:55.800> just<00:05:56.040> walking<00:05:56.550> fucking

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
they are really just walking fucking

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.300 
they are really just walking fucking
weapons<00:05:57.390> that's<00:05:57.540> what<00:05:57.870> they<00:05:58.050> are<00:05:58.290> and<00:05:58.650> chloral

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
weapons that's what they are and chloral

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:01.280 
weapons that's what they are and chloral
sensei<00:05:59.610> can<00:05:59.790> be<00:05:59.880> considered<00:06:00.360> a<00:06:00.510> weapon<00:06:01.080> to<00:06:01.260> a

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
sensei can be considered a weapon to a

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:03.770 
sensei can be considered a weapon to a
mass<00:06:01.680> destruction<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:03.210> so<00:06:03.450> let's<00:06:03.690> think

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
mass destruction and so let's think

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.740 
mass destruction and so let's think
about<00:06:03.930> this<00:06:04.140> why<00:06:05.030> why<00:06:06.030> would<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.360> government

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
about this why why would the government

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.270 
about this why why would the government
have<00:06:06.780> this<00:06:07.020> unless<00:06:07.440> they're<00:06:07.650> wanting<00:06:07.980> to<00:06:08.010> make

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 
have this unless they're wanting to make

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.190 
have this unless they're wanting to make
some<00:06:08.580> form<00:06:08.850> of<00:06:09.060> weapon<00:06:09.600> against<00:06:10.020> another

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
some form of weapon against another

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.040 
some form of weapon against another
country's<00:06:11.180> control<00:06:12.180> war<00:06:12.540> controlled<00:06:12.960> the

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
country's control war controlled the

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.750 
country's control war controlled the
earth<00:06:13.200> to<00:06:13.320> stuff<00:06:13.500> like<00:06:13.590> that<00:06:13.890> so<00:06:14.310> I'm<00:06:14.430> assuming

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
earth to stuff like that so I'm assuming

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.450 
earth to stuff like that so I'm assuming
reach<00:06:15.270> su<00:06:15.540> that<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.900> new<00:06:16.200> kid<00:06:16.530> Amon<00:06:16.950> Coulson<00:06:17.340> say

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
reach su that a new kid Amon Coulson say

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.000 
reach su that a new kid Amon Coulson say
was<00:06:17.610> made<00:06:17.880> to<00:06:18.420> be<00:06:18.510> engineered<00:06:18.990> as<00:06:19.200> biological

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:20.010 
was made to be engineered as biological

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.980 
was made to be engineered as biological
weapons<00:06:20.400> that's<00:06:20.730> what<00:06:21.000> I<00:06:21.030> think<00:06:21.420> is<00:06:21.540> going<00:06:21.810> on

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
weapons that's what I think is going on

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.990 
weapons that's what I think is going on
here<00:06:22.230> because<00:06:22.350> Crowson<00:06:23.310> say<00:06:23.430> definitely<00:06:23.790> is

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
here because Crowson say definitely is

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.730 
here because Crowson say definitely is
geared<00:06:24.630> towards<00:06:24.930> a<00:06:25.020> weapon<00:06:25.320> and<00:06:25.410> so<00:06:25.530> is<00:06:25.650> this

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
geared towards a weapon and so is this

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.140 
geared towards a weapon and so is this
kid<00:06:25.950> and<00:06:26.130> then<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.340> know<00:06:26.430> reads<00:06:26.640> who<00:06:26.790> they're

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
kid and then you know reads who they're

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.670 
kid and then you know reads who they're
geared<00:06:27.420> towards<00:06:27.720> weapons<00:06:28.380> of<00:06:28.500> mass

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
geared towards weapons of mass

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.989 
geared towards weapons of mass
destruction<00:06:29.130> so<00:06:30.020> yeah<00:06:31.020> there's<00:06:31.920> just

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:32.999
