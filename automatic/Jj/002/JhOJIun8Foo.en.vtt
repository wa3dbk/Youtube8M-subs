case with a lot of players because not

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.480

many players meet the requirements to
actually<00:02:01.000> do<00:02:01.270> the<00:02:01.630> player<00:02:01.840> in<00:02:01.990> ports<00:02:02.410> you<00:02:02.950> need

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:02.980 
actually do the player in ports you need

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.920 
actually do the player in ports you need
to<00:02:03.190> have<00:02:03.310> at<00:02:03.460> least<00:02:03.490> two<00:02:03.940> skills<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.750> are<00:02:04.840> at

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
to have at least two skills that are at

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.670 
to have at least two skills that are at
least<00:02:05.080> above<00:02:05.740> 90

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
least above 90

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.770 
least above 90
you<00:02:07.610> know<00:02:07.730> stuff<00:02:08.000> that's<00:02:08.240> actually<00:02:08.600> very

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
you know stuff that's actually very

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260 
you know stuff that's actually very
specific<00:02:09.740> you<00:02:10.250> know<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.490> thieving<00:02:11.060> or

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
specific you know like thieving or

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.790 
specific you know like thieving or
fishing<00:02:11.660> or<00:02:11.840> her<00:02:12.080> blur<00:02:12.290> or<00:02:12.320> something<00:02:12.710> like

fishing or her blur or something like

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.010 
fishing or her blur or something like
that<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.250> you<00:02:14.240> know<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.420> you<00:02:14.480> actually<00:02:14.660> have

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
that so you know if you actually have

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.540 
that so you know if you actually have
those<00:02:15.290> then<00:02:15.650> you<00:02:15.860> probably<00:02:16.070> have<00:02:16.190> actually

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
those then you probably have actually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.210 
those then you probably have actually
use<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.910> scrimshaw<00:02:17.300> before<00:02:17.920> really<00:02:18.920> curious

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
use the scrimshaw before really curious

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.910 
use the scrimshaw before really curious
to<00:02:19.370> see<00:02:19.730> exactly<00:02:20.210> what<00:02:20.690> these<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:21.260> new<00:02:21.500> items

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
to see exactly what these two new items

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.160 
to see exactly what these two new items
are<00:02:22.070> going<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.250> do<00:02:22.430> now<00:02:23.390> they're<00:02:23.720> stating<00:02:24.050> that

are going to do now they're stating that
it's<00:02:24.350> going<00:02:24.500> to<00:02:24.709> be<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.390> companion<00:02:26.390> skill<00:02:27.020> to

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
it's going to be a companion skill to

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.720 
it's going to be a companion skill to
what<00:02:27.860> they're<00:02:28.010> actually<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.640> be

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
what they're actually going to be

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.610 
what they're actually going to be
releasing<00:02:29.150> next<00:02:29.390> year<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.140> we're<00:02:30.350> going<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.530> be

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
releasing next year so we're going to be

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.890 
releasing next year so we're going to be
getting<00:02:30.740> another<00:02:31.280> skill<00:02:31.700> sometime<00:02:32.480> next<00:02:32.720> year

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
getting another skill sometime next year

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.320 
getting another skill sometime next year
which<00:02:33.230> is<00:02:33.260> actually<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.310> good<00:02:34.580> it's

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
which is actually really good it's

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.910 
which is actually really good it's
actually<00:02:35.690> going<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.900> keep<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.320> game<00:02:36.680> fresh

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
actually going to keep the game fresh

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.130 
actually going to keep the game fresh
and<00:02:37.580> for<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> people<00:02:38.300> that<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.630> already<00:02:38.989> got

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
and for the people that have already got

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.870 
and for the people that have already got
the<00:02:39.440> completion<00:02:40.220> escape<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.640> everything

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
the completion escape and everything

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.970 
the completion escape and everything
like<00:02:41.000> that<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.750> gives<00:02:41.959> them<00:02:42.110> a<00:02:42.230> new<00:02:42.380> goal<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.860> go

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
like that it gives them a new goal to go

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.060 
like that it gives them a new goal to go
for<00:02:43.280> now<00:02:43.810> it's<00:02:44.810> supposed<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.200> also<00:02:45.440> be<00:02:45.770> helpful

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
for now it's supposed to also be helpful

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.570 
for now it's supposed to also be helpful
towards<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:48.560> know<00:02:48.650> your<00:02:48.860> other<00:02:49.070> gathering

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
towards you know your other gathering

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.190 
towards you know your other gathering
skills<00:02:49.730> I'm<00:02:50.120> guessing<00:02:50.420> that's<00:02:50.540> like<00:02:50.810> towards

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
skills I'm guessing that's like towards

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.830 
skills I'm guessing that's like towards
wood<00:02:51.440> cutting<00:02:51.920> and<00:02:52.370> stuff<00:02:52.760> like<00:02:52.910> that<00:02:52.970> so<00:02:53.690> it's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
wood cutting and stuff like that so it's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.360 
wood cutting and stuff like that so it's
going<00:02:53.959> to<00:02:54.020> be<00:02:54.110> really<00:02:54.350> interesting<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.040> see

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
going to be really interesting to see

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.090 
going to be really interesting to see
how<00:02:55.880> this<00:02:56.090> skill<00:02:56.480> plays<00:02:56.780> out<00:02:57.050> and<00:02:57.290> assists

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
how this skill plays out and assists

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.940 
how this skill plays out and assists
with<00:02:58.310> those<00:02:58.489> other<00:02:58.730> things<00:02:59.090> so<00:02:59.930> that's<00:03:00.770> pretty

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
with those other things so that's pretty

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.770 
with those other things so that's pretty
much<00:03:01.100> all<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.489> information<00:03:01.970> we<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.150> on<00:03:02.540> the

images<00:03:18.709> this<00:03:18.920> is<00:03:19.040> actually<00:03:19.370> going<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.580> be

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
images this is actually going to be

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.280 
images this is actually going to be
pretty<00:03:19.910> cool<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.420> looks<00:03:20.690> like<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:20.870> really

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
pretty cool it looks like a really

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.070 
pretty cool it looks like a really
well-done<00:03:21.860> rework<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.850> they're<00:03:23.750> gonna<00:03:23.840> be

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
well-done rework and they're gonna be

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.229 
well-done rework and they're gonna be
making<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:24.650> to<00:03:24.860> where<00:03:25.040> it's<00:03:25.280> actually<00:03:25.489> seeing

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
making it to where it's actually seeing

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.470 
making it to where it's actually seeing
events<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.930> sixth<00:03:27.410> age<00:03:27.610> so<00:03:28.610> you<00:03:28.970> know
