00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.600
 In this video we show you the one with 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:18.090
 boxee did mix before it starts 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.290
 pointed out that of epoxy resin 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.110
 Dangers to health 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.960
 can and especially skin irritation 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.040
 and allergic reactions 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.720
 That's why you have to process yourself 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.520
 accordingly protect from popstars 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.500
 by getting latex or lower 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.390
 gloves and also one 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.480
 safety glasses so no proxy did in 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.270
 the eyes can not spray with it 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.440
 Concentrated vapors are inhaled 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.840
 you have to have a certified one 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 wear a respirator or at least 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.559
 air the workshop well 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.899
 The oxide never gets alone 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.640
 always used only mixed with herta 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.440
 for the curing of the mixture is the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.449
 Exact dosage important the the 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.050
 manufacturer of components always on the 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:04.269
 should indicate the dosage 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 therefore a digital scale with gram 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.950
 to be used more precisely 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.510
 the exact calculation of the quantities with 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.270
 circumvent care a calculator 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.150
 by preparing a mix table 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.980
 in the for any foxi taz amount 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:22.360
 already the correct amount of herta 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:24.580
 indicated is suitable as a mixing vessel 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.250
 stable plastic cups good the 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.570
 it should therefore be transparent to 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.590
 Condition of the mixture always good 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.780
 can control 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.980
 So now you give a certain amount 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.980
 Epoxy in the cup 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:46.119
 and then you give the appropriate 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:48.490
 Tougher both components must be good 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.149
 be stirred together because they are 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.979
 not automatically people 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:58.840
 Wooden sticks are well suited 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.640
 is that on the edge and the floor 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.280
 the speaker mixing well off 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.630
 you should pipe at least two and 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.140
 even longer if it is in the workshop 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.670
 Cold is when you have a table construction machine 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.000
 You can also enjoy the good too 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.040
 use mix 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.590
 this is well suited with plastic 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.970
 Propeller because less bubbles in 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.580
 the mixture is moved into as 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:31.900
 if you get by hand if you want that 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.709
 Mix now in this liquid form 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.269
 wants to use 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.030
 for example if you have one 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.739
 It should have a role to play in 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.459
 protected by a flat container 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.750
 So for example a selection 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.299
 In this way, the extended 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.950
 processing time so the business 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:53.019
 not so quickly if you have the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.390
 herta mixture, however, to stick or 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.150
 you want to use as a filler 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.239
 also fillers to give 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 this will create the mix 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.079
 show in this case how to measure a mass 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.680
 mixed with the rolls of the 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.900
 can produce hull side 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.760
 First, we give some epoxide 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.959
 dye to allow the putty 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.959
 not white but brown 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:25.590
 then we give a slightly brittle 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.590
 Filler to so-called micro berlins 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.099
 Gradually, small amounts of 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.810
 powder stirred until the mass of the 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.819
 proper consistency has to fill 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.560
 the consistency should be such that the 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.030
 Do not crowd the pots often 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.739
 it is then practically the filler 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.989
 to fill in a bag 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.989
 because they are easier to apply then 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.580
 This is one thing you can stick to 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.360
 Use freezer bags when over 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:04.489
 a clean beaker you die sets 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:11.170
 the mass into it twists the opening 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:13.190
 of the bag and cuts off the top 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.209
 that way, masses can be well on the 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.209
 apply completely 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.610
 order and speaker can be 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.750
 Incidentally, use several times 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.560
 The bargains you can easily with 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.720
 wipe off a paper towel 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.169
 At the store you can also paper towels 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.169
 use 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.090
 and if that is not enough you can 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.449
 something to do or epoxide cleaner to do it 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.449
 to take 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.880
 After that, the cup is almost like new
