00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.880 
installed I've been very pleased so far
so<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:06.569> box<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.870> get<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.109> actual<00:00:07.589> nest

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
so in the box you get the actual nest

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.470 
so in the box you get the actual nest
unit<00:00:08.220> itself<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.760> looks<00:00:08.940> amazing

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
unit itself which looks amazing

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.560 
unit itself which looks amazing
so<00:00:10.050> instructions<00:00:10.880> it<00:00:11.880> does<00:00:12.090> state<00:00:12.360> you<00:00:12.540> should

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
so instructions it does state you should

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.480 
so instructions it does state you should
get<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.110> professional<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.740> fit<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.099> rather

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
get a professional to fit this rather

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.460 
get a professional to fit this rather
than<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> go<00:00:15.000> yourself<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:16.289> think

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
than have a go yourself and I think

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.260 
than have a go yourself and I think
that's<00:00:16.619> promoted<00:00:17.190> because<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> new<00:00:17.940> unit

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
that's promoted because of a new unit

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.960 
that's promoted because of a new unit
that's<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.600> included<00:00:19.050> for<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.439> UK<00:00:19.890> which<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that's been included for the UK which is

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.189 
that's been included for the UK which is
the<00:00:21.949> baccarat<00:00:22.949> see<00:00:23.189> here<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:24.930> box

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
the baccarat see here so this box

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.769 
the baccarat see here so this box
requires<00:00:25.500> into<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.130> boiler<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.480> on

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
requires into the boiler and then on

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.150 
requires into the boiler and then on
into<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.410> nest

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
into the nest

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
into the nest
so<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:30.029> boil<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.420> only<00:00:30.570> change<00:00:30.720> I've<00:00:30.900> had<00:00:31.050> to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and that box powers the actual nest and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.020 
and that box powers the actual nest and
the<00:00:40.320> nest<00:00:40.350> comes<00:00:40.739> on<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.100> detects<00:00:41.430> motion<00:00:41.640> and

so<00:01:48.340> over<00:01:48.460> time<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:48.700> builds<00:01:48.939> up<00:01:49.149> a<00:01:49.299> nice

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
so over time it builds up a nice

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.819 
so over time it builds up a nice
schedule<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.110> as<00:01:50.200> you<00:01:50.259> can<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.530> here<00:01:50.680> this

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
schedule and as you can see here this

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:52.289 
schedule and as you can see here this
this<00:01:51.159> isn't<00:01:51.310> something<00:01:51.579> I've<00:01:51.820> done<00:01:51.970> this<00:01:52.149> is

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
this isn't something I've done this is

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:53.639 
this isn't something I've done this is
something<00:01:52.450> the<00:01:52.750> nest<00:01:52.990> has<00:01:53.140> learned<00:01:53.380> that

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649 
something the nest has learned that

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:55.679 
something the nest has learned that
we've<00:01:53.829> changed<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.030> temperature<00:01:55.450> at<00:01:55.540> these

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
we've changed the temperature at these

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.480 
we've changed the temperature at these
times<00:01:55.990> on<00:01:56.200> these<00:01:56.350> days<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:56.950> so<00:01:57.039> it<00:01:57.159> starting

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
times on these days and so it starting

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.060 
times on these days and so it starting
to<00:01:57.520> populate<00:01:58.060> the<00:01:58.210> list<00:01:58.680> because<00:01:59.680> this<00:01:59.950> is

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
to populate the list because this is

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.710 
to populate the list because this is
internet-enabled<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.970> can<00:02:01.149> use<00:02:01.299> this<00:02:01.420> with

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
internet-enabled you can use this with

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.320 
internet-enabled you can use this with
your<00:02:01.960> mobile<00:02:02.140> app<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.610> that<00:02:03.729> I've<00:02:03.820> I'm<00:02:04.149> using

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
Android and you can set the temperature

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.440 
Android and you can set the temperature
and<00:02:06.009> basically<00:02:06.520> everything<00:02:06.850> you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.090> do<00:02:07.240> on

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
the next unit itself you can do via the

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.400 
the next unit itself you can do via the
app<00:02:10.149> and<00:02:10.599> that's<00:02:10.869> includes<00:02:11.200> not<00:02:11.380> just

app and that's includes not just
assessing<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:11.890> temperature<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.519> also

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
assessing the temperature but also

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.750 
assessing the temperature but also
checking<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.060> schedule<00:02:14.489> changing<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.580> from
