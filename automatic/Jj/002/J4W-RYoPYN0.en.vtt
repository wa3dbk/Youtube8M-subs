00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
all of that stuff it's basically if you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.850 
all of that stuff it's basically if you
shoot<00:01:47.909> Canon<00:01:48.420> already<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.899> canon<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.500> if<00:01:49.799> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
difference that I see that is really

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.920 
difference that I see that is really
worth<00:01:56.490> mentioning<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.180> worrying<00:01:57.509> about<00:01:57.540> is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
worth mentioning and worrying about is

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.030 
worth mentioning and worrying about is
the<00:01:58.439> autofocus<00:01:59.100> system<00:01:59.340> the<00:02:00.149> nikon<00:02:00.710> d600<00:02:01.710> has

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the autofocus system the nikon d600 has

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.319 
the autofocus system the nikon d600 has
39<00:02:02.689> AF<00:02:03.689> points<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.619> 15<00:02:05.159> cross-type<00:02:05.820> points

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
in the center of the frame ok that's a

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.960 
in the center of the frame ok that's a
lot<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.879> cross<00:02:09.179> type

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
lot of cross type

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.630 
lot of cross type
wants<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.240> choose<00:02:10.450> from<00:02:10.690> 39<00:02:11.650> AF<00:02:12.160> points<00:02:12.520> and

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
wants to choose from 39 AF points and

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.150 
wants to choose from 39 AF points and
total<00:02:12.970> is<00:02:13.030> also<00:02:13.390> really<00:02:13.630> nice<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.350> 6d<00:02:14.950> on

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
total is also really nice if the 6d on

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.690 
total is also really nice if the 6d on
the<00:02:15.280> other<00:02:15.400> hand<00:02:15.670> has<00:02:16.260> 11<00:02:17.260> AF<00:02:17.710> points<00:02:18.160> with<00:02:18.340> one

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
cross type point in the center that's it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.960 
cross type point in the center that's it
the<00:02:22.270> fact<00:02:22.570> is<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.080> d600<00:02:23.950> has<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.160> faster<00:02:24.760> and

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the fact is the d600 has a faster and

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.300 
the fact is the d600 has a faster and
better<00:02:25.150> autofocus<00:02:26.020> system<00:02:26.050> hands<00:02:26.740> down<00:02:27.040> it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
better autofocus system hands down it

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.720 
better autofocus system hands down it
just<00:02:27.640> is<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.990> 6d<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.710> a<00:02:29.740> very<00:02:30.130> good<00:02:30.220> camera

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
just is so the 6d is a very good camera

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.730 
just is so the 6d is a very good camera
and<00:02:30.940> if<00:02:31.240> you<00:02:31.360> don't<00:02:31.540> need<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:31.960> a<00:02:31.990> superfast

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
and if you don't need like a superfast

and if you don't need like a superfast
super-sophisticated<00:02:33.480> autofocus<00:02:34.480> system<00:02:34.510> go

super-sophisticated autofocus system go

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
ahead and get it especially if you've

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.920 
ahead and get it especially if you've
already<00:02:36.700> invested<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.330> a<00:02:37.390> bunch<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.630> Canon

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.300 
out on top and my opinion for that
reason<00:02:45.700> our<00:02:46.180> next<00:02:46.540> question<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.200> about<00:02:47.770> image

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
reason our next question is about image

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.820 
reason our next question is about image

resolution and the question is does the

an<00:05:41.140> inch<00:05:41.400> sensors<00:05:42.400> in<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:42.610> Sony<00:05:42.880> it<00:05:43.180> might

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
an inch sensors in the Sony it might

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.300 
an inch sensors in the Sony it might
just<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.780> the<00:05:43.810> top<00:05:44.230> of<00:05:44.410> my<00:05:44.560> finger<00:05:45.040> right<00:05:45.280> here

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
just be the top of my finger right here

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.550 
just be the top of my finger right here
that's<00:05:45.700> receiving<00:05:46.090> light<00:05:46.390> that's<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.230> tiny

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
that's receiving light that's a tiny

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.190 
that's receiving light that's a tiny
area<00:05:48.220> compared<00:05:48.670> to<00:05:48.760> the<00:05:48.880> big<00:05:49.210> piece<00:05:49.630> of<00:05:49.660> image

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
area compared to the big piece of image

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.200 
area compared to the big piece of image
that's<00:05:50.710> being<00:05:50.980> received<00:05:51.340> on<00:05:51.520> this<00:05:51.700> photo<00:05:51.880> site

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
that's being received on this photo site

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.720 
that's being received on this photo site
here<00:05:52.480> so<00:05:53.050> bigger<00:05:53.560> sensors<00:05:54.040> make<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.280> difference

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
here so bigger sensors make a difference

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.730 
here so bigger sensors make a difference
in<00:05:54.850> that<00:05:55.090> sony<00:05:55.390> camera<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.080> sensor<00:05:56.410> is<00:05:56.500> very

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:56.740 
in that sony camera the sensor is very

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.310 
in that sony camera the sensor is very
tiny<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:57.460> because<00:05:58.450> it<00:05:58.570> has<00:05:58.720> even<00:05:59.050> more

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
tiny and because it has even more

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.010 
tiny and because it has even more
megapixels<00:05:59.830> crammed<00:06:00.460> onto<00:06:00.670> it<00:06:01.030> those<00:06:01.510> pixels

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:02.020 
megapixels crammed onto it those pixels

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.340 
megapixels crammed onto it those pixels
are<00:06:02.290> even<00:06:02.860> tinier<00:06:03.550> than<00:06:03.580> normal<00:06:04.150> so<00:06:04.780> the<00:06:05.050> sony

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
are even tinier than normal so the sony

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.380 
are even tinier than normal so the sony
is<00:06:05.560> not<00:06:05.800> going<00:06:05.980> to<00:06:06.100> provide<00:06:06.370> as<00:06:06.760> good<00:06:07.120> of<00:06:07.150> an

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:07.390 
is not going to provide as good of an

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.080 
is not going to provide as good of an
image<00:06:07.780> in<00:06:08.020> terms<00:06:08.350> of<00:06:08.530> quality<00:06:08.800> as<00:06:09.190> that<00:06:09.640> nikon

image in terms of quality as that nikon
d<00:06:10.300> 3100<00:06:10.780> is<00:06:11.290> the<00:06:11.830> size<00:06:12.100> of<00:06:12.250> the<00:06:12.400> sensor<00:06:12.820> is<00:06:12.940> also

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
d 3100 is the size of the sensor is also

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.800 
d 3100 is the size of the sensor is also
why<00:06:14.200> large<00:06:14.680> frame<00:06:15.220> sensors<00:06:16.090> like<00:06:16.450> the<00:06:16.600> full

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
why large frame sensors like the full

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.800 
why large frame sensors like the full
frame<00:06:17.110> cameras<00:06:17.920> respond<00:06:18.730> better<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.420> perform

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
frame cameras respond better and perform

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.810 
frame cameras respond better and perform
better<00:06:20.050> in<00:06:20.170> lower<00:06:20.530> light<00:06:20.680> situations<00:06:21.070> at

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
better in lower light situations at

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.570 
better in lower light situations at
higher<00:06:22.360> ISO<00:06:23.020> because<00:06:23.800> if<00:06:23.920> you<00:06:24.040> have<00:06:24.220> a<00:06:24.250> bigger

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
higher ISO because if you have a bigger

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.270 
higher ISO because if you have a bigger
photo<00:06:24.910> site<00:06:25.360> that<00:06:26.200> bigger<00:06:26.470> photo<00:06:26.740> site<00:06:27.040> again

can<00:06:27.610> collect<00:06:27.940> more<00:06:28.180> light<00:06:28.240> which<00:06:28.990> means<00:06:29.260> when

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 
can collect more light which means when

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.470 
can collect more light which means when

we've<00:06:58.250> been<00:06:58.400> talking<00:06:58.760> a<00:06:58.820> lot<00:06:58.970> about<00:06:59.030> and

we've been talking a lot about and

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.840 
we've been talking a lot about and
that's<00:06:59.990> the<00:07:00.260> lens<00:07:00.620> that<00:07:01.010> you<00:07:01.130> put<00:07:01.370> on<00:07:01.610> your

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.070 
camera good lenses will help you produce

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.510 
camera good lenses will help you produce
better<00:07:04.490> quality<00:07:04.640> images<00:07:05.570> so<00:07:06.170> it's<00:07:06.830> not<00:07:07.070> one

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 
better quality images so it's not one

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.270 
better quality images so it's not one
thing<00:07:07.940> that<00:07:08.510> indicates<00:07:09.170> image<00:07:09.560> quality<00:07:09.830> and

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 
thing that indicates image quality and

thing that indicates image quality and
image<00:07:10.970> resolution<00:07:11.180> is<00:07:11.750> a<00:07:11.780> misleading<00:07:12.140> thing
