 in the Italian championship and then players 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.789
 to discover 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 then we need to focus on them 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.809
 features and hope that the 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.539
 basketball that we will propose both 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.729
 effective for those who are ours 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.240
 seasonal goals to be immediately 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.170
 get ready for a preseason that will be 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.890
 made complex by the situation sciences 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.630
 which is common to many other clubs but in the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.460
 which we will have to have the strength to 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.920
 stay focused on ours 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 goals and be able to improve sitting 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.180
 after sitting to make us ready 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.670
 at the beginning of the new season there 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.350
 immediately presents very obstacles 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.680
 challenging both in the championship and in 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.680
 Euroleague 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.450
 well first of all as mentioned by the unit 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.160
 from the team's ability to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.780
 share basketball we should 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.750
 learn to speak the same language 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.340
 that from the point of view strictly 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 competitive to be able to express 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.170
 a game that justifies the fortissimo 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.980
 wish we have and want 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.980
 demonstrate to compete 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.800
 I know deeply the values ​​on which you are 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 the history of this di is built 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.350
 this club and I do not hide that way

 in which we conceived the team 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.880
 seems to be able to trace there 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.530
 and then the idea is to go to 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:31.250
 recover certain values and propose a 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.360
 group of players who are capable of 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.380
 retrace the deeds of those who have them 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.360
 preceded 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.880
 with the pride of being able to emulate them e 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.940
 without feeling the pressure of having to 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940
