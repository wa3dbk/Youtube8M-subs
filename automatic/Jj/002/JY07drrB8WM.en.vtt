00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.560 
along each brush path in the next frame
we<00:01:15.720> reproject<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.470> samples<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> image<00:01:17.280> space

of the strokes and avoiding the pop the
next<00:01:58.660> step<00:01:58.900> is<00:01:59.080> to<00:01:59.229> parameterize<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.100> brush

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
next step is to parameterize the brush

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.550 
next step is to parameterize the brush
paths<00:02:00.550> stroke<00:02:01.420> qualities<00:02:01.900> such<00:02:02.140> as<00:02:02.170> width

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.710 
paths stroke qualities such as width
texture<00:02:03.220> and<00:02:03.430> Wiggles<00:02:03.790> vary<00:02:04.360> along<00:02:04.510> the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
texture and Wiggles vary along the

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.530
