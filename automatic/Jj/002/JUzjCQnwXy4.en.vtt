dry conditions one of the features we

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
dry conditions one of the features we

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
what that does is when it's active keeps

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.890 
what that does is when it's active keeps

really<00:01:51.810> like<00:01:51.990> most<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.470> xc60<00:01:53.100> s<00:01:53.250> interior

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
really like most of the xc60 s interior

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.639 
really like most of the xc60 s interior
for<00:01:54.119> example<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.630> some<00:01:54.810> nice<00:01:54.990> materials<00:01:55.500> such

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
for example so some nice materials such

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.130 
for example so some nice materials such
as<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> leather<00:01:56.070> seats<00:01:56.460> soft<00:01:57.180> touch<00:01:57.450> -<00:01:57.750> and

gauges some of the buttons here they're

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.429 
gauges some of the buttons here they're
a<00:02:03.210> little<00:02:03.390> small<00:02:03.780> and<00:02:03.930> they're<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.110> little<00:02:04.170> low

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
a little small and they're a little low

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.840 
a little small and they're a little low
on<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.680> dash<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.250> makes<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.700> hard

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
on the dash that makes it kind of hard

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.580 
on the dash that makes it kind of hard
to<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.180> them<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.479> they<00:02:06.630> lack<00:02:06.810> contrast<00:02:07.439> in

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to see them and they lack contrast in

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.290 
to see them and they lack contrast in
certain<00:02:07.890> light<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.399> again<00:02:08.670> it's<00:02:08.879> tough<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.209> get

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
certain light so again it's tough to get

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.240 
certain light so again it's tough to get
to<00:02:09.450> them<00:02:09.599> one<00:02:10.229> drawback<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:10.950> aluminum

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
to them one drawback to this aluminum

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.370 
to them one drawback to this aluminum
look<00:02:11.670> center<00:02:11.970> stack<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.629> edge

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
look center stack is this edge

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.080 
look center stack is this edge
a<00:02:13.440> little<00:02:13.710> sharp<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.220> some<00:02:14.370> drivers<00:02:14.790> felt

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
a little sharp and some drivers felt

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.310 
a little sharp and some drivers felt
that<00:02:15.210> they<00:02:15.270> bang<00:02:15.450> their<00:02:15.660> knee<00:02:15.810> against<00:02:16.200> it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
that they bang their knee against it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.230 
that they bang their knee against it
also<00:02:16.710> the<00:02:17.220> seats<00:02:17.550> are<00:02:17.730> really<00:02:17.970> really

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
also the seats are really really

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.550 
also the seats are really really
comfortable<00:02:18.510> but<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.230> have<00:02:19.320> a<00:02:19.350> very

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
comfortable but there have a very

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.230 
comfortable but there have a very
slippery<00:02:19.920> leather<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.760> bottoms<00:02:21.150> are

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
slippery leather and the bottoms are

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.060 
slippery leather and the bottoms are
very<00:02:21.480> very<00:02:21.690> flat<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.350> some<00:02:22.500> people<00:02:22.740> felt<00:02:22.830> they

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
very very flat so some people felt they

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.430 
very very flat so some people felt they
slid<00:02:23.340> around<00:02:23.460> a<00:02:23.730> lot<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.030> them<00:02:24.180> one<00:02:25.170> thing<00:02:25.320> we

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
slid around a lot in them one thing we

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.900 
slid around a lot in them one thing we
didn't<00:02:25.680> like<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> 2-step<00:02:26.520> starting

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
didn't like is a 2-step starting

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.500 
didn't like is a 2-step starting

kind of a silly procedure getting into
the<00:02:41.010> back<00:02:41.160> seat<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.580> xc60<00:02:42.210> is<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.390> bit<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.630> a

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
the back seat of the xc60 is a bit of a

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.630 
the back seat of the xc60 is a bit of a
challenge<00:02:42.960> first<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:43.920> door<00:02:44.160> opening<00:02:44.520> is

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
challenge first the door opening is

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.130 
challenge first the door opening is
narrow<00:02:44.880> and<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.330> once<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.630> get<00:02:45.810> through

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
narrow and then once you get through
