00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.299
 today we will show you how we will 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:08.790
 plant this summer tomato tree well or 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:15.839
 also called tomatoes in a barrel 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:22.140
 tomatoes in general in any container which 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:26.330
 you like and so for a start we will take 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.429
 a tomato bush you can land 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.099
 whether to take seedlings directly with seeds 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.290
 but since now is the beginning of the season I think 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.920
 seedlings all have 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:41.070
 take the best tall if you like 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.590
 varieties as they stretch well up 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.920
 and in principle their growth is unlimited 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:52.170
 that is, the height of the bush will be high and 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 get a lot of fruits we took 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:58.379
 capacity about 30 liters here in it 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.820
 maybe more maybe less so 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:07.979
 and in such a way prepared her on y 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.140
 it is not there and at the very bottom we 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.850
 poured out 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.549
 a little bricks trouble 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.280
 this is done in order to root 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.729
 the system was getting 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:27.210
 air access here and sprinkled 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.640
 straw to the bottom of this barrel capacity we 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.150
 lay out 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.370
 this tube they did well into 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.310
 random order holes through 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.830
 which will occur watering she 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.510
 will be brought out on top of the bush and 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:50.450
 he will pour water he water and irrigate 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:57.890
 the whole root system like this 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:02.990
 we put the end here revealed and 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.990
 we start to plant a tomato bush 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:14.840
 then this tomato we have all the growth 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.989
 winter on the windowsill 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:24.660
 Now we have you decided to transplant in a barrel 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.890
 make it a tomato tree because 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.430
 Tomato has whole stem 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.350
 it is also its root system 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.670
 we are now 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.860
 disconnect the regiment for which he was 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.989
 tied up and also 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:44.040
 we put it in a barrel and only a small one 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.630
 part of the top will leave outside which 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:54.569
 further we will be as we grow 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:58.390
 sprinkle with earth like this 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.939
 we folded it in a spiral and leave 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:04.180
 the top of everything else then goes to his 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:12.489
 Kafka springs in root system she 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:22.810
 will actively develop and fill up 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:25.389
 forces on this bushes we already by the way 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:28.359
 tomatoes began to form but we 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:46.030
 they also sleep and leave such 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:48.400
 little tip here and how we tell you 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.750
 shown here in this hole will pour 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.889
 water because the course will be high 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.449
 at the same time through this hose will be 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:03.159
 pass air circulation and give 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:06.340
 oxygen to the roots of the barrel we fill 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.220
 the earth is not fully we will look like 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.359
 our course is developing and we will also 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:17.859
 fall asleep all the stepchildren all the foliage 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:21.330
 to the full height of the barrel is also possible 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.259
 lay here right now put hay and 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.960
 again a layer of earth 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.960
 but you can basically leave it like this 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.700
 right here right here I am a little bit 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:43.390
 distracting from potatoes growing potatoes 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.920
 at prices we see what sprouts already 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.100
 did not appear 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:52.150
 if you go there you will see which ones 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.090
 powerful stems have formed and even have 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.110
 already small potato was 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.970
 young under some bushes so 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.790
 Well, so here we are zamulchirovani top 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:09.310
 hay our course is tomato and now his 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:12.550
 shed water with these what's called 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:16.170
 gasoline sm medications yes anyone baikal 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.170
 we have homemade drugs for them 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.690
 here in this barrel we have prepared 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:31.330
 biological cocktail that we make 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:37.509
 from fresh grass with the addition of Baikal 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:42.340
 Here and in roughly in proportion liter 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:46.820
 cocktail in 10 liters of water and stir 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:50.720
 you can water our tomatoes now 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.930
 I need a very good watering while 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.180
 the whole root system develops 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:06:00.320
 then later as you grow you just need 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.840
 watch him grow a bush and 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:14.960
 naturally feed when 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:21.289
 necessary after transplant we 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:24.009
 all shed do not see how it will grow 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:24.009
 our bush 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:32.430
 what face invented spoons which he grew 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:38.430
 here the earth will settle now 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:41.320
 as the action of these drugs 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:45.720
 biological it will overlap 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:51.010
 turn into such a substrate 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:51.880
 hips up we poured now yes not about 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.920
 a bucket of water 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:59.790
 10 liters of this will be enough here on 

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:04.530
 while we have it now 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:07.390
 the whole ink system is formed up 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.190
 pour water you do not be afraid water 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.130
 much because the surplus 

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:14.790
 you will come out on because at the bottom of this 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:14.790
 there is no barrel 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:23.890
 we wish you success in your labors 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.310
 monitor the growth of this tomato tree 

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:30.220
 and naturally 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:34.330
 we will post new videos so 

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:38.130
 can comment add can 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:42.930
 be some comments 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.930
 all goodbye in
