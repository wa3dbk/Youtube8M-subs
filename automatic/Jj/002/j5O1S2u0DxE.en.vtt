 Their photo was stolen from the internet. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.049

 Come back and recognize me. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.440

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.789
 nephews to discover how everyone 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.340
 turned ad stars this one called 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.440
 from new york to the store there in good view 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.879
 The store also did not know and 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 Headquarters in Manaus 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.989
 so with this pilgrimage by telephone 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 came the answer 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 the photo was chosen by an agency 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.140
 advertising that no longer exists 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.049
 I got to talk to someone from da 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 Agency who worked at the agency that 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.990
 basically confirmed that they took 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.850
 from Internet 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.159
 the story went to the American newspaper 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 the new york times in a signed article 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.189
 by sam 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.619
 in note the company grows fast said 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.970
 which relied on the legality of the rights 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.100
 image copyright 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 jurisprudence already exists in Brazil to 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.170
 such cases justice believes that the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.900
 images that are on the internet are not 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.299
 public domain if they are used without 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.850
 the persons appearing in the 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.399
 photos and even the photographer has 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.380
 The right to compensation depends on the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.049
 damage to a smaller scale the indemnification 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.490
 usually a few thousand reais but can 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.500
 reach millions 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.780
 this rights lawyer 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.469
 The author says that the best way to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.939
 protect is to read the authorization terms 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.500
 especially in social networks, which 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.140
 almost nobody does 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.000
 I'm authorizing certain uses 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.060
 of the pictures of the posts are 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.360
 made in the comments of the videos whose 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.069
 pilot is made for the internet then 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.379
 really is 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.879
 restoration that there also the limits 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:20.739

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.739
