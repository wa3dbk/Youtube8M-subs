00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
now so we got to shim that up no way

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.140 
now so we got to shim that up no way
about<00:02:52.400> it<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.530> is<00:02:54.590> Savannah<00:02:55.310> this<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
about it now this is Savannah this is a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.640 
about it now this is Savannah this is a
different<00:02:56.510> horse<00:02:56.630> is<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> daughter<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.590> the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
different horse is the daughter and the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.830 
different horse is the daughter and the
saddle<00:02:58.550> is<00:02:58.640> still<00:02:58.880> popping<00:02:59.330> up<00:02:59.450> look<00:02:59.630> at<00:02:59.690> how

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
saddle is still popping up look at how

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.440 
saddle is still popping up look at how
bad<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.440> is<00:03:00.500> on<00:03:00.830> this<00:03:01.010> side<00:03:01.280> smaller<00:03:02.239> and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
bad this is on this side smaller and

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.270 
bad this is on this side smaller and
we've<00:03:02.570> got<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> smaller<00:03:03.200> pad<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.890> seemed<00:03:04.250> to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
we've got the smaller pad that seemed to

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.620 
we've got the smaller pad that seemed to
work<00:03:04.340> better<00:03:04.489> because<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.120> other<00:03:05.209> pad<00:03:05.450> was

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
work better because the other pad was

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.170 
work better because the other pad was
too<00:03:05.840> long<00:03:06.019> and<00:03:06.290> jammed<00:03:06.620> them<00:03:06.940> here<00:03:07.940> in<00:03:08.120> this

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
too long and jammed them here in this

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.130 
too long and jammed them here in this
area<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.670> was<00:03:10.790> helping<00:03:11.780> push<00:03:11.989> the

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
area and so it was helping push the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.930 
area and so it was helping push the
saddle<00:03:12.440> forward<00:03:12.709> so<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:12.950> shorter<00:03:13.310> pad<00:03:13.550> seems

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
saddle forward so this shorter pad seems

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.210 
saddle forward so this shorter pad seems
to<00:03:14.120> fit<00:03:14.360> their<00:03:14.720> bodies<00:03:15.110> better<00:03:15.350> but<00:03:16.070> still

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
to fit their bodies better but still

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.660 
to fit their bodies better but still
we've<00:03:16.640> got<00:03:16.790> a<00:03:16.820> whole<00:03:17.209> lot<00:03:17.540> of<00:03:18.070> space<00:03:19.070> under<00:03:19.640> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
we've got a whole lot of space under the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.960 
we've got a whole lot of space under the
back<00:03:19.940> end<00:03:20.150> of<00:03:20.269> this<00:03:20.360> saddle<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:20.930> just<00:03:21.970> yeah

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
back end of this saddle it's just yeah

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.770 
back end of this saddle it's just yeah
and<00:03:23.299> then<00:03:24.610> with<00:03:25.610> whoops<00:03:26.299> I<00:03:26.390> gotta<00:03:26.540> go<00:03:26.660> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
and then with whoops I gotta go the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.390 
and then with whoops I gotta go the
other<00:03:26.810> way<00:03:26.930> son<00:03:28.780> where's<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.959> return<00:03:30.769> balance

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
other way son where's the return balance

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:39.000 
other way son where's the return balance
point<00:03:31.640> here<00:03:31.880> let<00:03:32.030> me<00:03:32.120> try<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:32.540> now

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.650 

the<00:03:40.010> balance<00:03:40.340> points<00:03:40.700> not<00:03:40.880> an<00:03:41.090> too<00:03:41.330> terrible

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
the balance points not an too terrible

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.150 
the balance points not an too terrible
spot<00:03:41.930> right<00:03:42.350> now<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:44.060> there<00:03:44.570> are<00:03:44.980> I've<00:03:45.980> only

withers and yesterday when I road here's

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.960 
withers and yesterday when I road here's
what<00:03:51.470> the<00:03:51.560> front<00:03:51.860> end<00:03:52.010> looks<00:03:52.190> like<00:03:52.460> I<00:03:52.490> miss<00:03:52.790> or

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
what the front end looks like I miss or

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.520 
what the front end looks like I miss or
take<00:03:53.150> this<00:03:53.330> shot<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:53.930> can<00:03:54.080> see<00:03:54.230> care<00:03:54.380> and

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
take this shot so you can see care and

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:55.630 
take this shot so you can see care and
then<00:03:54.650> we're<00:03:54.830> gonna<00:03:54.950> interest<00:03:55.160> position

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
then we're gonna interest position

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.970 
then we're gonna interest position
dinner<00:03:55.910> regarder<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> shoulder<00:03:56.980> saddle

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
dinner regarder the shoulder saddle

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.650 
dinner regarder the shoulder saddle
position<00:03:58.100> on<00:03:58.460> them<00:03:58.580> and<00:03:58.790> the<00:03:58.910> position<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.570> the

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
position on them and the position of the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.780 
position on them and the position of the
horse<00:04:00.080> saddle<00:04:00.890> on<00:04:00.950> the<00:04:01.040> horse's<00:04:01.340> body<00:04:01.460> and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
horse saddle on the horse's body and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.970 
horse saddle on the horse's body and
then<00:04:01.910> hold<00:04:02.060> on<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:03.230> now<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.500> can<00:04:03.710> see<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
then hold on and now you can see the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.500 
then hold on and now you can see the
distance<00:04:04.340> now<00:04:04.400> you<00:04:04.520> can<00:04:04.700> see<00:04:04.850> they<00:04:04.970> decide<00:04:05.300> to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
distance now you can see they decide to

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.940 
distance now you can see they decide to
this<00:04:05.750> sin<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.200> it's<00:04:06.350> pretty<00:04:06.470> far<00:04:06.680> back<00:04:06.890> right

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
this sin so it's pretty far back right

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:15.000 
this sin so it's pretty far back right
now<00:04:07.180> okay<00:04:08.180> we're<00:04:08.510> going<00:04:08.600> to<00:04:08.720> move<00:04:08.840> her<00:04:08.960> out

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.259 

okay<00:04:16.010> so<00:04:16.070> when<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.580> thinks<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.090> one

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
okay so when it thinks that this one

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.020 
okay so when it thinks that this one
fits<00:04:17.480> the<00:04:17.660> her<00:04:17.959> better<00:04:18.170> than<00:04:18.260> Maddie<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:19.130> she

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
fits the her better than Maddie but she

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.910 
fits the her better than Maddie but she
still<00:04:20.239> thinks<00:04:20.450> it's<00:04:20.720> too<00:04:20.959> big<00:04:21.170> and<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:24.560> need<00:04:24.740> to

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
still thinks it's too big and we need to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.480 
still thinks it's too big and we need to
compare<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.520> next<00:04:25.790> size<00:04:25.940> down<00:04:25.970> really

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
compare the next size down really

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.650 
compare the next size down really
they're<00:04:28.490> just<00:04:28.700> not<00:04:28.940> that<00:04:28.970> big<00:04:29.240> of<00:04:29.270> horses<00:04:29.600> I

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
they're just not that big of horses I

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.750 
they're just not that big of horses I
mean<00:04:29.780> they<00:04:29.870> don't<00:04:29.930> weigh<00:04:30.200> but<00:04:30.560> maybe<00:04:31.190> nine

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
mean they don't weigh but maybe nine

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.840 
mean they don't weigh but maybe nine
hundred<00:04:32.090> maybe<00:04:32.300> a<00:04:32.420> thousand<00:04:32.900> pounds<00:04:33.850> they're

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
hundred maybe a thousand pounds they're

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:45.040 
hundred maybe a thousand pounds they're
just<00:04:34.880> ribs<00:04:35.300> are<00:04:35.480> really<00:04:35.720> sprung

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.260 

okay<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.260> has<00:04:46.470> moved<00:04:46.710> forward<00:04:46.950> some<00:04:47.460> that

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
okay this has moved forward some that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.810 
okay this has moved forward some that
perf<00:04:48.570> its<00:04:48.810> forward<00:04:49.200> or<00:04:49.380> a<00:04:49.620> little<00:04:50.520> bit<00:04:50.640> let<00:04:50.790> me

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
perf its forward or a little bit let me

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.140 
perf its forward or a little bit let me
change<00:04:51.060> that<00:04:51.180> ship<00:04:52.050> too<00:04:52.230> badly<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:53.160> her<00:04:53.310> we'll

we<00:04:58.170> put<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.590> saddle<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:59.040> with<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.370> small

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
we put the saddle on with the small
