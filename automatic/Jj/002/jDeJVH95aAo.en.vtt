then<00:00:51.460> many<00:00:51.760> generations<00:00:52.239> beyond<00:00:52.780> mine<00:00:53.199> and<00:00:53.559> I

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
then many generations beyond mine and I

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.410 
then many generations beyond mine and I
think<00:00:54.309> that's<00:00:54.460> where<00:00:54.670> Wells<00:00:54.850> has<00:00:55.059> helped<00:00:55.300> us

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
think that's where Wells has helped us

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.420 
think that's where Wells has helped us
because<00:00:55.750> they<00:00:55.930> put<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.350> in<00:00:56.559> mind<00:00:56.920> with<00:00:57.250> us

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
because they put that in mind with us

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.099 
because they put that in mind with us
and<00:00:57.670> they<00:00:57.760> treat<00:00:58.000> us<00:00:58.120> like<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.390> family<00:00:58.750> versus

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
and they treat us like the family versus

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.020 
and they treat us like the family versus
the<00:00:59.230> big<00:00:59.410> conglomerate<00:01:00.010> it's<00:01:00.730> a<00:01:00.820> very

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
so the asset based lending facility was

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.550 
so the asset based lending facility was
the<00:01:36.310> right<00:01:36.610> answer<00:01:36.970> for<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.210> company<00:01:37.630> growing

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
the right answer for the company growing

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.710 
the right answer for the company growing
is<00:01:38.829> very<00:01:39.250> expensive<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:39.970> very<00:01:40.030> hard<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> do

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
is very expensive and very hard to do

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.740 
is very expensive and very hard to do
but<00:01:41.470> they<00:01:41.740> stood<00:01:42.040> by<00:01:42.280> us<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:43.000> took<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.360> risk<00:01:43.540> on

but they stood by us they took a risk on
us<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.229> we<00:01:44.619> have<00:01:45.040> not<00:01:45.159> ever<00:01:45.399> forgotten<00:01:45.939> that

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
us and we have not ever forgotten that

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.490 
us and we have not ever forgotten that
the<00:01:46.420> company<00:01:46.810> had<00:01:46.930> been<00:01:46.960> thinking<00:01:47.229> about

the company had been thinking about
