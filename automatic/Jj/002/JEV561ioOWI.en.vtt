down to what screws to use all these
screws<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:30.119> commonly<00:00:30.599> used<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:31.170> your

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
screws are very commonly used in your

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.630 
screws are very commonly used in your
treated<00:00:31.679> wood<00:00:31.910> you<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.950> screw<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
treated wood you have a screw that is

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.020 
treated wood you have a screw that is
treated<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.719> go<00:00:36.870> inside<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.800> wood<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:39.000> that

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
treated to go inside the wood so that

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.229 
treated to go inside the wood so that
way<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.629> doesn't<00:00:39.899> rot<00:00:40.379> out<00:00:40.620> or<00:00:41.340> rust<00:00:41.670> out<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
way it doesn't rot out or rust out and

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.400 
way it doesn't rot out or rust out and
break<00:00:42.840> off<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.890> treated<00:00:44.280> screw<00:00:45.410> then

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
break off so it's a treated screw then

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
break off so it's a treated screw then
you<00:00:46.530> have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> zinc<00:00:47.100> coated<00:00:47.640> screw<00:00:48.030> they<00:00:48.780> do

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you have a zinc coated screw they do

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.900 
you have a zinc coated screw they do
this<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.620> prolong<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.160> life<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.579> screw

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
this to prolong the life of the screw

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.189 
this to prolong the life of the screw
although<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.870> will<00:00:52.079> eventually<00:00:52.410> wear<00:00:52.890> out

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
although it will eventually wear out

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
although it will eventually wear out
then<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.320> have<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> painted<00:00:55.980> screw<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
then you have a painted screw the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.939 
then you have a painted screw the
painted<00:00:57.180> screws<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.899> just<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.260> common<00:00:58.649> steel

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
painted screws are just a common steel

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.639 
painted screws are just a common steel
but<00:00:59.550> they<00:00:59.670> put<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> paint<00:01:00.359> baked<00:01:00.780> onto<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> top

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
