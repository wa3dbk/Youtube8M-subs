00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 until very little time ago we had 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.019
 certain rules to combine 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.330
 the socks 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.670
 and they are also standards that many of 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.650
 you have already given me details 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:18.890
 about them well then 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.390

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.330

 runner from Colombia and Caesar 87 01 10 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.690
 s your nick they sent us or they asked us to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.760
 let's talk about the socks and before 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.129
 nothing, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.650
 catch our boring socks 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.670
 blacks 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:58.230
 let's keep them forever 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.210
 because we are going to reveal how to combine 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.210
 socks of very elegant colors 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.850
 I'm wearing 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.010
 from Granada this corner of south of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.820
 Spain I send you a very sincere greeting 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 I am green boxes and as I said 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.580
 we had some specific rules before 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.830
 maybe too strict patterns 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.680
 in the way of combining socks 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.080
 and fortunately the sock and the 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.270
 Sock or stocking has become 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.790
 one more complement for man and 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.140
 obviously the color and strength 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.480
 designs have started to start from a 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.520
 tremendous way let's go over those 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.980
 old rules that we had for 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.160
 combine socks we said that the 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:53.680
 socks should prolong the 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.090
 color of the trouser fabric or what 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.190
 what we did was if we had pants 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.920
 gray we put a gray sock for 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.100
 continue and prolong that form others 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.170
 they said that the socks we had to 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.030
 put them in the tone of the shoes to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.540
 that aesthetics is not broken or is 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.650
 when when the sock looked 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.020
 we tried to make them a color 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.580
 similar to shoes to break the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:21.160
 aesthetic and especially the sap the sock 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.740
 black the black executive sock was 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.990
 as a religion for many people 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.290
 be put on suit was automatically 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.870
 use black sock has arrived the 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.459
 moment to start breaking 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.470
 some rules if the sock has been 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:36.430
 become a complement with which 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 we can play 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.620
 more about our masculine styling what 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.799
 such if we take some reference for 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.060
 that you can learn to combine it in each 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.159
 one of these elements I'll go 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.010
 leaving an image for them to see 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:53.349
 the examples that I want that I want 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.239
 transmit well, let's assume that 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.569
 we are dressed in suits and we want to make 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:02.590
 a combination we can use the tie 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.379
 to combine the sock here I leave you 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.909
 this image so you can see another of the 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:08.799
 elements that we can do to 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.569
 coordinate our sock with our 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.239
 half is to use the handkerchief 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.460
 pocket this image so you can see the 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.250
 example that I want to put you 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.890
 another one of the details could be the color 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.040
 of our shirt we could look for the same 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:28.390
 to the color of the shirt some socks 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:32.829
 and finally we could use as 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:35.859
 before I searched for the color of 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.780
 our costume with our eternal or 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.819
 a reference about the pattern for 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.500
 combine the socks look at this 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.780
 example so you can see how we have 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.540
 combined the pattern detail of the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.040
 weave with the sock when we get to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.049
 a casual style you can not 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:53.200
 imagine how soar in 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:56.379
 possibilities we can search coordinated 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.659
 of sock comedy with the scarf with the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.280
 vest with the color of the American that 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.650
 have some detail some 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.419
 belt some element that is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.560
 striking I'll leave you a series of 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.870
 images so they can see 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 proposals of these combinations that 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.220
 I want to share with you 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.950
 pavano 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.570
 ah 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.000
 the important key of everything I deal with 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.540
 to convey that with all the examples 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.090
 previous is 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.430
 do not try that the sock goes 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.520
 isolated from the set but it is a 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.230
 part of the set analyzes the detail 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.320
 that draws the attention of the styling that 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.540
 you take and there he goes to do the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 combination with the sock that's why you 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.110
 put all the previous examples 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.680
 so you can see the combinations 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.830
 both cloth shirt tie cravat 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.180
 pocket the belt any item 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.250
 I insist do not try to find that the 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.110
 sock go isolated but shape 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.870
 part of the combination of others 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.990
 elements of your style but attention 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.270
 let's do a good dry braking 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:20.310
 we are commenting that try to look 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.070
 color coordinated to make your 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.840
 combinations but when we enter the 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.030
 world of the gala as the ceremony 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.770
 a night event a dinner in which 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:32.500
 you go in tuxedo or that now of touch 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.770
 a very special event you are the groom 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.550
 of that wedding you must wear a sock 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:42.280
 black braking in the dry whenever we 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.379
 let's find a very formal event 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.449
 we always have to resort to the sock 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:50.080
 black because it will always be much more 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:53.139
 smart to go very formally dressed 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.210
 with a yellow red or green sock the 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.550
 true that is out of context the 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.470
 content of this video the contributions 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.060
 what have I done to you so you can combine 

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.610

 please give a like to give a like 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:10.930
 because it's the line that that information 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.729
 that we are adding up to know if 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.800
 the content that we are developing 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:18.479
 so you like it's worth it for 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.919
 you and really brings something of value to 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.590
 something of value why we always ask you 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.139
 that you give a like to like it when 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.419
 that content that really has 

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:31.120
 contributed something and good and already to conclude 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:32.949
 what if we go straight to the council 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.849
 with which we always close our 

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:38.159
 videos the socks to dress 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:42.700
 they can not be short they have to be 

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:44.980
 socks always long well 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.410
 along for many, many 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.220
 years and have the opportunity to see a 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:53.140
 lots of gadgets for a lot of 

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.820
 gadgets to fasten the socks to 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.670
 me personally those gadgets do not 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.230
 fortunately, nothing like the day of 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.800
 today it is easy to find socks from 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.720
 colors stripe motif rhombus 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.700
 we can make nice combinations and 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.950
 elegant but always long socks 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:11.890
 aesthetically you can not imagine what 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.710
 ugly that is a wrinkled sock down or 

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:16.100
 how ugly it is 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.930
 these images that I'm going to show you 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:21.210
 undress you take off your pants and that a 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:23.340
 man left with these gadgets so 

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:25.110
 strangers that you are seeing the truth is 

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:26.400
 that I think I 've never put on those 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.320
 I think gadgets not me 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.360
 and I would tell investigates looking 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:34.710
 Long sock possibilities always 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.350
 they will benefit you much more than a 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:39.570
 sock short and wrinkled down because 

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.860
 think that all these details do not 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:42.860
 nothing more than add more
