00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.280
 the big sale of caillou 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.660
 sorry 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.760
 if only I have dropped the box of 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.910
 things for the market this year 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.279
 we have a lot of things to sell and 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.440
 if the whole neighborhood participates in it 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.660
 so I'm putting all the things together 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.460
 we no longer use to overcome them I 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.710
 I can also sell things in the 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.020
 flea market dad that seems like a 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.790
 great idea that there's a why you're not going 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.870
 to see if you come out there some toys 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.870
 with which you no longer play 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.469
 so I was costing a lot 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.350
 decide what toys I was going to sell in the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.600
 flea market everyone liked 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.229
 toys that no longer played like 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229
 it's going to fall 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.630
 well I do not think anyone is willing to 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.910
 buy something that is broken but is that 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.700
 If I sell my toys I will not be left 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.980
 none to play you do not have to 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.920
 sell them all only those with the 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.330
 no longer play 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 I am also sure that there will be 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.920
 some other child selling toys with 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 those who no longer play and you will want 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.880
 buy him some 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.810
 that I thought that was a 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 great idea I was going to sell the toys 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.119
 that I did not want anymore and I was going to change them 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.100
 others much prettier than I was 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.320
 Looking forward to the day of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.470
 jumble sale 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.960
 the dad list 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.910
 you have done a great job we are going to 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.910
 take them out and set the table 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.990
 and my fight 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.610
 I think it's a good idea so you can 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.770
 save the money you earn by selling 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.620
 your toys when I can buy 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.270
 new objects nobody good first 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.580
 you should get rid of any of the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.890
 old cielito and so you'll have money to 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 buy new let's go for a walk to 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.420
 see what other children sell 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:24.280
 yes 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:26.710
 and surprise I bought it, mom is a 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.610
 really nice toy or if you want it 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.610
 sell to jeffrey 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.040
 not the truth is that I do not want 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.349
 sell it to anyone 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.819
 you are sure that I long ago 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.790
 that you do not play with him and before he was 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:48.189
 decided to sell it I understand you kaiju 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.189
 If you change your mind, less is worth it 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.630
 there's a why you're saving again 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.720
 the toys because I do not want to sell anymore 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.220
 my toys I have an idea because I do not 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.000
 we take a walk to see what it is that 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.000
 they sell others 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.439
 or the street that happens to you, it seems to me that 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.720
 here is one you like too much the 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:16.540
 flea market because it is selling 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.280
 hot dogs in the jingle you'll see in 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.140
 a flea market can be found all 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.879
 until hot dogs for 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.790
 little eaters who have to 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:29.500
 cheering up here you have only it will cost you a 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:31.450
 smile thank you 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.780
 you see the markets can be something 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.780
 very funny 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.359
 look mom has in the house outside 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.549
 here 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:46.590
 he's right it seems he's out hey 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.200
 I thought it would be fun to sleep at 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.340
 outdoors imagined what it would be like to sleep 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.340
 under the stars 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.820
 funny mom 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.510
 look at this fell 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.360
 Wow 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.360
 and I'll take it 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.139
 here and I really liked walking through the 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.540
 neighbors' houses and see what 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.100
 they sold the people they had put up for sale 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:28.520
 a lot of interesting things this 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.460
 for me it's an electric can opener 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.790
 you squeeze here and open the can 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.120
 automatically 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.710
 You can sing it to me, we already have a can opener that 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.240
 works like a charm 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.240
 let's find something that we need 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.490
 you get a little big 3 leaves 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 let me prove it 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:56.840
 if it looks good on you, what do you think about this 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.840
 another no 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.420
 it's a very nice toy that I bought 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.150
 because we are not going to see if dad has been able 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.250
 sell something before buying anything that I 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.120
 he was sad because he could not buy 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.120
 the construction game 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.560
 but kaiju if it does not even fit in your 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.540
 toy box fell he thought that for that 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.460
 the construction game wants in its 

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:23.440
 box was going to have to get rid of 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.870
 some of his old toys with the 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.000
 that he no longer played and thought that although he 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.580
 no longer he played with them maybe had 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.830
 someone who did love them and over 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.430
 if he sold them he would have room for 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.430
 new toy 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:44.069
 and so yes I'm selling it seriously 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.860
 thank you fell to jeff and you will love it 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:49.259
 playing with your toy is that I never 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.910
 game with him in return the best you 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:53.440
 you find some new toy out there 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.440
 here you have 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.440
 Thank you 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.780
 Look, I'm glad I thought that 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:08.160
 at the end I wanted to keep your toys 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.690
 I do not all have an idea because they do not 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.180
 put on the table so that all the 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:14.720
 world can see them 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.720
 do not 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.090
 mom looks by the lookout 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.680
 that's fantastic that you've done very 

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:33.410
 well we can organize another flea market 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:37.000
 soon it will be necessary to look 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:39.640
 of things your mom has bought 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.340
 this deserves a celebration because it does not 

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.340
 let's have an ice cream 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:48.100
 What's wrong with you here? I do not want an ice cream 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.169
 I'm afraid he fell before he wants another 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.169
 little thing but no sky 

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.640
 they were very happy to have 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.620
 sold all his toys because well 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.980
 he had room for his new game of 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.980
 building
