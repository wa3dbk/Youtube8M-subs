together<00:00:19.050> i<00:00:19.320> think<00:00:19.380> everyone<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:20.400> kind<00:00:20.520> of

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
together i think everyone was kind of

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.800 
together i think everyone was kind of
pulled<00:00:20.820> together<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.300> claw<00:00:21.449> i<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.720> that

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
pulled together as a claw i think that

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.620 
pulled together as a claw i think that
that's<00:00:21.930> been<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> common<00:00:22.680> theme<00:00:23.039> recently

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
that's been the common theme recently

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.019 
that's been the common theme recently
and<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.810> yeah<00:00:24.990> it's<00:00:25.140> very<00:00:25.350> Philly<00:00:25.560> him<00:00:25.769> to

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
and so yeah it's very Philly him to

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.310 
and so yeah it's very Philly him to
decide<00:00:27.029> ultimate<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.539> he<00:00:27.630> wants<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.869> move<00:00:28.109> on

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320

that's<00:00:43.320> been<00:00:43.590> on<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> cards<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.250> while

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that's been on the cards for a while

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.549 
that's been on the cards for a while
something<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.969> you've<00:00:45.059> known<00:00:45.239> about<00:00:45.559> its

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
something that you've known about its

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.600 
something that you've known about its
not<00:00:46.680> only<00:00:46.800> we've<00:00:47.039> known<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.550> obviously

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
not only we've known about it obviously

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.840

when<00:00:47.969> Paul<00:00:48.390> Cook<00:00:48.629> left<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.370> think<00:00:50.370> there<00:00:50.760> was

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
when Paul Cook left I think there was

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.369 
when Paul Cook left I think there was
certainly<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.210> conversations<00:00:52.170> regarding

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
certainly some conversations regarding

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.229 
certainly some conversations regarding
him<00:00:52.739> wanting<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> take<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.730> Leah<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:54.090> him

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
him wanting to take take Leah with him

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.750 
him wanting to take take Leah with him
but<00:00:54.390> we'd<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.770> made<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> really

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but we'd like to think we made a really

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.520 
but we'd like to think we made a really
good<00:00:56.910> offer<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.300> Liam<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> stay<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.170> take

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
good offer to Liam to stay and take

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
good offer to Liam to stay and take
charge<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.340> would<00:00:59.489> proven<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.510> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
charge and that would proven to be the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.459 
charge and that would proven to be the
right<00:01:00.750> thing<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.260> obviously

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
right thing to do because obviously

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.219 
right thing to do because obviously
ultimately<00:01:02.070> he<00:01:02.460> kept<00:01:02.730> his<00:01:02.879> up<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.019> think

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
ultimately he kept his up and I think

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.870 
ultimately he kept his up and I think
that<00:01:04.769> you've<00:01:05.159> got<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> give<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> lot<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.790> the

very<00:02:13.830> quickly<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.510> but<00:02:15.510> it's<00:02:15.959> just<00:02:16.170> one<00:02:16.260> of

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
very quickly and but it's just one of

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.360 
very quickly and but it's just one of
those<00:02:16.410> things<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:16.739> happens<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.220> football

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
that does not an awful lot we can do

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.540 
that does not an awful lot we can do
about<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.290> apart<00:02:19.709> from<00:02:19.800> choosing<00:02:20.340> where<00:02:20.430> we

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
about it apart from choosing where we

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.750 
about it apart from choosing where we
react<00:02:20.790> react<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.500> it's<00:02:22.500> almost<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:23.400> kind<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
react react to it it's almost it kind of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.309 
react react to it it's almost it kind of
helps<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.120> little<00:02:24.270> bit<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.750> we're<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:24.989> the

helps a little bit that we're in the
close<00:02:25.560> season<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> means<00:02:26.670> rather

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970

follow a proper procedure with
interviews<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.849> ultimately<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:43.019> between<00:02:43.560> us

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
interviews and ultimately it between us

a<00:02:44.130> point<00:02:44.519> we<00:02:45.030> believe<00:02:45.300> will<00:02:45.330> be<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:45.780> on

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
a point we believe will be the right on

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.800 
a point we believe will be the right on
practice<00:02:46.470> dully<00:02:46.709> in<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.430> short<00:02:47.730> term<00:02:47.940> what<00:02:48.690> is

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
practice dully in the short term what is

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.910 
practice dully in the short term what is
the<00:02:48.930> plan<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.350> of<00:02:49.440> course<00:02:49.590> you've<00:02:49.709> got<00:02:49.830> an

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
the plan because of course you've got an

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620 
the plan because of course you've got an
awful<00:02:50.190> lot<00:02:50.220> of<00:02:50.400> players<00:02:50.580> out<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.850> contract<00:02:51.269> you

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
awful lot of players out of contract you

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.390 
awful lot of players out of contract you
need<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.870> futures<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.290> be<00:02:52.380> decided<00:02:52.590> that's

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
need the futures to be decided that's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920 
need the futures to be decided that's
that's<00:02:53.730> probably<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.120> only<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.720> only

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
that's probably the only the only

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.809 
that's probably the only the only
downside<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.950> timing<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.400> this<00:02:56.519> is<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
downside to the timing of this is the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.770 
downside to the timing of this is the
fact<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.090> we've<00:02:57.239> got<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.390> lot<00:02:57.540> of<00:02:57.569> players

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
fact that we've got a lot of players

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.470 
fact that we've got a lot of players
over<00:02:58.019> to<00:02:58.140> contract<00:02:58.880> some<00:02:59.880> of<00:02:59.970> those<00:03:00.060> players

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
over to contract some of those players

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.960 
over to contract some of those players
