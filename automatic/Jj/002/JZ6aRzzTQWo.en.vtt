00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 What characteristics does sulfur have? 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:10.920
 it's not soluble in water I do not know what it does 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.929
 soluble makes the temperature soluble and 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.599
 the alkalinity that has the decal 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.310
 then this mix we are going to make 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.109
 we have it available from 1 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.970
 then up to here it's okay if the 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.970
 formula 20 kilograms of sulfur 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:57.680
 the calcium sulfur with lime formula 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.210
 they know their trunk 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.210
 how are farmers 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.540
 it's not a mixture of the amounts are 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:11.590
 20 kilograms of sulfur 7 out of 100 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:15.500
 liters of water one question each pound 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.899
 the origin is in the rock for example 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.840
 we have oyster shells in this is 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.950
 calcium carbonate we have names and 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.950
 we have quick lime 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.430
 we throw water is easy 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.090
 but we are there 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.090
 in these relationships 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:40.160
 the calcium oxide is numerators 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.380
 quality to elaborate this case because 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.170
 I'm like that, it has more than 5% of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.090
 magnesium precipitates are formed and that 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.940
 they do in soluble then it's from 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.979
 lime oxide preference 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.950
 the process is to heat the water 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.479
 in the water cylinders make the mixture 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.790
 to make it faster 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.760
 the lime mixture 220 kilograms 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.140
 sulfur 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.140
 and of being when 20 also 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.110
 but we see that it is not soluble 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:27.610
 the effect of alkalinity on the head 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.890
 is what makes solubility possible 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.569
 those are tricks of the chemical industry 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.850
 they do not tell you 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.960
 but here we learn towards the sun 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.600
 in the envelope with calm is the main 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.980
 mechanism of action that will have going to 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.060
 be acaricides 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.650
 now 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.650
 against what will work 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.629
 they are color mites like spiders 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.629
 battles those who have won 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:07.110
 efe 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.630
 those who have cattle and also 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.810
 can work remember that the cycle 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.430
 biological of the ticks the xerecismo 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.900
 in larva 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.900
 nymphs and adults 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.870
 at what stage we will find it more 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.840
 possible the carapace of the claw is missing or 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.819
 the keratin he has 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.819
 The purpose of image protection 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.020
 usually the biological cycle takes 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.210
 twenty one days 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.720
 once the tick swelled and 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:46.330
 It measures around 5 millimeters 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:50.440
 then it is when it will fall to the three 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.720
 days deposit five thousand nine sites 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.090
 depending on the species in question 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.130
 there are about five thousand but not all have 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.860
 survival then 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.650
 let's put it 2500 and find how many 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.560
 carafes to be together 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.920
 then that is the potential that has 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.799
 if we apply sulfur to livestock 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.650
 in a concentration one of them has 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.829
 elaborated the broth in a concentration 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.190
 of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:25.530
 5 to one liter of water 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.530
 no dowry engineer 5 large with liters 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:33.870
 for one of forgiveness is a vowel quoted a 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:40.920
 five for five of water then more 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:45.529
 focused on better animals is a 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:47.959
 little bordering but they are tolerable 

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:50.820
 there is no greater happiness if there is a 

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:52.569
 chosen to end here 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.139
 not be military 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.139
 pieces 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.400
 they are not such in the cellar 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.789
 sometimes 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.789
 to the press 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:34.520
 in the extremes 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:37.990
 there is a water question 1 - 5 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.990
 for a cattle head 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:49.150
 it may be the investment that they will reach 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:52.570
 like between one and a half to two liters 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:54.810
 the prepared broth and a question and this 

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.810
 product 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:20.770
 zelaya is not only loaded with 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.750
 big but I did not follow him 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.740
 about two months so you can bring me 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.360
 the Argentines 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.540
 if you want permission to transport 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.960
 because it's that front 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:37.430
 removing the ones they do not leave the lists 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.430
 for power games 

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:47.519
 once the process 40 to 45 hot 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:48.960
 minutes depending on the intensity of the 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:50.639
 stove 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.490
 the aspect that it will take is a 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:57.990
 Aragon coloration and do not scream this without 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.110
 have been applied 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.740
 and good 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.190
 the berries why 

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:09.600
 for something like the red horse spider 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:11.449
 for the little ones 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.309
 our 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.309
 tell the squirrels 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.639
 but in truth it is not knowing with 

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.919
 Specification of the huge 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.070
 and here is more the effect here I decide not 

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:25.620
 you are stuffed 

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:28.350
 indeed also with that they continue like this 

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.330
 when a virus attacks any of 

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:32.009
 those plants to the tomato to the chili 

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:35.520
 papaya 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:38.629
 and everything else went after me out 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.629
 lie to sell the products 

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:43.819
 because what I have learned from the 

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:43.819
 country
