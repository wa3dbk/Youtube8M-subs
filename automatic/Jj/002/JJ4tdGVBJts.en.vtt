00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
to coming some high-octane fun let's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:47.740 
to coming some high-octane fun let's
find<00:02:24.690> out

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:03:22.589 

Oh

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.729 

obviously<00:03:23.599> both<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.110> these<00:03:24.230> machines<00:03:24.620> are

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
obviously both of these machines are

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.949 
obviously both of these machines are
massive<00:03:25.430> fun<00:03:25.790> but<00:03:26.269> while<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.510> Superleggera

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
massive fun but while the Superleggera

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.809 
massive fun but while the Superleggera
may<00:03:27.410> not<00:03:27.590> be<00:03:27.709> able<00:03:27.860> to<00:03:27.980> do<00:03:28.160> stoppies<00:03:28.489> and

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
may not be able to do stoppies and

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.850 
may not be able to do stoppies and
admittedly<00:03:29.540> costs<00:03:29.959> 10<00:03:30.170> times<00:03:30.440> as<00:03:30.620> much

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
admittedly costs 10 times as much

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.729 
admittedly costs 10 times as much
ultimately<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:32.180> has<00:03:32.330> a<00:03:32.390> WOW<00:03:32.660> factor<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:33.500> bike

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
ultimately it has a WOW factor the bike

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.100 
ultimately it has a WOW factor the bike
can't<00:03:34.099> ever<00:03:34.340> hope<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.819> match<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.840> course

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
can't ever hope to match and of course

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.320 
can't ever hope to match and of course
you<00:03:36.709> don't<00:03:36.950> have<00:03:37.099> to<00:03:37.220> wear<00:03:37.340> leather<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:38.030> drive

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
you don't have to wear leather to drive

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.569 
you don't have to wear leather to drive
