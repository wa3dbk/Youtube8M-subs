to be grass here but it wasn't it was
not<00:02:26.420> grass<00:02:26.720> was<00:02:27.349> probably<00:02:27.590> like<00:02:27.770> dark<00:02:28.069> because

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
not grass was probably like dark because

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.340 
not grass was probably like dark because
usually<00:02:29.180> people<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.720> forget<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:30.020> change<00:02:30.140> to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350
