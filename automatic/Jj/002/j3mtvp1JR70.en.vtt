00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.680
 hello welcome to another new video 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.290
 fermat dotcom tutorial on this 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.170
 occasion we are going to focus 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:16.160
 specifically on how to find out the 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.650
 name bonjour of an ipad or another 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.069
 apple mobile device to be able 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.960
 deliver documents directly to that 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:27.439
 ipad in this case is going to be an ipad 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.140
 iphone or ipod touch for applications 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.899
 that offer the possibility of converting 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.390
 our device on a hard drive 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.190
 wifi there are certain applications in this 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.830
 If we are going to focus with 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.180
 documents by riddle but there are other 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.690
 many applications that offer that 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:48.010
 possibility and what we are going to try is 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:50.840
 first find out what that name is 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.520
 bonjour using the tools of 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.440
 system that is what we are going to do 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.300
 put the first one let's activate 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.380
 our wifi network because our 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.220
 computer is connected 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:04.739
 via ethernet and what we will 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.410
 do is pressing the option key to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.320
 open wifi diagnosis and using the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.350
 keyboard shortcut command 7 we will open the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.390
 bonjour services browser what 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 we have here we see that we do not have 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.430
 no ipad in our services 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.650
 bonjour so that what we do will 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.410
 To be 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.410
 connect directly with our ipad 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.009
 we are already connecting with our ipad 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.009
 is here 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.920
 and what we are going to do is to open the 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.920
 application 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.920
 what is documents by riddle 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.750
 and we automatically see that in the 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.500
 browser has appeared a new 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.440
 ipad device 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.460
 with 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.250
 a new name that by clicking on that 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.290
 bottom we have seen here this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.250
 explains clickable area 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.470
 explainable we will see the name bonjour of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.350
 our ipad then in this case is 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.370
 ipad de carlos burguÃ©s ruiz local point 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.440
 we already know what the name bonjour is 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.540
 For our ipad or for our iphone 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.710
 and this is extremely useful especially 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.120
 at the time of script ar 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.060
 using automaton or using 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.330
 applescript create scripts that we 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.110
 allow then to perform tasks 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.810
 regardless of the ip that is 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.489
 assign through our hcp network 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.620
 are assigned to our device 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.660
 directly we will already know what is the 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.819
 name bonjour and with which we can 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.140
 automatically perform a script that 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.319
 work independently of the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.770
 possible changes that the hcp network can 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.200
 do assigning to each device in 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.220
 this case we have a username and 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.850
 password 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.020
 why 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.020
 the options 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.200
 wifi drive we have activated what we can 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.330
 see here we have activated the hard drive 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.569
 wifi and also asks for the name and 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.500
 password so we can 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.200
 Add 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.230
 that name and password and in addition to 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.100
 be able to connect directly because it is 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.100
 feasible to do it 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.090
 through 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.090
 d 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.560
 we'll see 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.060
 let's copy it directly from here 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 we can load it or connect it 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:56.880
 as a local unit we can also 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:01.050
 use your browser to access in 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.420
 concrete to the options of the 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.740
 device using this program 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.330
 way that at a certain time if 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.640
 we do not have mac we can always use 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.140
 the browser for on any computer 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.660
 upload a file or download a file 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.850
 directly 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.820
 because the computer may be that we are 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.070
 working with a pc and we want in a 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.530
 determined moment connect with our 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.140
 ipad because we have files uploaded to 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.210
 in the ites we want to download them or 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.420
 upload some file and we are not going to 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.520
 need no special configuration 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.860
 or no special situation simply 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.580
 open in this case is document my 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.100
 reader because it leads to support web 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.210
 and upload files or download files and 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.310
 in the mch we have seen that in addition to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.650
 be able to do it through the browser 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.510
 we can do it using the shortcut 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.970
 of conventional keyboard command k from 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.570
 the finder to connect to a server and 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.940
 adding then in the bonjour direction 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.940
 from our ipad or our iphone
