00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.010
 hello youtube people here from the r axis 95 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.260
 in a tutorial and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.780
 how to play multiplayer in pokemon 3b 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.789
 first of all the links I'll leave 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.160
 in the description so check the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.289
 to make the first one easier 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.779
 step is to download the program called 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.670
 never and make sure that the others 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.339
 people with whom you are going to play 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.010
 also download it and repeat the link 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:35.200
 will be in the description I do not download it 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.210
 me because I already have it xd but you 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.520
 click where it says download and a 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.680
 once downloaded install once 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.050
 installed open it and you will see something like 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.080
 this we click on the button 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.330
 so that it works now, they will appear 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.370
 the networks that we have and ours if 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.440
 we are going to be the host or the 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.150
 creator of the game we give in creating 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.250
 network if it is that we do not have and we will 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.980
 ask for some data as we see it here that 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.890
 they ask us and from the network here we put the 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.780
 name we want for our network 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.060
 password a password that we give to 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.490
 those who are going to join later now 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.350
 we go to the game only that before I will tell you 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.390
 I think this works after 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.280
 that you have obtained your first pokemon 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.200
 and I say I think because the times that 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.229
 try from the beginning you could not 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.270
 I'm not sure if it's a book since it's 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.070
 a game in full development so if 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.040
 it does not work from the beginning and 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.920
 they will know why they can create or join 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.140
 departures from these two places 1 where 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.110
 I am right now that would be the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.430
 fourth of start 2 in this part of the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.830
 pokemon centers 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.560
 if you are the one who creates the game or host 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.020
 then you give the host so that the others 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.600
 join your departure you should go to hamas and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.640
 join your network after that click 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.979
 right and give where it says copy 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.920
 ipv6 address and that stick it 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.869
 pressing the keys at the same time 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.780
 control and uve in this part where it says 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.700
 jon attention the fallero to the antivirus 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.500
 can cause problems so 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.080
 deactivate oppose the game and the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.300
 hamas and as allowed programs if they see 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.880
 that when they join the game they take the host 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.040
 this may be the problem if you 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.080
 they are going to join a game then they go to 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.500
 where he says and oib and then they go to hamas 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.110
 and copy ipv4 ipv6 address as 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.990
 them work I know that before I said that ip 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.080
 but if it does not work for them use the 4 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.910
 I recommend more be you the host or not and 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.920
 until here the video arrived I hope you 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.930
 they have understood any questions 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.480
 have me put it in the comments and 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.640
 I'll answer it as soon as I see it 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 I have served them because they already asked me 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.750

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.540

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.520
 promised is debt and here is
