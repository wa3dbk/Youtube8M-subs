00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
can take a look at the boot animation to

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.849 
can take a look at the boot animation to
see<00:01:12.210> how<00:01:12.329> that<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:12.659> look<00:01:12.719> so<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.560> first

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:13.859

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
right next to that camera icon which is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.039 
right next to that camera icon which is
not<00:01:40.560> themed<00:01:40.999> it<00:01:41.999> does<00:01:42.390> kind<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.780> look<00:01:42.929> a<00:01:42.960> little

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
not themed it does kind of look a little

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.020 
not themed it does kind of look a little
weird<00:01:43.469> there<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.219> does<00:01:44.490> look<00:01:44.729> nice

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
weird there but it does look nice

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.260 
weird there but it does look nice
nonetheless<00:01:45.469> so<00:01:46.469> it<00:01:46.859> does<00:01:47.249> apply<00:01:47.670> different

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
nonetheless so it does apply different

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.800 
nonetheless so it does apply different
icons<00:01:48.749> to<00:01:49.079> your<00:01:49.320> launcher<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.810> unfortunately

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
icons to your launcher but unfortunately

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
icons to your launcher but unfortunately
not<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.469> them<00:01:52.619> are<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.039> be<00:01:53.130> themed

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
not all of them are going to be themed

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.520 
not all of them are going to be themed
so<00:01:53.939> they<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.210> look<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.990> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.380> out<00:01:55.409> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
so they do look a little bit out of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.069 
so they do look a little bit out of
place<00:01:55.799> sometimes<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.359> that's<00:01:57.630> something

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
place sometimes and that's something

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.440 
place sometimes and that's something
that<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.710> developer<00:01:59.189> has<00:01:59.399> stopped<00:01:59.729> creating

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that the developer has stopped creating

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
that the developer has stopped creating
is<00:02:00.569> not<00:02:00.749> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> add<00:02:01.170> any<00:02:01.409> more<00:02:01.469> icons<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.219> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
is not going to add any more icons so it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.039 
is not going to add any more icons so it
is<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> bit<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.909> bummer<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.630> if<00:02:03.719> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.929> get

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
is a bit of a bummer but if you can get

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.989 
is a bit of a bummer but if you can get
past<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.619> icons<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.219> are<00:02:05.399> supported

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:05.999 
past it the icons that are supported

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:07.910 
past it the icons that are supported
look<00:02:06.600> really<00:02:06.960> nice<00:02:07.109> and<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.409> really<00:02:07.679> do<00:02:07.799> like

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
look really nice and I really do like

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.040 
look really nice and I really do like
them<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.280> wish<00:02:08.729> that<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.390> developer

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
them I just wish that the developer

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.660 
them I just wish that the developer
continue<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.740> add<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.100> icons<00:02:11.460> but<00:02:11.610> I

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
continue to add more icons but I

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
continue to add more icons but I
understand<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.330> sort<00:02:12.870> of<00:02:12.930> hard<00:02:13.230> to<00:02:13.319> get<00:02:13.530> all

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
understand it's sort of hard to get all

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.530 
understand it's sort of hard to get all
of<00:02:13.920> these<00:02:14.040> different<00:02:14.220> icons<00:02:14.490> into<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.269> theme

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
of these different icons into this theme

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.390 
of these different icons into this theme
but<00:02:16.110> they<00:02:16.200> look<00:02:16.379> nice<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.920> less<00:02:17.129> and

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
but they look nice and then the less and

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.399 
but they look nice and then the less and
the<00:02:17.879> soft<00:02:18.180> keys<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.540> also<00:02:18.690> changed<00:02:19.260> so<00:02:19.319> you

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409 
the soft keys are also changed so you

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:20.670 
the soft keys are also changed so you
have<00:02:19.500> a<00:02:19.560> little<00:02:19.799> bit<00:02:19.950> of<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.099> different

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
have a little bit of a different

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.410 
have a little bit of a different
Eero<00:02:20.980> you've<00:02:21.219> got<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.430> circle<00:02:21.879> for<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.120> home

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
Eero you've got a circle for the home

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.780 
Eero you've got a circle for the home
and<00:02:22.719> then<00:02:23.140> you<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.829> square<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:24.670> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
and then you have a square for the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.899 
and then you have a square for the
recents<00:02:25.420> or<00:02:25.599> multitasking<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.739> they<00:02:27.730> look

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909 
recents or multitasking and they look

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.130 
recents or multitasking and they look
really<00:02:27.939> nice<00:02:28.299> there's<00:02:28.629> not<00:02:28.780> really<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.079> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
really nice there's not really much to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.869 
really nice there's not really much to
say<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.469> these<00:02:29.620> soft<00:02:29.859> keys<00:02:30.129> but<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.579> really

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
say about these soft keys but I really

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.819 
say about these soft keys but I really
enjoy<00:02:31.180> using<00:02:31.450> them<00:02:31.689> and<00:02:31.989> it<00:02:32.260> actually<00:02:32.290> kind<00:02:32.709> of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:32.829 
enjoy using them and it actually kind of

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.709 
enjoy using them and it actually kind of
makes<00:02:33.010> me<00:02:33.250> wish<00:02:33.519> that<00:02:33.549> stock<00:02:34.090> Android<00:02:34.540> has

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:34.719 
makes me wish that stock Android has

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.089 
makes me wish that stock Android has
something<00:02:35.019> closer<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.530> these<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:35.799> just<00:02:35.859> look

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
something closer to these that just look

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.339 
something closer to these that just look
a<00:02:36.189> lot<00:02:36.340> more<00:02:36.489> simple<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.840> little<00:02:38.109> bit<00:02:38.200> more

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
a lot more simple and a little bit more

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:40.259 
a lot more simple and a little bit more
minimal<00:02:38.769> than<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.099> ones<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.670> available

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
minimal than the ones that are available

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.349 
minimal than the ones that are available
on<00:02:40.750> stock<00:02:41.139> Android<00:02:41.739> but<00:02:42.219> anyway<00:02:42.519> these<00:02:42.879> soft

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
on stock Android but anyway these soft

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.940 
on stock Android but anyway these soft
keys<00:02:43.599> look<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.079> nice<00:02:44.200> and<00:02:44.409> I<00:02:44.500> enjoy<00:02:44.739> them

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
keys look really nice and I enjoy them

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.440 
keys look really nice and I enjoy them
now<00:02:45.099> if<00:02:45.549> we<00:02:45.639> go<00:02:45.760> ahead<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:45.939> take<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> look<00:02:46.329> at

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
now if we go ahead and take a look at

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.500 
now if we go ahead and take a look at
the<00:02:46.599> multitasking<00:02:47.290> or<00:02:47.439> recents<00:02:48.010> tab<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:49.329> can

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
the multitasking or recents tab you can

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.199 
the multitasking or recents tab you can
see<00:02:49.750> it<00:02:50.079> sort<00:02:50.500> of<00:02:50.590> has<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.159> Android<00:02:51.549> L<00:02:51.730> feel

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
see it sort of has that Android L feel

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.390 
see it sort of has that Android L feel
where<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.810> recent<00:02:53.530> apps<00:02:53.709> are<00:02:53.950> actually<00:02:54.280> in

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
where the recent apps are actually in

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.460 
where the recent apps are actually in
the<00:02:54.579> middle<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.750> screen<00:02:56.019> rather<00:02:56.349> than

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
the middle of the screen rather than

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.339 
the middle of the screen rather than
being<00:02:56.769> offset<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.430> the<00:02:57.549> right<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.139> looks

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
being offset to the right and it looks

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.559 
being offset to the right and it looks
pretty<00:02:59.620> nice<00:02:59.799> although<00:03:00.280> since<00:03:00.549> some<00:03:01.060> icons

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
pretty nice although since some icons

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.240 
pretty nice although since some icons
are<00:03:01.720> not<00:03:01.750> themed<00:03:02.079> like<00:03:02.260> Phoenix<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.889> can<00:03:03.069> see

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
are not themed like Phoenix you can see

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.129 
are not themed like Phoenix you can see
there<00:03:03.459> it<00:03:03.939> does<00:03:04.180> kind<00:03:04.419> of<00:03:04.510> stick<00:03:04.720> out<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.019> look

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
there it does kind of stick out and look

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.449 
there it does kind of stick out and look
a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.379> bit<00:03:05.560> weird<00:03:05.739> against<00:03:06.129> all<00:03:06.219> the<00:03:06.340> other

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
a little bit weird against all the other

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.490 
a little bit weird against all the other
ones<00:03:06.669> that<00:03:06.819> may<00:03:07.120> also<00:03:07.269> be<00:03:07.450> themed<00:03:07.870> since<00:03:08.139> the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
ones that may also be themed since the

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.229 
ones that may also be themed since the
icons<00:03:08.889> are<00:03:09.010> themed<00:03:09.189> system-wide<00:03:09.879> and<00:03:09.909> not

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
icons are themed system-wide and not

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.449

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389

those little tiny tick boxes so the

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.080 
those little tiny tick boxes so the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
sort of matching the theme because the

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.950 
sort of matching the theme because the
theme<00:05:06.810> is<00:05:07.110> sort<00:05:07.889> of<00:05:07.949> circular<00:05:08.250> and<00:05:08.760> round<00:05:09.120> but

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
the keyboard with the sort of rounded

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.550 
the keyboard with the sort of rounded
cornered<00:05:12.900> keys

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
cornered keys

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.670

about<00:06:23.849> is<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.570> fact<00:06:24.780> that<00:06:24.870> the<00:06:25.139> user<00:06:25.650> profile

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
about is the fact that the user profile

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.909 
about is the fact that the user profile
picture<00:06:26.610> is<00:06:26.849> not<00:06:27.300> sort<00:06:27.960> of<00:06:28.020> themed<00:06:28.380> like<00:06:28.650> those
