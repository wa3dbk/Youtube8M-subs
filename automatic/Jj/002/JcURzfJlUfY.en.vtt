00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
as you can see right around my YouTube

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.630 
as you can see right around my YouTube

application right down there in the dock

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
application right down there in the dock
then<00:00:39.090> that<00:00:39.239> means<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.750> application<00:00:40.200> is

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
then that means that the application is

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.280 
then that means that the application is
active<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:42.059> background<00:00:42.960> running

application so you can see right here if

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.049 
application so you can see right here if
I<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.780> ahead<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.079> open<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> my<00:00:47.070> app<00:00:47.340> switcher

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
I go ahead and open up my app switcher

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.389 
I go ahead and open up my app switcher
and<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> actually<00:00:49.110> see<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.680> taking

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
place within the app switcher as well so

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.590 
place within the app switcher as well so
you<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.219> white<00:00:53.460> glow<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:54.420> there

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600

you can see that white glow right there
on<00:00:54.750> steam<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.770> let's<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.010> say<00:00:56.250> I<00:00:56.280> wanted<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
on steam but let's just say I wanted to

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
on steam but let's just say I wanted to
swipe<00:00:57.329> over<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.640> YouTube<00:01:00.170> there<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
swipe over here to YouTube there it is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.270 
swipe over here to YouTube there it is
so<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.280> swipe<00:01:02.489> up<00:01:02.699> on<00:01:02.850> that<00:01:03.229> and<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.040> see

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
so if I swipe up on that and you can see

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.310 
so if I swipe up on that and you can see
that<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.549> glow<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.330> gone<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:07.200> you'll

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that the glow is actually gone so you'll

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.219 
that the glow is actually gone so you'll
also<00:01:07.470> notice<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.010> those<00:01:08.310> red

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
also notice that I have those red

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.710 
also notice that I have those red
notification<00:01:10.229> glows<00:01:10.650> right<00:01:11.010> there<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> again

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
notification glows right there so again

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.170 
notification glows right there so again
if<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.290> go<00:01:13.470> back<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.760> can<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
if I go back to this you can see that

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.030 
if I go back to this you can see that
the<00:01:15.360> red<00:01:15.630> glow<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.960> gone<00:01:16.170> but<00:01:16.380> now<00:01:16.560> I<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
the red glow is gone but now I have that

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.260 
the red glow is gone but now I have that
white<00:01:17.340> globe<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:18.060> actually

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
white globe because that's actually

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.020 
white globe because that's actually
running<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.020> background<00:01:19.189> so<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.640> isn't

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
running in the background so this isn't

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.390 
running in the background so this isn't
really<00:01:21.390> much<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.229> active<00:01:22.770> dock<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.250> my

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
really much like active dock in my

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.120 
really much like active dock in my
opinion<00:01:23.759> I<00:01:23.939> mean<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> does<00:01:24.360> still<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.810> that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
opinion I mean it does still have that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.149 
opinion I mean it does still have that
type<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.159> kind<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:26.909> bouncy<00:01:27.680> effect<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
type of kind of bouncy effect that

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.969 
type of kind of bouncy effect that
active<00:01:29.729> doc<00:01:29.970> had<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.540> active<00:01:30.960> doc<00:01:31.170> was<00:01:31.439> one<00:01:31.890> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
active doc had but active doc was one of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.219 
active doc had but active doc was one of
my<00:01:32.070> favorite<00:01:32.460> tweaks<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.720> used<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
my favorite tweaks and I used it

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.760 
my favorite tweaks and I used it
non-stop<00:01:34.860> until<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.939> basically<00:01:36.750> upgraded<00:01:37.439> iOS

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
non-stop until I basically upgraded iOS

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.580 
non-stop until I basically upgraded iOS
7<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.130> jailbroke<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.640> in<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.570> what<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.290> does

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
7 and jailbroke it in but what this does

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
7 and jailbroke it in but what this does
is<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.009> necessarily<00:01:41.460> contain<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.689> the

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
is not necessarily contain it to the

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.530 
is not necessarily contain it to the
dock<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:44.490> know<00:01:44.640> brings<00:01:45.090> us<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
dock this you know brings us to the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.719 
dock this you know brings us to the
entire<00:01:45.869> springboard<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.159> can<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.490> that

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
entire springboard and you can see that

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.969 
entire springboard and you can see that
