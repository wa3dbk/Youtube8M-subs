 ensure that they are tremendously comfortable 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:48.140
 It has been a pleasure to play, it really is 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.640

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.390
 direct things sometimes happen 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.819
 little things but good we had all very 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.470
 well it was very fun it was great and 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.140
 then in the afternoon, you know that 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.790

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.010
 was already yances to the room they did 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.450
 a triangular and good, I think that 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.130
 those who were in the afternoon I 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 I personally retired because I had to 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.050
 see the classic but those who were 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.090
 in the afternoon for sure it happens 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.940
 I'm great here we are going down to 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.070
 the bottom floor and see what it is that 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.690
 here they still have more fish is an area 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.940
 more reserved for teams that 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.260
 go or go to boot camps 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.840
 that for those who do not know what is a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.680
 bud fields is to meet and concentrate 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.409
 with your team 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.290
 and talk about strategies to play at 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:54.689
 100% play together and especially play with 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.790
 a powerful and important line I've already 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.260
 said that they are 100 megs symmetric like that 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.900
 that of course a very good connection 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.879
 we are coming to my favorite area of 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.310
 this high performance center that is 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.510
 the fish tank is worth fixing down here for 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.370
 Nobody bother you as I told you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.739
 before but here the fish tank totally 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.510
 individually completely so that nobody 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.980
 bother with that little door here we have 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.049
 to the giants guys who were 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.900
 training and now you are going to see 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.549
 it's worth little more than telling you we're 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 practically reaching the end about 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.569
