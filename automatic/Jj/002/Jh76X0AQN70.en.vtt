00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.999 

under<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:11.099> rock<00:00:11.400> here<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.530> found<00:00:13.530> out<00:00:13.769> that

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
under this rock here I found out that

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.420 
under this rock here I found out that
our<00:00:14.130> natural<00:00:14.790> spring<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.450> coming<00:00:16.139> out<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:27.230 

here<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:22.939> it's<00:00:23.939> solid<00:00:24.600> here<00:00:25.550> but<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:27.000> water

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
here it is it's solid here but the water

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.070 
here it is it's solid here but the water
keeps<00:00:27.539> pumping<00:00:28.109> up<00:00:28.470> here<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.949> flowing<00:00:29.849> down

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
keeps pumping up here and flowing down

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.400 
keeps pumping up here and flowing down
to<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.199> lake<00:00:31.349> so<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.329> most<00:00:33.930> likely<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
to the lake so this is most likely a

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.370 
to the lake so this is most likely a
natural<00:00:35.040> spring<00:00:35.250> oh<00:00:35.640> my<00:00:36.300> friends<00:00:36.719> I<00:00:36.960> just

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
energy again so we can keep going here

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.640 
energy again so we can keep going here
but<00:03:23.120> first<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.300> need<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.480> extinguish<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:25.440> fire

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and the easiest way to do that is to

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:38.660 
and the easiest way to do that is to
just<00:03:29.700> push<00:03:30.000> it<00:03:30.150> down<00:03:30.270> to<00:03:30.630> like<00:03:30.870> oh<00:03:37.519> there<00:03:38.519> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
just push it down to like oh there you
