00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.120 
for two months and I was like this feels
like<00:01:56.399> work<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.780> last<00:01:57.960> month<00:01:58.290> I've<00:01:58.950> just

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like work so the last month I've just

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.300 
like work so the last month I've just
been<00:01:59.250> taking<00:01:59.750> to<00:02:00.750> step<00:02:01.049> two<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.770> night<00:02:02.009> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
been taking to step two at night and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.969 
been taking to step two at night and
then<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:02.610> take<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> step<00:02:03.329> one<00:02:03.570> which<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
then I take the step one which is

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.530 
then I take the step one which is
essentially<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> multivitamin<00:02:05.759> once<00:02:06.299> in<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
essentially a multivitamin once in the

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.469 
essentially a multivitamin once in the
morning<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.759> the<00:02:08.759> step<00:02:08.970> two<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
morning and then the step two is that I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.140 
morning and then the step two is that I
take<00:02:10.050> at<00:02:10.200> night<00:02:10.250> that's<00:02:11.250> all<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> vitamins
