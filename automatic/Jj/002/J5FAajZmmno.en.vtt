Hi everyone, today we're going to cook a really easy recipe

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.030
one of the easiest i'm going to show you

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.400
We're going to cook some "bouchÃ©es guacamole prawns"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
We start to prepare the guacamole, we need 2 tender 
 avocados, 1 onion, salt and pepper and 1/2 lemon.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
Then, we need prawn crackers and little prawns.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.500
for the guacamole, i start by cutting avocados in half.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To remove the core, i stick the knife and turn

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Once we have a 1/2 avocado, we cut it in half again

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and to remove the skin, pass your thumb between the skin and avocado

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Nothing said here !

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'm going to add onions, so for onions, i protect my eyes, 
 ( few onions, better than too much onions) and let's go!

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
unidentified talk ...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Once my onions finely chopped, take a bowl to mix

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I add the desired quantity, i'm not going to put 
 everything otherwise it'll be a bit too flavoured

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Add avocado + juice of 1/2 lemon + salt and pepper reasonably. Mix

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So now, it's really easy, take a cracker, put some guacamole 
 on it and drop a prawn on top. Superb !

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We have a really nice plate, prepare them at 
 the last minute to keep crackers crispy !
