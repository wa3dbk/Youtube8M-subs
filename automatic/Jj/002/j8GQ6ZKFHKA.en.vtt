this little trick but trust me it's a

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:40.269 
this little trick but trust me it's a
hundred<00:07:38.839> percent<00:07:38.929> drop<00:07:39.379> and<00:07:39.769> Monster<00:07:40.249> Cards

hundred percent drop and Monster Cards
or<00:07:40.819> worth<00:07:41.209> it<00:07:41.449> because<00:07:41.809> not<00:07:42.800> two<00:07:42.979> players<00:07:43.219> buy

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:43.550

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.629 
or worth it because not two players buy
them<00:07:43.789> mainly<00:07:44.599> for<00:07:44.899> the<00:07:44.959> same<00:07:45.110> reason<00:07:45.139> I<00:07:45.529> do<00:07:45.709> but

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 
them mainly for the same reason I do but

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.929 
them mainly for the same reason I do but
um<00:07:47.110> that's<00:07:48.110> going<00:07:48.499> to<00:07:48.559> be<00:07:48.709> the<00:07:49.099> conclusion<00:07:49.699> to

00:07:49.929 --> 00:07:49.939 
um that's going to be the conclusion to
