00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hey people i am to beats and cordial 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.069
 welcome to the new video of me and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.049
 Although today it is about the topic like 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.690
 I'm getting better in call of duty is 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.969
 how can the killstreaks reach and 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.460
 yes how can i hear classics reach 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.080
 murder cam and nuclear maybe even 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.960
 already, and indeed there is for it actually 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.060
 three tips steiger the tips first so 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 the third tip sounds now I have 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.869
 now a bit absurd 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
 but it really helps and I start 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.740
 first with the first tip 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 There are many youtubers doing that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.040
 to more more videos just several parks 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 videos and then you know how I mean 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.940
 actually as I said there is only 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.469
 three tips i'm starting now i'm starting 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.820
 the first thought as one should yes 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.820
 just start but I found 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.360
 It's so nice and that's the first tip 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.899
 just watch youtube videos of people 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.449
 So just people who just comment 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.789
 I clamped less fun 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.280
 Just watch youtube videos on what 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.680
 what I commander marcel from commander 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.640
 scorpion whiskey bar service kappacher 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.170
 absolutely very pretty beast and yes me 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.189
 say look at youtube videos others 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.409
 you also get a bit through it 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.070
 better but it helps you of course 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.170
 Not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.030
 So it helps you but it helps 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
 do not know much how to move 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.229
 We can be allowed to do something like that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.490
 this is all how the map is structured 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.119
 where opponents build you can see 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.990
 But the second tip is just paying attention 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.400
 simple people are just like you man 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.979
 can only get better if you do that 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.049
 looking for a game or often play is real 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.280
 what brings the game what brings you 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.659
 if you look at this video though 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.490
 call of duty only once a week 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.320
 plays is clear that here is not better 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.869
 unless he has the worst talent 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.579
 and yes, as I said , just look for this 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 But the game does not neglect that 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.350
 school or or the work or 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.130
 otherwise negligible negligent 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 please do not 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.120
 yes that can donate you can 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.620
 Example of school stay seated 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.140
 just write bad and afterwards 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.790
 his statements trial so they keep 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.210
 extent you have to control it when 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.250
 her on the 16 now we come to the third 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.130
 tip where I've just been told the 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.830
 of evil absurd but it really helps 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:14.560
 people and you have to glue yourself 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.720
 So do not look for the worst Baroque 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.460
 liver sticks to those everywhere 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.640
 you can not get it off but just 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.350
 so glue the things so covers that 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.880
 we can not see her anymore but the one 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.440
 also go away without him 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.520
 These adhesive strips you know hope 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.520
 rather you can see these adhesive strips 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.350
 leaves behind and yes you cut with it 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.630
 That's right for you and then it stuck 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.950
 exactly where, for example, everyone 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.620
 call of duty that they are playing 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.350
 By the way, go shit black ops 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.140
 second single stylo mw3 well it is there 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:46.090
 where the killstreaks are built 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.410
 So you know that then he will 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.720
 how many kills you still see 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.670
 you just need to tap that off 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.410
 that sounds really bad now 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.540
 absurd then but it helps you bad 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.100
 when then you do not even have some 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.410
 then people have bad pressure 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.030
 if she was just above orywal that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.709
 always used to be there with me 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.160
 I'm protected like a berber like that 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.110
 protected 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.880
 that did not sweat at all for 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.890
 a hobby I would have to again 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.020
 I think evil for an orbital 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.570
 Well, that's sweaty at the beginning too 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.870
 so that will be with the people who like 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.239
 The bras just told the idea 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.190
 start playing my god i am 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.540
 just on a tenth street i have 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.459
 equal to my next Norby 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.320
 course, of course, catch synonymous 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.000
 to sweat it is the same 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.410
 like if you're in front three, apply 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.989
 Although had never quite sets 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.239
 mitbestimmt so before and yes again cards 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:37.540
 of course explained and yes as I said 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.610
 people just give it to you then see 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.209
 you are not on which street you are 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.670
 just are 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.800
 well, if you're concentrating on it, you guys 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.150
 do not tell you on it please not the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.739
 kills with otherwise that brings you even 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.690
 Nothing that her ex stuck because then 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.180
 Do you really know my dress my 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.060
 Swarm or whatever, so stick it off 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.320
 and just watch look 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.540
 not down here could be similar 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.790
 so it seems quite normal and then 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.230
 Do you see my god I have no lobby 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.720
 he just keeps on saying then you have something 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.500
 I know if you could drone Toni 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.950
 of course you then play 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.460
 without control organ orbiter then stell 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.770
 Do not be kidding 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:16.880
 drone was able to I have the same 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.040
 I somehow do not care about it through you 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.959
 think just keep playing is easy 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.120
 if it would happen that we 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.290
 that one reaches and someday if you 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.270
 you really did play that way 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.890
 then check that out then you will get it 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.480
 not so much with her anymore 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.050
 equal before the pages then you get so 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.660
 displayed italy satellites and sat 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.430
 Immediately and then it goes on 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:42.169
 and so you do not come in this lab 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.370
 no finished grade looks hot but you 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.550
 I probably know that 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.990
 If the beginning to sweat and 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.669
 so is just mean of here 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.980
 I hope this has given you now fallen 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.650
 she really tries these three tips 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.770
 let's go and yes people that's it from me 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.160
 and by the way, before you are video now 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.690
 to make a statement then please leave it 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.200
 easy down there but there if it does 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.790
 like 

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:07.730
 I will of course now more videos 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:10.360
 upload the house again 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.360
 I was like that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.590
 charlie is secured
