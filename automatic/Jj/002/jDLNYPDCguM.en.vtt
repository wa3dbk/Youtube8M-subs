that's what I'm trying to say what I do

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.760 
that's what I'm trying to say what I do
first<00:00:35.020> is<00:00:35.289> I<00:00:35.440> use<00:00:35.710> this<00:00:36.039> NARS<00:00:37.230> cap-vert<00:00:38.230> it's

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
first is I use this NARS cap-vert it's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.029 
first is I use this NARS cap-vert it's
sort<00:00:39.489> of<00:00:39.579> like<00:00:39.760> a<00:00:39.960> bronzing<00:00:40.960> um<00:00:42.329> stick<00:00:43.329> so

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
sort of like a bronzing um stick so

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.170 
sort of like a bronzing um stick so
normally<00:00:45.039> I<00:00:45.070> would<00:00:45.340> use<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.640> like<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
normally I would use this like in the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.670 
normally I would use this like in the
summer<00:00:46.359> it's<00:00:46.600> really<00:00:46.660> great<00:00:47.020> for<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.590> know

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
that bronze underneath the cheekbones

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.049 
that bronze underneath the cheekbones
but<00:00:50.800> this<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.430> really<00:00:51.579> good<00:00:51.789> base<00:00:52.030> for

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
but this is a really good base for

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.569 
but this is a really good base for
slenderizing<00:00:52.989> your<00:00:53.289> nose<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:53.920> what<00:00:54.070> you<00:00:54.160> do<00:00:54.370> is

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
right now but I'm going to do is use a

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.440 
right now but I'm going to do is use a
just<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.189> makeup<00:01:27.460> sponge<00:01:27.729> and<00:01:27.909> kind<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.240> blend

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
slenderizing the same thing with the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.320 
slenderizing the same thing with the
other<00:02:33.400> side<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:35.580> you<00:02:36.580> kind<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.850> want<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.120> keep

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.550 
it you know similar on both sides you
know<00:02:43.330> want<00:02:43.450> one<00:02:43.690> that's<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:44.080> little<00:02:44.170> bit<00:02:44.380> lower

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
know want one that's a little bit lower

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.560 
know want one that's a little bit lower
and<00:02:44.709> one<00:02:45.010> that's<00:02:45.250> kind<00:02:45.490> of<00:02:45.550> a<00:02:45.820> little<00:02:46.450> bit

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
and one that's kind of a little bit

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.320 
and one that's kind of a little bit
higher<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.050> want<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.230> keep<00:02:47.980> it<00:02:48.330> similar

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
higher you just want to keep it similar

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:57.090 
higher you just want to keep it similar
and<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:52.060> trick<00:02:52.300> here<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:55.860> try<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:56.980> get

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
and the trick here is to try and get

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
and the trick here is to try and get
straight<00:02:57.489> so<00:02:57.970> kind<00:02:58.330> of<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:58.450> that<00:02:58.630> looks

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
straight so kind of like that looks

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.630 
straight so kind of like that looks
really<00:02:59.080> funny<00:02:59.260> right<00:02:59.470> now<00:02:59.500> but<00:03:00.220> I'm<00:03:00.370> going<00:03:00.580> to

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
really funny right now but I'm going to

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.010 
really funny right now but I'm going to
blend<00:03:00.850> it<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.300> I'll<00:03:01.570> show<00:03:01.690> you<00:03:01.750> what<00:03:01.930> it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:02.020 
blend it in and I'll show you what it

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.510 
blend it in and I'll show you what it
looks<00:03:02.140> like<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.350> you<00:03:02.410> want<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.709> blend<00:03:02.920> out

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
looks like and you want to blend out

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.340 
looks like and you want to blend out
this<00:03:04.090> way<00:03:04.300> you<00:03:04.360> don't<00:03:04.570> want<00:03:04.690> to<00:03:04.750> blend<00:03:04.930> on<00:03:05.080> top

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
this way you don't want to blend on top

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
this way you don't want to blend on top
of<00:03:05.560> your<00:03:05.680> bridge<00:03:05.980> we're<00:03:06.130> going<00:03:06.250> to<00:03:06.310> do

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
of your bridge we're going to do

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.570 
of your bridge we're going to do
something<00:03:06.550> else<00:03:06.730> with<00:03:06.850> that<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.709> just<00:03:08.980> lightly

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
something else with that so just lightly

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.630 
something else with that so just lightly
you'd<00:03:10.360> want<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.600> blend<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.370> till<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.520> all

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
you'd want to blend it till it's all

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.729 
you'd want to blend it till it's all
gone<00:03:12.880> but<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.209> want<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> keep<00:03:13.630> some<00:03:14.050> shading

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
gone but you want to keep some shading

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:32.589 
gone but you want to keep some shading
there<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.430> that

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.270 

so<00:03:33.599> now<00:03:33.750> you've<00:03:33.959> got<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.140> much<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.890> slender

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
so now you've got a much more slender

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.149 
so now you've got a much more slender
eyes<00:03:35.519> nose<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.349> to<00:03:37.349> make<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.650> even<00:03:37.769> a<00:03:38.129> little
