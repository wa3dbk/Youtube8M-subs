00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:15.219
 hello I kiamo tina and I want to do me 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:20.849
 see how we work come true 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:23.860
 real soft tissue fabrics 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:28.540
 expandable similar facts 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.110
 if we make a scarf with colored stripes 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.090
 then we did not decide 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.820
 how much this edge must be guarantor 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 then we want to start with another 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:43.870
 elbow after another then binds the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 you read more children two wool and you start 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.890
 with another color 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:56.250
 now for example I take red 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:01:01.510
 we start with red another color 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.629
 I do so we start with the big e 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.299
 I go straight 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.680
 two straight the number always step out 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.690
 cold up 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 and I drop it in the shirt falls on itself 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:27.500
 then I read this flap next to the 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.500
 first of the previous one 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.939
 I make a knot knot 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:40.899
 to stop it is enough and another facts 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.899
 then two straight 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.110
 to change the color you start the 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.550
 the corner for not having jude is in the middle of 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:06.640
 we must always be united to the 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:14.520
 at the beginning the different color with a knot 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:14.520
 two small reverses made 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:30.490
 Yup 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:33.490
 so with the irons of several servants 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:38.320
 numbers depending on the thickness of the wool 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.980
 they should be used for this blade here 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:47.050
 I used the number 4 which is fine and is 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.310
 this is a sample of 20 jerseys that 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.370
 so it comes with the fourth with the number 4 here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.750
 they are made to make a beautiful example 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 scarf requires about three pounds of wool 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:06.280
 that if you want a whole fund or with 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:15.060
 polymers can be made of lines 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:15.060
 in the show hello 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.540
 Hello
