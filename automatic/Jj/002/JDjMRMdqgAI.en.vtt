00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.530
 There was 

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.250
 I really appreciate it 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:08.250
 Last fall 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:16.430
 Losing is the regret 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:19.520
 I don't think that it was good to be able to concentrate there 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:25.050
 It has been a lot of players from that cold loss to here 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:28.949
 It is so we would really Do was the Tanomoshiku growth 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.919
 Among them, I think that we are really good to throw our company today but what kind of from the battery 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.090
 I saw it like this, but it is already very impressive. 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:39.140
 At the sight go really against because 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.450

 Let 's throw it just over there hard 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.290
 It is really tenacious pitching again while putting out anything- how about the growth of Mr Sato? 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.329
 Now I felt even if it anymore 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.680
 It is no catcher and the large side 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.040
 Oh well while taking good child communication 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.400
 Well catcher's ger well 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.690
 I think you have supported o and lead 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.870

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.060
 And I want to do someday I heard was decided 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.360

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.310

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.340
 Yes it is the police finals did not expect 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.920

 Aim There are author invested a great pitching 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.570
 The last moment I raised my arms high and put up a guts pose 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.170
 What kind of mood did was paddle still winter doing firmly themselves to defeat Mr. Urawagakuin 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 Because it has 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:02.380

 Myself where is that I think really great pitching's while issued a runner today 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.160
 It was good 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.340
 After all we followed the course well so I thought it was the best there 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.239

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.170
 People of that catcher Although I seemed to be there is really effective breathing in athletes 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.489

 Well it was really good that the result came out

 It was a safety bunt of the additional reduction of the scene broadcast player itself 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:49.540
 What a feeling when that sign came out mars ter 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:54.189

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.269
 Now it's finally the lower mayoral election, but what if you set it up on a mound 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.890
 Do you want to pitch 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:00.370
 The most good if it is pitching to take so struck with after all the Ashikari configuration, such as today 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.459
 Than I think 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.310
