look through here says t-mobile up to
the<00:04:08.120> top<00:04:08.270> now<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.540> carrier<00:04:08.900> has<00:04:09.050> changed<00:04:09.440> from

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
the top now the carrier has changed from

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.920 
the top now the carrier has changed from
carrier<00:04:09.980> 13-point<00:04:10.760> oh<00:04:10.850> I<00:04:11.060> was<00:04:11.570> down<00:04:11.690> here<00:04:11.720> at

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
carrier 13-point oh I was down here at

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.300 
carrier 13-point oh I was down here at
the<00:04:11.990> bottom<00:04:12.260> I'll<00:04:12.350> show<00:04:12.560> you<00:04:12.620> guys<00:04:12.860> this<00:04:13.070> you

the bottom I'll show you guys this you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.710 
the bottom I'll show you guys this you
know<00:04:13.430> I<00:04:13.460> didn't<00:04:13.700> switch<00:04:14.030> out<00:04:14.240> the<00:04:14.360> phone<00:04:14.540> from

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
know I didn't switch out the phone from

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.530 
know I didn't switch out the phone from
the<00:04:14.900> beginning<00:04:15.430> you<00:04:16.430> can<00:04:16.580> actually<00:04:16.880> see<00:04:17.090> the

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
the beginning you can actually see the

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.009 
the beginning you can actually see the
meid<00:04:18.380> is<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:19.459> same<00:04:19.670> so<00:04:20.180> my<00:04:20.299> final<00:04:20.600> opinion<00:04:20.690> of

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
meid is the same so my final opinion of

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.250 
meid is the same so my final opinion of
the<00:04:21.109> GPP<00:04:21.620> sim<00:04:21.830> versus<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.340> our<00:04:22.430> sim<00:04:22.670> 7<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.750> GPP

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
the GPP sim versus the our sim 7 the GPP

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.870 
the GPP sim versus the our sim 7 the GPP
sim<00:04:24.500> does<00:04:24.710> seem<00:04:24.920> to<00:04:25.010> connect<00:04:25.280> every<00:04:25.550> time<00:04:25.730> and

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
sim does seem to connect every time and

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.310 
sim does seem to connect every time and
it<00:04:25.940> does<00:04:26.060> seem<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.330> work<00:04:26.480> very<00:04:26.510> well<00:04:26.780> it's<00:04:27.020> very

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
it does seem to work very well it's very

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.350 
it does seem to work very well it's very
stable<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:28.100> problem<00:04:28.400> with<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.610> our<00:04:28.700> sim<00:04:28.910> 7<00:04:29.240> is

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
stable the problem with the our sim 7 is

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.610 
stable the problem with the our sim 7 is
that<00:04:29.510> people<00:04:29.810> are<00:04:29.900> trying<00:04:30.140> in<00:04:30.350> there<00:04:30.470> having

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
that people are trying in there having

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.700 
that people are trying in there having
to<00:04:30.890> tried<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.510> whole<00:04:32.630> process<00:04:32.900> about<00:04:33.290> 2<00:04:33.440> to<00:04:33.530> 3

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
to tried the whole process about 2 to 3

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.960 
to tried the whole process about 2 to 3
times<00:04:33.740> in<00:04:34.070> order<00:04:34.160> to<00:04:34.370> get<00:04:34.490> it<00:04:34.550> to<00:04:34.640> work<00:04:34.760> and

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
times in order to get it to work and

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.950 
times in order to get it to work and
sometimes<00:04:35.180> they're<00:04:35.450> not<00:04:35.600> even<00:04:35.810> getting

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:35.960 
sometimes they're not even getting

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.900 
sometimes they're not even getting
theirs<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.350> work<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.710> don't<00:04:37.070> know<00:04:37.250> exactly<00:04:37.430> what

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
theirs to work I don't know exactly what

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:40.300 
theirs to work I don't know exactly what
the<00:04:38.030> issue<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.330> but<00:04:38.660> I<00:04:39.170> know<00:04:39.230> that<00:04:39.320> the<00:04:39.620> GPP<00:04:40.100> sim

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
the issue is but I know that the GPP sim

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.090 
the issue is but I know that the GPP sim
does<00:04:40.520> seem<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:40.850> work<00:04:41.000> every<00:04:41.330> time<00:04:41.890> now<00:04:42.890> I

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
does seem to work every time now I

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.670 
does seem to work every time now I
thought<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.640> myself<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:44.300> wonder<00:04:44.630> if<00:04:44.990> it's<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
thought to myself I wonder if it's the

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.740 
thought to myself I wonder if it's the
GPP<00:04:46.190> sim<00:04:46.400> itself<00:04:46.760> or<00:04:46.970> if<00:04:47.060> it's<00:04:47.240> the<00:04:47.360> profile

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
GPP sim itself or if it's the profile

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.090 
GPP sim itself or if it's the profile
that<00:04:47.900> was<00:04:48.050> installed<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.560> came<00:04:48.740> or<00:04:48.980> the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
that was installed that came or the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.370 
that was installed that came or the
software<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.580> came<00:04:49.730> with<00:04:49.790> the<00:04:50.030> GPP<00:04:50.540> sim<00:04:50.780> so

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
software that came with the GPP sim so

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.680 
software that came with the GPP sim so
what<00:04:51.560> I<00:04:51.590> did<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:51.980> I<00:04:52.010> actually<00:04:52.160> took<00:04:52.580> my<00:04:52.820> our<00:04:53.360> sim

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
what I did is I actually took my our sim

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.440 
what I did is I actually took my our sim
7<00:04:54.140> which<00:04:54.530> I<00:04:54.680> actually<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:55.160> did<00:04:55.370> took<00:04:56.180> my<00:04:56.330> our

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:56.450 
7 which I actually just did took my our

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.240 
7 which I actually just did took my our
sim<00:04:56.660> 7<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.110> placed<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.500> in<00:04:57.620> the<00:04:57.770> device<00:04:57.980> with

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
sim 7 and placed it in the device with

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.490

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
every single time which leads me to

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.610 
every single time which leads me to
believe<00:05:04.340> that<00:05:04.460> it's<00:05:04.700> not<00:05:04.880> actually<00:05:05.150> the<00:05:06.080> GPP

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
sim itself that's stable but rather the

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.320 
sim itself that's stable but rather the
profile<00:05:09.169> that<00:05:09.350> you<00:05:09.500> install<00:05:09.950> now<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.910> problem

it<00:05:12.260> comes<00:05:12.500> with<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:13.160> software<00:05:13.340> and<00:05:13.850> in<00:05:14.270> order

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
it comes with the software and in order

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.820 
it comes with the software and in order
to<00:05:14.510> use<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.810> software<00:05:15.140> you<00:05:15.380> have<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.680> have
