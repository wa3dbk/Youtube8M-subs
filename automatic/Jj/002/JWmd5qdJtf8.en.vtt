00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
although in real life it doesn't really

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.110 
although in real life it doesn't really
seem<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.800> much<00:00:37.980> brighter<00:00:38.309> than<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
seem that much brighter than the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.260 
seem that much brighter than the
comparable<00:00:39.660> tablets<00:00:40.260> say<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.770> ipad<00:00:41.280> 2<00:00:41.550> or<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
comparable tablets say the ipad 2 or the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
comparable tablets say the ipad 2 or the
galaxy<00:00:42.780> tab<00:00:42.960> 10-1<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> noticeably

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
galaxy tab 10-1 it is noticeably

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.670 
galaxy tab 10-1 it is noticeably
brighter<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.960> do<00:00:46.140> find<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.530> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
brighter and we do find that the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.680 
brighter and we do find that the
contrast<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.640> good<00:00:47.910> especially<00:00:48.300> off

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
contrast is very good especially off

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.740 
contrast is very good especially off
viewing<00:00:49.170> contrast<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.920> very<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.789> good<00:00:51.090> you

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
viewing contrast is very very good you

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.049 
viewing contrast is very very good you
can<00:00:51.899> get<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.469> 178<00:00:53.250> degrees<00:00:53.340> without<00:00:53.699> really

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
can get up to 178 degrees without really

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.630 
can get up to 178 degrees without really
losing<00:00:54.449> much<00:00:54.629> contrast<00:00:55.140> at<00:00:55.379> all<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.399> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
losing much contrast at all so that is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.580 
losing much contrast at all so that is
definitely<00:00:56.670> an<00:00:57.329> impressive<00:00:57.870> step<00:00:58.199> forward

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
definitely an impressive step forward

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
definitely an impressive step forward
we'll<00:00:58.710> flip<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> over<00:00:59.129> and<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.300> take<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we'll flip it over and so you can take a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.360 
we'll flip it over and so you can take a
look<00:01:00.660> at<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> design<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.559> can<00:01:01.620> see<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> spun

look at the design you can see the spun

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.579 
look at the design you can see the spun
aluminum<00:01:02.629> design<00:01:03.629> which<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.019> very<00:01:04.199> similar<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
aluminum design which is very similar to

this<00:02:48.230> is<00:02:48.380> pretty<00:02:48.620> minimal<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.700> terms<00:02:50.030> of

TouchWiz customization is that we see on

TouchWiz customization is that we see on

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
it very interesting this is the keyboard

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.430 
it very interesting this is the keyboard
dock<00:04:06.950> which<00:04:07.160> is<00:04:07.310> a<00:04:07.340> 150<00:04:08.120> dollar<00:04:08.330> extra<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.260> it

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
dock which is a 150 dollar extra and it

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.170 
dock which is a 150 dollar extra and it
comes<00:04:09.650> with<00:04:09.830> its<00:04:09.950> own<00:04:10.040> battery<00:04:10.340> built-in<00:04:10.880> so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
comes with its own battery built-in so

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.560 
comes with its own battery built-in so
if<00:04:11.330> you<00:04:11.510> take<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.500> prime<00:04:13.060> slot<00:04:14.060> it<00:04:14.209> in<00:04:14.330> like

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
if you take the prime slot it in like

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.780 
if you take the prime slot it in like
thus<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:17.810> actually<00:04:18.170> starts<00:04:18.560> to<00:04:18.739> recharge<00:04:19.280> the

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
thus it actually starts to recharge the

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.810 
thus it actually starts to recharge the
tablet<00:04:20.239> as<00:04:20.359> it's<00:04:20.720> plugged<00:04:20.930> in<00:04:21.169> here<00:04:21.410> so<00:04:22.160> if<00:04:22.550> you

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
tablet as it's plugged in here so if you

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.700 
tablet as it's plugged in here so if you
have<00:04:23.150> both<00:04:23.540> batteries<00:04:23.840> fully<00:04:24.020> charged<00:04:24.560> you

have both batteries fully charged you

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.250 
have both batteries fully charged you
effectively<00:04:25.160> you're<00:04:25.520> not<00:04:25.640> going<00:04:25.880> to<00:04:25.940> call

as<00:05:11.800> you're<00:05:12.040> typing<00:05:12.220> away<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.790> keyboard

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
as you're typing away on the keyboard

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.240 
as you're typing away on the keyboard
which<00:05:13.750> causes<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.260> cursor<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:14.680> move<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:15.040> can

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
which causes the cursor to move and can

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.310 
which causes the cursor to move and can
cause<00:05:15.460> all<00:05:15.730> sorts<00:05:15.760> of<00:05:16.030> headaches<00:05:16.330> if<00:05:16.510> you<00:05:17.110> are

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
cause all sorts of headaches if you are

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.440 
cause all sorts of headaches if you are
trying<00:05:17.650> to<00:05:17.830> write<00:05:18.040> on<00:05:18.220> here<00:05:18.400> which<00:05:18.610> in<00:05:19.180> theory

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:19.450 
trying to write on here which in theory

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.810 
trying to write on here which in theory
you<00:05:19.690> would<00:05:19.720> be<00:05:19.960> doing<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:20.740> 150<00:05:21.190> dollars<00:05:21.580> extra

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
you would be doing so 150 dollars extra

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.140 
you would be doing so 150 dollars extra
for<00:05:22.150> this<00:05:22.450> which<00:05:22.750> turns<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.230> into<00:05:23.970> basically<00:05:24.970> a

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
for this which turns it into basically a

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.540 
for this which turns it into basically a
nice<00:05:25.450> little<00:05:25.720> laptop<00:05:26.290> a<00:05:26.320> very<00:05:26.680> small<00:05:27.070> laptop

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
nice little laptop a very small laptop

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.400 
nice little laptop a very small laptop
as<00:05:27.760> it<00:05:27.910> were<00:05:28.000> with<00:05:28.630> very<00:05:28.870> good<00:05:29.020> battery<00:05:29.380> life

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410 
as it were with very good battery life

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.310 
as it were with very good battery life
and<00:05:29.800> very<00:05:30.460> light<00:05:30.790> weight<00:05:31.420> as<00:05:31.690> well<00:05:31.960> so<00:05:32.200> it's

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
and very light weight as well so it's

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.170 
and very light weight as well so it's
very<00:05:32.560> easy<00:05:32.710> to<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.280> take<00:05:33.580> with<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.000> and

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
very easy to and take with you and

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.940 
very easy to and take with you and
that's<00:05:35.020> certainly<00:05:35.230> a<00:05:35.410> much<00:05:35.740> nicer

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
that's certainly a much nicer

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.090 
that's certainly a much nicer
alternative<00:05:36.850> then<00:05:37.540> a<00:05:37.990> netbook<00:05:38.590> these<00:05:38.830> days

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
alternative then a netbook these days

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.270 
alternative then a netbook these days
for<00:05:39.760> not<00:05:39.880> a<00:05:39.910> whole<00:05:40.090> lot<00:05:40.210> extra<00:05:40.510> money<00:05:40.690> to

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
for not a whole lot extra money to

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.620 
for not a whole lot extra money to
unleash<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:42.790> slide<00:05:43.030> that<00:05:43.060> to<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.420> side

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
unleash that you slide that to the side

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.960 
unleash that you slide that to the side
and<00:05:44.080> there<00:05:44.980> you<00:05:45.070> go<00:05:45.190> you're<00:05:45.430> back<00:05:45.580> to<00:05:45.730> having<00:05:45.760> a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
and there you go you're back to having a

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.630 
and there you go you're back to having a
tablet<00:05:46.150> again<00:05:47.940> so<00:05:48.940> again<00:05:49.120> we<00:05:49.660> think<00:05:49.930> this<00:05:50.140> is

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
tablet again so again we think this is

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.310 
tablet again so again we think this is
the<00:05:51.640> best<00:05:51.760> android<00:05:52.210> tablet<00:05:52.690> on<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.810> market<00:05:52.900> at

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
the best android tablet on the market at

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.360 
the best android tablet on the market at
this<00:05:53.530> point<00:05:53.830> in<00:05:53.980> terms<00:05:54.070> of<00:05:54.220> performance

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
this point in terms of performance

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.000 
this point in terms of performance
battery<00:05:55.120> life<00:05:55.300> design<00:05:56.230> it<00:05:56.500> is<00:05:56.650> certainly

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
battery life design it is certainly

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.220 
battery life design it is certainly
outpacing<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.670> samsung<00:05:58.060> galaxy<00:05:58.090> tab<00:05:58.690> 10<00:05:59.020> dot

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
outpacing the samsung galaxy tab 10 dot

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.680 
outpacing the samsung galaxy tab 10 dot
one<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.680> the<00:05:59.770> 8.9<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:00.640> at<00:06:01.360> five<00:06:01.600> hundred

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
one and the 8.9 and at five hundred

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.410 
one and the 8.9 and at five hundred
dollars<00:06:02.110> for<00:06:02.320> 32<00:06:02.680> gigs<00:06:02.950> it's<00:06:03.640> a<00:06:03.790> pretty<00:06:04.180> good

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:04.420 
dollars for 32 gigs it's a pretty good

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.260 
dollars for 32 gigs it's a pretty good
value<00:06:04.780> too<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.410> again<00:06:05.830> this<00:06:06.070> is<00:06:06.370> the<00:06:06.400> asus<00:06:07.030> eee

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
value too so again this is the asus eee

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.870 
value too so again this is the asus eee
pad<00:06:07.480> transformer<00:06:07.870> prime<00:06:08.500> and<00:06:08.830> we<00:06:09.730> would

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 
pad transformer prime and we would

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.040 
pad transformer prime and we would
definitely<00:06:10.090> give<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:10.570> our<00:06:10.660> mark<00:06:10.930> of

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
definitely give it our mark of

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.590 
definitely give it our mark of
recommendation
