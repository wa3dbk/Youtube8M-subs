we do have a a temporary light that is

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.670 
we do have a a temporary light that is
on<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.690> wall<00:02:48.930> here<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.560> pull-string<00:02:49.850> and

we<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.830> do<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.069> benzene<00:02:53.400> in<00:02:53.580> here<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:54.000> this

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
we can do the benzene in here to this

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.259 
we can do the benzene in here to this
event<00:02:55.170> types<00:02:55.590> are<00:02:55.769> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> turn<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.640> the

have another pipe over here on this side
and<00:03:16.170> eventually<00:03:16.620> we'll<00:03:16.769> put<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:16.950> little<00:03:17.070> wash

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
and eventually we'll put a little wash

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.280 
and eventually we'll put a little wash
station<00:03:17.760> in<00:03:17.880> here<00:03:18.150> that's<00:03:18.720> what<00:03:18.930> will<00:03:19.079> drain

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
station in here that's what will drain

weather<00:03:25.980> in<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.190> winter<00:03:27.319> we<00:03:28.319> made<00:03:28.500> it<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:28.650> a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
weather in the winter we made it just a

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.460 
weather in the winter we made it just a
little<00:03:28.920> bigger<00:03:29.340> than<00:03:29.609> we<00:03:29.700> proposed<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:31.200> start

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
little bigger than we proposed to start

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.870 
little bigger than we proposed to start
with<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:32.069> was<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.400> matter<00:03:32.549> of<00:03:32.700> fitting

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
with it was just a matter of fitting

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.509 
with it was just a matter of fitting
with<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.090> ground<00:03:33.359> and<00:03:33.540> working<00:03:33.840> with<00:03:34.019> it<00:03:34.519> as

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
with the ground and working with it as

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.670 
with the ground and working with it as
we<00:03:35.850> can<00:03:36.000> see<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.299> contour<00:03:36.750> we<00:03:37.260> follow<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
we can see it a contour we follow the

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.470 
we can see it a contour we follow the
contour<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.220> existing<00:03:38.700> slope<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.239> here

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
contour of the existing slope in here

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.539 
contour of the existing slope in here
and<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.720> didn't<00:03:39.900> use<00:03:39.989> any<00:03:40.200> forms<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.340> doing

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
and we didn't use any forms and doing

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.300 
and we didn't use any forms and doing
the<00:03:41.639> concrete<00:03:42.060> footings<00:03:42.650> but<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.980> turned<00:03:44.190> out

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
the concrete footings but it turned out

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.960 
the concrete footings but it turned out
20<00:03:44.850> feet<00:03:45.060> deep<00:03:45.269> 18<00:03:46.049> feet<00:03:46.290> wide<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:47.700> gives<00:03:47.880> us

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
20 feet deep 18 feet wide that gives us

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.330 
20 feet deep 18 feet wide that gives us
about<00:03:48.200> 360<00:03:49.200> square<00:03:49.410> feet<00:03:49.739> which<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:49.980> about

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
about 360 square feet which is about

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.050 
about 360 square feet which is about
fifteen<00:03:50.819> dollars<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.239> square<00:03:51.600> foot<00:03:53.060> finished

to all these vertical post i don't think

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.030 
to all these vertical post i don't think
i<00:03:59.910> mentioned<00:04:00.150> there<00:04:00.450> they<00:04:01.139> get<00:04:01.319> extra<00:04:01.620> support

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
i mentioned there they get extra support

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.800 
i mentioned there they get extra support
just<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.180> case<00:04:03.560> at<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.799> shell<00:04:05.010> shape<00:04:05.660> like<00:04:06.660> an
