00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:07.830
 Hello dear friends with you lie and 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 in this video I will review 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:20.330
 audi a4 1 24 from valve is already on the bill 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:26.730
 third edition and i think is good 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:30.300
 my model is good so here and to 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:35.130
 video about the difference from the 24 headquarters that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.140
 I already have it does not turn 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.469
 wheels 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.239
 so you believe that 24 scale can 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:50.550
 turn the wheels now I'm you 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:55.440
 I will show for example the genie bar which I 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:59.460
 bought me the next wheel shop in the morning 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:08.850
 black but they turn this here 24 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:11.549
 scale is 20 scale flour I lost 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:16.290
 a jeep who still wanted to show well 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:19.950
 okay this is audi a4 as i said 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 watercolors and I finally figured out with 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.700
 I had my photo camera all the time 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 so as that is your name 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.590
 finally I was able to deal with 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.799
 settings now everything is fine on 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.400
 in fact, it is much closer. 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.860
 ok opening parts door open 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 and they open for glass 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.799
 it's weird here the glass they open 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.649
 for these mirrors 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.149
 they are completely iron they are very 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 shrimp so you can open them 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:02.399
 still opening the promo tour and what 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.080
 I can not say about the Moravian usually 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.479
 plastics laid 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:15.510
 the trunk does not open for it already 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:18.510
 would be 24 scale no ok here he is 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:24.150
 stepped over to the front end 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:28.470
 before in my ugly well at all i'm not on 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.510
 saudi a4 on headlamps so well located 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.690
 four numbers on it seems some narrow 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.830
 excuse me for apologizing of course well ka 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.780
 you angle like an elephant narrow-eyed therefore 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.850
 She then has her these bits of glass 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.930
 arranged everything so it seems 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:52.709
 some weird 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:57.270
 very country still walks the body of it 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:01.230
 completely grieved well and the backside does not go 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.350
 it pleased me and generally I can 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.100
 tell us about modelka modelka ok 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:14.910
 fulfilled only I buy it buy 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:17.420
 here is a scuff try oh well 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.519
 everything just got worse 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.190
 Well, here here are scuffs and still here 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.750
 here the scuff she last was her 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.060
 she really wanted to buy me very 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.709
 joyfully over and over again disliked 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.780
 due to the fact that they do not turn 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:41.430
 wheels so would it be awesome model 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:46.830
 what else to say ass from the castle 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:49.340
 real 4 meaning he looks like he looks like 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.340
 before 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:57.980
 but fog as she always salon 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:07.430
 not so 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:10.159
 Of course damn everything is dark everything is dark but I 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.470
 I'll just tell you in the salon is very 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.310
 only good in very dark colors 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:26.530
 so you don't see him almost 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:26.530
 cute and very stupid they forgot the coat of arms but 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.470
 ordinary plastic tried to express 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.789
 any such lines everyones tried 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.039
 cut but it seems to me not very 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:38.870
 It turned out why here is all 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:43.130
 turns to normal color 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:48.580
 Odessa black painted okay well 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:52.160
