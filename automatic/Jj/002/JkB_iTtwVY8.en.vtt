ergonomic studies you have your

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600 
ergonomic studies you have your
prototype<00:00:44.840> you<00:00:45.410> print<00:00:45.740> your<00:00:45.890> prototype<00:00:46.400> and

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
prototype you print your prototype and

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.940 
prototype you print your prototype and
then<00:00:47.210> you<00:00:47.330> place<00:00:47.630> that<00:00:47.660> prototype<00:00:48.290> in<00:00:48.680> its

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
then you place that prototype in its

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.070 
then you place that prototype in its
working<00:00:49.310> environment<00:00:49.820> to<00:00:49.970> see<00:00:50.210> how<00:00:50.480> the
