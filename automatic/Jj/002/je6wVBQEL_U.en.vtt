very disappointing performance in that
first<00:00:12.250> half<00:00:12.460> I<00:00:12.670> liked<00:00:12.910> how<00:00:13.030> it<00:00:13.059> came<00:00:13.599> out<00:00:13.750> of

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:13.870 
first half I liked how it came out of

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.390 
first half I liked how it came out of
the<00:00:13.960> gate<00:00:14.110> strong<00:00:14.290> we<00:00:14.860> created<00:00:15.190> a<00:00:15.220> lot<00:00:15.370> of

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:15.400 
the gate strong we created a lot of

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.300 
the gate strong we created a lot of
chances<00:00:15.550> in<00:00:16.000> those<00:00:16.269> first<00:00:16.869> 20<00:00:17.050> minutes<00:00:17.289> but<00:00:17.650> we

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:18.310 
chances in those first 20 minutes but we

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.460 
chances in those first 20 minutes but we
just<00:00:18.460> didn't<00:00:18.759> get<00:00:18.880> a<00:00:18.909> goal<00:00:19.169> really<00:00:20.169> bugged<00:00:20.380> me

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
just didn't get a goal really bugged me

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.859 
just didn't get a goal really bugged me
how<00:00:20.679> Alexis<00:00:21.400> Sanchez<00:00:21.789> has<00:00:21.939> had<00:00:22.089> chances<00:00:22.599> Aaron

chances<00:00:25.390> it<00:00:25.929> should<00:00:26.439> have<00:00:26.560> been<00:00:26.679> 2<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:27.249> 3<00:00:27.519> no

before a crystal policy even had their

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.710 
before a crystal policy even had their
goal<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.310> that's<00:00:30.519> very<00:00:30.729> just<00:00:30.939> disappointing

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
goal and that's very just disappointing

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.950 
goal and that's very just disappointing
that<00:00:31.810> we've<00:00:31.929> let<00:00:32.110> them<00:00:32.259> back<00:00:32.439> into<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.800> game

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960

Crystal<00:00:34.960> Palace<00:00:35.260> have<00:00:35.559> been<00:00:35.739> dangerous

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
Crystal Palace have been dangerous

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.180 
Crystal Palace have been dangerous
I<00:00:36.789> have<00:00:37.269> liked<00:00:37.539> how<00:00:37.750> Bella<00:00:38.410> and<00:00:38.769> Mario<00:00:39.129> have

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
I have liked how Bella and Mario have

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.160 
I have liked how Bella and Mario have
played<00:00:39.850> against<00:00:40.149> our<00:00:40.269> danger<00:00:40.660> men<00:00:40.840> and<00:00:41.050> in

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
played against our danger men and in

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.860 
played against our danger men and in
terms<00:00:41.379> of<00:00:41.559> blasting<00:00:42.070> Zaha<00:00:42.550> I<00:00:42.789> thought<00:00:43.359> we're

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
terms of blasting Zaha I thought we're

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.930 
terms of blasting Zaha I thought we're
nullifying<00:00:44.410> the<00:00:44.440> main<00:00:45.070> point<00:00:45.519> of<00:00:45.609> attack

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
nullifying the main point of attack

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.020 
nullifying the main point of attack
however<00:00:46.809> on<00:00:47.079> their<00:00:47.289> goal<00:00:47.730> terrible<00:00:48.730> team

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
however on their goal terrible team

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.419 
however on their goal terrible team
defending<00:00:49.629> and<00:00:49.839> what<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.260> mean<00:00:50.469> by<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.649> is<00:00:51.039> the

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
defending and what I mean by that is the

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:53.340 
defending and what I mean by that is the
commitment<00:00:51.940> to<00:00:52.030> defend<00:00:52.390> was<00:00:52.629> just<00:00:52.899> not<00:00:53.079> there

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
commitment to defend was just not there

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.660 
commitment to defend was just not there
it<00:00:53.859> started<00:00:54.370> with<00:00:54.550> Aaron<00:00:55.030> Ramsey<00:00:55.269> diving<00:00:55.960> in

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it started with Aaron Ramsey diving in

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.389 
it started with Aaron Ramsey diving in
needlessly<00:00:58.079> Claire<00:00:59.079> easily<00:00:59.739> gets<00:00:59.949> around<00:01:00.219> him

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
needlessly Claire easily gets around him

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.110 
needlessly Claire easily gets around him
crosses<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.539> ball<00:01:01.719> in<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:02.170> then<00:01:02.739> we<00:01:03.370> don't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
crosses the ball in and then we don't

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.680 
crosses the ball in and then we don't
clear<00:01:04.420> it<00:01:04.510> very<00:01:04.750> well<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.140> drops<00:01:05.590> back<00:01:05.920> to

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
clear it very well it drops back to

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.350 
clear it very well it drops back to
their<00:01:07.690> right<00:01:07.930> back<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.350> these<00:01:08.440> scores<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:09.360> you

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
their right back in these scores and you

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.030 
their right back in these scores and you
can't<00:01:10.570> really<00:01:10.750> put<00:01:10.960> that<00:01:11.110> on<00:01:11.260> defenders<00:01:11.860> you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
can't really put that on defenders you

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.640 
can't really put that on defenders you
have<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.280> put<00:01:12.460> that<00:01:12.610> on<00:01:12.880> our<00:01:12.910> midfielders<00:01:13.690> not

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 
have to put that on our midfielders not

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.370 
have to put that on our midfielders not
closing<00:01:14.920> down<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.580> I<00:01:16.510> believe<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> reason

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
closing down and I believe the reason

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
closing down and I believe the reason
for<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:18.960> offensively<00:01:19.960> we're<00:01:20.320> playing

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
for that is offensively we're playing

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.450 
for that is offensively we're playing
özil<00:01:21.970> Ramsey<00:01:22.660> Sanchez<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.560> interchangeable

özil Ramsey Sanchez and interchangeable

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.030 
özil Ramsey Sanchez and interchangeable
rules<00:01:24.960> however<00:01:25.960> when<00:01:26.680> you<00:01:26.740> have<00:01:26.890> those

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
rules however when you have those

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.570 
rules however when you have those
interchangeable<00:01:27.790> rolls<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:29.440> put<00:01:30.130> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
interchangeable rolls and you put the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.580 
interchangeable rolls and you put the
defensive<00:01:31.090> coverages<00:01:31.630> with<00:01:31.810> that<00:01:31.990> sometimes

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
defensive coverages with that sometimes

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.980 
defensive coverages with that sometimes
things<00:01:33.340> get<00:01:33.520> mixed<00:01:33.820> up<00:01:33.940> so<00:01:34.180> if<00:01:34.300> Aaron<00:01:34.570> Ramsey's

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
things get mixed up so if Aaron Ramsey's

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.900 
things get mixed up so if Aaron Ramsey's
playing<00:01:35.290> the<00:01:35.440> middle<00:01:35.710> Moses<00:01:36.520> playing<00:01:36.760> out

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:36.910 
playing the middle Moses playing out

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.330 
playing the middle Moses playing out
wide<00:01:37.120> they<00:01:37.900> don't<00:01:38.080> necessarily<00:01:38.620> play<00:01:38.800> their

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
wide they don't necessarily play their

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.700 
wide they don't necessarily play their
defensive<00:01:39.880> coverages<00:01:40.300> and<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:41.110> was<00:01:41.290> a<00:01:41.320> parent

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
defensive coverages and I was a parent

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.680 
defensive coverages and I was a parent
on<00:01:41.920> their<00:01:42.100> goal<00:01:42.310> Aaron<00:01:42.670> Ramsey<00:01:42.820> lets<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
on their goal Aaron Ramsey lets the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.360 
on their goal Aaron Ramsey lets the
player<00:01:43.870> across<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.440> in<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.770> then<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:45.040> Alexis

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
player across it in and then the Alexis

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.970 
player across it in and then the Alexis
Sanchez<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.850> playing<00:01:46.120> in<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.270> middle<00:01:46.980> his

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
Sanchez is playing in the middle his

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.250 
Sanchez is playing in the middle his
defensive<00:01:48.520> coverage<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:49.150> that<00:01:49.180> wing<00:01:49.690> back<00:01:49.930> and

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
defensive coverage is that wing back and

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.350 
defensive coverage is that wing back and
he<00:01:50.830> did<00:01:50.980> not<00:01:51.070> follow<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.670> and<00:01:51.940> they<00:01:52.120> end<00:01:52.270> up

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
he did not follow that and they end up

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.380 
he did not follow that and they end up
scoring<00:01:52.630> goal<00:01:52.960> I<00:01:53.230> mean<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.820> tough<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.210> say

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
scoring goal I mean it's tough to say

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:56.790 
scoring goal I mean it's tough to say
question<00:01:55.900> marks<00:01:56.140> would<00:01:56.230> check<00:01:56.500> with<00:01:56.530> their

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
question marks would check with their

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.200 
question marks would check with their
goal<00:01:58.260> could<00:01:59.260> he<00:01:59.350> have<00:01:59.470> done<00:01:59.590> a<00:01:59.650> little<00:01:59.860> better
