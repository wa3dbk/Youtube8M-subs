00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you guys so I thought that first of all

I'll tell you what nutribullet tell us

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.110 
I'll tell you what nutribullet tell us
so<00:00:31.230> I've<00:00:31.439> got<00:00:31.619> notes<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.070> for<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.369> they<00:00:32.850> say

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
so I've got notes here for you they say

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.450 
so I've got notes here for you they say
that<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.390> neither<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:34.079> juicer<00:00:34.590> or<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.920> blender

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
that it is neither a juicer or a blender

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.000 
that it is neither a juicer or a blender
it's<00:00:35.640> an<00:00:35.820> extractor<00:00:36.780> whatever<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.230> means<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
it's an extractor whatever that means it

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's an extractor whatever that means it
retains<00:00:38.340> nutrients<00:00:38.850> while<00:00:39.570> breaking<00:00:40.170> down

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
retains nutrients while breaking down

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.750 
retains nutrients while breaking down
the<00:00:40.469> fiber<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.190> breaks<00:00:41.340> down<00:00:41.520> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
the fiber because it breaks down the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.209 
the fiber because it breaks down the
stems<00:00:42.030> seeds<00:00:42.480> skins<00:00:43.020> etc<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.770> release<00:00:43.980> more

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
stems seeds skins etc to release more

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.170 
stems seeds skins etc to release more
nutrients<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.210> it's<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:46.520> blender<00:00:47.520> juicer

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
nutrients so it's like a blender juicer

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.990 
nutrients so it's like a blender juicer
hybrid<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.170> extractor<00:00:49.860> ever<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.250> means<00:00:50.460> so

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
hybrid and extractor ever that means so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.340 
hybrid and extractor ever that means so
that's<00:00:51.149> what<00:00:51.329> they<00:00:51.449> say<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.079> see<00:00:52.230> what

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
that's what they say so you see what

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.189 
that's what they say so you see what
they<00:00:52.440> put<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.890> package<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.420> this

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
they put in the package you get this

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
they put in the package you get this
little<00:00:56.070> bugger<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> base<00:00:57.300> of

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
little bugger which is like the base of

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.450 
little bugger which is like the base of
the<00:00:57.870> nutribullet<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> base<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
the nutribullet this is the base that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.189 
the nutribullet this is the base that
you<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.670> everything<00:00:59.850> else<00:01:00.030> on<00:01:00.210> top<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.629> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
you put everything else on top of it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.290 
you put everything else on top of it's
quite<00:01:01.410> small<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> head<00:01:02.640> comparison

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
quite small this is a head comparison

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.570 
quite small this is a head comparison
for<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.530> get<00:01:04.619> three<00:01:04.949> different<00:01:04.979> size

cups you get a big cup and then two

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.980 
cups you get a big cup and then two
smaller<00:01:08.520> cups<00:01:08.820> sort<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.420> them<00:01:09.510> with<00:01:09.600> handles

smaller cups sort of them with handles

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
smaller cups sort of them with handles
some<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.380> handles<00:01:10.830> get<00:01:11.070> some<00:01:11.369> Screaming

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
some of that handles get some Screaming

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.859 
some of that handles get some Screaming
lids<00:01:12.210> some<00:01:13.140> screw<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.890> handles<00:01:14.570> another<00:01:15.570> lid

nutribullet for about a week and I've

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.349 
nutribullet for about a week and I've
made<00:02:16.980> three<00:02:17.400> drinks<00:02:17.790> of<00:02:17.879> it<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.180> how<00:02:18.299> about

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
made three drinks of it so how about

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.000

that<00:02:18.659> much<00:02:18.810> experience<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.379> yet<00:02:19.530> but<00:02:19.560> I<00:02:19.739> can

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that much experience of it yet but I can

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.399 
that much experience of it yet but I can
give<00:02:20.189> you<00:02:20.370> my<00:02:20.609> first<00:02:20.790> impressions<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.659> used<00:02:22.290> to

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
give you my first impressions I used to

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.440 
give you my first impressions I used to
use<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.769> food<00:02:23.099> processor<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.939> make<00:02:24.120> my

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
use a food processor to make my

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.869 
use a food processor to make my
smoothies<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.200> my<00:02:25.349> drinks<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> this

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
smoothies and my drinks and this

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.440 
smoothies and my drinks and this
produces<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.720> much<00:02:28.489> smoother<00:02:29.489> fluffier

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
produces a much smoother fluffier

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.440 
produces a much smoother fluffier
creamier<00:02:31.290> sort<00:02:31.620> of<00:02:31.680> drink<00:02:31.920> so<00:02:32.370> to<00:02:33.060> me<00:02:33.180> that's<00:02:33.299> a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
creamier sort of drink so to me that's a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.420 
creamier sort of drink so to me that's a
benefit<00:02:33.840> it's<00:02:34.530> thinner<00:02:34.920> than<00:02:35.040> my<00:02:35.250> usual

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
benefit it's thinner than my usual

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.399 
benefit it's thinner than my usual
smoothies<00:02:35.939> I<00:02:36.090> do<00:02:36.150> quite<00:02:36.389> like<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.629> thick<00:02:36.959> chunky

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:37.409 
smoothies I do quite like a thick chunky

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.319 
smoothies I do quite like a thick chunky
smoothie<00:02:37.829> another<00:02:38.129> benefit<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.700> would<00:02:38.849> say<00:02:39.060> is

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
smoothie another benefit I would say is

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.020 
smoothie another benefit I would say is
that<00:02:39.750> it's<00:02:39.930> really<00:02:40.139> compact<00:02:40.590> like<00:02:41.370> my<00:02:41.730> food

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
that it's really compact like my food

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.599 
that it's really compact like my food
processor<00:02:42.180> is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:43.109> bad<00:02:43.470> boy<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.950> is<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.340> Beast

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
processor is a bad boy it is the Beast

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.879 
processor is a bad boy it is the Beast
and<00:02:44.970> my<00:02:45.359> previous<00:02:45.569> blender<00:02:46.079> was<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.260> bigger<00:02:46.650> as

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
and my previous blender was a bigger as

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.490 
and my previous blender was a bigger as
well<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:47.639> this<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.060> actually<00:02:48.450> much<00:02:48.629> more<00:02:48.870> small

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
well so this is actually much more small

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.399 
well so this is actually much more small
and<00:02:49.709> compact<00:02:49.829> so<00:02:50.340> much<00:02:50.939> easier<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.329> like<00:02:51.510> move

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
and compact so much easier to like move

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.929 
and compact so much easier to like move
around<00:02:52.439> not<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.189> I'm<00:02:53.310> moving<00:02:53.459> around<00:02:53.700> much

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
around not that I'm moving around much

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.179 
around not that I'm moving around much
with<00:02:54.150> math<00:02:54.329> nutribullet<00:02:54.959> another<00:02:55.530> benefit<00:02:56.010> is

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:56.189 
with math nutribullet another benefit is

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:58.520 
with math nutribullet another benefit is
its<00:02:56.400> easy<00:02:56.669> to<00:02:57.030> clean<00:02:57.359> you<00:02:58.019> literally<00:02:58.230> just<00:02:58.379> put

make a drink and then grab it and walk

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.409 
make a drink and then grab it and walk
out<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> door<00:03:25.979> not<00:03:26.729> something<00:03:27.030> that<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.209> tend

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
out the door not something that I tend

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:28.789 
out the door not something that I tend
to<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.810> often<00:03:28.139> but<00:03:28.290> if<00:03:28.409> you're<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.620> sort

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to do that often but if you're the sort

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.530 
to do that often but if you're the sort
of<00:03:28.829> person<00:03:28.889> who<00:03:29.250> needs<00:03:29.669> a<00:03:29.790> quick<00:03:30.000> breakfast<00:03:30.419> in

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
of person who needs a quick breakfast in

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.729 
of person who needs a quick breakfast in
the<00:03:30.599> morning<00:03:30.900> then<00:03:31.409> that's<00:03:31.560> probably

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
the morning then that's probably

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.379 
the morning then that's probably
actually<00:03:32.159> really<00:03:32.400> useful<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.090> just<00:03:33.329> to

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
actually really useful for you just to

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.449 
actually really useful for you just to
be<00:03:33.479> able<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.780> grab<00:03:34.169> it<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.409> go<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:35.190> for<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
be able to grab it and go so for the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.649 
be able to grab it and go so for the
nutribullet<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:36.120> whole<00:03:36.239> thing<00:03:36.449> with<00:03:36.569> all

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
nutribullet the whole thing with all

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.629 
nutribullet the whole thing with all
these<00:03:36.780> things<00:03:37.049> inside<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.680> I<00:03:37.859> think<00:03:38.459> it's

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
these things inside it I think it's

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.059 
these things inside it I think it's
about<00:03:38.790> 99<00:03:39.359> pounds<00:03:39.599> which<00:03:40.049> I<00:03:40.290> personally<00:03:40.859> think

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
about 99 pounds which I personally think

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.240 
about 99 pounds which I personally think
isn't<00:03:41.849> a<00:03:42.000> bad<00:03:42.299> deal<00:03:42.659> it's<00:03:43.530> actually<00:03:43.859> cool<00:03:44.010> to

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
isn't a bad deal it's actually cool to

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.080 
isn't a bad deal it's actually cool to
me<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.519> quite<00:03:44.669> expensive

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
me it's quite expensive

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.000 
me it's quite expensive
that's<00:03:45.239> what<00:03:45.359> sounds<00:03:45.540> like<00:03:45.569> a<00:03:45.659> poor<00:03:46.010> graduate

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
that's what sounds like a poor graduate

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.849 
that's what sounds like a poor graduate
but<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:48.060> think<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.930> is<00:03:49.019> worth<00:03:49.260> it<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.769> the

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
but I think it is worth it for the

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.219 
but I think it is worth it for the
quality<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> you<00:03:50.459> get<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:51.299> don't<00:03:51.479> need<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.049> I

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:52.229 
quality that you get you don't need it I

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.809 
quality that you get you don't need it I
could<00:03:52.500> survive<00:03:52.859> just<00:03:53.400> with<00:03:53.489> my<00:03:53.609> food

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
could survive just with my food

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.939 
could survive just with my food
processor<00:03:54.269> and<00:03:54.419> make<00:03:54.569> good<00:03:54.900> drinks<00:03:55.079> but<00:03:55.919> I

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
processor and make good drinks but I

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.800 
processor and make good drinks but I
think<00:03:56.340> it<00:03:56.579> makes<00:03:56.790> really<00:03:57.120> nice<00:03:57.329> good<00:03:57.689> quality

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
think it makes really nice good quality

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.479 
think it makes really nice good quality
drinks<00:03:58.409> and<00:03:58.530> it's<00:03:58.620> a<00:03:58.680> nice<00:03:58.859> little<00:03:58.889> gadget<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
drinks and it's a nice little gadget to

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:00.920 
drinks and it's a nice little gadget to
have<00:03:59.639> so<00:03:59.849> I<00:03:59.879> haven't<00:04:00.090> blood<00:04:00.299> that<00:04:00.479> I<00:04:00.510> have<00:04:00.750> it

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
have so I haven't blood that I have it

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.390 
have so I haven't blood that I have it
so<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.409> need<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.590> build<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.889> make<00:04:02.010> these<00:04:02.159> claims

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
so it need to build it make these claims

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.619 
so it need to build it make these claims
that<00:04:02.699> it's<00:04:02.819> some<00:04:03.030> sort<00:04:03.180> of<00:04:03.299> nutritional

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629 
that it's some sort of nutritional

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.080 
that it's some sort of nutritional
powerhouse<00:04:04.079> that<00:04:04.650> keeps<00:04:04.889> all<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.609> nutrition

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
powerhouse that keeps all the nutrition

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.449 
powerhouse that keeps all the nutrition
intact<00:04:06.479> and<00:04:06.840> gives<00:04:07.229> you<00:04:07.379> super<00:04:07.739> food<00:04:07.949> drinks

intact and gives you super food drinks
this<00:04:08.609> that<00:04:08.819> neither<00:04:09.000> I<00:04:09.299> don't<00:04:09.509> necessarily

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
this that neither I don't necessarily

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:11.119 
this that neither I don't necessarily
know<00:04:09.959> about<00:04:10.079> these<00:04:10.290> nutrition<00:04:10.739> benefits

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
know about these nutrition benefits

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.439 
know about these nutrition benefits
whether<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.579> giving<00:04:11.790> me<00:04:11.879> more<00:04:12.030> nutrition

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:12.449 
whether it is giving me more nutrition

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:13.879 
whether it is giving me more nutrition
than<00:04:12.569> I<00:04:12.629> was<00:04:12.750> getting<00:04:13.049> with<00:04:13.169> my<00:04:13.229> drinks<00:04:13.680> from<00:04:13.769> a

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
than I was getting with my drinks from a

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:14.809 
than I was getting with my drinks from a
food<00:04:14.069> processor

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
food processor

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.550 
food processor
I<00:04:14.849> can't<00:04:15.209> reliably<00:04:15.449> test<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.169> or<00:04:16.349> let<00:04:16.500> you

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
I can't reliably test that or let you

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.469 
I can't reliably test that or let you
know<00:04:16.680> if<00:04:16.799> that's<00:04:16.979> true<00:04:17.279> but<00:04:17.579> if<00:04:17.909> it<00:04:18.090> does<00:04:18.269> do

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
know if that's true but if it does do

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:19.530 
know if that's true but if it does do
that<00:04:18.510> then

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
that then

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.450 
that then
right<00:04:19.720> for<00:04:20.200> me<00:04:20.290> the<00:04:20.410> only<00:04:20.560> drawback<00:04:21.160> for<00:04:21.370> the

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
right for me the only drawback for the

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.130 
right for me the only drawback for the
nutribullet<00:04:21.730> is<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.480> can't<00:04:22.690> make<00:04:22.840> nut

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
nutribullet is that you can't make nut

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.240 
nutribullet is that you can't make nut
butters<00:04:23.410> with<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.710> which<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:23.860> something<00:04:24.130> that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
butters with it which is something that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.460 
butters with it which is something that
my<00:04:24.430> food<00:04:24.640> process<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.210> could<00:04:25.480> do<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.990> could<00:04:26.350> just

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
my food process I could do I could just

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:27.810 
my food process I could do I could just
keep<00:04:26.590> blending<00:04:26.800> up<00:04:27.160> some<00:04:27.280> nuts<00:04:27.430> and<00:04:27.610> nuts<00:04:27.760> and

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
keep blending up some nuts and nuts and

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.220 
keep blending up some nuts and nuts and
eventually<00:04:28.270> it<00:04:28.330> turns<00:04:28.510> into<00:04:28.630> a<00:04:28.720> nice<00:04:28.900> creamy

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
eventually it turns into a nice creamy

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.290 
eventually it turns into a nice creamy
butter<00:04:29.470> but<00:04:30.220> from<00:04:30.640> what<00:04:30.820> I've<00:04:30.940> read<00:04:31.120> online

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
butter but from what I've read online

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.820 
butter but from what I've read online
apparently<00:04:32.020> you're<00:04:32.290> not<00:04:32.380> supposed<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.710> do

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
apparently you're not supposed to do

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.590 
apparently you're not supposed to do
that<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.190> chew<00:04:33.340> bullet<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.150> that's<00:04:34.480> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
that and you chew bullet so that's the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.750 
that and you chew bullet so that's the
only<00:04:34.780> drawback<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.410> only<00:04:35.650> tool<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.670> I<00:04:36.700> think

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
only drawback the only tool that I think

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.850 
only drawback the only tool that I think
it<00:04:37.090> misses<00:04:37.450> being<00:04:37.690> able<00:04:37.810> to<00:04:37.930> make<00:04:38.170> a<00:04:38.380> nice<00:04:38.530> nut

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
it misses being able to make a nice nut

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.650 
it misses being able to make a nice nut
butter<00:04:39.040> on<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.670> whole<00:04:39.850> I<00:04:39.880> think<00:04:40.000> I<00:04:40.240> give<00:04:40.420> the

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
butter on the whole I think I give the
