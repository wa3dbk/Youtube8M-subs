solve it well I see three problems okay

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.070 
solve it well I see three problems okay
number<00:00:14.280> one<00:00:14.400> problem<00:00:15.389> that<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.630> see<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.900> getting

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
number one problem that I see is getting

number one problem that I see is getting
traffic<00:00:16.470> okay<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.000> really<00:00:18.060> hard<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
traffic okay it's not really hard to

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
traffic okay it's not really hard to
build<00:00:18.690> your<00:00:18.840> own<00:00:18.930> site<00:00:19.289> stuff<00:00:20.070> like<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.279> but

when<00:00:22.050> people<00:00:22.320> do<00:00:22.619> they<00:00:22.859> don't<00:00:23.010> know<00:00:23.070> how<00:00:23.220> to

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
when people do they don't know how to

when people do they don't know how to
get<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.670> consistent<00:00:23.939> flow<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.359> traffic<00:00:24.539> now<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
get a consistent flow of traffic now I

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.859 
get a consistent flow of traffic now I
do<00:00:25.289> know<00:00:25.710> people<00:00:26.029> that<00:00:27.029> will<00:00:27.330> get<00:00:27.570> traffic

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
do know people that will get traffic

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.779 
do know people that will get traffic
here<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.830> I'll<00:00:28.949> stop<00:00:29.250> I'll<00:00:29.429> get<00:00:29.580> traffic

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
here and then I'll stop I'll get traffic

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.959 
here and then I'll stop I'll get traffic
here<00:00:30.240> and<00:00:30.420> then<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.660> stop<00:00:30.720> and<00:00:31.880> when<00:00:32.880> they

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
here and then it will stop and when they

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.639 
here and then it will stop and when they
do<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.300> that<00:00:33.450> traffic<00:00:33.870> they<00:00:34.200> don't<00:00:34.380> know<00:00:34.500> how

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
do get that traffic they don't know how

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.500 
do get that traffic they don't know how
to<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:35.219> number<00:00:35.460> two<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.000> turn<00:00:36.300> them<00:00:36.420> into

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to do number two which is turn them into

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.440 
to do number two which is turn them into
leads<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.790> once<00:00:38.790> they<00:00:38.879> get<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> leads<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
leads and once they get the leads you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.030 
leads and once they get the leads you
don't<00:00:39.570> know<00:00:39.629> how<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.780> convert<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.320> leads<00:00:40.620> okay

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
don't know how to convert the leads okay

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.100 
don't know how to convert the leads okay
so<00:00:41.100> there's<00:00:41.969> two<00:00:42.149> problems<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.629> coincide

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
so there's two problems that coincide

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.260 
so there's two problems that coincide
there<00:00:43.410> okay<00:00:44.280> and<00:00:44.460> then<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.640> know<00:00:44.760> other<00:00:45.030> people

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
there okay and then I know other people

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.540 
there okay and then I know other people
that<00:00:45.300> don't<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:46.110> basic<00:00:46.710> stuff<00:00:47.280> about

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that don't really know basic stuff about

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.060 
that don't really know basic stuff about
how<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> build<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> website<00:00:48.270> or<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.719> blog<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.260> so

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
how to build a website or a blog and so

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.680 
how to build a website or a blog and so
that's<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> third<00:00:50.550> problem<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.059> scene<00:00:51.329> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that's the third problem that a scene so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
that's the third problem that a scene so
this<00:00:52.620> office<00:00:53.010> together<00:00:53.190> if<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.640> don't<00:00:53.789> know

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
this office together if you don't know

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.119 
this office together if you don't know
how<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.480> all<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:55.050> basic<00:00:55.500> things<00:00:55.530> here

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
how to do all these basic things here

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
how to do all these basic things here
which<00:00:56.969> getting<00:00:57.420> traffic<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.199> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
which getting traffic really is it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.709 
which getting traffic really is it's
easy<00:00:59.430> but<00:00:59.640> it's<00:00:59.820> not<00:00:59.969> easy<00:01:00.149> once<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> how

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
easy but it's not easy once you know how

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.709 
easy but it's not easy once you know how
to<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.320> can<00:01:01.440> set<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.920> let<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.070> go

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
to do it you can set it up and let it go

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.670 
to do it you can set it up and let it go
but<00:01:03.719> if<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.260> how<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.559> these

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
but if you don't know how to do these

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.200 
but if you don't know how to do these
three<00:01:04.830> things<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.309> almost<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> chain<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
three things it's almost like a chain a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.530 
three things it's almost like a chain a
chain<00:01:06.750> who's<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:08.369> has<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> missing<00:01:09.090> link<00:01:09.270> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
chain who's that has a missing link and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
chain who's that has a missing link and
if<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.020> has<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> missing<00:01:10.500> link<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.799> can't<00:01:10.979> hold

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
if it has a missing link it can't hold

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.090 
if it has a missing link it can't hold
whatever<00:01:12.000> supposed<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.510> hold<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:13.680> know<00:01:13.799> hold

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
whatever supposed to hold you know hold

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.460 
whatever supposed to hold you know hold
up<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.720> how<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.869> connect<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> change

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
up so how do you connect the change

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.399 
up so how do you connect the change
together<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.189> make<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.970> easy<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:19.080> well

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
together and make this easy for you well

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.350 
together and make this easy for you well
if<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.280> online<00:01:20.460> marketing<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.000> do<00:01:21.180> get<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
consistent flow of traffic and you're

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.890 
consistent flow of traffic and you're
somebody<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.790> consistently<00:01:24.450> sits<00:01:24.750> there

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
somebody that consistently sits there
