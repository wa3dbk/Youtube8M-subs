00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.470
 at the end of my studies I really 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.450
 decided to set up my agency 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.060
 architectured this agency today 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.250
 at 18 I created it in 1995 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.380
 we work as well for the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.130
 tourism by creating hotels of 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.899
 holiday villages 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.489
 we are fortunate to have a 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.170
 luxury clientele to make beds 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.300
 luxury villas that are located in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.059
 Calvi Bastia in Porto-Vecchio and 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.950
 saint-florent if the acquisition of this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 high technology equipment allowed 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.570
 within an agency to change a little 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.980
 our way of working since we have 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.900
 meetings today a lot more 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.970
 friendlier much more effective it is 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.710
 first of all I think a state of mind this 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.350
 state of mind it's really about being 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 innovative and precursor and to be 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 innovative and precursor it could not pass 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.079
 that by acquiring this table this 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.149
 which was really very important that's 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:11.189
 to have the first around my clients 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.990
 and turned around was really very 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.009
 positive since we can summarize it 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.210
 today in three reassuring words 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.210
 efficient and user-friendly 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.960
 it's really a new medium of 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.180
 presentation of your projects and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.460
 your know-how to our customers on 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.990
 intuitive side of the table involves the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.909
 client who becomes the same actor 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.830
 owners of his project this is a 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.970
 tool that helps to be more effective 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.880
 in our work at our meetings 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.890
 agencies and saving time 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.969
 during customer presentations 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.659
 replaces the models that made 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:46.130
 in the old days 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.189
 this tool allows us to improve 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.939
 the interface between the architect is 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:52.119
 structural engineer 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.340
 everyday we are brought to 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:58.310
 implant beams sending to make 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.959
 just hold certain certain 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.359
 projects that are complicated where the 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:04.159
 cantilever including real time is 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:06.349
 modifies the poles the location of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.909
 poles one goes into the beams in 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.289
 according to what architects will say in 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.590
 function of what we need for that 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.379
 it's yours 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.890
 thus one gains in efficiency and 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.890
 time saving 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.430
 so what fascinated me when I 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.959
 I put in situation with my team 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.400
 it's first and foremost the very playful side 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.230
 the barriers are erased between us and 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 the architect so that's really 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.170
 something great 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.849
 we all work on one foot 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.849
 equality in our joint projects 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.670
 a situation that reassures 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.670
 enormously for the project of a lifetime
