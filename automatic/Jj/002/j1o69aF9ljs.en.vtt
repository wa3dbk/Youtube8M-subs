00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
set up now I think I would say is that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.990 
set up now I think I would say is that
be<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.549> I<00:02:00.090> heart<00:02:00.420> makeup<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:02.549> mirror

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
use it for more thing

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.760 
use it for more thing
okay<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.540> when<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.840> put<00:02:14.020> these<00:02:14.110> two<00:02:14.350> pallets

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
okay so when you put these two pallets

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.550 
okay so when you put these two pallets
side-by-side<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.940> can<00:02:16.150> see<00:02:16.390> they<00:02:16.900> are<00:02:16.930> so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
side-by-side you can see they are so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.060 
side-by-side you can see they are so
similar<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.780> exactly<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.380> shades<00:02:20.710> in

one I'm wearing today can tell which of
the<00:02:53.860> pallets<00:02:54.480> well<00:02:55.480> I'm<00:02:55.600> not<00:02:55.750> actually

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
the pallets well I'm not actually

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.530 
the pallets well I'm not actually
wearing<00:02:56.380> either<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.550> them<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:57.880> wearing<00:02:58.270> both

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.510 
exactly the same one in in the other
palette<00:03:10.090> so<00:03:10.630> I've<00:03:10.900> used<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.350> exact<00:03:11.680> same<00:03:11.800> kind

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
palette so I've used the exact same kind

palette so I've used the exact same kind
of<00:03:12.610> shades<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.300> each<00:03:13.510> eye<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.110> I<00:03:14.200> can<00:03:14.380> honestly

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.010 
of shades on each eye and I can honestly
say<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.160> can<00:03:15.520> hardly<00:03:16.030> tell<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.570> difference

ones<00:03:51.730> can<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> little<00:03:52.240> bit<00:03:52.360> hit<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:52.570> miss

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
ones can be a little bit hit and miss

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.300 
ones can be a little bit hit and miss
but<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:53.020> found<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.320> most<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:53.860> shades<00:03:54.100> I've

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
but I found that most of the shades I've

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.480 
but I found that most of the shades I've
used<00:03:54.610> that<00:03:54.820> these<00:03:55.060> are<00:03:55.300> so<00:03:55.510> pigmented<00:03:55.930> and<00:03:56.490> so

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
used that these are so pigmented and so

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.670 
used that these are so pigmented and so
is<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:58.150> definitely<00:03:58.750> worth<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.140> six<00:03:59.500> pound

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
is is definitely worth the six pound

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.340 
is is definitely worth the six pound
fifty<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.310> out<00:04:00.640> of<00:04:01.030> all<00:04:01.270> the<00:04:01.540> you<00:04:01.930> know<00:04:02.080> the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
fifty and out of all the you know the

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.140 
fifty and out of all the you know the
makeup<00:04:02.560> revolutions<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.550> thought<00:04:03.730> makeup<00:04:04.030> one

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
makeup revolutions I thought makeup one

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.370 
makeup revolutions I thought makeup one
that<00:04:04.270> would<00:04:04.390> definitely<00:04:04.720> recommend<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:05.200> get

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
that would definitely recommend to get

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.949 
that would definitely recommend to get
this<00:04:05.560> one<00:04:05.830> if<00:04:06.070> you're<00:04:06.220> unsure<00:04:06.550> on<00:04:07.000> which<00:04:07.300> what

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
this one if you're unsure on which what

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.130 
this one if you're unsure on which what
to<00:04:08.140> get<00:04:08.290> get<00:04:08.560> this<00:04:08.800> one<00:04:09.070> and<00:04:09.690> so<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:10.870> shades

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
to get get this one and so the shades

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.890 
to get get this one and so the shades
are<00:04:11.410> very<00:04:11.620> pigmented<00:04:11.950> on<00:04:12.489> this<00:04:12.820> one<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.630> the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
are very pigmented on this one and the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.630 
are very pigmented on this one and the
only<00:04:14.050> kind<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.739> difference<00:04:15.130> I<00:04:15.280> would<00:04:15.489> say

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
only kind of difference I would say

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:18.090 
only kind of difference I would say
about<00:04:15.940> this<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:17.230> know<00:04:17.320> in<00:04:17.470> comparison<00:04:17.709> to

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
about this and you know in comparison to

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.800 
about this and you know in comparison to
the<00:04:18.340> two-faced<00:04:18.760> ones<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.150> two<00:04:19.299> first<00:04:19.510> ones<00:04:19.690> I

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
the two-faced ones the two first ones I

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.990 
the two-faced ones the two first ones I
will<00:04:19.959> turn<00:04:20.350> a<00:04:20.380> little<00:04:20.530> bit<00:04:20.830> creamier

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
will turn a little bit creamier

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.780 
will turn a little bit creamier
and<00:04:22.090> but<00:04:23.070> it's<00:04:24.070> probably<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.610> big

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
and but it's probably not a big

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.460 
and but it's probably not a big
difference<00:04:25.000> after<00:04:25.690> you've<00:04:25.810> put<00:04:26.020> it<00:04:26.110> on<00:04:26.230> it's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
difference after you've put it on it's

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.330 
difference after you've put it on it's
just<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.830> know<00:04:26.980> working<00:04:27.550> them<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:29.340> the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
