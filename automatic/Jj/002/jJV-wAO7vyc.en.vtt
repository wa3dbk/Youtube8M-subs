let's take crisis to maximum edition for

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.179 
let's take crisis to maximum edition for
example<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.240> has<00:01:48.450> two<00:01:48.689> keys<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.200> say<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.979> say

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
example that has two keys so say you say

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.859 
example that has two keys so say you say
crisis<00:01:50.700> 2<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.149> then<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.420> can<00:01:51.540> either<00:01:51.659> say

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
crisis 2 and then you can either say

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.260 
crisis 2 and then you can either say
origin<00:01:52.350> or<00:01:52.530> steam<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.549> say<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.820> want<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.180> on

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
origin or steam so say I want it on

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
origin or steam so say I want it on
steam<00:01:54.570> i<00:01:54.810> would<00:01:55.200> say<00:01:55.320> crisis<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.890> maximum

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
steam i would say crisis to maximum

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.170 
steam i would say crisis to maximum
edition<00:01:56.579> own<00:01:56.850> steam<00:01:57.210> now<00:01:58.310> be<00:01:59.310> wary<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.850> lot<00:02:00.090> of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
edition own steam now be wary a lot of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.310 
edition own steam now be wary a lot of
you<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:00.390> probably<00:02:00.479> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.110> this

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you are probably going to want all this

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.709 
you are probably going to want all this
stuff<00:02:01.560> on<00:02:01.710> steam<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.759> i<00:02:03.030> guess<00:02:03.240> if<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.509> want<00:02:03.659> a

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
stuff on steam so i guess if you want a

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.209 
stuff on steam so i guess if you want a
better<00:02:03.960> chance<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.380> getting<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.740> maybe<00:02:04.920> get<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
better chance of getting it maybe get it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.850 
better chance of getting it maybe get it
on<00:02:05.340> origin<00:02:05.790> i'm<00:02:05.909> not<00:02:06.060> really<00:02:06.210> sure<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.860> take

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
on origin i'm not really sure and take

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.219 
on origin i'm not really sure and take
your<00:02:08.069> time<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.580> read<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.149> comments<00:02:09.629> maybe

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
your time and read the comments maybe

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.630 
your time and read the comments maybe

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
these games because there's no

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.010 
these games because there's no
take-backs<00:02:17.370> or<00:02:17.640> anything<00:02:18.000> like<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.180> all

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
what that game is honestly but that's

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.490 
what that game is honestly but that's
only<00:02:58.770> available<00:02:59.040> for<00:02:59.550> origin<00:03:00.230> there<00:03:01.230> is

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
battlefield 3 and that's only available

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.950

for<00:03:06.110> for<00:03:07.110> for<00:03:07.530> origin<00:03:07.980> there<00:03:08.910> is<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.330> sims<00:03:09.600> 3

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
for for for origin there is the sims 3

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.680 
for for for origin there is the sims 3
which<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.320> either<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.220> actually<00:03:11.690> download

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
which is either you actually download

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.710 
which is either you actually download
that<00:03:12.900> through<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:14.300> through<00:03:15.300> their<00:03:15.450> website

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
that through the through their website

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.020 
that through the through their website
but<00:03:16.110> I<00:03:16.170> think<00:03:16.410> you<00:03:16.530> can<00:03:16.650> only<00:03:16.770> play<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.280> on<00:03:17.459> own

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
but I think you can only play it on own

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.720 
but I think you can only play it on own
origin<00:03:18.570> and<00:03:18.980> it's<00:03:19.980> also<00:03:20.160> got<00:03:20.430> three

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
origin and it's also got three

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.850 
origin and it's also got three
expansions<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:22.200> guess<00:03:22.380> how<00:03:22.530> that's<00:03:22.709> going

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
expansions and I guess how that's going

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.570 
expansions and I guess how that's going
to<00:03:22.920> work<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.550> that<00:03:23.940> if<00:03:24.300> you<00:03:25.200> get<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.830> sims<00:03:26.130> 3

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
to work is that if you get the sims 3

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.340 
to work is that if you get the sims 3
i'm<00:03:26.820> going<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.090> give<00:03:27.209> you<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.360> expansions<00:03:28.140> and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
i'm going to give you the expansions and

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.650 
i'm going to give you the expansions and
the<00:03:29.070> expansions<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.820> come<00:03:30.150> with<00:03:30.270> that<00:03:30.300> is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
the expansions that come with that is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.040 
the expansions that come with that is
the<00:03:30.959> high<00:03:31.200> end<00:03:31.380> loft<00:03:31.680> stuff<00:03:32.670> late<00:03:33.570> night<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the high end loft stuff late night and

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.210 
the high end loft stuff late night and
date<00:03:34.440> night<00:03:34.970> so<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.239> get<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:37.040> little<00:03:38.040> way<00:03:38.190> i

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
date night so if you get a little way i

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.729 
date night so if you get a little way i

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
took a bow if you get the sims 3 key you

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.530 
took a bow if you get the sims 3 key you
just<00:03:43.950> read<00:03:44.100> em<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.370> on<00:03:44.459> your<00:03:44.640> website<00:03:44.790> and<00:03:45.300> if
