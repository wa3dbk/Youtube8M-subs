stirring<00:02:38.909> the<00:02:39.239> hook<00:02:39.480> I'm<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> give<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.530> a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
stirring the hook I'm going to give it a

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.710 
stirring the hook I'm going to give it a
nice<00:02:40.769> shake<00:02:41.099> then<00:02:41.310> it<00:02:41.430> starts<00:02:41.760> working<00:02:42.569> out

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
nice shake then it starts working out

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
nice shake then it starts working out
all<00:02:42.870> right<00:02:43.019> we've<00:02:43.890> got<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.220> handy<00:02:44.700> pour

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
all right we've got this handy pour

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.030 
all right we've got this handy pour
cover<00:02:45.330> which<00:02:45.599> makes<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.470> lot<00:02:46.650> easier<00:02:47.010> to

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
cover which makes it a lot easier to

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.979 
cover which makes it a lot easier to
pull<00:02:47.280> otherwise<00:02:47.670> it<00:02:47.910> spilled<00:02:48.480> all<00:02:48.690> over<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
pull otherwise it spilled all over the

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.740 
pull otherwise it spilled all over the
place<00:02:49.230> yeah<00:02:50.010> all<00:02:50.819> right<00:02:50.910> any<00:02:51.180> like<00:02:51.480> Darth

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
place yeah all right any like Darth

00:02:51.750 --> 00:04:48.690 
place yeah all right any like Darth
Vader

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.280 

it<00:04:49.700> was<00:04:49.850> at<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:50.180> point<00:04:50.300> that<00:04:50.630> our<00:04:50.810> cameraman

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
it was at this point that our cameraman

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.740 
it was at this point that our cameraman
went<00:04:51.500> AWOL<00:04:52.070> he<00:04:52.970> announced<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.390> there<00:04:53.540> was

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
went AWOL he announced that there was

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.080 
went AWOL he announced that there was
somewhere<00:04:54.290> else<00:04:54.500> and<00:04:54.740> he<00:04:54.830> needed<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.220> be<00:04:55.460> then

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
somewhere else and he needed to be then

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:58.140 
somewhere else and he needed to be then
he<00:04:56.180> put<00:04:56.450> down<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.660> camera<00:04:57.170> took<00:04:57.530> off

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
he put down the camera took off

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.310 
he put down the camera took off
consequently<00:04:59.150> we<00:04:59.480> have<00:04:59.510> no<00:04:59.780> footage<00:05:00.110> of<00:05:00.230> the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
consequently we have no footage of the

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.870 
consequently we have no footage of the
masking<00:05:00.680> tape<00:05:00.710> removal<00:05:01.220> and<00:05:01.430> overspray

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
masking tape removal and overspray

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.600 
masking tape removal and overspray
cleanup<00:05:02.300> which<00:05:03.230> is<00:05:03.470> probably<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.310> good<00:05:04.550> thing

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
cleanup which is probably a good thing

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.180 
cleanup which is probably a good thing
since<00:05:05.210> I<00:05:05.420> cursed<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.990> lot<00:05:06.350> while<00:05:06.680> cleaning<00:05:06.980> up

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
since I cursed a lot while cleaning up

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.400 
since I cursed a lot while cleaning up
all<00:05:07.400> the<00:05:07.610> overspray<00:05:08.060> on<00:05:08.090> the<00:05:08.240> windows<00:05:08.570> for<00:05:09.380> a

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
all the overspray on the windows for a

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.560 
all the overspray on the windows for a
first<00:05:09.800> real<00:05:10.220> experiment<00:05:10.910> with<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.090> last<00:05:11.240> rap

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
first real experiment with the last rap

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.680 
first real experiment with the last rap
it<00:05:11.870> went<00:05:12.230> well<00:05:12.500> my<00:05:13.250> biggest<00:05:13.670> regret<00:05:14.240> was<00:05:14.270> not

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
it went well my biggest regret was not

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.040 
it went well my biggest regret was not
spending<00:05:15.140> more<00:05:15.350> time<00:05:15.620> masking<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.220> windows<00:05:16.580> I

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
spending more time masking the windows I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.390 
spending more time masking the windows I
wasted<00:05:18.050> a<00:05:18.140> lot<00:05:18.170> of<00:05:18.350> time<00:05:18.500> removing<00:05:19.040> a<00:05:19.250> whole

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
wasted a lot of time removing a whole

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.940 
wasted a lot of time removing a whole
lot<00:05:19.520> overspray<00:05:20.060> and<00:05:20.810> my<00:05:21.110> custom<00:05:21.560> mix<00:05:21.740> color

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
lot overspray and my custom mix color

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.710 
lot overspray and my custom mix color
didn't<00:05:22.520> come<00:05:22.640> out<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.940> way<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.060> expected<00:05:23.600> but

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
didn't come out the way I expected but

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.650 
didn't come out the way I expected but
hey<00:05:24.140> that's<00:05:24.500> life<00:05:25.000> next<00:05:26.000> time<00:05:26.240> maybe<00:05:26.450> I'll

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
hey that's life next time maybe I'll

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.800 
hey that's life next time maybe I'll
stick<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.140> color<00:05:27.380> chart<00:05:28.420> yeah

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
stick to the color chart yeah

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.390 
stick to the color chart yeah
it's<00:05:29.930> foolish<00:05:30.440> to<00:05:30.710> dip<00:05:30.890> a<00:05:30.920> car<00:05:31.190> outside

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
it's foolish to dip a car outside

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.910 
it's foolish to dip a car outside
underneath<00:05:32.180> the<00:05:32.270> tree<00:05:32.540> but<00:05:33.260> it's<00:05:33.410> doable

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:33.920 
underneath the tree but it's doable

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.520 
underneath the tree but it's doable
just<00:05:34.820> pick<00:05:35.060> a<00:05:35.090> tree<00:05:35.480> that<00:05:35.660> doesn't<00:05:36.110> drop<00:05:36.470> a

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
just pick a tree that doesn't drop a

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.650 
just pick a tree that doesn't drop a
bunch<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.980> junk<00:05:37.220> and<00:05:37.370> wait<00:05:37.850> for<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.150> day<00:05:38.450> when

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
bunch of junk and wait for a day when

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.600 
bunch of junk and wait for a day when
it's<00:05:38.780> overcast<00:05:39.320> the<00:05:39.680> temperatures<00:05:40.460> were

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610

it's overcast the temperatures were
right<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.030> it's<00:05:41.450> not<00:05:41.720> windy<00:05:42.260> I<00:05:43.030> sprayed

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
right and it's not windy I sprayed

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.000 
right and it's not windy I sprayed
slightly<00:05:44.570> over<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> gallon<00:05:45.260> of<00:05:45.440> last<00:05:45.740> draft

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
slightly over a gallon of last draft

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.000 
slightly over a gallon of last draft
this<00:05:46.790> might<00:05:47.300> be<00:05:47.630> the<00:05:47.900> thinnest<00:05:48.500> coverage<00:05:48.860> that

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
this might be the thinnest coverage that

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.340 
this might be the thinnest coverage that
you<00:05:49.160> can<00:05:49.310> get<00:05:49.400> away<00:05:49.490> with<00:05:49.880> my<00:05:50.810> intent<00:05:51.170> was<00:05:51.320> to

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
you can get away with my intent was to

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.080 
you can get away with my intent was to
come<00:05:51.590> back<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.800> few<00:05:51.950> weeks<00:05:52.280> later<00:05:52.490> and<00:05:52.730> spray<00:05:53.060> a

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
come back a few weeks later and spray a
