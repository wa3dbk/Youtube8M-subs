00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.879
 Gorgeous good day here at gta 5 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.690
 on the playstation 4 my name is around 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.510
 8.8 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.849
 we'll show you now like a military jet 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.840
 clown could be the point was on the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 map displayed 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:21.810
 you have to do something faster 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.720
 We will search for cars and we will if that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.710
 military area spring because you are different 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710
 do not come in 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.700
 important is that they are not somehow 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.190
 I went against Einstein and I turned 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.030
 that we are just above this stone 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.900
 drive that was close but me 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.900
 make it done 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.470
 Now we have to watch that you are with 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.970
 four stars if you are in the area 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.340
 and we have to watch that now 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.300
 Another comes where we said this 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 takes place 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.760
 important is really not too 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:07.050
 many military soldiers in your area 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 or armor because then it will be 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.280
 difficult to roll with the jet 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.350
 right now 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.420
 the feet represent that you are moving 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 remains report on special device with it 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 you do not know each other 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 it has to be easy here 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.100
 star farewell 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.300
 represents 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.420
 then 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.159
 That's up to you 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.390
 In the fall, we are now easy to 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.970
 demonstrate 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.159
 if you like the video 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.700
 then I let or like sent 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:20.280
 improvement suggestions that now too 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.970
 the first video we did 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.970
 the audio 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.320
 such videos would be easy 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.520
 perhaps 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.410
 it's still here that leaves the country 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.410
 to drive everyone out 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 a little bit 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.650
 Law 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.890
 maybe you also need a bit 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.890
 Exercise always works straight away 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.440
 the soldiers also always different 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.440
 are 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.970
 fly or even improve everything 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.190
 super here once formed clearly and 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.150
 I'll show you the second trick for 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:30.810
 beginners in gta 5 online and have to 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.800
 you dare for that and not 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:38.780
 some but the suv those on the 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.730
 lightest stripe recognizes 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.900
 you have to cash in santos so far 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:49.790
 bring and then brings you 9000 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:52.670
 dollar as long as he did not like it 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.860
 and repair him 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:03.810
 but that trick is only me 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:07.980
 just think the method money too 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:14.700
 earn but 1000 are not beginning 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:16.609
 little then you have to that that is the 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.359
 next trip here already in the video 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.609
 does not need her to a geldautomaten 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.270
 but it could be easy 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:30.180
 pay by mobile phone 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:32.340
 So save the way to come now 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.860
 we often get to the next trick 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.380
 problem that your vehicle somewhere 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.720
 have left and that just now 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.669
 is too far away and then you go 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.039
 just on your cell phone and look under 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.340
 contacts and calls the mechanic 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.900
 This will be your vehicle or 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:05:01.600
 personal vehicle on request then 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:05:04.240
 Run moment 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.680
 and then you should do your personal 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.680
 can use the vehicle again 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.619
 that's how we get on with it 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:29.369
 last trick and that has something with 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:33.179
 to do this helicopter and that is it 

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:36.359
 The military helicopter is about to 

00:05:33.179 --> 00:05:40.549
 this because he has a hook under 

00:05:36.359 --> 00:05:47.579
 the first one with the right box 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:51.209
 let down and with the 

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:56.789
 cards you can then cars problems 

00:05:51.209 --> 00:05:58.619
 or believe one looks also the dixi klos 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.139
 but I'll lift that up 

00:05:58.619 --> 00:06:04.829
 Tried and tested also comes in 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:10.289
 a next video but now for the first time 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:13.469
 For the cars, there is a lot 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:15.799
 because it's legal just like that 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:19.469
 to get a car on this hook 

00:06:15.799 --> 00:06:21.899
 The easiest way is if you with the 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:23.310
 makes friends in a closed 

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:26.760
 game session 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:31.380
 new friend just in front of the car 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:33.630
 puts what high voltage in this video 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.880
 I now have the car on 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.510
 thrown a train 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.220
 could do with it what he wanted and 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:44.640
 I thank you for the audience 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.370
 Thank you for leave to watch 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.260
 thumb up there or if you 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:51.530
 it has written suggestions for improvement 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.530
 in the comments
