the the remote is really interesting
it's<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.070> size<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.670> a<00:01:36.150> ps3<00:01:36.780> controller

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it's about the size of a ps3 controller

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.179 
it's about the size of a ps3 controller
and<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> back<00:01:39.110> it's<00:01:40.110> got<00:01:40.470> its

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
and you can see on the back it's got its

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.200 
and you can see on the back it's got its
got<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.579> grooves<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.729> an<00:01:44.729> over

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
here so you can hold it like a ps3

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.240 
here so you can hold it like a ps3
controller<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.490> it's<00:01:50.490> actually<00:01:50.700> pretty

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
controller and it's actually pretty

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.399 
controller and it's actually pretty
pretty<00:01:53.250> intuitive<00:01:54.020> we're<00:01:55.020> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
pretty intuitive we're going to have to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.030 
pretty intuitive we're going to have to
set<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.829> in<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.070> bed<00:01:57.110> but<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> played<00:01:58.890> with

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
set it up in a bed but but I played with

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.010 
set it up in a bed but but I played with
it<00:01:59.159> at<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.700> sony<00:01:59.939> store<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.630> actually

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it at the sony store and it's actually

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.330 
it at the sony store and it's actually
pretty<00:02:01.200> good<00:02:02.240> so<00:02:03.240> these<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.990> IR<00:02:04.560> blasters

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
pretty good so these are the IR blasters

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.260 
pretty good so these are the IR blasters
so<00:02:06.350> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.380> different<00:02:07.920> from<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.700> logitech

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
so this is different from the logitech

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.460 
so this is different from the logitech
as<00:02:09.450> far<00:02:09.629> as<00:02:09.750> i<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.869> tell<00:02:09.989> because<00:02:10.289> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
as far as i can tell because the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.589 
as far as i can tell because the
logitech<00:02:10.979> has<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.220> huge<00:02:11.640> ir<00:02:11.970> blaster<00:02:12.390> on<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
logitech has a huge ir blaster on the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.990 
logitech has a huge ir blaster on the
front

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
front

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.870 
front
it<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.960> has<00:02:14.200> actually<00:02:14.550> individual<00:02:15.550> IR

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
it and this has actually individual IR

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.240 
it and this has actually individual IR
blasters<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.650> you<00:02:17.800> plug<00:02:17.980> into<00:02:18.160> the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
blasters that that you plug into the

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.200 
blasters that that you plug into the
back<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.700> unit<00:02:19.530> here<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.920> let's<00:02:21.820> see<00:02:22.030> what

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
back of the unit here is let's see what

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.840 
back of the unit here is let's see what
is<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.540> wow<00:02:23.320> that's<00:02:23.650> an<00:02:23.740> hdmi<00:02:24.220> cable<00:02:24.640> and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
is this wow that's an hdmi cable and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
will actually need an additional hdmi

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.770 
will actually need an additional hdmi
cable<00:02:28.140> that<00:02:29.140> I<00:02:29.170> picked<00:02:29.500> up<00:02:29.620> from<00:02:29.680> game<00:02:30.280> cables

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
cable that I picked up from game cables

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.699 
cable that I picked up from game cables
com2<00:02:31.780> to<00:02:32.740> run<00:02:32.980> from<00:02:33.310> my<00:02:33.700> tivo<00:02:34.270> into<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.320> TV

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
com2 to run from my tivo into the TV

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.240 
com2 to run from my tivo into the TV
itself<00:02:37.080> let's<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.800> k<00:02:39.730> power<00:02:40.390> cord<00:02:41.040> this<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.220> a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
itself let's see k power cord this is a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.660 
itself let's see k power cord this is a
us<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.060> it's<00:02:43.360> 110<00:02:46.830> what<00:02:47.830> do<00:02:47.920> we<00:02:47.950> got<00:02:48.130> here<00:02:48.160> oh

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
us so it's 110 what do we got here oh

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.280 
us so it's 110 what do we got here oh
this<00:02:49.420> is<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.600> power<00:02:50.260> converter<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:53.020> it's<00:02:53.230> a

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
this is the power converter so it's a

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.350 
this is the power converter so it's a
19.5<00:02:54.390> AC<00:02:55.860> adapter<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:58.630> it<00:02:59.100> terminates

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
19.5 AC adapter and then it terminates

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:09.690 
19.5 AC adapter and then it terminates
oh<00:03:01.410> okay<00:03:02.410> so<00:03:02.550> actually<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.530> see<00:03:08.700> one

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
second so it actually terminates at one

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.620 
second so it actually terminates at one
