cycles<00:00:10.719> and<00:00:11.170> we're<00:00:11.950> here<00:00:12.129> today<00:00:12.280> talking

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
cycles and we're here today talking

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.620 
cycles and we're here today talking
about<00:00:12.789> the<00:00:13.030> new<00:00:13.180> Mach<00:00:13.389> 4<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.830> new<00:00:15.010> Mach<00:00:15.190> 4<00:00:15.630> we

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
about the new Mach 4 the new Mach 4 we

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.529 
about the new Mach 4 the new Mach 4 we
started<00:00:16.990> developing<00:00:17.470> several<00:00:17.920> years<00:00:18.130> ago<00:00:18.539> to

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
started developing several years ago to

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.840 
started developing several years ago to
replace<00:00:19.990> our<00:00:20.380> aluminum<00:00:20.590> 26<00:00:21.070> inch<00:00:21.400> wheel<00:00:21.609> Mach

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
replace our aluminum 26 inch wheel Mach

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
and in 27.5 inch wheels when we started

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.029 
and in 27.5 inch wheels when we started
this<00:00:27.640> project<00:00:27.939> we<00:00:28.419> took<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.470> lot<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:29.829> things

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
this project we took a lot of the things

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.330 
this project we took a lot of the things
that<00:00:30.130> we<00:00:30.310> developed<00:00:30.759> from<00:00:30.909> our<00:00:31.089> less<00:00:32.340> 27.5

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
that we developed from our less 27.5

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.479 
that we developed from our less 27.5
inch<00:00:33.700> frame<00:00:34.030> and<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.360> it<00:00:34.540> has<00:00:34.690> us<00:00:35.489> more

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
inch frame and that it has us more

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.510 
inch frame and that it has us more
relaxed<00:00:36.940> geometry<00:00:37.480> slacker<00:00:37.810> angles<00:00:38.350> and<00:00:38.620> what

one of the coolest things about the bike

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.210 
one of the coolest things about the bike
is<00:02:01.900> we<00:02:02.049> were<00:02:02.200> working<00:02:02.560> on<00:02:02.710> this<00:02:02.950> and

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
is we were working on this and

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.980 
is we were working on this and
developing<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.850> geometry<00:02:04.390> in<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.570> field<00:02:04.780> of

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
millimeter travel bikes and as we were

you<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:17.890> realized<00:02:18.280> with<00:02:18.490> the<00:02:18.540> 27.5<00:02:19.540> wheels

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you really realized with the 27.5 wheels

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.570 
you really realized with the 27.5 wheels
that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
that

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.640 
that
the<00:02:22.000> bike<00:02:22.180> could<00:02:22.360> use<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.599> little<00:02:22.900> bit<00:02:23.080> more<00:02:23.410> and

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
the bike could use a little bit more and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.190 
the bike could use a little bit more and
and<00:02:24.340> so<00:02:24.459> we<00:02:24.580> started<00:02:24.879> testing<00:02:25.090> longer<00:02:25.720> travel

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
and so we started testing longer travel

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.559 
and so we started testing longer travel
on<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.860> bikes<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:30.099> wanted<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.879> still<00:02:31.269> get

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
on the bikes and we wanted to still get

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.869 
on the bikes and we wanted to still get
that<00:02:31.720> balance<00:02:32.290> of<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.769> pedaling<00:02:33.220> performance

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
that balance of the pedaling performance

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.580 
that balance of the pedaling performance
that<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.150> Mach<00:02:34.330> 4<00:02:34.599> is<00:02:34.750> known<00:02:34.989> for<00:02:35.260> we<00:02:35.410> didn't

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
that the Mach 4 is known for we didn't

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.680 
that the Mach 4 is known for we didn't
want<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.739> lose<00:02:35.920> any<00:02:36.190> of<00:02:36.280> that<00:02:36.580> and<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:37.390> seemed

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
want to lose any of that and it seemed

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.620 
want to lose any of that and it seemed
that<00:02:38.380> around<00:02:39.130> 120<00:02:39.880> millimeters<00:02:40.330> it<00:02:40.450> really

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
that around 120 millimeters it really

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.750 
that around 120 millimeters it really
much<00:02:41.019> over<00:02:41.319> 115<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.099> when<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> started<00:02:42.670> to

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
much over 115 is when you started to

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.270 
much over 115 is when you started to
feel<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.090> bike<00:02:43.950> pedal<00:02:44.950> a<00:02:44.980> little<00:02:45.040> bit

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
feel the bike pedal a little bit

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.589 
feel the bike pedal a little bit
differently<00:02:45.640> have<00:02:45.849> a<00:02:45.880> little<00:02:46.120> bit<00:02:46.209> more<00:02:46.330> trail

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.020 
bike feel to it but at 115 millimetres
travel<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:50.170> got<00:02:50.379> that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
travel you got that

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.580 
travel you got that

terrain<00:03:02.049> that<00:03:02.230> was<00:03:02.349> more<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.620> a<00:03:02.799> hundred<00:03:03.190> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
terrain that was more like a hundred and

twenty hundred and twenty five
millimeter<00:03:04.780> travel<00:03:05.110> bikes<00:03:05.290> so<00:03:05.500> we<00:03:05.709> arrived<00:03:06.310> at

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
millimeter travel bikes so we arrived at

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.370 
millimeter travel bikes so we arrived at
a<00:03:06.640> hundred<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.180> fifteen<00:03:07.480> millimeters<00:03:07.989> after

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
a hundred and fifteen millimeters after

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.589 
a hundred and fifteen millimeters after
quite<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.739> bit<00:03:08.980> testing<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.730> deciding<00:03:10.569> that

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
quite a bit testing and deciding that

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.050 
quite a bit testing and deciding that
that<00:03:10.870> is<00:03:11.019> really<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.440> balance<00:03:11.920> where<00:03:12.250> you<00:03:12.880> get

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
that is really the balance where you get

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.580 
that is really the balance where you get
the<00:03:13.239> great<00:03:13.420> crossover<00:03:13.930> between<00:03:14.200> cross

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
the great crossover between cross

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.610 
the great crossover between cross
country<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.310> trail<00:03:15.970> bikes<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.569> it's<00:03:17.170> it's

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
country and trail bikes so it's it's

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.620 
country and trail bikes so it's it's
really<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.920> passion<00:03:18.160> of<00:03:18.489> mine<00:03:18.519> because<00:03:19.000> we've

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
really a passion of mine because we've

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.949 
really a passion of mine because we've
got<00:03:19.810> bikes<00:03:20.049> like<00:03:20.260> our<00:03:20.410> Mach<00:03:20.620> 6<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.250> attack

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
got bikes like our Mach 6 that attack

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.809 
got bikes like our Mach 6 that attack
and<00:03:22.959> tackle<00:03:23.410> very<00:03:23.739> aggressive<00:03:24.250> terrain<00:03:24.549> and

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
and tackle very aggressive terrain and

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.849 
and tackle very aggressive terrain and
world<00:03:25.000> enduro<00:03:25.359> type<00:03:25.690> stuff<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.230> they<00:03:26.650> pedal

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
world enduro type stuff and they pedal

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.890 
world enduro type stuff and they pedal
great<00:03:27.250> but<00:03:27.910> you<00:03:27.970> would<00:03:28.090> not<00:03:28.209> want<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.510> use<00:03:28.569> that

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
great but you would not want to use that

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.270 
great but you would not want to use that
