gonna like they're patching a bunch of

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.260 
gonna like they're patching a bunch of
stuff<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.370> they're<00:02:02.760> gonna<00:02:02.880> pop<00:02:03.120> some

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
stuff like they're gonna pop some

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.880

matchmaking<00:02:03.480> and<00:02:04.080> like<00:02:04.230> how<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.440> footsteps

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
matchmaking and like how the footsteps

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.050

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
but the only thing that I think that

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
but the only thing that I think that
they<00:02:08.009> should<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.550> really<00:02:08.700> work<00:02:08.940> on<00:02:09.090> maybe

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
they should really really work on maybe

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.609 
they should really really work on maybe
not<00:02:09.630> for<00:02:09.750> this<00:02:09.869> call<00:02:10.020> duty<00:02:10.170> before<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.530> next

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
not for this call duty before the next

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
Call of Duty is making the knife is

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.850 
Call of Duty is making the knife is
secondary<00:02:12.660> because<00:02:12.990> as<00:02:13.200> much<00:02:13.230> as<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.560> you

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
secondary because as much as that you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260
