00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
is this example here I've leveled it up

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.670 
is this example here I've leveled it up
put<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> catalyst<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.049> put<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.470> very

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
put a catalyst on it and put some very

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.859 
put a catalyst on it and put some very
powerful<00:00:16.949> mods<00:00:17.460> split<00:00:18.090> chamber<00:00:18.390> being<00:00:18.630> one<00:00:18.840> of

them serration another good one the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.259 
them serration another good one the
speed<00:00:21.689> trigger<00:00:21.900> also<00:00:22.410> very<00:00:22.619> useful<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:23.279> well

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
speed trigger also very useful as well

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.170 
speed trigger also very useful as well
as<00:00:24.449> ammo<00:00:24.689> drum<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:26.130> weapon<00:00:26.430> does<00:00:26.849> burn

quickly<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.750> helps<00:00:31.050> out<00:00:31.199> just<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.590> little

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
quickly but this helps out just a little

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.069 
quickly but this helps out just a little
bit<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.130> having<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.640> extra<00:00:32.820> amount<00:00:33.270> now<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.960> do

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
bit in having that extra amount now I do

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.680 
bit in having that extra amount now I do
plan<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.500> having<00:00:35.010> a<00:00:35.160> higher<00:00:35.460> level<00:00:35.969> ammo<00:00:36.270> drum

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
plan on having a higher level ammo drum

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.530 
plan on having a higher level ammo drum
once<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.590> 30<00:00:37.890> but<00:00:38.610> i'm<00:00:39.090> using<00:00:39.420> that

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
once I get it to 30 but i'm using that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.299 
once I get it to 30 but i'm using that
right<00:00:39.719> now<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.899> most<00:00:40.320> important<00:00:40.860> mod<00:00:41.010> right

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
right now the most important mod right

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.590 
right now the most important mod right
now<00:00:41.550> is<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.239> cryo<00:00:42.719> rounds<00:00:43.460> this<00:00:44.460> i<00:00:44.760> cannot

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
now is the cryo rounds this i cannot

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
now is the cryo rounds this i cannot
stress<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.140> enough<00:00:46.289> cry<00:00:46.680> rounds<00:00:47.010> are<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
stress this enough cry rounds are the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
stress this enough cry rounds are the
most<00:00:47.340> important<00:00:47.730> because<00:00:47.879> it's<00:00:48.239> so<00:00:48.450> say<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> me

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.130 
down making it oddities here to hit with
the<00:00:51.690> ignis<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.230> well<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.100> being<00:00:53.460> hilarious<00:00:54.140> now

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
the ignis as well as being hilarious now

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.439 
the ignis as well as being hilarious now
when<00:00:55.829> using<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.579> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:56.940> sure<00:00:56.969> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
when using this you want to make sure to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
when using this you want to make sure to
have<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.899> longer<00:00:58.199> range<00:00:58.469> weapon<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.160> mitigate

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
have a longer range weapon to mitigate

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:00.950 
have a longer range weapon to mitigate
some<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> long<00:01:00.090> range<00:01:00.329> problems<00:01:00.809> the

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
some of the long range problems the

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
some of the long range problems the
ignis<00:01:01.199> has<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:01.980> short-range<00:01:02.280> weapon

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
ignis has it's a very short-range weapon

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
ignis has it's a very short-range weapon
so<00:01:03.300> use<00:01:03.510> something<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> Lex<00:01:04.350> or<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
so use something like the Lex or the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
so use something like the Lex or the
Kraken<00:01:05.760> something<00:01:06.420> along<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.780> lines<00:01:07.040> to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
Kraken something along those lines to

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.060 
Kraken something along those lines to
complement<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:09.619> weapon<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.770> that's<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
complement this weapon so that's going

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.920 
complement this weapon so that's going
to<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> fight<00:01:11.549> alright<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.540> here<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.780> are

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
to do a fight alright and here we are

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.580 
to do a fight alright and here we are
against<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> hyena<00:01:14.280> I<00:01:15.049> fought<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> hyena

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
against the hyena I fought the hyena

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.620 
against the hyena I fought the hyena
many<00:01:16.799> many<00:01:17.009> times<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.270> thought<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.600> might

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
many many times but I thought it might

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.380 
many many times but I thought it might
be<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.170> useful<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.460> difficult

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
be very useful to see what a difficult

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.710 
be very useful to see what a difficult
bosses<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> lot<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> hit<00:01:23.369> points<00:01:23.720> against

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bosses with a lot of hit points against

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.630 
bosses with a lot of hit points against
the<00:01:25.080> ignis<00:01:25.820> now<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.270> see<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.689> using

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
the ignis now you can see I'm using

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.109 
the ignis now you can see I'm using
burst<00:01:29.640> fire<00:01:30.229> which<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:31.740> important<00:01:32.460> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
burst fire which is really important to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.440 
burst fire which is really important to
conserve<00:01:33.900> ammo<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:35.759> prevents<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.390> from

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
conserve ammo and it prevents you from

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.870 
conserve ammo and it prevents you from
being<00:01:37.079> able<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:38.450> see<00:01:39.450> only<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.200> wall<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.189> fire<00:01:41.430> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
being able to see only a wall of fire so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
being able to see only a wall of fire so
enemies<00:01:42.390> over<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.040> let<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.220> spotted<00:01:45.799> let's
