battle the thing about this game is is

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.999 
battle the thing about this game is is
that<00:01:48.520> I<00:01:48.729> haven't<00:01:49.119> even<00:01:49.179> I<00:01:49.679> haven't<00:01:50.679> seen<00:01:50.830> any

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
that I haven't even I haven't seen any

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.070 
that I haven't even I haven't seen any
of<00:01:51.190> the<00:01:51.250> animes<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.910> i<00:01:52.209> personally<00:01:52.959> hate

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
of the animes and I i personally hate

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.760 
of the animes and I i personally hate
anime<00:01:53.500> but<00:01:53.739> I<00:01:55.080> until<00:01:56.080> all<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.319> voices<00:01:56.500> are

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
anime but I until all the voices are

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.279 
anime but I until all the voices are
really<00:01:57.009> well<00:01:57.129> executed<00:01:57.459> as<00:01:57.849> if<00:01:58.229> they<00:01:59.229> were

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 
really well executed as if they were

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.550 
really well executed as if they were
probably<00:02:00.000> used<00:02:01.000> from<00:02:01.360> actual<00:02:02.020> characters<00:02:02.440> in

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
probably used from actual characters in

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.990 
probably used from actual characters in
the<00:02:02.649> anime<00:02:02.950> because<00:02:03.129> they<00:02:03.220> sound<00:02:03.459> like<00:02:03.550> anime

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
the anime because they sound like anime

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.719 
the anime because they sound like anime
voices<00:02:04.390> um<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.590> don't<00:02:05.619> really<00:02:05.800> like<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.519> type

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
voices um I don't really like that type

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.499 
voices um I don't really like that type
of<00:02:06.759> stuff<00:02:07.090> because<00:02:07.269> the<00:02:07.450> voices<00:02:07.569> are<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.509> one

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
of stuff because the voices are and one

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.440 
of stuff because the voices are and one
word<00:02:10.690> cheesy<00:02:11.470> but<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.950> it<00:02:12.190> it<00:02:12.760> gives<00:02:12.970> me<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.150> big

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
word cheesy but is it it gives me a big

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.699 
word cheesy but is it it gives me a big
it's<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.720> good<00:02:13.870> field<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.290> game<00:02:14.410> because<00:02:14.530> it

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
it's a good field of the game because it

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.280 
it's a good field of the game because it
kind<00:02:14.920> of<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.670> sets<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> place<00:02:16.599> for<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.260> game

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
kind of it sets the place for the game

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.160 
kind of it sets the place for the game
because<00:02:17.709> this<00:02:17.860> is<00:02:18.040> sort<00:02:18.910> of<00:02:19.060> an<00:02:19.209> anime<00:02:19.629> styled

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170
