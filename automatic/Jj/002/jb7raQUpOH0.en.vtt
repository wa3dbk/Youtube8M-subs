00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
to make a cotton duck our cotton a chick

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.700 
to make a cotton duck our cotton a chick
you<00:00:13.950> would<00:00:14.160> need<00:00:14.400> cotton<00:00:16.010> construction<00:00:17.010> paper

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
you would need cotton construction paper

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.830 
you would need cotton construction paper
peppercorns<00:00:19.710> and<00:00:20.480> glue<00:00:22.100> first<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:24.420> make<00:00:24.660> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
peppercorns and glue first to make the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.769 
peppercorns and glue first to make the
cotton<00:00:25.230> chick<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> cotton<00:00:26.640> duck<00:00:26.910> you'll

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
cotton chick and the cotton duck you'll

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:38.280 
cotton chick and the cotton duck you'll
glue<00:00:28.109> two<00:00:28.740> pieces<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.640> cotton<00:00:30.539> together

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.290 

you<00:00:38.830> know<00:00:38.890> you<00:00:38.980> can<00:00:39.220> set<00:00:39.520> these<00:00:39.760> aside<00:00:39.820> and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:40.300 
you know you can set these aside and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.300 
you know you can set these aside and
while<00:00:40.870> they're<00:00:41.170> dry<00:00:43.380> we<00:00:44.380> can<00:00:44.410> make<00:00:44.770> the<00:00:44.980> feet

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
while they're dry we can make the feet

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.980 
while they're dry we can make the feet
to<00:00:48.310> show<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:48.610> how<00:00:48.880> to<00:00:48.940> make<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.420> feet<00:00:49.720> I'm

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:49.990 
to show you how to make the feet I'm

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.550 
to show you how to make the feet I'm
going<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.560> do<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.920> bigger<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.870> that<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.320> can

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
going to do it bigger so that you can

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.370 
going to do it bigger so that you can
see<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.070> what<00:00:54.460> I<00:00:54.489> did<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:56.350> cut<00:00:56.710> a<00:00:57.570> big<00:00:58.570> trying<00:00:59.050> a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 
see it what I did was cut a big trying a

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:06.630 
see it what I did was cut a big trying a
triangle<00:01:00.220> like<00:01:01.290> this<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:05.170> make<00:01:05.440> the<00:01:05.710> toes

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
triangle like this and to make the toes

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
triangle like this and to make the toes
I<00:01:07.290> drew<00:01:08.290> other<00:01:08.560> triangles<00:01:10.680> inside<00:01:11.680> like<00:01:12.100> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I drew other triangles inside like this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.180 
I drew other triangles inside like this
then<00:01:14.470> I<00:01:14.770> cut<00:01:15.340> it<00:01:15.490> out<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:17.009> glued<00:01:18.009> them

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
then I cut it out and glued them

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.700 
then I cut it out and glued them
together<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:19.030> I'm<00:01:19.270> going<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.690> make<00:01:19.960> two<00:01:20.290> little

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
together so I'm going to make two little

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:32.490 
together so I'm going to make two little
ones<00:01:20.920> now<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.970> correct<00:01:22.509> size<00:01:22.840> for<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.470> chick

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.510 

Drago<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:37.220> smaller<00:01:37.610> triangles<00:01:38.450> inside<00:01:38.990> and

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
Drago the smaller triangles inside and

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.370 
Drago the smaller triangles inside and
then<00:01:40.520> I'm<00:01:40.820> just<00:01:41.120> coming<00:01:41.510> at<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.870> out<00:01:42.910> but

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
then I'm just coming at it out but

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.320 
then I'm just coming at it out but
doubling<00:01:45.380> the<00:01:45.470> paper<00:01:45.740> I<00:01:45.920> cut<00:01:46.340> two<00:01:46.670> out<00:01:46.700> just

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
doubling the paper I cut two out just

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.860 
doubling the paper I cut two out just
alike<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:49.160> I<00:01:49.490> cut<00:01:49.790> them<00:01:49.970> both<00:01:50.150> at<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.570> same

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
alike and I cut them both at the same

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.710 
alike and I cut them both at the same
time<00:01:51.430> you<00:01:52.430> don't<00:01:52.580> have<00:01:52.730> to<00:01:53.000> do<00:01:53.150> that<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:53.540> can

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
time you don't have to do that you can

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.580 
time you don't have to do that you can
always<00:01:53.900> make<00:01:54.320> one<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.800> then<00:01:54.950> trace<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:58.510> now<00:01:59.590> to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
always make one and then trace it now to

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.620 
always make one and then trace it now to
mix<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:03.280> toes<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.940> glue<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.300> together

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.310 

like<00:02:08.630> this<00:02:10.540> let<00:02:11.540> that<00:02:11.720> bend<00:02:13.720> then<00:02:14.720> set<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
like this let that bend then set the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.050 
like this let that bend then set the
cotton<00:02:15.800> ball<00:02:16.040> on<00:02:16.540> top<00:02:17.920> these<00:02:18.920> are<00:02:19.190> very<00:02:19.460> easy

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
cotton ball on top these are very easy

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.290 
cotton ball on top these are very easy
to<00:02:21.010> make<00:02:22.010> now<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.990> make<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.410> eyes<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.670> put

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
to make now to make the eyes I just put

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.200 
to make now to make the eyes I just put
a<00:02:26.330> little<00:02:26.630> dot<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.140> glue<00:02:27.170> here<00:02:27.710> and<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.940> little

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
a little dot of glue here and a little

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.340 
a little dot of glue here and a little
dot<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.420> glue<00:02:29.570> there<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:32.080> I've<00:02:33.080> used

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
dot of glue there and I've used

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.650 
dot of glue there and I've used
peppercorns<00:02:34.310> if<00:02:34.550> you<00:02:35.060> don't<00:02:35.270> want<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.510> use

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
peppercorns if you don't want to use

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.449 
peppercorns if you don't want to use
peppercorns<00:02:36.500> you<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.890> take<00:02:37.100> your<00:02:37.250> hole

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
peppercorns you can take your hole

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.390 
peppercorns you can take your hole
puncher<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.120> use<00:02:38.900> construction<00:02:39.470> paper<00:02:39.739> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
puncher and use construction paper and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.510 
puncher and use construction paper and
cut<00:02:40.459> out<00:02:41.330> two<00:02:41.630> little<00:02:41.930> round<00:02:42.080> eyes<00:02:45.459> now<00:02:46.459> to

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
cut out two little round eyes now to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.510 
cut out two little round eyes now to
make<00:02:46.970> the<00:02:47.209> beak<00:02:47.480> I'm<00:02:48.380> going<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.860> show<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.100> on<00:02:49.340> a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
make the beak I'm going to show you on a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.330 
make the beak I'm going to show you on a
larger<00:02:49.970> piece<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.420> paper<00:02:50.630> how<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.620> made<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.100> big

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
larger piece of paper how I made the big

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.320 
larger piece of paper how I made the big
I<00:02:52.610> used<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.330> fold<00:02:53.660> like<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.060> I<00:02:56.060> made<00:02:56.300> a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
I used to fold like here and I made a

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:07.020 
I used to fold like here and I made a
triangle<00:03:00.250> like<00:03:01.250> this

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.680 

cut<00:03:08.030> the<00:03:08.210> triangle<00:03:08.870> out<00:03:12.700> then<00:03:13.700> the<00:03:13.880> big<00:03:14.120> opens

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
cut the triangle out then the big opens

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.920 
cut the triangle out then the big opens
when<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.290> glue<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:16.400> beak<00:03:17.240> onto<00:03:17.780> the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
when you glue the the beak onto the

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.080 
when you glue the the beak onto the
cotton<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.890> want<00:03:19.100> to<00:03:19.160> put<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.490> glue<00:03:19.700> right

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
cotton you want to put the glue right

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.680 
cotton you want to put the glue right
along<00:03:20.120> this<00:03:20.810> edge<00:03:21.140> and<00:03:21.650> then<00:03:22.490> glue<00:03:22.820> it<00:03:22.850> on<00:03:23.150> so

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
along this edge and then glue it on so

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:30.930 
along this edge and then glue it on so
now<00:03:23.870> I'm<00:03:24.020> going<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.230> make<00:03:24.380> one<00:03:24.650> the<00:03:24.890> right<00:03:25.160> size

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.620 

I'm<00:03:31.940> going<00:03:32.090> to<00:03:32.180> fold<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.600> paper<00:03:34.630> remember

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
I'm going to fold the paper remember

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.630 
I'm going to fold the paper remember
that<00:03:35.840> you<00:03:36.020> want<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.320> make<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.710> flat<00:03:37.040> side<00:03:37.400> of

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
that you want to make the flat side of

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.180 
that you want to make the flat side of
it<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:38.840> triangle<00:03:40.030> where<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.060> fold<00:03:41.510> is<00:03:42.190> so

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
it the triangle where the fold is so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.860 
it the triangle where the fold is so
you're<00:03:43.340> just<00:03:43.550> going<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.850> draw<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.180> triangle

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
you're just going to draw the triangle

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:56.800 
you're just going to draw the triangle
like<00:03:45.080> this<00:03:47.800> and<00:03:49.270> cut<00:03:50.270> it<00:03:50.300> out<00:03:55.180> put<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.330> glue<00:03:56.600> on

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
like this and cut it out put the glue on

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:06.190 
like this and cut it out put the glue on
the<00:03:57.140> edge

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.520 

and<00:04:06.770> then<00:04:06.980> hold<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.150> just<00:04:08.480> for<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.780> second<00:04:09.410> and

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
and then hold it just for a second and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.770 
and then hold it just for a second and
you've<00:04:10.220> made<00:04:10.520> your<00:04:10.760> beat<00:04:11.090> for<00:04:11.480> your<00:04:11.660> chick<00:04:12.610> now

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
you've made your beat for your chick now

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.220 
you've made your beat for your chick now
the<00:04:14.780> duck<00:04:15.020> is<00:04:15.290> made<00:04:15.850> the<00:04:16.850> same<00:04:17.180> type<00:04:17.570> kind<00:04:17.989> of

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
the duck is made the same type kind of

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.520 
the duck is made the same type kind of
way<00:04:18.470> you're<00:04:19.340> going<00:04:19.579> to<00:04:19.700> start<00:04:20.150> with<00:04:20.840> do<00:04:21.079> cotton

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
way you're going to start with do cotton

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:24.280 
way you're going to start with do cotton
balls<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.570> you're<00:04:23.570> going<00:04:23.720> to<00:04:23.780> start<00:04:24.080> with<00:04:24.230> a

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
balls and you're going to start with a

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.590 
balls and you're going to start with a
triangle<00:04:24.650> for<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.340> foot<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:28.240> again<00:04:29.240> I'm

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
triangle for the foot and again I'm

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.690 
triangle for the foot and again I'm
going<00:04:29.720> to<00:04:29.810> draw<00:04:30.080> it<00:04:30.230> larger<00:04:30.770> so<00:04:30.800> you<00:04:31.070> can<00:04:31.430> see

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
going to draw it larger so you can see

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:41.520 
going to draw it larger so you can see
what<00:04:31.910> I've<00:04:32.090> done<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:40.010> make<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.430> Ducks<00:04:40.729> foot

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
what I've done to make the Ducks foot

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.719 
what I've done to make the Ducks foot
you<00:04:42.530> want<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.800> make<00:04:42.950> a<00:04:42.979> triangle<00:04:45.310> but<00:04:46.310> instead

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
you want to make a triangle but instead

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.030 
you want to make a triangle but instead
of<00:04:46.850> making<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.300> triangle<00:04:47.660> inside<00:04:48.320> since<00:04:48.860> the

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
of making a triangle inside since the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.100 
of making a triangle inside since the
duck<00:04:49.220> has<00:04:49.460> webbed<00:04:49.850> feet<00:04:50.180> you're<00:04:50.840> going<00:04:50.870> to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
duck has webbed feet you're going to

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.950 
duck has webbed feet you're going to
make<00:04:51.320> a<00:04:51.350> curve<00:04:51.800> up<00:04:52.130> and<00:04:52.460> then<00:04:53.210> another<00:04:53.540> curve

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
make a curve up and then another curve

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.620 
make a curve up and then another curve
around<00:04:54.229> and<00:04:54.889> this<00:04:55.580> makes<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.120> look<00:04:56.180> more<00:04:56.570> like

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
around and this makes it look more like

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:03.969 
around and this makes it look more like
a<00:04:56.810> wet<00:04:57.139> foot<00:04:59.830> then<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.860> put<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:01.460> out<00:05:02.770> again<00:05:03.770> you

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
a wet foot then you put it out again you

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.010 
a wet foot then you put it out again you
can<00:05:04.190> cut<00:05:04.370> them<00:05:04.460> both<00:05:04.669> out<00:05:04.940> or<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.330> can<00:05:05.360> cut<00:05:05.750> one

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
can cut them both out or you can cut one

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:21.010 
can cut them both out or you can cut one
and<00:05:06.229> trace<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:09.970> then<00:05:10.970> glue<00:05:11.240> the<00:05:11.539> feet<00:05:11.900> together

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:28.620 

with<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.740> cotton<00:05:22.130> balls<00:05:22.340> on<00:05:22.700> top

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.330 

then<00:05:29.260> we<00:05:29.410> want<00:05:29.650> to<00:05:29.740> put<00:05:29.890> two<00:05:30.160> little<00:05:32.100> spots<00:05:33.100> of

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
then we want to put two little spots of

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.670 
then we want to put two little spots of
glue<00:05:33.640> for<00:05:33.670> the<00:05:34.030> eyes<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:37.440> again<00:05:38.440> we're

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
glue for the eyes and again we're

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.170 
glue for the eyes and again we're
putting<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.130> peppercorn<00:05:39.820> on<00:05:40.920> now<00:05:41.940> to<00:05:42.940> make

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
putting the peppercorn on now to make

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.740 
putting the peppercorn on now to make
the<00:05:43.420> beef<00:05:44.190> we<00:05:45.190> want<00:05:45.430> to<00:05:45.550> make<00:05:45.730> it<00:05:45.970> again<00:05:46.270> from

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
the beef we want to make it again from

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:49.530 
the beef we want to make it again from
the<00:05:46.960> fold<00:05:47.290> and<00:05:47.680> I'm<00:05:48.370> going<00:05:48.640> to<00:05:48.730> make<00:05:48.940> a<00:05:48.970> larger

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
the fold and I'm going to make a larger

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.070 
the fold and I'm going to make a larger
one<00:05:49.720> so<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.080> can<00:05:50.350> see<00:05:50.590> what<00:05:50.800> I'm<00:05:50.950> doing

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.730 

fold<00:05:56.080> the<00:05:56.260> paper<00:05:57.390> and<00:05:58.390> this<00:05:58.780> time<00:05:59.140> instead<00:05:59.380> of

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
fold the paper and this time instead of

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.670 
fold the paper and this time instead of
making<00:06:00.100> a<00:06:00.190> triangle<00:06:00.930> we're<00:06:01.930> making<00:06:02.260> a<00:06:02.350> large

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
making a triangle we're making a large

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.140 
making a triangle we're making a large
curve<00:06:03.460> and<00:06:04.830> again<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:06.040> made<00:06:06.460> this<00:06:06.700> straight

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
curve and again I made this straight

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.230 
curve and again I made this straight
part<00:06:07.570> on<00:06:07.870> the<00:06:08.230> fold<00:06:08.670> because<00:06:09.670> that's<00:06:09.970> where

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
part on the fold because that's where

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.690 
part on the fold because that's where
we're<00:06:10.420> going<00:06:10.600> to<00:06:10.630> put<00:06:10.840> the<00:06:10.990> glue<00:06:11.290> so<00:06:12.220> I'm<00:06:12.430> going

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
we're going to put the glue so I'm going

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:22.500 
we're going to put the glue so I'm going
to<00:06:12.790> cut<00:06:13.060> out<00:06:13.210> a<00:06:13.240> smaller<00:06:13.780> one<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:21.120> then<00:06:22.120> fold

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
to cut out a smaller one and then fold

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.940 
to cut out a smaller one and then fold
the<00:06:22.750> paper<00:06:23.460> and<00:06:24.460> again<00:06:24.820> I'm<00:06:25.180> gonna<00:06:25.740> make<00:06:26.740> this

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
the paper and again I'm gonna make this

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.560 
the paper and again I'm gonna make this
straight<00:06:27.310> part<00:06:27.670> where<00:06:27.940> the<00:06:28.090> fold<00:06:28.390> is<00:06:30.300> this<00:06:31.300> is

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
straight part where the fold is this is

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:40.110 
straight part where the fold is this is
just<00:06:31.840> like<00:06:32.110> a<00:06:32.140> long<00:06:32.500> upside<00:06:33.160> down<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:38.940> cut<00:06:39.940> it

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
just like a long upside down you cut it

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.710 
just like a long upside down you cut it
out

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:43.720 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.840 

it<00:06:44.720> opens<00:06:45.200> up<00:06:45.440> that's<00:06:45.800> the<00:06:46.100> little<00:06:46.280> beak<00:06:46.520> and

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
it opens up that's the little beak and

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:51.400 
it opens up that's the little beak and
we're<00:06:46.970> putting<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:49.510> glue<00:06:50.510> right<00:06:50.750> on<00:06:51.050> the<00:06:51.200> edge

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:51.410 
we're putting the glue right on the edge

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:59.380 
we're putting the glue right on the edge
and<00:06:55.390> we've<00:06:56.390> made<00:06:56.690> our<00:06:56.870> little<00:06:57.080> duck
