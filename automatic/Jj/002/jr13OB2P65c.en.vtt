first thing a lot of y'all will notice
is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.780> changeover<00:00:13.349> from<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.590> cold<00:00:13.799> air<00:00:13.920> and

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
is the changeover from the cold air and

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.799 
is the changeover from the cold air and
take<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.250> was<00:00:14.340> running<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.610> old<00:00:14.730> videos<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.540> the

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
take I was running the old videos to the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.480 
take I was running the old videos to the
stock<00:00:16.049> intake<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.980> was<00:00:17.100> actually<00:00:17.340> done<00:00:17.430> on

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
stock intake that was actually done on

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.519 
stock intake that was actually done on
the<00:00:17.789> dyno<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.779> found<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> stock

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
the dyno and I found that the stock

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.260 
the dyno and I found that the stock
intake<00:00:19.770> actually<00:00:20.220> gave<00:00:20.340> me<00:00:20.430> more<00:00:20.699> power<00:00:20.970> than

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
intake actually gave me more power than

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.790 
intake actually gave me more power than
the<00:00:21.359> cold<00:00:21.539> air<00:00:21.660> intake<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.560> was<00:00:22.680> pretty

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
the cold air intake and it was pretty

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
the cold air intake and it was pretty
significant<00:00:23.250> amount<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.609> like<00:00:23.820> 500

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
significant amount to like 500

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929 
significant amount to like 500

horsepower I did remove the elbow from

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.310 
horsepower I did remove the elbow from
out<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.119> here<00:00:27.269> though<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.599> definitely<00:00:28.170> is<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
out of here though that definitely is a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
out of here though that definitely is a
restrictions<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.310> out<00:00:29.460> with<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
restrictions to take that out with the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.519 
restrictions to take that out with the

that's<00:03:47.090> pretty<00:03:47.180> much<00:03:47.270> all<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.660> here<00:03:47.870> take

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
that's pretty much all of it here take

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.540 
that's pretty much all of it here take
it<00:03:48.320> out<00:03:48.410> for<00:03:48.560> a<00:03:48.620> drive<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.130> we'll<00:03:49.220> show<00:03:49.490> you

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
it out for a drive and we'll show you

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.010 
it out for a drive and we'll show you
how<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.790> drives<00:03:50.000> and<00:03:50.300> maybe<00:03:50.450> even<00:03:50.570> a<00:03:50.720> burnout

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
how it drives and maybe even a burnout

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.950 
how it drives and maybe even a burnout
video<00:03:51.260> so<00:03:51.500> we'll<00:03:51.650> see<00:03:52.510> all<00:03:53.510> right<00:03:53.660> before<00:03:53.780> we

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
video so we'll see all right before we

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.150 
video so we'll see all right before we
actually<00:03:54.230> move<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.530> here<00:03:54.650> I'll<00:03:54.740> start<00:03:54.950> up<00:03:55.040> so

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
actually move in here I'll start up so

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:13.200 
actually move in here I'll start up so
you<00:03:55.220> can<00:03:55.340> hear<00:03:55.490> it

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.070 

all<00:04:14.210> right<00:04:14.420> now<00:04:14.660> show<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.960> little

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:15.080 
all right now show you a little

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.289 
all right now show you a little
acceleration<00:04:15.830> from<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.280> and<00:04:16.459> we'll<00:04:16.790> start<00:04:17.030> off

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
acceleration from it and we'll start off

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:36.690 
acceleration from it and we'll start off
here

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.700 

I<00:04:36.760> don't<00:04:37.630> think<00:04:37.690> the<00:04:37.840> last<00:04:37.990> video<00:04:38.320> got<00:04:38.350> the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
I don't think the last video got the

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.680 
I don't think the last video got the
water<00:04:39.280> injection<00:04:39.790> and<00:04:39.940> they<00:04:40.000> FR<00:04:40.330> over<00:04:40.540> here

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
water injection and they FR over here

00:04:40.690 --> 00:05:02.070 
water injection and they FR over here
especially<00:04:40.810> it's<00:04:41.260> still<00:04:41.440> not<00:04:41.530> fully<00:04:41.770> tuned<00:04:42.100> so

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:28.749 

let's<00:05:02.440> play<00:05:02.710> faster

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:31.739 
this is good I'd say five minutes later

00:05:31.739 --> 00:05:36.589 
this is good I'd say five minutes later
there's<00:05:32.039> the<00:05:32.219> smoke<00:05:32.519> for<00:05:32.819> a<00:05:32.849> minute<00:05:33.119> ago<00:05:35.599> put

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
guess he was coming to investigate my

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.220 
guess he was coming to investigate my
smoke<00:06:40.830> back<00:06:41.100> there<00:06:41.750> and<00:06:42.750> while<00:06:42.990> I'm<00:06:43.080> out<00:06:43.170> with

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:43.230 
smoke back there and while I'm out with

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.330 
smoke back there and while I'm out with
the<00:06:43.320> video<00:06:43.500> game<00:06:43.680> anyways<00:06:43.980> might<00:06:44.190> as<00:06:44.250> well

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
the video game anyways might as well

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.530 
the video game anyways might as well
show<00:06:44.490> you<00:06:44.700> what<00:06:44.820> it<00:06:44.910> does<00:06:45.060> in<00:06:45.180> four-wheel

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
show you what it does in four-wheel

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.210 
show you what it does in four-wheel
drives<00:06:45.810> and<00:06:46.020> so<00:06:46.140> that's<00:06:46.530> how<00:06:46.680> I<00:06:46.710> have<00:06:46.890> to<00:06:46.920> drive

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
drives and so that's how I have to drive

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.490 
drives and so that's how I have to drive
it<00:06:47.400> 90%<00:06:48.060> of<00:06:48.090> the<00:06:48.180> time<00:06:48.390> so<00:06:48.750> listen<00:06:48.960> four<00:06:49.350> wheel

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
it 90% of the time so listen four wheel

00:06:49.500 --> 00:07:03.750 
it 90% of the time so listen four wheel
drive<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.830> go<00:06:50.010> and<00:06:50.100> launch<00:06:50.340> it

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.760 

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.400 

even<00:07:04.330> better<00:07:04.510> because<00:07:04.660> it<00:07:04.840> didn't<00:07:05.050> spin<00:07:05.200> so

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.410 
even better because it didn't spin so

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.720 
even better because it didn't spin so
much<00:07:05.560> it's<00:07:05.740> kind<00:07:05.890> of<00:07:05.920> chirps<00:07:06.280> um<00:07:06.400> it's<00:07:06.550> very

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:06.730 
much it's kind of chirps um it's very

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.870 
much it's kind of chirps um it's very
beginning<00:07:07.860> all<00:07:08.860> right<00:07:09.040> so<00:07:09.220> we're<00:07:09.370> back<00:07:09.580> for<00:07:09.760> a

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880 
beginning all right so we're back for a

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.400 
beginning all right so we're back for a
little<00:07:10.000> demonstration<00:07:10.330> or<00:07:10.900> what<00:07:11.020> it<00:07:11.110> does<00:07:11.140> in

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
little demonstration or what it does in

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.410 
little demonstration or what it does in
acceleration<00:07:11.910> y'all<00:07:12.910> tell<00:07:13.090> me<00:07:13.120> what<00:07:13.300> you
