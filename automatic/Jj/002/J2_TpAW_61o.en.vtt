00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 it is the planet closest to the sun of 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.660
 fact is only 58 million 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.240
 miles of the star king is three times 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.420
 closest for that reason the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:17.220
 temperatures reach 450 degrees 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.220
 these are five wonders 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.369
 given its proximity to the mercury sun 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.050
 it might seem the most impossible place 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.849
 of the solar system for a finding of 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.710
 water however you knew that the 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.570
 tilt of its axis of rotation is 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.640
 less than one degree so there are 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.660
 entire regions ie the regions 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.650
 polar in which never receives knots 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.440
 so in those areas the 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:43.900
 temperatures drop to 185 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.280
 degrees below zero so the suspicion 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.110
 that there was water was great 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.809
 until the nasa messenger probe 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.670
 in 2011 he came to the planet revealed to us that 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.339
 not just water ice on the planet 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.620
 hottest solar system but that 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.230
 that ice is also extraordinarily 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.899
 abundant in fact it is the largest of the 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.290
 constituents of their deposits 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.290
 North Pole 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.490
 did you know that your book is composed 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 manually iron if as well as what 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:19.000
 listens to iron so its core 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.070
 it makes its structure enormously heavy 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.560
 internal one of the planets does 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.000
 mysterious solar system measurements 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.740
 gravitational the probe did 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.260
 messenger suggest that mercury has 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.870
 a huge core of dense iron that 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.680
 It occupies up to 85% inside the 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.840
 planet 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.300
 the area over the iron core that is 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.170
 much denser than rock but not so 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.170
 dense as 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.509
 is the most remote planet orbits the sun 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:54.170
 in 88 Earth days but on the other 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:57.170
 part is slow its rotation takes 180 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.049
 days is the slowest of all strength 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.310
 of gravity the sun is what causes 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.530
 rotate slowly so a year 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.410
 when one of your faces the sun for six 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.290
 months is what does your day his 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.330
 temperature reaches 420 degrees heat 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.590
 and the face that is not exposed to the sun 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.019
 reaches up to 145 degrees under you have 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.640
 enough time to warm up and enter 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:23.640
 every part of his face 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.450
 It has an extremely hard layer 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.820
 detached from surface by the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.740
 solar winds a constant current 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.310
 of particles that comes from the layer 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.800
 most external of the sun 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.870
 as mercury is so hot these 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.180
 atoms quickly escape into space 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.950
 in addition to its weak force of gravity 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.260
 so unlike land and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.200
 venus the mercury atmosphere is 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.560
 constantly being supplanted by 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.560
 other 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.170
 as we assume the mercury planet of 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.599
 approximately two thousand four hundred 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.569
 kilometers of radio has been reduced 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.790
 this amount anguish of kilometers 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:10.159
 in the last four billion of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.999
 years which is much more than what 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.280
 I was waiting a few decades ago because 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:17.569
 they get me and this is because of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.159
 cooling that has come 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.099
 experiencing its iron core 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.480
 for millions of years this immense the 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.420
 core that as we had not mentioned 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.819
 before it occupies most of the planet and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.290
 makes the crust very thin so 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:33.019
 that when it 's a metallic core it 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.440
 cooling this phenomenon of 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.180
 shrunken
