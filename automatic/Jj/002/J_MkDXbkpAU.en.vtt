00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.430
 hello welcome on coco tv for a 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.090
 new video presentation 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.460
 today a passive CPU heatsink 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.399
 zalman fx sounds which passive ie 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.949
 fanless up to 95 watts and 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:41.980
 after with a small fan of 92 mm 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:44.949
 if we want to climb a little higher the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.239
 product it is not happening in this 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.710
 so box a black box with all 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.030
 the latest technical information 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.570
 information that is very interesting 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:56.110
 especially here the height for example 157 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.760
 mm only for 156 wide of his 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.019
 coast is so really in almost a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.290
 perfect cube in terms of dimensions 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.610
 with four heatpipes that leave the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.960
 base and others that we will discover a 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.080
 a little bit later when we 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.869
 will handle the product itself in 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.390
 inside there is the bundle we are going 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.330
 to go directly to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.439
 radiator so the radiator 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.689
 Here it is, we can see it 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.840
 actually it looks more like a 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:24.340
 cube with the base here mirror finish 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.619
 four heatpipes that leave how 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.960
 made of 6 mm diameter a base that 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.850
 slightly off- center simply for 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.590
 ensure compatibility with 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.990
 elements around the socket but one 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.159
 will come back on a little bit more 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.470
 late we have here fins in 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.240
 aluminum with the plastic on 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.860
 every point on every corner that protects 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.860
 which is because there is no one can 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.820
 to see him in fact he has 1 2 3 here in 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.750
 more who do U-turns so six 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.400
 over 80 it makes us a total of 10 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.460
 technically the product is presented 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.960
 like these here it is on a map 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.729
 mother so we can see it at the level 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.250
 of memory we concluded m when 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.879
 even put the patriot with a 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 rather big radiator here the pci 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.310
 express is not blocked and in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.409
 the absolute does not overflow enormously at 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.269
 pcb level so for the cases that 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.689
 can still pass it should not 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:26.530
 touch the top inside we have 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.780
 small towers with step is 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.900
 Here we will slide if a need 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.540
 fan 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.920
 92 mm that will be maintained by claws 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.209
 that will hang on each side and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.329
 finally from enclosures we removed the 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.739
 little top with the zalman cube logo that 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:47.840
 was maintained by four vices and which 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:50.390
 allows us to discover the structure of the 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.439
 radiator we see there exactly how 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.829
 it's actually designed we have the 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:59.379
 heat pipe that will go up next three 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.780
 others are welded directly on 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.799
 similarly on this side so the idea is 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.750
 original know them ask when 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.319
 even a minimum of know-how then there 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.150
 it moves a little 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.430
 it's perfectly normal it's a 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.510
 safety if we ever kick in 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.489
 the adductor radiator that is when 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.769
 not even too much of us despite his 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.439
 template we could expect a little 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.069
 little more at the rate is the 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:20.900
 passive 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.269
 the design is special it costs 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.250
 relatively expensive we are at 85 euros 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:26.989
 for France it's not given happening 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.030
 so we'll have to wait to see what 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.040
 is worth at the performance level with a 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.859
 fan without a fan 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.030
 gold case a case and all that on 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.889
 the small ivy bridge 1,3570 announced at 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.989
 cents to 77 tdp web 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.599
 we are also going on the past 95 votes 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.669
 with 1,750 still from intel see 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.989
 a little what it gives without overclocking 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.769
 of course since it is absolutely 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:53.269
 not the purpose of this type of radiator there 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.669
 will go on a 100% configuration 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.829
 fanless or almost since in a 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.729
 case we will see if it holds or if it does not 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.530
 not come if you have to add a 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:02.329
 fan how fast true 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.359
 will take care of all this later 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.579
 besides we will make a small file on 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:08.720
 the fan lets see if we can play if 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.549
 we can work if we still have to 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.409
 fans short we'll take care of 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:16.599
 all this in a first time the 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.599
 radiator very soon goodbye
