but what I found measuring up to 56 feet
in<00:01:12.400> length<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.910> was<00:01:13.330> the<00:01:13.540> oarfish<00:01:14.110> or<00:01:14.380> the<00:01:15.220> king

pelvic fins they are rarely caught alive
and<00:01:28.660> are<00:01:28.960> probably<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> cause<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.740> sea
