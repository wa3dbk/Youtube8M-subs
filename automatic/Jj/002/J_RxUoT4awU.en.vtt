leader<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.179> Autobots<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:50.689> that<00:01:50.959> allowed

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
leader of the Autobots and that allowed

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.749 
leader of the Autobots and that allowed
us<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.439> tell<00:01:51.709> a<00:01:51.740> really<00:01:52.069> interesting<00:01:52.310> story

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
us to tell a really interesting story

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.219 
us to tell a really interesting story
about<00:01:52.850> how<00:01:54.670> Grimlock<00:01:55.670> is<00:01:55.939> a<00:01:56.270> good<00:01:56.869> guy<00:01:57.020> but

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
about how Grimlock is a good guy but

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.129 
about how Grimlock is a good guy but
still<00:01:58.100> has<00:01:58.399> his<00:01:58.639> own<00:01:58.759> agenda<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.389> at<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.899> same

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:00.139 
still has his own agenda and at the same

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:02.769 
still has his own agenda and at the same
time<00:02:00.200> show<00:02:00.979> off<00:02:01.189> how<00:02:01.549> cool<00:02:01.819> Optimus<00:02:02.359> is<00:02:02.539> and

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
time show off how cool Optimus is and

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.389 
time show off how cool Optimus is and
what<00:02:03.139> what<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.679> takes<00:02:03.829> to<00:02:03.920> be<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.039> great<00:02:04.219> leader

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
what what it takes to be a great leader

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.819 
what what it takes to be a great leader
but<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:05.659> gameplay<00:02:05.869> that<00:02:06.170> came<00:02:06.350> with<00:02:06.529> him<00:02:06.709> was

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
but the gameplay that came with him was

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.830 
but the gameplay that came with him was
so<00:02:07.130> fundamentally<00:02:07.939> different<00:02:08.330> for<00:02:08.479> Grimlock

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
so fundamentally different for Grimlock

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.590 
so fundamentally different for Grimlock
we<00:02:09.440> looked<00:02:09.920> for<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.490> lot<00:02:10.940> of<00:02:11.060> different<00:02:11.360> kinds

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
we looked for a lot of different kinds

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.150 
we looked for a lot of different kinds
of<00:02:11.660> inspiration<00:02:12.319> then<00:02:12.500> we<00:02:12.650> went<00:02:12.770> back<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.010> the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
of inspiration then we went back to the

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.220 
of inspiration then we went back to the
g1<00:02:13.520> cartoon<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.270> they<00:02:14.690> were<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.959> kind<00:02:15.140> of

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
g1 cartoon and they were that kind of

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.130 
g1 cartoon and they were that kind of
the<00:02:15.380> slow<00:02:15.709> plotting<00:02:16.670> super<00:02:17.480> powerful<00:02:17.840> but

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
the slow plotting super powerful but

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.180 
the slow plotting super powerful but
slow<00:02:18.410> applauding<00:02:18.890> t-rex<00:02:19.250> and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
slow applauding t-rex and

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
slow applauding t-rex and
speech<00:02:20.700> patterns<00:02:21.150> were<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> same<00:02:21.600> way<00:02:21.810> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
speech patterns were the same way and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.900 
speech patterns were the same way and
it's<00:02:22.740> not<00:02:22.890> really<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.370> we're<00:02:23.550> looking<00:02:23.880> for

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's not really what we're looking for

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.640 
it's not really what we're looking for
so<00:02:24.210> we<00:02:24.240> looked<00:02:24.540> at<00:02:24.720> some<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.110> other<00:02:25.140> media

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
so we looked at some of the other media

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.500 
so we looked at some of the other media
of<00:02:25.860> Grimlock<00:02:26.220> and<00:02:26.460> really<00:02:26.760> settled<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.210> UK

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
of Grimlock and really settled the UK

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.790 
of Grimlock and really settled the UK
comics<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:28.020> thought<00:02:28.170> did<00:02:28.320> a<00:02:28.350> really<00:02:28.590> cool<00:02:28.770> job

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
comics I thought did a really cool job

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.220 
comics I thought did a really cool job
of<00:02:29.130> making<00:02:29.310> him<00:02:29.550> interesting<00:02:30.230> intellectually

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
of making him interesting intellectually

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.320 
of making him interesting intellectually
interesting<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:32.220> we<00:02:32.340> drew<00:02:32.550> from<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.060> kind<00:02:33.270> of

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
interesting so we drew from that kind of

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.000 
interesting so we drew from that kind of
stuff<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.840> gameplay<00:02:34.320> that<00:02:34.800> kind<00:02:34.980> of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
stuff and then the gameplay that kind of

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:36.860 
stuff and then the gameplay that kind of
paved<00:02:35.430> our<00:02:35.640> own<00:02:35.760> path<00:02:36.030> and<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.690> know<00:02:36.810> you

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
paved our own path and you know you

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.330 
paved our own path and you know you
would<00:02:37.110> there's<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.680> many<00:02:37.800> memorable<00:02:38.160> moments

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
would there's so many memorable moments

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.760 
would there's so many memorable moments
of<00:02:38.730> him<00:02:38.880> being<00:02:39.030> great<00:02:39.410> physical<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.740> know

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
of him being great physical you know

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.740 
of him being great physical you know
breaking<00:02:41.280> things<00:02:41.460> bashing<00:02:42.060> things<00:02:42.300> you<00:02:42.660> know

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
breaking things bashing things you know

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.960 
breaking things bashing things you know
and<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.470> having<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.920> good<00:02:44.070> big<00:02:44.340> sword<00:02:44.700> and

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
and and and having a good big sword and

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.400 
and and and having a good big sword and
so<00:02:45.060> we<00:02:45.180> just<00:02:45.330> said<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.960> place<00:02:46.140> for<00:02:46.170> him

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
so we just said that's the place for him

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.900 
so we just said that's the place for him
to<00:02:46.500> live<00:02:46.620> making<00:02:47.010> levels<00:02:47.280> from<00:02:47.400> Transformers

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
to live making levels from Transformers

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.330 
to live making levels from Transformers
is<00:02:48.030> not<00:02:48.150> easy<00:02:48.500> it's<00:02:49.500> not<00:02:49.650> easy<00:02:49.740> for<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> couple

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
is not easy it's not easy for a couple

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.130 
is not easy it's not easy for a couple
reasons<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:51.090> there's<00:02:51.720> not<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> lot<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
reasons one there's not a lot of

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
reasons one there's not a lot of
parallel<00:02:52.620> games<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.010> can<00:02:53.160> look<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.630> I'm

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
parallel games we can look to I'm

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.300 
parallel games we can look to I'm
actually<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.350> best<00:02:55.500> game<00:02:55.740> we<00:02:55.770> can<00:02:56.010> look<00:02:56.130> to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
actually the best game we can look to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.280 
actually the best game we can look to
while<00:02:56.490> building<00:02:56.760> fall<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.450> how<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.050> build

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
while building fall for how to build

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.110 
while building fall for how to build
spaces<00:02:58.770> that<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.950> transformer<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.730> use<00:02:59.910> and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
spaces that a transformer would use and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.910 
spaces that a transformer would use and
find<00:03:00.270> interesting<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:00.900> play<00:03:01.440> patterns<00:03:01.800> that

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
find interesting and play patterns that

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.860 
find interesting and play patterns that
could<00:03:02.040> be<00:03:02.130> neat<00:03:02.310> was<00:03:02.790> war<00:03:03.030> for<00:03:03.210> Cybertron<00:03:03.690> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
could be neat was war for Cybertron and

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.690 
could be neat was war for Cybertron and
we<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.710> kind<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.890> broke<00:03:05.130> ground<00:03:05.370> with<00:03:05.670> that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
we really kind of broke ground with that

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.640 
we really kind of broke ground with that
game<00:03:06.120> so<00:03:06.330> we<00:03:06.450> were<00:03:06.540> able<00:03:06.570> as<00:03:06.960> artists<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.470> kind

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
game so we were able as artists to kind

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.080 
game so we were able as artists to kind
of<00:03:07.710> hole<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:07.980> our<00:03:08.070> craft<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.640> better<00:03:08.910> and

of hole in our craft you better and

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.480 
of hole in our craft you better and
better<00:03:09.210> with<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.540> kind<00:03:09.930> of<00:03:09.960> the<00:03:10.110> level<00:03:10.350> design

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
better with the kind of the level design

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.820 
better with the kind of the level design

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
actually in the weapons so what we did

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.170 
actually in the weapons so what we did
is<00:04:09.659> we<00:04:09.750> built<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.200> teletraan<00:04:10.739> store<00:04:11.180> and

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
is we built the teletraan store and

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
turret that joins them so you can only
