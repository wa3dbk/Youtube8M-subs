00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.290
 Today there is a flat store update 

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.810
 and yes if you want to see how 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.580
 I live like that then just stay then 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.470
 I personally think it's always very 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.910
 interesting to see how to get people 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.520
 You can get a lot of inspiration 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.530
 get what you like or maybe 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.610
 Also do not like for a home 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.400
 In any case, I always find that completely 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.320
 exciting and I will definitely still 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.119
 I would like to say that I live here since 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.920
 I'm 19 years old in mine 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:29.160
 flat and if I have it again 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.169
 everything would be new then more 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.819
 very different if you are natural 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.260
 his taste changed a bit too 

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:37.030
 and, above all, it also notices something 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.559
 is practical or not practical 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.929
 For example, I would never get one again 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.219
 clear dining table made me choose it 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:42.729
 I would not do that again 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.920
 do 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.600
 but well, so on the whole feel 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.190
 I will at home very comfortable here's 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.920
 yes also important that you are in his 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:58.510
 four walls feels good and yes there comes 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.979
 simply with us we are now in the quasi 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.409
 Entrance area so if I go to the door 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.539
 come on then pull that for me like that 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:09.009
 I have a fairly small hallway 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:10.600
 where many schools are and here 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.600
 I do not have much possibility 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 or as we say so, we say so 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.630
 have small dresser and so on 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:23.439
 Right then my bathroom is right 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:24.939
 that is not so exciting now 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.520
 my washing machine serves as 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.890
 so it's not great 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.500
 exciting here is the only highlight 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.560
 maybe my sweet glitter where you are 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.859
 had chosen me then 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.119
 the whole and maybe it was 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.270
 could serve 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.030
 I have a dvd shelf from ikea here 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.520
 and I use that as yes as it is 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.499
 simply stocking stuff for beauty stuff 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.579
 and that might be a small one 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.890
 tip for you, there are also in 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:58.259
 different colors and yes I have here 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:01.210
 stop my brushing and so on 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.840
 I love that I love that about everything 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.870
 there we go my sleep murdered 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.880
 that looks like that 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.770
 open wallpaper I can with it again 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 It's so kind of you 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.960
 if you look almost as silky 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.970
 looks in any case quite noble in 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.710
 Really every love is from carrÃ© that is 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.980
 already quite old that's mine 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.480
 marmal gift for the birthday but 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.640
 Maybe there's something else there 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.370
 a sparkle 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.970
 and here are a few students like that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.920
 then the perspective that I had 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.060
 my videos because I always there 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.590
 daylight then directly frontal have 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.110
 without of course otherwise me a chair 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.430
 I have a short stand now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.890
 I introvert myself quickly 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.600
 not so spectacular my phone loads 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.250
 by the way, and it goes off completely 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.740
 instagram cause i just go back 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.870
 started a raffle and mine 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.120
 mobile phone is not resting now 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.100
 I knew really hard on battery 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.160
 has died because here is mine 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.310
 entrance door because I have such mirrors 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.709
 stuck because I'm quite practical 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.870
 find is makes the room brighter and 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.620
 bigger and you can of course again 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:23.350
 A check in the mirror before throwing 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.030
 you leave the apartment exactly and here 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.830
 left, I have such a storeroom and 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:30.280
 I do not know if I show you this 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.760
 It should be really embarrassing but it is just 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.440
 it's really mess oh my god but me 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.570
 show you how it looks 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.790
 oh my god I have my winter shoes 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:43.720
 in the cellar so that's really violent 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:46.900
 mainka, but yes, I'm just standing there 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.370
 and now we are actually coming in 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.610
 my main room in mine 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.610
 living room 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.620
 I do not know how it is 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.940
 but I really have one 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.970
 huge sofa that 's really 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.510
 Huge looks now there is a small one 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:06.370
 But the saying was quite funny 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.110
 you surround me with luxury on the 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
 I can do without 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.220
 Of course money is not everything but me 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.810
 found the saying very sweet and this 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 Wandtattoo I think also beautiful 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.160
 life is not measured by the number 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.470
 the 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.750
 breaths but a moments the us 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.170

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.670
 I get up to bhutto my god 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.890
 Do not you like brothers? Do not wear me 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.420

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.380
 Plant still alive because I have even 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.320

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.050
 just in my opinion even better 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.030
 I'm really excited about that 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.710

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.310

 So if you want to win that then 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.580

 but that ends on Sunday but already 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.840
 if this is lying around then that is 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:08.690
 Of course, practically to the end and mine 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.340

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:13.310

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.020
 on my kitchen area here 

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:32.430
 I could whisper full because I did that 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.410

 Wonder what to expect but has 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:51.240
 definitely exceeded my expectations 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.880
 So I think I'm also very chic and 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.190
 that's how stylish it gets 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.960
 bit glossy so I think real 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:00.950
 I'm really happy that I bought myself 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.210
 I have so much face to see 

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:05.870

 would like to receive a positive review 

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.000
 I do not say that often because it always does 

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.960
 stupid but I would me 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.900
