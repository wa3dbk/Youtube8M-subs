00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
defect now these are fit and I hardly

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.720 
defect now these are fit and I hardly
ever<00:01:01.109> cut<00:01:01.379> mine<00:01:01.559> because<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:01.980> eyes<00:01:02.160> small<00:01:02.609> but

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
ever cut mine because my eyes small but

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.840 
ever cut mine because my eyes small but
quite<00:01:02.969> long<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.899> if<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.769> fit<00:01:05.129> it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
quite long but if they did not fit it

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.429 
quite long but if they did not fit it
would<00:01:06.060> look<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
would look something like this and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.560 
would look something like this and
although<00:01:08.430> when<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.700> close<00:01:08.939> your<00:01:08.970> eyes<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
although when you close your eyes that

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.149 
although when you close your eyes that
would<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.810> fine<00:01:10.110> looking<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> row

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
would be fine looking down the row

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.800 
would be fine looking down the row
that's<00:01:11.340> fine<00:01:11.640> okay<00:01:12.119> let's<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.420> a<00:01:12.450> little<00:01:12.659> more

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that's fine okay let's do a little more

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
that's fine okay let's do a little more
saturated<00:01:13.850> it's<00:01:14.850> hard<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> get<00:01:15.210> understand

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
saturated it's hard to get understand

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.130 
saturated it's hard to get understand
and<00:01:16.040> if<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.250> do<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.140> they're

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
and if you do it like that and they're

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.780 
and if you do it like that and they're
too<00:01:19.320> long<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.680> looks<00:01:19.860> like<00:01:19.950> your<00:01:20.220> eyes<00:01:20.400> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
too long it looks like your eyes and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.539 
too long it looks like your eyes and
drooping<00:01:21.409> so<00:01:22.409> make<00:01:22.770> sure<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.340> are<00:01:23.369> not

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
drooping so make sure that they are not

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.690 
drooping so make sure that they are not
too<00:01:23.880> long<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:24.860> test<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.549> with

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
too long and test them not just with

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
too long and test them not just with
your<00:01:26.790> eye<00:01:26.970> closed<00:01:27.270> looking<00:01:27.600> as<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> mirror<00:01:28.020> but

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
your eye closed looking as a mirror but

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890 
your eye closed looking as a mirror but
also<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.740> eye<00:01:28.829> open<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.600> line

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
also with your eye open so that the line

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.969 
also with your eye open so that the line
from<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> edge<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.979> your<00:01:32.579> eye<00:01:33.500> to<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> end<00:01:34.829> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
from the edge of your eye to the end of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.289 
from the edge of your eye to the end of
your<00:01:35.070> eyebrow<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:37.340> nothing<00:01:38.340> no<00:01:38.790> eyelashes

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
your eyebrow is nothing no eyelashes

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.490 
your eyebrow is nothing no eyelashes
going<00:01:39.479> outside<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> line<00:01:40.170> basically

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
going outside of that line basically

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.719 
going outside of that line basically
because<00:01:40.860> if<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.070> does<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.460> will<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.700> like

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
because if it does it will look like

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.289 
because if it does it will look like
your<00:01:41.970> eyes<00:01:42.119> drooping<00:01:42.570> down<00:01:43.040> here<00:01:44.040> we<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.299> next

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
your eyes drooping down here we go next

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.109

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
inside and push it using the edges a

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.220 
inside and push it using the edges a
little<00:04:31.360> that<00:04:32.360> way<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.570> don't<00:04:32.810> get<00:04:32.930> any<00:04:33.110> glue

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
little that way you don't get any glue

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.680 
little that way you don't get any glue
on<00:04:33.440> your<00:04:33.470> hands<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.120> if<00:04:35.120> you're<00:04:35.240> unsure<00:04:35.420> if

it's<00:04:35.900> stuck<00:04:36.080> probably<00:04:38.110> go<00:04:39.110> along<00:04:39.410> with<00:04:40.480> some

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
it's stuck probably go along with some

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.740 
it's stuck probably go along with some
kind<00:04:41.720> of<00:04:41.810> end<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:43.100> a<00:04:43.190> broader<00:04:43.490> or<00:04:43.820> pencil<00:04:44.330> and

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
kind of end of a broader or pencil and

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.130 
kind of end of a broader or pencil and
this<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.320> make<00:04:45.410> them<00:04:45.590> look<00:04:45.740> kind<00:04:46.040> of<00:04:46.130> them

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
this can make them look kind of them

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.250 
this can make them look kind of them
flat<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.890> what<00:04:49.250> I<00:04:49.280> sometimes<00:04:49.580> do<00:04:50.050> then<00:04:51.050> use<00:04:51.230> a

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
flat so what I sometimes do then use a

00:04:51.260 --> 00:05:00.190 
flat so what I sometimes do then use a
pencil<00:04:51.560> to<00:04:52.990> flip<00:04:53.990> them<00:04:54.169> back<00:04:54.320> up<00:04:58.390> and<00:04:59.390> fortune

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
pencil to flip them back up and fortune

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.100 
pencil to flip them back up and fortune
as<00:05:00.880> the<00:05:01.880> one<00:05:02.000> I<00:05:02.030> left<00:05:02.210> too<00:05:02.450> long<00:05:02.480> you<00:05:02.750> can<00:05:02.900> see

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
as the one I left too long you can see

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.260 
as the one I left too long you can see
that<00:05:03.290> it's<00:05:03.440> slipping<00:05:03.860> from<00:05:04.730> sticking<00:05:05.150> the

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
that it's slipping from sticking the

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.390 
that it's slipping from sticking the
edge<00:05:05.419> if<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.260> happens<00:05:06.620> to<00:05:06.800> you<00:05:06.950> or<00:05:07.190> for

edge if that happens to you or for

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.220 
edge if that happens to you or for
example<00:05:07.430> you<00:05:07.850> go<00:05:08.000> out<00:05:08.180> and<00:05:08.480> during<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> night
