good<00:02:11.340> Bishop<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.390> want<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
good Bishop so I want to

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.390 
good Bishop so I want to
a<00:02:13.080> bit<00:02:14.080> careful<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.560> think<00:02:14.830> it's<00:02:14.950> important<00:02:15.340> to

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
a bit careful I think it's important to

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.460 
a bit careful I think it's important to
get<00:02:15.490> off<00:02:15.959> one<00:02:16.959> pair<00:02:17.260> of<00:02:17.290> rooks<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.630> now<00:02:20.140> just

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
get off one pair of rooks and now just

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.940 
get off one pair of rooks and now just
centralize<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.250> knight<00:02:21.520> or<00:02:21.819> what<00:02:22.120> about<00:02:22.950> f6

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
centralize my knight or what about f6

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.130 
centralize my knight or what about f6
King<00:02:24.280> f7<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.670> rules<00:02:27.910> out<00:02:28.120> any<00:02:28.150> Knight<00:02:28.660> pivots

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
King f7 that rules out any Knight pivots

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.440 
King f7 that rules out any Knight pivots
I<00:02:29.489> think<00:02:30.489> there's<00:02:30.670> something<00:02:30.880> to<00:02:31.030> be<00:02:31.120> said<00:02:31.420> for

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
I think there's something to be said for

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.540 
I think there's something to be said for
that<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.290> certainly<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.860> little<00:02:33.310> bit

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
that so it's certainly a little bit

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.979 
that so it's certainly a little bit
vulnerable<00:02:33.790> along<00:02:34.209> this<00:02:34.330> diagonal<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:34.930> I

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
vulnerable along this diagonal but I

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.540 
vulnerable along this diagonal but I
could<00:02:35.140> always<00:02:35.230> block<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.739> with<00:02:35.860> tonight<00:02:36.160> here

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
could always block it with tonight here

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.990 
could always block it with tonight here
