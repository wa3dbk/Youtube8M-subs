definitely review worthy because it is

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.080 
definitely review worthy because it is
such<00:00:15.960> an<00:00:16.170> addictive<00:00:16.859> game<00:00:17.100> so<00:00:17.699> I'm<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:17.940> going

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
such an addictive game so I'm just going

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.720 
such an addictive game so I'm just going
to<00:00:18.150> start<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> new<00:00:18.480> game<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> way<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> game

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
to start a new game so the way the game

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.370 
to start a new game so the way the game
works<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.779> have<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> move<00:00:22.199> this

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
works is you actually have to move this

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.230 
works is you actually have to move this
little<00:00:22.680> light<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.820> only<00:00:23.939> goes<00:00:24.180> one

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
little light and it only goes one

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
little light and it only goes one
direction<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.279> move<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> over<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
direction so you need to move it over to

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.490 
direction so you need to move it over to
activate<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.539> me<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.170> as<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.470> see

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
activate your me on and as you can see

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
activate your me on and as you can see
this<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> white<00:00:29.130> light<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.550> this<00:00:29.699> me<00:00:30.090> on<00:00:30.240> was

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
this is a white light so this me on was

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.569 
this is a white light so this me on was
activated<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.050> white<00:00:31.349> light<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.769> here<00:00:32.550> we

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
activated by a white light and here we

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.880 
activated by a white light and here we
have<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.790> beam<00:00:33.180> splitter<00:00:33.600> there's<00:00:34.559> beam

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
have a beam splitter there's beam

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.490 
have a beam splitter there's beam
splitters<00:00:35.340> prisms<00:00:36.170> mirrors<00:00:37.170> and<00:00:37.380> all

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
splitters prisms mirrors and all

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.760 
splitters prisms mirrors and all
different<00:00:37.860> sorts<00:00:38.160> of<00:00:38.340> objects<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:38.940> have<00:00:39.090> to

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
different sorts of objects you have to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.740 
different sorts of objects you have to
reconfigure<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.280> activate<00:00:41.640> your<00:00:41.670> me<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.300> if

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
reconfigure to activate your me on so if

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.389 
reconfigure to activate your me on so if
I<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.079> one<00:00:43.350> as<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.920> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.190> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I do this one as you can see it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.760 
I do this one as you can see it
activated<00:00:44.879> both<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.379> so<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.559> one<00:00:46.739> I

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
activated both of them so this one I

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.020 
activated both of them so this one I
have<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> mirror<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.579> this<00:00:47.730> one's<00:00:47.910> pretty

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
have a mirror and this one's pretty

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.779 
have a mirror and this one's pretty
simple<00:00:48.420> we<00:00:48.510> just<00:00:48.539> activate<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.200> Mia<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.800> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
simple we just activate that Mia and on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.729 
simple we just activate that Mia and on
this<00:00:50.969> level<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.449> actually<00:00:51.809> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.199> colored

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
this level we actually have a colored

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.180 
this level we actually have a colored
prism<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.149> has<00:00:54.390> blue<00:00:54.899> red<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.500> yellow<00:00:55.890> so

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
prism so it has blue red and yellow so

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
prism so it has blue red and yellow so
as<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.520> see<00:00:56.640> our<00:00:56.789> me<00:00:56.940> ons<00:00:57.090> correspond<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
as you can see our me ons correspond to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.900 
as you can see our me ons correspond to
those<00:00:57.870> colors<00:00:58.260> blue<00:00:58.859> red<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.309> yellow<00:00:59.579> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
those colors blue red and yellow so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.060 
those colors blue red and yellow so
we'll<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.090> move<00:01:00.359> our<00:01:00.510> prism<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.829> where<00:01:01.949> we

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
we'll just move our prism to where we

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.050 
we'll just move our prism to where we
need<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:04.650> move<00:01:04.799> our<00:01:04.920> light<00:01:05.100> source<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.760> it

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
need it and move our light source and it

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.429 
need it and move our light source and it
will<00:01:06.180> actively<00:01:06.479> our<00:01:06.630> me<00:01:06.810> ons<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.170> actually

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
will actively our me ons it's actually

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.740 
will actively our me ons it's actually
pretty<00:01:07.650> cool<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.909> game<00:01:09.090> continues<00:01:09.570> like

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
pretty cool so the game continues like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.080 
pretty cool so the game continues like
this<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.799> each<00:01:11.040> increasing<00:01:11.670> level<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
this and with each increasing level the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.899 
this and with each increasing level the
difficulty<00:01:12.630> becomes<00:01:12.869> more<00:01:13.110> intense<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> if

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
difficulty becomes more intense so if

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.520 
difficulty becomes more intense so if
you<00:01:15.000> ever<00:01:15.090> get<00:01:15.270> stuck<00:01:15.330> all<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> do<00:01:16.380> is

you ever get stuck all you have to do is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.810 
you ever get stuck all you have to do is
