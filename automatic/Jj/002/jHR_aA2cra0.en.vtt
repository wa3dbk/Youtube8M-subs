00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.100
 3 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.760
 this book is special because we are 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.560
 comes the preseason and with it a 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.029
 lots of changes at this time 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.740
 talk with you in the most 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.540
 possible sensual so that all those who 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 they did not get to gold have their time of 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.720
 minutes and those that do go like you in 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 all night 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 we started with the most important thing the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 jungle the monsters are prettier and 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.550
 In general, the map looks more 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.350
 cool there are changes in each quadrant of 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.850
 the jungle visually this so that 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.440
 according to the player, identify well the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.540
 map but it would have to be a bit 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 subnormal to lose the same map of 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.170
 four years ago but I guess for 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.579
 the new players is very good every 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.019
 camp now has an effect 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.149
 specific that is activated if you spear 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.679
 twitch did crush the wolves that 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.269
 we must understand the canine that patrol 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.399
 your zone of blue so that no channel 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:55.199
 pass unseen the cracks that are 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.640
 the old goals of bot have a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.070
 improvement that makes Tunisia a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 monster every five hits the ground the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.789
 little frog that was once the ghost next 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.110
 of the blue gives you a poisonous armor that 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.720
 makes enemies attack you 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
 suffer prolonged magical damage and for 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.800
 last those of claw that move a 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.150
 kilitos award of translation this is given 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.520
 in a kind of oracle that reveals 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.829
 wards but not units with stealth 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.299
 words all happy and then the buses 

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.310
 traditional companies that practically give 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.109
 same only that when it's my it makes you the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 red brings you back to life and when smith is 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.130
 the blue manna returns the dragon and the 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.719
 Baron also have changes the dragon 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.880
 will give effects to whoever kills it in a 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:31.860
 consecutive as stacks so to speak 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.659
 and the baron I want to give the regeneration of 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.369
 no manna life but now it will allow you 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.500
 return the advance faster and your 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.479
 videos will be faster and it will be more 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.329
 cool will practically become 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.189
 wyn jones or jesse that rich now if the 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.390
 objects I will not explain in detail 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.039
 in numbers because I feel with the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.929
 academic responsibility to read a 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.369
 little once in a while or not and I 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.170
 just because it's a little more 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 practical all previous objects of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.619
 the jungle in their was lizard of the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030
 Elders went to the vegetable except 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.009
 the machete and it's not Robert's 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.750
 Rodriguez with this only remaining object 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.509
 you can make four new objects 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.670
 that served for specific purposes such as 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.200
 the broiler sword that will allow you 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 give a tremendous zape the changes 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.649
 enemies with your smith obviously 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.930
 doing less damage than a monster and 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.090
 slowing down what's also the knife 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.340
 furtive these rayet are a few masters 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.470
 of the Spanish language some rogues from 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.060
 good to talk about this topic was that your may 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.390
 have half the cooling every time 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.000
 what do you 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.770
 from the enemy jungle and will give you a group 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.209
 so you can go running like a thief 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.190
 of the tepito market 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.470
 there is even Mexican on the other hand 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.530
 we have the saber to follow is like 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.150
 the saber skirmish this item at 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.920
 just as I can from the ones you throw 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.810
 allows to emit an enemy only now 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.220
 will be marked and you will do more damage and 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.830
 it will be less harm 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.660
 and you will have vision about him and finally 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.489
 the edge of the ranger with whom 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.950
 basically you will have smile to the right and 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.319
 sinister because it will reduce your condom very 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.989
 machine however its damage is reduced 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.489
 so in fact quickly those 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.560
 are the new items in the jungle that 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.510
 will allow a smash party during 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.430
 all the game and we will see running the 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.980
 gunners the whole game as well as classic 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.360
 has gone to those items such as 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.060
 the boots are going to be able to add a 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.650
 enchantment the warrior will attack 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.870
 and theft of life the magician will give faith and 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.940
 reduction cooling the colossus 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.650
 life and horseshoe and finally the one of 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.810
 devourer who will give attack speed and 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.269
 magical damage by impact accumulates opens in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.890
 function of the modules that impact is 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.420
 similar to the wild flares that 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.310
 it's all about the jungle of this 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.630
 preseason we will see a very jungle 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.290
 active wild compared to the 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.420
 previous 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.920
 It makes me very happy does all 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.030
 changes in a single video so that all 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.650

 next hours and so they do not have me 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.750
 talking like a parrot for 11 or 15 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.400
 minutes 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.810
