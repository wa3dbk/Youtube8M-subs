and we can talk about that as well okay

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.110 
and we can talk about that as well okay
so<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:01.080> just<00:03:01.350> want<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.890> see<00:03:02.220> what<00:03:02.489> was<00:03:02.700> all<00:03:02.850> about

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
so I just want to see what was all about

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.500 
so I just want to see what was all about
and<00:03:03.890> hopefully<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.310> what<00:03:05.580> you're<00:03:05.730> looking<00:03:05.820> for

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.530 
and hopefully is what you're looking for
hazardous<00:03:07.290> steps<00:03:07.620> as<00:03:08.010> well<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.880> get<00:03:09.030> in<00:03:09.360> and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
hazardous steps as well to get in and

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:17.000 
hazardous steps as well to get in and
out<00:03:09.600> easily<00:03:12.500> so<00:03:13.500> it's<00:03:13.650> very<00:03:14.750> practical

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
out easily so it's very practical

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.760 
out easily so it's very practical
and<00:03:19.099> this<00:03:20.099> is<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.400> vehicle
