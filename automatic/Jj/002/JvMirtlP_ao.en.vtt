you<00:01:32.850> don't<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> lot<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.390> use<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.409> get

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
you don't get a lot of use you get

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.469 
you don't get a lot of use you get
demotivated<00:01:35.100> from<00:01:35.759> it<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.000> that's<00:01:36.240> what<00:01:36.329> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
demotivated from it and that's what I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.469 
demotivated from it and that's what I
mean<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.220> ya<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.790> also<00:01:39.180> the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
mean and that will ya just and also the

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.450 
mean and that will ya just and also the
videos<00:01:39.810> take<00:01:40.079> longer<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.560> upload<00:01:40.920> that's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
videos take longer to upload that's

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
videos take longer to upload that's
another<00:01:41.939> big<00:01:42.180> reason<00:01:42.420> they<00:01:42.689> take<00:01:42.869> longer

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
another big reason they take longer

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.050 
another big reason they take longer
because<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.590> making<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.250> depth<00:01:44.460> so

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
because I'm making it more in depth so

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.420 
because I'm making it more in depth so
for<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.689> i'm<00:01:46.140> not<00:01:46.590> saying<00:01:46.860> i'm<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.310> back

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.100 
for now I i'm not saying i'm going back
to<00:01:47.490> Manchester<00:01:48.030> United<00:01:48.659> instead<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.990> I'm
