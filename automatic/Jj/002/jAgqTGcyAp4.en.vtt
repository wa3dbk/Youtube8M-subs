00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.960
 Hello everyone 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.490
 so today I'm going to show you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.850
 how to increase a line for the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.300
 trout 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.510
 then you will have hooks by 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.020
 month the hooks I'm already trying disassembled 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:31.619
 with the bottom of line with will 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:36.690
 develops a gold float for trout 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:41.310
 preferably Strait of 3.7 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:46.110
 oil mills no more oxygen at 1.5 g and 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:51.060
 of course a cane be the reel so 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:54.090
 we will take the thread we have in our 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.110
 nice bill we'll go through all the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.630
 arts jumps I can open and well one 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.850
 do not know it's now the end of the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.930
 wire we will disassemble a little float 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:16.140
 after salty for the futures that you 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:18.740
 have on those who are in the air here is it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740
 you specify that 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.310
 like that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:32.340
 went next to connect the body of 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:40.140
 line aubade line we will make a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:42.710
 loop then I'm doing it then I'll you 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.710
 watch 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:05.710
 or yours but here is the loop 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 then we take the bottom line with 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:17.950
 the hook so here is the bottom of the line 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:21.250
 with the soul are so then we take the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.220
 line body with the loop we take 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 the loop and we take the second loop 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.800
 also who already has on the bottom line 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.959
 pass the loop of the bottom of line in the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.470
 loop of the line body we pick up 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:40.020
 the hook is there I feel we pass 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.640
 in his loop of the building loop 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.950
 we are tightening is new and here is the knot 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:52.180
 it's called the 902 then the sinkers 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.310
 luxury and a float of 5 g 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:58.239
 we will take 5 g of simple white 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.060
 logical the sinkers then always a 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.760
 bottom will be down line one by 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.810
 against then the lead puts him about to 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:14.290
 15 cm for easter the fish can 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.519
 still see him so about sister 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:25.900
 then serves the other lead we put them 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:32.310
 on the line body kind m 3 because 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:32.310
 that if he is free or still three 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.569
 we're going to take off some wire loosen a 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.569
 little thread 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:55.650
 gold lead puts it about 5 cm 5 cm 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:58.099
 from the one we did after the two 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:17.340
 Other species also lead 5cm 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:19.729
 like that she last here is 2 3 and at 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729
 further 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.330
 4 and after the hook I also forgot 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.070
 when we make knots for example we 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.669
 make the curls always wet 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.190
 because when we do not wet 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.940
 when if ever we are a trout 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.260
 knot here the thread crashes and so that 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.850
 risk of cutting more easily 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.850
 so always wet
