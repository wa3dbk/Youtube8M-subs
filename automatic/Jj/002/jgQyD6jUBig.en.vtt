00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.180
 I am now looking at a picture of the confiscation in the committee 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.310
 both suspects 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.230
 they had been guilty of the large-scale fraud and the money they had 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.989
 it earns the hands having six invested in the cars 

00:00:13.989 --> 00:00:15.910
 and here too the commission 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.030
 The hot tub in the garden is one of the many examples that regime acted as 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 she has confiscated things from it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.310
 recently the Utrecht police have been actively seeking the assets of criminals 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.169
 to detect the police that has been open and to take away the past six months 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.120
 yielded that already two and a half million off of this rate until they were already home 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.300
 and a seizure 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.630
 a cottage cloud is used for a hemp nursery 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.090
 Then we have the people want them to know what they are doing and despite it 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.660
 fact that it is a property for sale 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.069
 then we will seize the entire home 

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:54.559
 the police also took cars from this luxury speedboat jewelry and a lot 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.650
 cash 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.100
 last Tuesday there was a raid in a hemp farm 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.180
 IJsselstein but after two tons of Christmas was found at a different address 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.470
 that same day this luxury caravan was probably towed from a campsite 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.470
 paid from the weed trade it is natural too 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.640
 go on holiday several times and all of that with criminal money 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.010
 the other people have fallen victim to it and it is all undermining 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.060
 just back the police works together with other parties such as the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.120
 tax authorities, benefits agencies and municipalities 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.610
 their credo a criminal hit you have all the hardest in his wallet yes 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.390
 criminal is not were a few months over a number of years than what in 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.530
 the rats come back say from prison and do not live with this new one 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.979
 car can step and say 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.330
 India committee can sit 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.660
 yes it is annoying that he is worth his money 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.170
 must do that 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.290
 we have seized a very distant earth and we knew that way 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.130
 he had a lot of debts 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.479
 and then the Ferrari driver that is of course strange 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.409
 but what happens with all that confiscated power, the first 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.359
 we hope it goes to trafficking in human beings as much as possible 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.419
 all first a good example of if we seize it then the 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:15.459
 The judge ruled that a part never goes back to the victim 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.849
 then it may also have to do that 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.779
 the money is not intended for victims 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:24.900
 then I feel the way back to the state treasury we all have there bah 

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:25.579
 Bah 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.950
 the police hope to show that crime does not pay 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.130
 and also hopes that organized crime will decrease because it will be confiscated 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.000
 millions taken that can no longer be put into new criminal 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.830
 activities
