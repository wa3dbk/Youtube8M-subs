00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.670 
and I learned by reading a lot of
comments<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.510> people<00:02:57.690> sometimes<00:02:58.290> get

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
comments that people sometimes get

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.650 
comments that people sometimes get
annoyed<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.190> don't<00:02:59.430> fall<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.030> shelf

annoyed that I don't fall in the shelf

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.090 
annoyed that I don't fall in the shelf
so<00:03:00.750> I'm<00:03:00.810> gonna<00:03:00.930> do<00:03:01.110> it<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.380> I<00:03:01.440> usually<00:03:01.650> save

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
so I'm gonna do it but I usually save

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.060 
so I'm gonna do it but I usually save
them<00:03:02.660> like<00:03:03.660> if<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:03.930> don't<00:03:03.990> I<00:03:04.380> can't<00:03:04.500> feel<00:03:04.830> love

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
them like if I don't I can't feel love

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.690 
them like if I don't I can't feel love
my<00:03:05.220> streak<00:03:05.490> I<00:03:05.640> don't<00:03:05.850> see<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.150> point<00:03:07.610> using<00:03:08.610> it

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
my streak I don't see the point using it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.790 
my streak I don't see the point using it
really<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.300> can<00:03:09.540> basically<00:03:09.990> just<00:03:10.320> save<00:03:10.770> it

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
really so I can basically just save it

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.690
