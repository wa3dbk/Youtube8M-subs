A's I just kind of do the best I can in
every<00:02:29.209> class<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.569> if<00:02:30.319> that<00:02:30.500> happens<00:02:30.620> to<00:02:30.890> be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
every class and if that happens to be

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.850 
every class and if that happens to be
Nathan<00:02:31.459> that's<00:02:32.090> what<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.390> is<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:33.080> take<00:02:33.260> classes

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
Nathan that's what it is we take classes

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.970 
Nathan that's what it is we take classes
and<00:02:34.130> materials<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.200> mechanics<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:36.380> basically

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
and materials and mechanics so basically

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.850 
and materials and mechanics so basically
you<00:02:37.310> have<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.790> bar<00:02:38.690> and<00:02:39.110> there<00:02:39.230> are<00:02:39.319> forces<00:02:39.620> on

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
you have a bar and there are forces on

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.740 
you have a bar and there are forces on
it<00:02:40.040> what<00:02:40.190> happens<00:02:40.580> inside<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.239> bar<00:02:41.420> stuff

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
it what happens inside the bar stuff

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.020 
it what happens inside the bar stuff
like<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:41.930> and<00:02:42.319> dynamics<00:02:43.160> and<00:02:43.310> control<00:02:43.489> so

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
like that and dynamics and control so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.330 
like that and dynamics and control so
like<00:02:44.840> if<00:02:45.049> you<00:02:45.170> have<00:02:45.350> horses<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.069> system

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
like if you have horses on a system

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.610 
like if you have horses on a system
how's<00:02:47.180> the<00:02:47.360> system<00:02:47.660> you<00:02:47.780> react<00:02:48.049> to<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.319> force

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
how's the system you react to that force

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.830 
how's the system you react to that force
and<00:02:48.950> then<00:02:49.040> controlling<00:02:49.549> it<00:02:49.819> this<00:02:50.269> morning<00:02:50.660> I

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
and then controlling it this morning I

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.479 
and then controlling it this morning I
had<00:02:50.989> a<00:02:51.019> presentation<00:02:51.560> in<00:02:51.650> my<00:02:51.799> chinese<00:02:52.160> class

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
had a presentation in my chinese class

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.280

o'clock and then I can have fun the rest

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.430 
o'clock and then I can have fun the rest
of<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.420> night<00:03:35.569> and<00:03:35.720> then<00:03:35.840> do<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.079> same<00:03:36.230> thing

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
of the night and then do the same thing

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.860 
of the night and then do the same thing
sunday<00:03:36.829> but<00:03:37.370> Julia's<00:03:37.850> education<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.720> about

sunday but Julia's education is about

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.110 
sunday but Julia's education is about
much<00:03:39.260> more<00:03:39.290> than<00:03:39.650> just<00:03:39.950> books<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.670> studying

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120

assignment to just go out and measure

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.319 
assignment to just go out and measure
something<00:04:01.130> and<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.489> can<00:04:01.639> measure<00:04:01.760> anything<00:04:02.090> we

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
something and we can measure anything we

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:04.750 
something and we can measure anything we
want<00:04:02.540> and<00:04:02.720> so<00:04:03.260> I'm<00:04:03.620> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.310> attach

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
want and so I'm going to attach

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.660 
want and so I'm going to attach
accelerometers<00:04:05.720> to<00:04:06.019> my<00:04:06.350> feet<00:04:06.560> hips<00:04:07.100> shoulders

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
accelerometers to my feet hips shoulders

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.509 
accelerometers to my feet hips shoulders
and<00:04:07.970> wrists<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.870> do<00:04:09.410> a<00:04:09.440> giant<00:04:09.950> swing<00:04:10.130> which<00:04:10.370> is

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
and wrists and do a giant swing which is

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.000 
and wrists and do a giant swing which is
where<00:04:10.730> you

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
where you

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.949 
where you
bring<00:04:11.159> on<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.340> bar<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:12.269> straight<00:04:12.480> body<00:04:12.659> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
bring on the bar the straight body and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.720 
bring on the bar the straight body and
there's<00:04:13.680> two<00:04:13.860> directions<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.400> it<00:04:14.430> you<00:04:14.610> can

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
there's two directions to it you can

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.370 
there's two directions to it you can
fall<00:04:14.970> with<00:04:15.120> your<00:04:15.269> stomach<00:04:15.599> going<00:04:15.780> first<00:04:16.139> or

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
fall with your stomach going first or

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.599 
fall with your stomach going first or
you<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.620> fall<00:04:16.739> with<00:04:16.889> your<00:04:16.979> back<00:04:17.100> going<00:04:17.370> first

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
you can fall with your back going first

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.770 
you can fall with your back going first
and<00:04:17.760> I'm<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.419> measure<00:04:18.540> the

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
and I'm going to measure the

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.090 
and I'm going to measure the
acceleration<00:04:19.019> of<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.530> different<00:04:19.859> parts<00:04:20.070> of

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
acceleration of the different parts of

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.069 
acceleration of the different parts of
my<00:04:20.250> body<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:20.790> compare<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.479> dynamics<00:04:21.989> of

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
my body and just compare the dynamics of

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.020 
my body and just compare the dynamics of
the<00:04:22.199> two<00:04:22.350> skills<00:04:22.710> I<00:04:22.949> think<00:04:23.580> genetics

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
the two skills I think genetics

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.610 
the two skills I think genetics
definitely<00:04:24.389> helping<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.690> classroom<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:25.530> a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
definitely helping the classroom like a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.050 
definitely helping the classroom like a
lot<00:04:25.770> of<00:04:25.889> skills<00:04:26.130> are<00:04:26.280> really<00:04:26.370> challenging<00:04:26.940> to

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
lot of skills are really challenging to

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.189 
lot of skills are really challenging to
learn<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.479> they<00:04:27.539> take<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> really<00:04:28.020> long<00:04:28.050> time

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
learn and they take a really long time

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.750 
learn and they take a really long time
and<00:04:28.470> you<00:04:28.800> don't<00:04:28.979> get<00:04:29.070> it<00:04:29.190> on<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.370> first<00:04:29.520> try

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
and you don't get it on the first try

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.070 
and you don't get it on the first try
and<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.120> get<00:04:30.240> really<00:04:30.360> frustrated<00:04:30.900> and<00:04:30.960> it's

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
and you get really frustrated and it's

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.540 
and you get really frustrated and it's
really<00:04:31.350> similar<00:04:31.530> with<00:04:31.770> school<00:04:32.010> work<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:32.400> like

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
really similar with school work you like

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.740 
really similar with school work you like
see<00:04:32.760> this<00:04:32.880> problem<00:04:33.240> you're<00:04:33.360> looking<00:04:33.600> you're

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
see this problem you're looking you're

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.200 
see this problem you're looking you're
like<00:04:33.870> I<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.650> no<00:04:35.039> idea<00:04:35.520> how<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.729> do<00:04:36.000> this<00:04:36.030> and

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
like I have no idea how to do this and

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.400 
like I have no idea how to do this and
then<00:04:36.510> you<00:04:36.600> start<00:04:36.840> writing<00:04:37.139> down<00:04:37.169> the

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
then you start writing down the

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.140 
then you start writing down the
equations<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.250> just<00:04:38.400> keep<00:04:38.610> trying<00:04:38.910> and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
equations and you just keep trying and

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.750 
equations and you just keep trying and
keep<00:04:39.240> trying<00:04:39.419> and<00:04:39.810> finally<00:04:40.740> figure<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.639> out

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
keep trying and finally figure it out

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.960 
keep trying and finally figure it out
and<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.270> think<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.900> got<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.580> persistence<00:04:44.580> from

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
and I think I got that persistence from

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.750 
and I think I got that persistence from
gymnastics<00:04:45.289> for<00:04:46.289> the<00:04:46.470> future<00:04:46.949> it's<00:04:47.190> probably

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
gymnastics for the future it's probably

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.939 
gymnastics for the future it's probably
a<00:04:47.880> master's<00:04:48.479> a<00:04:48.510> mechanical<00:04:49.169> engineering<00:04:49.710> and

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
a master's a mechanical engineering and

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.300 
a master's a mechanical engineering and
then<00:04:50.070> a<00:04:50.100> job<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.729> the<00:04:50.789> robotics
