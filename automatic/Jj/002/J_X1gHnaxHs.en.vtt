00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
I think there is a key component of the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.110 
I think there is a key component of the
location<00:02:49.270> being<00:02:50.050> on<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> coast<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.520> our

the the sea is your all the sea is
always<00:03:05.980> there<00:03:06.160> on<00:03:06.400> island<00:03:06.820> your<00:03:06.940> 20<00:03:07.360> miles<00:03:07.540> by

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780

25 miles across you're never very far
from<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.360> sea<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.720> I<00:03:10.750> think<00:03:10.960> it<00:03:11.050> has<00:03:11.140> a<00:03:11.200> huge

that's<00:04:12.049> why<00:04:12.319> I'll<00:04:12.739> burn<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.549> peat<00:04:13.790> I<00:04:14.000> get

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
that's why I'll burn the peat I get

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.180 
that's why I'll burn the peat I get
people<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.569> taste<00:04:14.780> the<00:04:14.930> barley<00:04:15.290> when<00:04:16.099> you

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
people to taste the barley when you

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.310 
people to taste the barley when you
understand<00:04:16.609> where<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:16.940> comes<00:04:17.090> from<00:04:17.239> I<00:04:17.690> think

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
understand where it comes from I think

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.089 
understand where it comes from I think
there's<00:04:18.590> a<00:04:19.720> there's<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.810> shift<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.410> terms<00:04:21.769> of

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
there's a there's a shift in terms of

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:25.420 
there's a there's a shift in terms of
understanding<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:24.139> style<00:04:24.740> of<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.039> spirit

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
understanding the style of the spirit

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.450 
understanding the style of the spirit
and<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.639> essence<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.180> spirit<00:04:26.570> and<00:04:27.310> to<00:04:28.310> me

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
and the essence of the spirit and to me

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.460 
and the essence of the spirit and to me
there's<00:04:28.940> something<00:04:29.180> very<00:04:29.419> primal<00:04:30.020> about<00:04:30.229> this

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
there's something very primal about this

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.740 
there's something very primal about this
whiskey<00:04:30.919> this<00:04:31.789> is<00:04:31.940> about<00:04:32.120> sitting<00:04:32.449> around<00:04:32.599> the

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
whiskey this is about sitting around the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.999 
whiskey this is about sitting around the
fire<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.289> this<00:04:33.590> goes<00:04:33.889> back<00:04:34.240> millennia<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:36.009> I

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
fire and this goes back millennia and I

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.320 
fire and this goes back millennia and I
think<00:04:37.070> that's<00:04:37.490> one<00:04:37.759> of<00:04:37.789> the<00:04:37.940> things<00:04:37.970> that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
think that's one of the things that

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.580 
think that's one of the things that
everybody<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.830> identify<00:04:40.070> with<00:04:41.380> there<00:04:42.380> are<00:04:42.560> a

whiskey I asked you to take more than 10

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.890

seconds<00:05:32.290> to<00:05:32.410> enjoying<00:05:32.710> it<00:05:32.890> and<00:05:33.720> that's<00:05:34.720> the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
seconds to enjoying it and that's the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.600 
seconds to enjoying it and that's the
nature<00:05:35.080> of<00:05:35.230> Laphroaig<00:05:36.010> it's<00:05:36.220> the<00:05:36.310> nature<00:05:36.460> of

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
nature of Laphroaig it's the nature of

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.490 
nature of Laphroaig it's the nature of
single<00:05:36.940> malts<00:05:37.150> I<00:05:37.240> think<00:05:37.450> today<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:37.900> some<00:05:38.470> of

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
single malts I think today and some of

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.130 
single malts I think today and some of
them<00:05:38.710> are<00:05:38.920> a<00:05:39.100> bit<00:05:39.340> more<00:05:39.490> challenging<00:05:40.140> we

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140 
them are a bit more challenging we

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.870 
them are a bit more challenging we
talked<00:05:41.350> about<00:05:41.380> the<00:05:41.920> notion<00:05:42.220> of<00:05:42.310> you'll<00:05:42.640> get

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
talked about the notion of you'll get

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.390 
talked about the notion of you'll get
there<00:05:43.150> so<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:44.230> lot<00:05:44.500> of<00:05:44.530> times<00:05:44.800> it's<00:05:45.010> just<00:05:45.070> about

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
there so a lot of times it's just about

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.030 
there so a lot of times it's just about
taking<00:05:46.300> your<00:05:46.330> time<00:05:46.600> with<00:05:46.840> it<00:05:46.870> maybe<00:05:47.530> adding<00:05:47.980> a

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
taking your time with it maybe adding a

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.460 
taking your time with it maybe adding a
wee<00:05:48.190> bit<00:05:48.340> of<00:05:48.520> water<00:05:48.700> to<00:05:48.850> it<00:05:49.180> because<00:05:49.990> it'll

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
wee bit of water to it because it'll

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.460 
wee bit of water to it because it'll
open<00:05:50.680> it<00:05:50.950> up<00:05:51.300> it'll<00:05:52.300> soften<00:05:52.540> it<00:05:52.870> you'll<00:05:53.260> find

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
open it up it'll soften it you'll find

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.210 
open it up it'll soften it you'll find
other<00:05:53.710> layers<00:05:53.980> to<00:05:54.250> the<00:05:54.340> whiskey<00:05:55.140> so<00:05:56.140> it's<00:05:56.980> a

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
other layers to the whiskey so it's a
