safety<00:00:06.770> to<00:00:07.770> understand<00:00:08.370> how<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.670> make<00:00:08.970> a<00:00:09.000> car

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
safety to understand how to make a car

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.919 
safety to understand how to make a car
safe<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:10.019> need<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.410> understand<00:00:10.980> some<00:00:11.309> physics

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:11.929 
safe you need to understand some physics

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.640 
safe you need to understand some physics
momentum<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.110> force<00:00:15.139> momentum<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.529> the

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
momentum and force momentum is the

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.410 
momentum and force momentum is the
quality<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> an<00:00:17.400> object<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:17.940> makes<00:00:18.270> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
quality of an object that makes it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.200 
quality of an object that makes it
harder<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.779> stop<00:00:19.170> heavy<00:00:20.010> objects<00:00:20.670> are<00:00:20.880> harder

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
harder to stop heavy objects are harder

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.230 
harder to stop heavy objects are harder
to<00:00:21.240> stuffed<00:00:21.660> new<00:00:21.869> light<00:00:22.109> ones<00:00:22.580> fast<00:00:23.580> objects

to stuffed new light ones fast objects

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.259 
to stuffed new light ones fast objects
are<00:00:24.420> harder<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.810> stop<00:00:25.230> them<00:00:25.470> slow<00:00:25.800> ones<00:00:26.210> all<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
are harder to stop them slow ones all of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.290 
are harder to stop them slow ones all of
this<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.900> be<00:00:27.930> summed<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> equation

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
this can be summed up in the equation

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.870 
this can be summed up in the equation
momentum<00:00:30.300> equals<00:00:30.720> force<00:00:31.019> times<00:00:31.349> velocity

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.580 

this<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.940> why<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> large<00:00:36.719> object<00:00:37.350> like<00:00:37.559> a

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this is why a large object like a

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
this is why a large object like a
slow-moving<00:00:38.100> truck<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.850> still<00:00:39.059> caused<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> lot

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
slow-moving truck and still caused a lot

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.400 
slow-moving truck and still caused a lot
of<00:00:39.719> damage<00:00:40.100> it<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> lot<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.579> momentum

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
of damage it is a lot of momentum

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
of damage it is a lot of momentum
momentum<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.920> why<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.550> jump<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> bus

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
momentum is why you can jump on a bus

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.420 
momentum is why you can jump on a bus
and<00:00:45.539> land<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:46.110> much<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.770> same<00:00:47.039> spot

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
and land pretty much on the same spot

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.029 
and land pretty much on the same spot
your<00:00:48.210> body's<00:00:48.719> momentum<00:00:48.989> keeps<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.829> moving

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
your body's momentum keeps you moving

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
your body's momentum keeps you moving
through<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> air<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.239> pace<00:00:51.570> as<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
through the air at the same pace as the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.139 
through the air at the same pace as the
bus<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:53.129> what<00:00:53.340> would<00:00:53.550> happen<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
bus but what would happen at that

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.810 
bus but what would happen at that
instant<00:00:54.660> if<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> bus<00:00:55.110> stopped<00:00:55.500> that's<00:00:56.340> right

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
instant if the bus stopped that's right

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.490 
instant if the bus stopped that's right
you<00:00:57.000> would<00:00:57.149> bang<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> front<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> bus

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
you would bang into the front of the bus

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.380 
you would bang into the front of the bus
because<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.070> would<00:00:59.250> keep<00:00:59.489> moving<00:01:02.390> safety

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
because you would keep moving safety

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
because you would keep moving safety
features<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.140> car<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.559> name<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:05.189> stop<00:01:05.519> us

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
features in a car off a name to stop us

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
features in a car off a name to stop us
moving<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> car<00:01:06.630> stops<00:01:06.930> but<00:01:07.170> that's

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
moving when the car stops but that's

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
moving when the car stops but that's
only<00:01:07.619> part<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> story<00:01:09.979> if<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.310> stop<00:01:11.610> moving

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
only part of the story if we stop moving

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.719 
only part of the story if we stop moving
too<00:01:12.210> fast<00:01:12.570> we<00:01:12.930> will<00:01:13.080> get<00:01:13.320> damaged<00:01:13.770> another

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
too fast we will get damaged another

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.749 
too fast we will get damaged another
equation<00:01:15.270> explains<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:17.040> states<00:01:17.520> that

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
equation explains this it states that

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
equation explains this it states that
momentum<00:01:18.240> equals<00:01:18.600> Force<00:01:18.900> Times<00:01:18.990> time<00:01:19.409> in

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
momentum equals Force Times time in

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.760 
momentum equals Force Times time in
other<00:01:20.880> words<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.570> stop<00:01:21.840> suddenly<00:01:22.110> and

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
other words if you stop suddenly and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.550 
other words if you stop suddenly and
lots<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.100> forces<00:01:23.610> exerted<00:01:24.030> on<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> body<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:24.960> the

human body and lots of force means a lot
of<00:01:28.290> damage<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.400> want<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.939> stop<00:01:30.210> gradually

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
of damage so you want to stop gradually

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.980 
of damage so you want to stop gradually
seatbelts<00:01:32.640> stop<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.150> when<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.450> car<00:01:33.659> stops

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
seatbelts stop you when the car stops

but pretensioners make this happen more
gradually<00:01:36.920> crumple<00:01:37.920> zones<00:01:38.189> stop<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.820> whole

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
gradually crumple zones stop the whole

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.179 
gradually crumple zones stop the whole
car<00:01:39.210> more<00:01:39.420> gradually<00:01:40.140> reducing<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> forces

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

acting<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> occupants<00:01:42.619> airbags<00:01:43.619> stop

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
acting on the occupants airbags stop

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.249 
acting on the occupants airbags stop
your<00:01:44.280> head<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.670> brain<00:01:44.850> moving<00:01:45.299> gradually<00:01:46.079> so

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
your head and brain moving gradually so

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.990 
your head and brain moving gradually so
that<00:01:46.470> there<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.770> less<00:01:47.009> chance<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.640> head<00:01:47.790> trauma

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
that there is less chance of head trauma

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020 
that there is less chance of head trauma
in<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:49.140> these<00:01:49.350> cases<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.920> faster<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> car<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
in all these cases the faster the car is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
in all these cases the faster the car is
moving<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.720> crashes<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> more<00:01:52.619> forces

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
moving when it crashes the more forces

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.000 
moving when it crashes the more forces
the<00:01:53.310> body<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.820> be<00:01:53.939> put<00:01:54.180> under

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
the body will be put under

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.040 
the body will be put under
so<00:01:55.610> there<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.970> have<00:01:56.000> a<00:01:56.150> basic<00:01:56.570> introduction

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
so there you have a basic introduction

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.070 
so there you have a basic introduction
to<00:01:57.320> momentum<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:58.130> car<00:01:58.340> safety<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.060> hope<00:01:59.810> you

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
to momentum and car safety I hope you

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.500 
to momentum and car safety I hope you
enjoyed<00:02:00.470> it
