one and three three five to zero and
finally<00:01:27.259> here's<00:01:28.250> how<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.520> read<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.939> dial

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
finally here's how to read the dial

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.350 
finally here's how to read the dial
meter<00:01:30.220> you'll<00:01:31.220> need<00:01:31.369> to<00:01:31.490> read<00:01:31.700> the<00:01:31.850> first<00:01:32.119> five

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
meter you'll need to read the first five

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.600 
meter you'll need to read the first five
dials<00:01:32.810> from<00:01:32.990> left<00:01:33.229> to<00:01:33.290> right<00:01:33.560> making<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.430> note

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
dials from left to right making a note

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.670 
dials from left to right making a note
of<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:34.970> number<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:35.570> pointer<00:01:35.960> is<00:01:36.110> indicating

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
of the number the pointer is indicating

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.310 
of the number the pointer is indicating
if<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.759> pointer<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.299> between<00:01:38.659> two<00:01:38.930> numbers

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
if the pointer is between two numbers

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.010 
if the pointer is between two numbers
write<00:01:39.740> down<00:01:39.950> the<00:01:40.130> lower<00:01:40.310> figure<00:01:40.610> each<00:01:41.570> dial

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
write down the lower figure each dial

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.139 
write down the lower figure each dial
may<00:01:42.409> rotate<00:01:42.649> in<00:01:43.040> the<00:01:43.130> opposite<00:01:43.460> direction<00:01:43.610> to

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
may rotate in the opposite direction to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.950 
may rotate in the opposite direction to
the<00:01:44.240> one<00:01:44.390> before<00:01:44.570> it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
the one before it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960 
the one before it
so<00:01:45.290> check<00:01:45.530> which<00:01:45.770> way<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.189> numbers<00:01:46.520> are<00:01:46.610> going

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
so check which way the numbers are going

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.840 
so check which way the numbers are going
so<00:01:47.570> here<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.990> reading<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.500> eight<00:01:49.100> three<00:01:49.640> nine

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
so here the reading is eight three nine

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.319 
so here the reading is eight three nine
two<00:01:50.659> three<00:01:51.640> once<00:01:52.640> you've<00:01:52.850> read<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.119> meter
