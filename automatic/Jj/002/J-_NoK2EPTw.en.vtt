and up in 1 inch maybe 2 H of the most

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.080 
and up in 1 inch maybe 2 H of the most
increments<00:01:23.020> so<00:01:23.619> you<00:01:23.710> want<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.159> work<00:01:24.340> on<00:01:24.579> small

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
increments so you want to work on small

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.330 
increments so you want to work on small
precise<00:01:25.689> micro<00:01:26.200> movements<00:01:26.650> in<00:01:26.740> this<00:01:26.799> position

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
precise micro movements in this position

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.190 
precise micro movements in this position
which<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.150> healthier<00:01:28.540> on<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.780> knees<00:01:28.930> and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
which is healthier on the knees and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.590 
which is healthier on the knees and
creates<00:01:29.950> more<00:01:30.009> heat<00:01:30.430> in<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.060> vents<00:01:31.390> and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
creates more heat in the vents and

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.219 
creates more heat in the vents and
quickly<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.850> we're<00:01:34.479> gonna<00:01:34.570> pulse<00:01:34.810> until

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
quickly so we're gonna pulse until

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:36.929 
quickly so we're gonna pulse until
you're<00:01:35.619> getting<00:01:36.009> close<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.460> that<00:01:36.490> fatigue

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
you're getting close to that fatigue

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.389 
you're getting close to that fatigue
points<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:38.110> then<00:01:38.320> hold<00:01:38.590> at<00:01:38.829> the<00:01:38.950> bottom<00:01:39.280> of

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
points and then hold at the bottom of

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.609 
points and then hold at the bottom of
your<00:01:39.460> plie<00:01:39.820> we're<00:01:40.570> gonna<00:01:40.659> squeeze<00:01:41.259> the<00:01:41.500> ball
