00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello and welcome back today show 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.370
 I give you the modern household book 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 it is simply about the 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 Revenues were expected to increase 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.920
 to see how much i have in the month 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.349
 really what can i actually do 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.049
 spent and I have to look that me 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 do not live up to my circumstances 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.660
 on the left side we write the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.010
 costs with the receipts on the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.789
 right side write the post with the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.900
 expenditures 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.490
 I do it all in one 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.439
 excel table because members took out ends 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 all together credited to my balance 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.830
 that is, the difference how much draws 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.630
 I have at the end left we start 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.680
 Of course, each of us has a job 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.550
 let's go 1500 euros as income 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.530
 maybe one or the other yes 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 another next job of that today 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.559
 often still necessary because otherwise 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.230
 money in the back and the front is not enough 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.270
 side job we indicate with 165 euro 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.710
 for example and who some of my 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.180
 the attentively looked at the white videos 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.980
 Of course you can also use the internet money 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.539
 For example, earn with ebay 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.610
 auctions and many others 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.840
 possibilities and to write on 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.820
 the left side just what 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.899
 should come out about the end of the month 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.739
 in our income 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.329
 that means not only 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.100
 internet shops you can 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.780
 For example, be that one texts 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.489
 now writes something good as well 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 I already have internet shops 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.390
 a video can be made 50 euro times 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.030
 easy to get around, but maybe 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.140
 also so that you still get child support 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.580
 or any other form of 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.259
 support writes it all down 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.869
 the left side on the positive side 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.920
 where has the revenues are 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.780
 for simplicity's sake now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.009
 but sometimes the child benefit and the side job 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 and we only refer to that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.130
 what I also do videos say 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.930
 Internet shops like the text 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.640
 Now let's go over to the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.560
 first of all we have issues 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.729
 Of course the rent we have to each place 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.710
 pay our apartment 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.750
 Then there are additional costs such as 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.939
 electricity or gas is not exactly 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.420
 give cheap 500 euros for the rent 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.009
 in electricity and gas 120 euros I think so 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.740
 a realistic value is what that is 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.930
 we currently pay the most expensive 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.340
 toy of us most of the car too 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.820
 to go shopping for work 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.049
 reach 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.119
 here for example with a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.189
 finance 150 euro times that too 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.200
 realistic and the car needs 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.000
 Of course, insurance or yes 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.719
 Generally a lot of insurance in the 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.100
 normal case of accidents or 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.899
 disability or anything 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 confesses you as well as determined 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.310
 be around 200 euro come together 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 then gasoline for the car 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.700
 is a very sweeping story I 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.319
 give now 100 euros to that you have to 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.209
 just flip over when you're at ford 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.700
 has recorded how much you have 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.319
 really consumes a riester pension 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.000
 for retirement or any 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.590
 another form of old-age provision with 50 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.430
 Euro 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.900
 maybe you are just like me 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.150
 We have a home savings needs 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.440
 Of course, money every month and so on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.700
 Slowly our gram is feeling out 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 list a very important point of course 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 also eat food what do we need 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.790
 easy on food every month 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.200
 Let's see how much you pay pro 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.620
 week and then extrapolate on the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.060
 Month gasoline and food is 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.019
 It can be very very flat 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.489
 Of course, be that one once 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.959
 less use the next again 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.000
 For example, we think more about the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.459
 barbecue season where we through more for 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.780
 Eat out, maybe we have too 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.780
 to repay another loan 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.680
 here to beech beats with 50 euros 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.120
 and so we really try 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.530
 to write down everything extensively 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.790
 For example, we still have money 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.620
 Take off in the month when we go with you 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.470
 pay cash we would have 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.030
 internet mobile landline phone easy 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.769
 really all write in what a 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.239
 spending on it falls to us that 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.220
 can count against ours 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.780
 revenue and then we see at the end 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.030
 we simply have enough income around 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.379
 to cover our expenses or do we live 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.730
 about our relationships 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.659
 that means either we have ours 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.099
 conditions and screws 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.840
 For example, you can credit yes too 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.640
 when you have paid off you would be back 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.230
 less exit or we have to look 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.610
 that we simply make more money with 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.190
 a side job with an extra income 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.019
 if you need help writing 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.390
 i just have many ideas i have 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.920
 can support it and that is 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.019
 just the whole thing like the modern one 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 Budget book works and in excel 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.959
 find it extremely practical because of this 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.549
 You can always keep the table up to date 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.720
 in contrast, if you look at paper 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.440
 also writes must always new 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 do 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.260
 thanks for the attention and see you 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.260
 next video
