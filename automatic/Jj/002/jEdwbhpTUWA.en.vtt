you delete the patch and do it offline

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.789 
you delete the patch and do it offline
but<00:00:12.179> if<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.330> come<00:00:12.480> over<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:13.110> used<00:00:13.620> to<00:00:13.710> be

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
but if you come over here you used to be

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.410 
but if you come over here you used to be
able<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.009> just<00:00:14.280> kind<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.519> jump<00:00:14.820> backwards<00:00:15.299> or

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
able to just kind of jump backwards or

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.510 
able to just kind of jump backwards or
if<00:00:15.509> you<00:00:15.630> just<00:00:15.660> wait<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.890> hold<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.460> to

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
if you just wait you can hold a to

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.650 
if you just wait you can hold a to
basically<00:00:17.910> climb<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.330> you<00:00:18.390> could<00:00:18.510> get<00:00:18.630> on

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
basically climb but you could get on

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.120 
basically climb but you could get on
this<00:00:18.840> ledge<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> pretty<00:00:19.439> cool<00:00:19.619> spot<00:00:19.890> and

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
this ledge it's a pretty cool spot and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.320 
this ledge it's a pretty cool spot and
you<00:00:20.189> can<00:00:20.220> see<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> lot<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> map<00:00:20.970> from<00:00:21.090> there

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
you can see a lot of the map from there

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640 
you can see a lot of the map from there
however<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.050> patched<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.350> can<00:00:22.529> no<00:00:22.619> longer

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
however it is patched you can no longer

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.500 
however it is patched you can no longer
do<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> spot<00:00:24.000> over<00:00:24.180> here<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.390> can

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
do it and in the spot over here you can

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.790 
do it and in the spot over here you can
just<00:00:24.600> come<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.990> hood<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.289> truck<00:00:25.619> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
just come to the hood of this truck and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.250 
just come to the hood of this truck and
Crouch<00:00:26.099> jump<00:00:26.400> into<00:00:26.789> this<00:00:26.939> little<00:00:27.449> fan<00:00:27.869> area

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
Crouch jump into this little fan area

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
Crouch jump into this little fan area
it's<00:00:28.439> pretty<00:00:28.560> cool<00:00:28.830> just<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.910> too<00:00:30.060> bad<00:00:30.179> you

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's pretty cool just it's too bad you

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.849 
it's pretty cool just it's too bad you
can't<00:00:30.330> actually<00:00:30.630> do<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:30.869> online<00:00:31.019> anymore<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
can't actually do it online anymore and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.440 
can't actually do it online anymore and
I<00:00:31.949> believe<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> still<00:00:32.969> do<00:00:33.090> this<00:00:33.239> spot

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
I believe you can still do this spot

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.520 
I believe you can still do this spot
online<00:00:33.719> if<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> come<00:00:33.989> over<00:00:34.110> here<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.410> can

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
online if you come over here you can

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.410 
online if you come over here you can
just<00:00:34.649> jump<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.219> onto<00:00:35.579> this<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.910> pipe<00:00:36.120> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
just jump to onto this little pipe and

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.030 
just jump to onto this little pipe and
you're<00:00:36.870> technically<00:00:37.320> outside<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> map<00:00:37.950> and

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
you're technically outside the map and

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
you're technically outside the map and
you<00:00:38.100> can<00:00:38.160> just<00:00:38.399> kind<00:00:38.550> of<00:00:38.579> crouch<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.030> hide<00:00:39.480> so

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
you can just kind of crouch and hide so

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.150 
you can just kind of crouch and hide so
it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.350> good<00:00:40.530> spot<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:41.010> pretty

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
it is a pretty good spot and I'm pretty

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.260 
it is a pretty good spot and I'm pretty
sure<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> can<00:00:41.489> still<00:00:41.670> do<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.969> one<00:00:42.120> online

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sure you can still do that one online

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.690 
sure you can still do that one online
and<00:00:42.890> pretty<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> rest<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.430> spots

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
and pretty much the rest of the spots

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.790 
and pretty much the rest of the spots
are<00:00:44.940> really<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.840> too<00:00:46.050> great<00:00:46.289> ends<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
are really not too great ends as a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.049 
are really not too great ends as a
matter<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.010> fact<00:00:47.190> were<00:00:47.309> denied<00:00:47.610> of<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> lot<00:00:48.030> of

the dolphin dive to get on top of the
forklift<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.350> into<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.710> barrels<00:00:58.980> there<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.219> a

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
forklift and into the barrels there is a

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.470 
forklift and into the barrels there is a
certain<00:00:59.550> part<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> forklift<00:01:00.239> where<00:01:00.420> you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
certain part of the forklift where you

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
certain part of the forklift where you
can<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.750> press<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> climb<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.800> ever

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
can just press a to climb so if you ever

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.080 
can just press a to climb so if you ever
want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.460> spot<00:01:02.670> just<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:03.000> that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
want to get to that spot just take that

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.969 
want to get to that spot just take that
into<00:01:03.300> consideration<00:01:03.390> over<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.799> showing

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
into consideration over here I'm showing

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.520 
into consideration over here I'm showing
these<00:01:05.280> camper<00:01:06.180> buildings<00:01:06.630> by<00:01:06.869> B<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.470> I

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
these camper buildings by B because I

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.109 
these camper buildings by B because I
know<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> lot<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.189> people<00:01:08.460> camp<00:01:08.700> here<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.000> it's

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
know a lot of people camp here and it's

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.399 
know a lot of people camp here and it's
the<00:01:09.210> main<00:01:09.330> reason<00:01:09.360> why<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.080> do<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.350> like

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the main reason why I really do not like
