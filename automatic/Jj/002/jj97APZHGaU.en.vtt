00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.710
 I would like us to put that other part where it says official churches 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.279
 What is interesting why it is 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.849
 there we will see 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.009
 this series of recordings here we have some dates and it would have to be a 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.279
 little the first entries of the earth 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.600
 but in some geographic charts the productive markets are the maps of 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:22.650
 films of them 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.369
 what to speak besides the discovery of certain areas of water and well what 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.550
 hot and lies 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.460
 in the middle of the big ice they call them the mossos pollin days 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.640
 and in politics because in the sea of ​​flight 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.890
 'my market map 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.570
 from the dead ground here the right side of said bélver 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.850
 l minutes 47 days pop araya 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.490
 He came back impressed 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.940
 because the entry signature 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.670
 place on April 13 and in the and began to see vegetation and I can not 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.290
 work on the giant and he began to feel 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.650
 a warm wind and if instead of a cold wind it will move in the north pole 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.750
 environment there is obviously a base that is known as the base amundsen-scott the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.889
 opportunity to fly 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:02.889
 just and then return with the Chilean army 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.730
 the interesting thing was 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.860
 you get to a place that we are now going to watch video 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.610
 and they do not let you in 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.100
 but there were a number of those who had the opportunity not only inside but 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.470
 by the lighted cameras 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.300
 record what they were watching 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.520
 i effectively base this amundsen 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.480
 watching 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.090
 from space the south pole because you can not fly 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.040
 beyond the 82nd parallel you can not even though there is said to be a flight 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.660
 transpolar does not exist the transpolar flight 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.560
 it does not exist that is to fly from for example from eua the aires to south africa 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.450
 it's much easier 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.060
 or from buenos aires santiago australia you can not and is that fly 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.170
 because you can not because it's forbidden by fao so the association 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.289
 which is responsible for regulating air routes as well as the north pole 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:51.299
 there is no flight after flying 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.299
 in the arctic apart either by the same situation 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.560
 look for example this is one of those photographs 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.600
 so but so censored because it clearly shows us the opening these of its 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.899
 interest the water is not going to be mined as well as it would run of state look 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:07.260
 this is what I was saying 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.120
 this part with taking out the portfolio this Antarctic top this is a take the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.460
 Chavez from the satellite that is asking us if there is something big that is 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.399
 missing there 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.089
 now degenkolb the video 

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:19.359
 because we are going to see 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.009
 as effectively when you enter the amundsen-scott base 

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:26.129
 the base muñiz in is one of these bases that goes directly into Antarctica and 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.879
 which serves precisely 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.949
 to have it 

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:34.629
 the control not only of what the weather is and all the storms that 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.810
 if you do not have a clear research base 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.129
 that you can only go 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.359
 two months a year forlán cleaning and did not ritó 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.629
 you have the opportunity of more 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.349
 Of course the problem is still there Chilean or Argentine or Polish or 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.050
 german 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.029
 this is the base 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:55.289
 look what's going to look like on the computer that gets peeled and you know that 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.670
 with this kind of research 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.809
 that only costs five hours in this place 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:03.639
 hence that screen is what the Antarctic part is taking precisely 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.470
 from space 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.470
 the same as we saw the 211 indigne his 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.889
 look at something big that the one that is missing now let's go in that hole 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:15.529
 does the woman or would be the sphincter of the earth 

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:19.519
 the south part of the poles, this is said by all contactees who enter there 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.029
 constantly opens up as a kind of breathing planet both the 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:24.089
 north as the south 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:25.389
 there is a book 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.599
 of a person who aspired to see in several years entered by a pole that 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.749
 came out for another 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.469
 but the interesting thing is that it closely resembles what we see in the divine 

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:33.999
 comedy 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.349
 more or less contemporary the divine comedy 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.839
 in those times there was not this type of the technological one who falls there 

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.489
 Spanish conquered several thousand Spanish ships 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.450
 that they were traveling through Argentina for that part yes without that in their journals 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.529
 it is written that they came to see it is estimated that this is one meter high 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.029
 Now that I've done 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.479
 patagonia does mean big foot if it is like this the avai agony 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.800
 please the men that had been clear and more 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.079
 a lot was coming but it is already being hour they would have seen the inhabitants 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.440
 from the earth good way I doubt it 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.130
 let's imagine that the golden legend has lasted, they were always there 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.410
 and they were referring to a continent of gold 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.820
 with a king of gold or at least a dress bathed in gold and what a curious francisco 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.560
 step on the transports 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.259
 percent and cow head all of them 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:29.939
 affirm the same things 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:33.339
 then came really looking for another young continent and adjusting 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.629
 riches as said 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.279
 they ended up taking 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:37.409
 what conclusion 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:40.680
 percent we get closer to the earth basin is 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.449
 parakeet 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.009
 we go to the last game to the last one that tells us about the cnc about others 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.919
 planets not only the earth 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.289
 also other planets or how curious as when I photographed 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.340
 jupiter niese furious as always put a patch always 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.419
 they always put it on all the planets there are times that I have seen it 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.060
 also saturn dance the hiv look when you start to see the horizon 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.190
 they start to change when they have the first shots because there is a channel 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.350
 nasa open some satellites 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.330
 obviously the same thing happens to him but he always suffers the obvious censorship 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.319
 I do not like a judge 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:17.129
 in some other way some or lawyers noticed all not because some 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.379
 even as a fossil in sky we talked the last time 

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.520
 they are artificial 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.320
 but if most of them have this configuration 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.970
 because they are not simple retouch why we never have a shot from 

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.260
 above that allows you to see the poles that open and close because they hide the 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.999
 truth of the planet to the human race 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:38.049
 I frankly ignore why I would have to hide it however we 

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:42.589
 end up taking for the neighboring country esophagus mouth a nine born in the draft 

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:46.399
 back I'm a little sauce are handled two alternatives of which 

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:48.240
 how things were already so bad 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.339
 one of the alternatives was maybe for inside like the moles 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.849
 There is an anecdote from the contactees who state that Marquez still has the 

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.110
 underground life 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.379
 the Martians to be passing through that I do not know if they're never under 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:03.419
 and the hotel amerian Martians call them arturia norms that mark 

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:07.689
 not that I know too much for me turned out to be arturo marte 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:08.919
 is a star 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.650
 that I would not come to the Asturians 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.770
 If they have a basis, it's a different story, so good for Rabat. 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.069
 a truth we would never accept to mate couples 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:22.369
 there is a book of people who believe that with banic in which it leaves on one of the fingers of a 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.499
 hand no no there is a new book that leaves early next year 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.110
 they should make it called 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.869
 the story was wrong I was going 

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:32.989
 and has evidence and shows evidence of what you just said about Ecuador 

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:36.209
 this hole that we are going to leave here, we were not given much 

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:40.020
 materials interviews and all the looting and punishing to spend the holidays we're going 

00:06:40.019 --> 00:06:40.940
 talk about this 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.900
 and let's also talk about why the Mayans suddenly disappeared the 600 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.669
 pesos 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.740
 and stop excusing yourself with the tunnels to which the one that spoke of weapons 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.360
 central park we are focused on giving a quick goal guys we are going to 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.340
 chia peace 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.399
 and we were promised in tuxtla gutiérrez is the workshop of indigo constellations 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.430
 you know all my pages formative space points 3 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.969
 besides her phone 

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:03.090
 1 21 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.319
 48 23 1 21 48 23 of tuxtla gutiérrez moya on Saturday and Sunday 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:11.249
 in that workshop and see you here next with many thanks 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:12.729
 thank you 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:15.369
 let's go to the pictures of him he published the first novel
