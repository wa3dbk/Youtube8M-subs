welcome<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.770> part<00:00:01.979> 3<00:00:02.340> of<00:00:02.370> Megaman<00:00:02.909> 1<00:00:03.120> and<00:00:03.419> now

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
welcome to part 3 of Megaman 1 and now

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.590 
welcome to part 3 of Megaman 1 and now
we<00:00:04.440> go<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:05.040> hardest<00:00:05.400> Robot<00:00:05.940> Master<00:00:05.970> stage

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
we go to the hardest Robot Master stage

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.100 
we go to the hardest Robot Master stage
Iceman<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:08.370> ice<00:00:08.550> climber<00:00:08.970> dude<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.809> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
Iceman the ice climber dude is the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.480 
Iceman the ice climber dude is the
hardest<00:00:10.969> stage<00:00:12.410> yeah<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.740> would<00:00:14.370> actually

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
hardest stage yeah I would actually

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:15.860 
hardest stage yeah I would actually
agree<00:00:14.700> I'd<00:00:14.910> say<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.299> even<00:00:15.570> harder<00:00:15.839> than

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
agree I'd say this is even harder than

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.109 
agree I'd say this is even harder than
the<00:00:15.990> wily<00:00:16.440> Castle<00:00:16.890> that's<00:00:17.160> my<00:00:17.400> personal

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the wily Castle that's my personal

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.700 
the wily Castle that's my personal
opinion<00:00:18.539> but<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.779> don't<00:00:18.990> think<00:00:19.170> as<00:00:19.289> quite<00:00:19.560> as

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
opinion but I don't think as quite as

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.380 
opinion but I don't think as quite as
her<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.189> wily<00:00:20.550> Castle<00:00:20.970> cuz<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> have

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
her this is a wily Castle cuz I have

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.170 
her this is a wily Castle cuz I have
done<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.750> without<00:00:21.810> using<00:00:22.199> the<00:00:22.439> magnet<00:00:22.769> beam

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
done it without using the magnet beam

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.870 
done it without using the magnet beam
but<00:00:24.180> good<00:00:24.330> luck<00:00:24.539> doing<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.019> though<00:00:28.160> slow<00:00:29.160> down

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
but good luck doing it though slow down

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.590 
but good luck doing it though slow down
I<00:00:30.800> know<00:00:31.800> no<00:00:32.040> water<00:00:32.279> physics<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.390> he

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
I know no water physics for you so he

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.530 
I know no water physics for you so he
jumps<00:00:33.870> normally<00:00:34.940> what's<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.120> point<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
jumps normally what's the point of the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
jumps normally what's the point of the
water<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:38.030> to<00:00:39.030> make<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> slightly

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
water then to make it a slightly

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.560 
water then to make it a slightly
different<00:00:39.930> shade<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.110> green

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
different shade of green

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.610 
different shade of green
well<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.600> start<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.110> think<00:00:43.140> about<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
well I start to think about the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.290 
well I start to think about the
mouvement<00:00:46.399> suppose<00:00:47.399> that's<00:00:47.700> an<00:00:47.850> improvement

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
mouvement suppose that's an improvement

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
mouvement suppose that's an improvement
yeah<00:00:49.289> you're<00:00:49.920> right<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.309> doesn't<00:00:50.460> make<00:00:50.610> sense

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
yeah you're right it doesn't make sense

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.200 
yeah you're right it doesn't make sense
he's<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> robot<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.570> should<00:00:51.780> sink<00:00:53.090> but<00:00:54.090> it

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
he's a robot you should sink but it

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
he's a robot you should sink but it
should<00:00:54.360> still<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.629> water<00:00:54.899> physics<00:00:55.230> though<00:00:55.649> but

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
should still be water physics though but

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.050 
should still be water physics though but
whatever

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 
whatever

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.920 
whatever

and<00:01:00.930> now<00:01:01.079> Mega<00:01:01.469> Man's<00:01:01.680> momentum<00:01:02.160> problems<00:01:02.489> are

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
and now Mega Man's momentum problems are

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
and now Mega Man's momentum problems are
meant<00:01:02.879> old<00:01:03.090> applied<00:01:03.359> even<00:01:03.570> further<00:01:03.780> but<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
meant old applied even further but the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.340 
meant old applied even further but the
fact<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.530> ice<00:01:04.970> Luigi<00:01:06.770> we<00:01:08.750> that's<00:01:09.750> great<00:01:10.110> I

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
fact of ice Luigi we that's great I

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.950 
fact of ice Luigi we that's great I
loved<00:01:10.770> playing<00:01:11.070> as<00:01:11.400> Luigi<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.060> gala<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.659> shoot

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
loved playing as Luigi and gala to shoot

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.120 
loved playing as Luigi and gala to shoot
that<00:01:13.110> things<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.530> from<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> start<00:01:13.920> you'll

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that things right from the start you'll

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.609 
that things right from the start you'll
kill<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.150> look<00:01:15.659> it's<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> phasing

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
kill that so and look it's the phasing

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
kill that so and look it's the phasing
blocks<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.189> their<00:01:17.310> first<00:01:17.520> appearance<00:01:18.380> you

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
blocks in their first appearance you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.289 
blocks in their first appearance you
don't<00:01:19.560> have<00:01:19.740> rush<00:01:20.040> jet<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
don't have rush jet and this can do you

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.929 
don't have rush jet and this can do you
no<00:01:21.689> good<00:01:22.130> uses<00:01:23.130> hang<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> beam<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.909> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
no good uses hang the beam here but I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.890 
no good uses hang the beam here but I
need<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> save<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.479> for<00:01:24.630> later<00:01:26.210> you're<00:01:27.210> harder

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
need to save it for later you're harder

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.429 
need to save it for later you're harder
phasing<00:01:28.770> black<00:01:29.009> no<00:01:31.820> goddamn<00:01:32.820> remember<00:01:33.750> this

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
phasing black no goddamn remember this

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.859 
phasing black no goddamn remember this
is<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.860> months<00:01:35.369> ago<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.540> were<00:01:36.630> having

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
is a months ago you mean you were having

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.719 
is a months ago you mean you were having
a<00:01:36.930> Skype<00:01:37.110> conversation<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.070> was<00:01:38.490> playing

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
a Skype conversation and I was playing

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.090 
a Skype conversation and I was playing
Mega<00:01:38.939> Man<00:01:39.180> 1<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:40.350> told<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.710> was<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> high

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
Mega Man 1 and I told you I was in high

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.960 
Mega Man 1 and I told you I was in high
stage<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.430> yeah<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.729> out<00:01:44.880> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
stage I was here yeah and I was out of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.289 
stage I was here yeah and I was out of
magnet<00:01:45.360> beam<00:01:46.310> now<00:01:47.310> it's<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.759> hard<00:01:47.970> it's

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
magnet beam now it's not that hard it's

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.280 
magnet beam now it's not that hard it's
just<00:01:48.390> yeah<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.159> part<00:01:51.229> platforms<00:01:52.229> you

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just yeah it's this part platforms you

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.630 
just yeah it's this part platforms you
have<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.409> jump<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.770> while<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.130> shoot<00:01:53.369> at<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
have to jump on while they shoot at you

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.069 
have to jump on while they shoot at you
and<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.119> random<00:01:54.479> directions<00:01:54.509> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and they go in random directions so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.810 
and they go in random directions so
there<00:01:55.320> could<00:01:55.439> be<00:01:55.470> minutes<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.219> end<00:01:56.579> where

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
there could be minutes on end where

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
there could be minutes on end where
they're<00:01:56.969> not<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.329> position<00:01:57.360> where<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:57.960> can

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
they're not in a position where you can

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.250 
they're not in a position where you can
jump<00:01:58.350> from<00:01:58.530> them

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
jump from them

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.400 
jump from them
yeah<00:02:01.260> it's<00:02:01.530> not<00:02:01.680> fun<00:02:02.190> we<00:02:02.720> jeez<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.990> drop<00:02:04.230> so

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
yeah it's not fun we jeez you drop so

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.760 
yeah it's not fun we jeez you drop so
freakin<00:02:04.770> fast<00:02:05.120> don't<00:02:06.120> die<00:02:06.530> fuck

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
freakin fast don't die fuck

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.670 
freakin fast don't die fuck
so<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.980> guess<00:02:08.340> those<00:02:08.580> flipping<00:02:09.119> platforms<00:02:09.869> soon

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
so I guess those flipping platforms soon
