00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.799 

that's<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:08.299> tree<00:00:08.540> the<00:00:08.780> camera<00:00:09.200> was

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809

right<00:00:12.809> here's<00:00:13.230> where<00:00:13.619> the<00:00:13.799> TP<00:00:14.190> was

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
right here's where the TP was

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:25.749 
right here's where the TP was
so<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:17.400> right<00:00:17.730> here's<00:00:18.150> where<00:00:18.450> I<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:18.750> standing

away from me and now I'm going to the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:01:17.160 
away from me and now I'm going to the
tree<00:00:39.120> where<00:00:41.120> squeaker<00:00:42.120> was

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:56.090 

see<00:01:24.220> let's<00:01:25.220> see

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
um now let him up here I can't figure

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:14.880 
um now let him up here I can't figure
out<00:02:01.960> which<00:02:02.140> tree<00:02:02.470> was<00:02:02.500> Oh<00:02:11.670> apparently<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
out which tree was Oh apparently this is

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.120 
out which tree was Oh apparently this is
the<00:02:14.920> tree<00:02:15.340> right<00:02:15.580> here<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:20.080> squeaker<00:02:20.769> was<00:02:20.980> in

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
the tree right here that squeaker was in

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.990 
the tree right here that squeaker was in
front<00:02:21.459> of<00:02:21.580> but<00:02:25.739> there's<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.890> white<00:02:27.280> tree<00:02:27.700> right

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
front of but there's a white tree right

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.590 
front of but there's a white tree right
there

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:50.660

I don't know now it was right it wasn't

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:36.160 
I don't know now it was right it wasn't
this<00:03:20.990> tree<00:03:23.200> was<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.500> one<00:03:24.740> I<00:03:34.840> mean<00:03:35.840> it<00:03:36.050> was

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
this tree was this one I mean it was

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:51.340 
this tree was this one I mean it was
standing<00:03:37.540> right<00:03:38.540> here<00:03:39.760> yeah

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.280 

it's<00:03:51.950> up<00:03:52.070> here<00:03:52.250> from<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.610> tree<00:03:53.020> was<00:03:54.020> right

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
it's up here from the tree was right

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.920 
it's up here from the tree was right
there<00:03:55.180> but<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.360> tree<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.970> camera<00:03:59.390> was<00:03:59.510> on<00:03:59.660> is

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
there but the tree the camera was on is

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.470 
there but the tree the camera was on is
right<00:04:00.140> there<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.710> spot<00:04:01.280> and<00:04:01.670> see<00:04:02.210> it<00:04:02.330> from

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
right there on that spot and see it from

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:19.159 
right there on that spot and see it from
here<00:04:02.690> pretty<00:04:03.020> easily

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.280 

turn<00:04:20.169> went<00:04:20.440> up<00:04:20.530> there<00:04:20.769> to<00:04:20.949> stand<00:04:21.190> by<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.549> tree

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
turn went up there to stand by the tree

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.800 
turn went up there to stand by the tree
where<00:04:23.290> we<00:04:23.440> thought<00:04:23.710> squeaker<00:04:24.310> Hall<00:04:24.550> was

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
where we thought squeaker Hall was

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.810 
where we thought squeaker Hall was
standing<00:04:26.100> but<00:04:27.100> we<00:04:27.460> now<00:04:27.669> see<00:04:29.370> ya<00:04:30.370> there<00:04:30.610> about

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
standing but we now see ya there about

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.710 
standing but we now see ya there about
the<00:04:30.970> same<00:04:31.000> size<00:04:36.180> quicker<00:04:37.180> could<00:04:37.479> have<00:04:37.570> been<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
the same size quicker could have been a

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:52.090 
the same size quicker could have been a
little<00:04:37.840> bit<00:04:38.020> taller

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.700 

train<00:04:53.030> thinks<00:04:53.450> the<00:04:53.600> squeaker<00:04:54.140> was<00:04:54.320> standing

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
train thinks the squeaker was standing

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.250 
train thinks the squeaker was standing
by<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.100> tree<00:04:55.870> so<00:04:56.870> we're<00:04:57.080> going<00:04:57.170> to

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
by that tree so we're going to

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:50.460 
by that tree so we're going to
photograph<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.070> compare<00:04:58.700> it<00:05:07.120> okay

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.530 

you
