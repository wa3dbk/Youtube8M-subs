00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.170
 color I found out of here now 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.060
 and to get it he is 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.890
 first of all, these exchangers now in the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.149
 video will show as your crew 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.620
 I'll hire you, of course 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.790
 on the next comes and in the video 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.649
 description so you grab this 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.120
 just need to copy the people 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.649
 my nature are those who have this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.640
 hack scout already set so now 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.379
 the weko drive 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.760
 if you do not have them in there too 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.440
 conclusive then you just have to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.059
 go to my first pentrop video there 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.890
 I explained it exactly like him 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.870
 to set the sam's club 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.730
 at least if we then in the box 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.350
 are when we first clip 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.120
 make it a perfect one 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.410
 can make matt paint and for that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.550
 we will first become one 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.620
 buy matt lacquer 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.270
 Of course he does not care which one 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 is if you then a matte finish 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.570
 From there he goes to the categories metallic 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.830
 There is a color out there it is very 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.150
 important that the new driver is out 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.159
 and do not buy then you go again 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.990
 back to the menu and change that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.340
 license plate , of course, too 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.200
 he does not care which one again 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.369
 now choose now you go back to the 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.900
 paint and now you can too 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.030
 already see that you are a perfect on 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.920
 your power can make an explanation and 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
 Here he is now the color pure money 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.430
 when he turns yellow on this race 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.110
 Pearl effect on your car then can 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.729
 you already select your crew color 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.110
 in that case, of course, this is it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.180
 neon orange if you changed that then 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.009
 and then you will already see 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.869
 that we now have this cool neon orange 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 Pearl effect on your car raps 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.740
 Anyway, I can give you all this 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.119
 cool effect highly recommend because 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 you really are right out of the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.840
 mass forth on the streets of los 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.920
 santos you already see how crass in the video 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.899
 looks and i can really get you out 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.670

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.649
 more lights up and looks even crass 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 and yes if you like this video 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.969
 paintshop wants to see videos of me 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.380
 then just leave me a ladder 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.430

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.430
