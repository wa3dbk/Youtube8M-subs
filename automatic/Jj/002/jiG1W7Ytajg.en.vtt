00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.150
 well it it everybody knows that there 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.090
 is welcome on this new video 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.800
 on destiny so I will introduce you 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.189
 the second character I chose 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.869
 so so hunters know at the third 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 i will introduce arcanes east 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.510
 so organist these styles the mage the one 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:49.300
 that she's a bit of super powers 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:50.650
 finally powers and all that my two 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.720
 latest videos it will be on a 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.720
 domination walkie 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.590
 arcane east sap was the one who got me who 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
 I actually liked them I chose them because 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.700
 that finally it was the last one I had 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.950
 learned I made titans hunters and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.730
 after arcanes east and arcane east 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.140
 happily that I put a last year 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.530
 because I did not go because I 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.330
 did not really like it at all 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 here we already have we fly further 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.840
 not a jetpack so to smoke it that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.280
 would all be a little weird 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:48.180
 a little cave we will go we want 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.420
 find beginners or not it moves 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.810
 a lot so we have a super power 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.250
 so the hand the melee head it takes 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 I think that absorbs to have 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.360
 precisely the super attack 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:11.220
 so that's the end of your eight years that I was 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.350
 almost all unlocked grenade g 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.830
 vortex hovering good of november sheets 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.420
 arkanic wisdom energy is rich in 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.690
 see landing cheat of vortex var 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.000
 and order in castrol so the vertex 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.650
 this is a kind of dry a kind of 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.620
 super big fine attack instead of the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:37.110
 grenade I will use I used if 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.459
 I find enemies here is hop you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.910
 were all that goes in and that 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.820
 but really really not quote 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.800
 who who dies what but after 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:53.300
 it's not like the flash grenette that 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.300
 is much more useful on titan 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.239
 hop hop hop so I make you a 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.530
 small mission with each character and on 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:27.280
 these resignations that maybe already already 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:29.560
 does I also go to 25% there I know 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:48.069
 that there are enemies by German and 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:53.230
 Lorient does not have anything to fake is 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:56.340
 a ship no they came back 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.340
 so yeah that sounds very fast years 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.850
 and here is the super-g so here it is 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:13.850
 attack a little stylus but must really 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.710
 to really be on what good is it 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.860
 it's a bit of a hassle 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.860
 that's it 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:26.990
 it's because she prefers arkani this 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.530
 time to do ten times more titans and 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.550
 hunters but for now I do not know 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:42.729
 not really, but not at all 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:47.229
 take a scalpel shit up 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.229
 ok so two I think that will be enough 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.509
 fuck 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:18.999
 oh yes so my race for for bow thing 

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:21.579
 at nice you have low she is awake 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:28.439
 it's guys a little weird blue weird 

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:28.439
 I did not really understand them 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.970
 here 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.950
 so I won a little trick yes 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.020
 so the dance changes too 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.960
 so I have a different gatling 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:02.900
 I call that the four lines these 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:06.260
 submachine guns this is ship that 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.180
 drop enemies from time to time 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.590
 is that it is not stable at all good 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.020
 at the same time it would be a practicality seen 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:16.430
 the most that I remove them so the 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.230
 ammo really lies but 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.730
 rarely is it ammunition 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.070
 violet 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.900
 so that gives according to these different 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.040
 it changes the canvas and ammunition they 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.970
 can give a lot they can 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.460
 give a lot or nothing at all 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:35.780
 so here it was for arcane 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:37.550
 east I think so I find it frankly 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.030
 medium way it's not the one that I 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.610
 prefer 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.380
 there are not really weapons intended 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.520
 apart from the shotgun I found 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.850
 but then really but really but 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:51.460
 so really but really everything for there 

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:51.460
 that's it and we can not aim very well with 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:07:01.360
 I'm just killing you the last two 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.360
 who remains I think men 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.860
 So here it was with the video you 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.630
