00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
v-shape at the outer corner so just

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:33.960 
v-shape at the outer corner so just
start<00:01:33.070> from<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.310> outer<00:01:33.430> corner<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:33.880> then

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
start from the outer corner and then

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:41.940 
start from the outer corner and then
pull<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.570> in<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:41.380> trick<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.650> staying

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
pull it in and the trick to staying

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.770

concentrated<00:01:42.820> what<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.060> color<00:01:43.270> like<00:01:43.540> just

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
concentrated what the color like just

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.780 
concentrated what the color like just
applying<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.290> one<00:01:44.500> certain<00:01:44.710> area<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:45.670> do

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
applying it in one certain area is to do

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.390 
applying it in one certain area is to do
very<00:01:46.030> small<00:01:46.570> localized<00:01:47.290> movements<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.310> you

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
very small localized movements so you

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.980 
very small localized movements so you
don't<00:01:48.640> want<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> really<00:01:49.270> spread<00:01:49.690> out<00:01:49.750> your

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
don't want to really spread out your

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.540 
don't want to really spread out your
brush<00:01:50.290> too<00:01:50.530> much<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.920> want<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.190> stay<00:01:51.340> very

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
brush too much you want to stay very

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.060 
brush too much you want to stay very
focused<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.570> one<00:01:52.780> area<00:01:53.110> and<00:01:53.410> just<00:01:53.590> do<00:01:53.710> small

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
focused in one area and just do small

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.990 
focused in one area and just do small
movements<00:01:54.670> back<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.030> forth

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000
