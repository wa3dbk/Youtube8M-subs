what<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:28.920> public<00:06:29.190> at<00:06:29.310> home<00:06:29.430> didn't<00:06:30.000> think<00:06:30.300> of

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
what the public at home didn't think of

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.390 
what the public at home didn't think of
them<00:06:30.690> because<00:06:30.990> you<00:06:31.470> know<00:06:31.590> Zoe<00:06:31.860> survived<00:06:32.280> a

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
them because you know Zoe survived a

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.250 
them because you know Zoe survived a
couple<00:06:32.610> of<00:06:32.700> skate<00:06:32.880> offs<00:06:33.120> and<00:06:33.300> through<00:06:34.110> her

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
couple of skate offs and through her

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.780 
couple of skate offs and through her
determination<00:06:34.980> and<00:06:35.100> grit<00:06:35.220> I<00:06:35.310> think<00:06:35.550> people

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790 
determination and grit I think people

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.370 
determination and grit I think people
sort<00:06:35.970> of<00:06:36.060> warm<00:06:36.360> to<00:06:36.570> her<00:06:36.690> and<00:06:36.870> then<00:06:36.960> also<00:06:37.140> the

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
sort of warm to her and then also the

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:38.900 
sort of warm to her and then also the
skating<00:06:37.620> got<00:06:37.860> a<00:06:37.890> lot<00:06:38.070> better<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.490> think

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
skating got a lot better I think

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.340 
skating got a lot better I think
