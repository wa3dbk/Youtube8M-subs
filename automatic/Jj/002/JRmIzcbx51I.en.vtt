00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.419
 very good to all our kids 

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.020
 new video of how to play online with the 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.520
 game of make football that I'm going to 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.440
 to do is a good tutorial because I've 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.640
 seen enough on the internet but 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.060
 really many explain bad of 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.060
 previous versions 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.680
 so good 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.880
 One thing are two very important things 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.130
 the first thing logically that they have the 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:32.710
 game installed meters of time 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.879
 and have it with the same version that is 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.480
 I have 0 7.4 since I have the 0.7 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.940
 point 4 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.399
 it was at 0 point 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.860
 0.7 point 5 but good the sound 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.860
 mechanism so they are supposed titles 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 how to play online with this version 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:59.059
 with the 0.75 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.059
 very important second step is to have 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.060
 in the same wifi network 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.850
 here I am connected since there was 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.720
 connected wifi resources 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.720
 with wifi hector 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.400
 and is connected 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:26.410
 two networks connected to the same Wi-Fi network 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.410
 so what we're going to do is go 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 wikileaks 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 good the follower what initiating this 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.600
 so this one here we're going to leave 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.840
 paragraph what to do is give play 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.770
 then it covers 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.770
 double ring 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.490
 can you hear a name anybody was 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.490
 my world wars 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:13.640
 my world and let's give it to his beard 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.640
 let's go to the general 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.640
 we will see until the world was built 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 the truth is that it is a very easy way 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.250
 I also wanted to play with my friends 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.250
 with even with 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.880
 with relatives like this in me in my 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:39.610
 own in my house with my own wifi network 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.530
 but we thought it was otherwise 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.400
 many people think they are hit the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.819
 play on rails and to play with her I 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.370
 required and you do not need 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.560
 what we are going to do as install in 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.989
 this phone so here is a 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.969
 steve's name and if we go to the options 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:58.969
 and let's change the name steve by 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.690
 Álex Borja 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.740
 and another very important thing that we have 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.020
 what to have is 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.020
 when everyone ran on the world 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.710
 I do not think what to do here 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.290
 to the options menu 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:26.720
 and that is what you see multiplayer well 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.720
 what is selected 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.110
 has been without solution and so has 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.340
 solved 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.610
 then once you have it like that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.750
 simply 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.120
 this one the separated ones 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.750
 and we go to the other device and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.750
 let's go to the play 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.430
 when we give full to follow 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:55.920
 all ours but it's not going to 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:00.650
 leave alex and work with wifi be seated 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.650
 and suddenly we give it to him and we get 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.379
 this for now we leave it quiet 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.769
 and we wait for him to be in the 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.769
 world 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.930
 how she has nothing history 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:30.000
 you just have to call the same 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:34.060
 wifi network and you will 3 noted that the 95 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:39.610
 rider kane and here I watched steve young 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:42.009
 well I will turn and open 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.420
 and this steve 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:47.290
 what 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.290
 is this 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.279
 and as we see 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.969
 if we hit 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.080
 We are going to hurt you as you see 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.419
 I killed him 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.180
 and when we go to response we go 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:28.180
 we will appreciate and be radiant and be here 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.280
 so nothing is quite good because 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.280
 you can play with your friends 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:45.280
 and one 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:47.800
 you can create your worlds by creating a 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.230
 very very good map to play online and 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.740
 even one single 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.740
 Y 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.410
 I'm going to upload it when I finish doing it 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.280
 so you have nothing to play 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:03.900
 online is very easy 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.139
 how could you check any 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.500
 hesitate to leave the description and nothing 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:12.740
 See you at the next and a hug 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.740
 everyone 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.800
 [Music] 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.480
