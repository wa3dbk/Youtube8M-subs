especially<00:00:41.850> on<00:00:42.179> vacation<00:00:42.690> because<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.409> feels

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
especially on vacation because it feels

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:45.559 
especially on vacation because it feels
like<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.819> just<00:00:44.850> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> getting<00:00:45.269> in<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.539> way

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
like it's just kind of getting in my way

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:48.290 
like it's just kind of getting in my way
so<00:00:46.170> let's<00:00:46.769> let's<00:00:47.429> see<00:00:47.579> how<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.850> packed<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
so let's let's see how they packed it

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.849 
so let's let's see how they packed it
and<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.019> this<00:00:49.199> is<00:00:49.260> actually<00:00:49.620> one<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.769> the

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
and and this is actually one of the

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.200 
and and this is actually one of the
reasons<00:00:50.159> why<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.309> also<00:00:50.519> wanted<00:00:50.819> to<00:00:50.879> do<00:00:51.089> an

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
reasons why I also wanted to do an

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
reasons why I also wanted to do an
unboxing<00:00:51.530> just<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.769> case<00:00:52.890> this<00:00:53.069> thing<00:00:53.280> didn't

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
unboxing just in case this thing didn't

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.590 
unboxing just in case this thing didn't
work<00:00:54.769> that<00:00:55.769> I<00:00:56.489> can<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.999> can<00:00:57.179> show<00:00:57.479> that<00:00:59.449> so<00:01:00.449> there

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
work that I can I can show that so there

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.890 
pictures in in a single battery full
battery<00:02:27.160> charge<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:28.150> lx7

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
battery charge the lx7

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.080 
battery charge the lx7
can<00:02:29.560> take<00:02:29.769> a<00:02:29.799> little<00:02:30.069> bit<00:02:30.280> less<00:02:30.489> I<00:02:30.700> believe<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
can take a little bit less I believe the

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.759 
can take a little bit less I believe the
number<00:02:31.390> was<00:02:31.630> around<00:02:31.930> maybe<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.350> let's<00:02:32.530> just

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
number was around maybe like let's just

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.250 
number was around maybe like let's just
pretend<00:02:32.890> 400<00:02:33.580> or<00:02:34.090> 300<00:02:34.569> or<00:02:34.900> something<00:02:35.170> like

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
pretend 400 or 300 or something like

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.610 
pretend 400 or 300 or something like
that

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
that

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.410 
that
so<00:02:35.920> having<00:02:36.100> three<00:02:36.459> batteries<00:02:36.790> would<00:02:37.030> be<00:02:37.180> very

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
so having three batteries would be very

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.090 
so having three batteries would be very
very<00:02:37.750> useful<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.260> still<00:02:38.500> being<00:02:38.709> able<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.890> take

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
very useful but still being able to take

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.670 
very useful but still being able to take
even<00:02:39.489> up<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.760> 300<00:02:40.180> photos<00:02:40.540> is<00:02:41.019> really<00:02:41.470> really

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
even up to 300 photos is really really

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.470 
even up to 300 photos is really really
amazing<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.190> most<00:02:42.640> people<00:02:42.970> don't<00:02:43.090> even<00:02:43.209> get

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
amazing and most people don't even get

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.990 
amazing and most people don't even get
that<00:02:43.540> close<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.860> know<00:02:44.980> me<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.819> know<00:02:45.850> I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
that close but if you know me you know I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.360 
that close but if you know me you know I
do<00:02:46.200> last<00:02:47.200> time<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.410> went<00:02:47.530> to<00:02:47.680> Japan<00:02:47.830> for<00:02:48.100> a<00:02:48.160> month

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
do last time I went to Japan for a month

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.949 
do last time I went to Japan for a month
I<00:02:48.519> literally<00:02:49.060> took<00:02:49.450> over<00:02:49.829> 10,000<00:02:50.829> pictures

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
I literally took over 10,000 pictures

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.570 
I literally took over 10,000 pictures
which<00:02:53.070> which<00:02:54.070> walk<00:02:54.910> out<00:02:55.120> to

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.980 

see<00:02:58.150> let's<00:02:58.750> see<00:02:58.930> what<00:02:59.110> works<00:02:59.350> out<00:02:59.560> too

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.800 

bit<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.140> bit<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:06.470> 10005<00:03:07.470> by<00:03:07.650> 30<00:03:08.010> equals<00:03:08.780> 333<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
bit a bit bit 10005 by 30 equals 333 a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.360 
bit a bit bit 10005 by 30 equals 333 a
day<00:03:10.050> which<00:03:10.290> means<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.800> would<00:03:10.950> need<00:03:11.130> at

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
day which means that I would need at

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.760 
day which means that I would need at
least<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:12.240> battery<00:03:12.630> change<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.590> were<00:03:13.680> to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
least one battery change if I were to

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.020

here's another thing that it does it has

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.469 
here's another thing that it does it has
a<00:05:36.470> ring<00:05:36.740> over<00:05:36.889> here<00:05:36.979> but<00:05:37.759> I<00:05:37.789> mean<00:05:38.000> I'll<00:05:38.120> get

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
a ring over here but I mean I'll get

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.939 
a ring over here but I mean I'll get
more<00:05:38.630> into<00:05:38.690> an<00:05:38.960> actual<00:05:39.289> review<00:05:39.410> that<00:05:39.800> way<00:05:39.919> I

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
more into an actual review that way I

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.680 
more into an actual review that way I
know<00:05:40.070> what<00:05:40.400> each<00:05:40.610> of<00:05:40.759> these<00:05:40.850> things<00:05:40.910> does<00:05:41.330> also

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
know what each of these things does also

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.390 
know what each of these things does also
here's<00:05:41.990> the<00:05:42.110> aspect<00:05:42.530> ratio<00:05:42.590> right<00:05:43.190> on<00:05:43.310> the

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
here's the aspect ratio right on the

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.800 
here's the aspect ratio right on the
thing<00:05:43.580> so<00:05:44.479> that's<00:05:44.630> good

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
thing so that's good

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.790 
thing so that's good

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.440 

the<00:05:54.250> range

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.870

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.500 

or<00:06:08.390> is<00:06:08.480> that<00:06:08.510> aperture-priority<00:06:10.510> program

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
or is that aperture-priority program

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.390 
or is that aperture-priority program
okay

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
okay
