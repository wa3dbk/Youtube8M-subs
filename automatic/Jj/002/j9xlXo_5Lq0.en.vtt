00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.900

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.660
 of course it's all a trick 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.809
 visual but the graphics are very realistic 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.809
 do not forget unesco for expensive beer 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.150

 barbican to suggest and even tals 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.840
 the costs it invested would bring 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.910
 So how about taking care of a stone? 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.880
 this same ep proposes that its 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.990

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.610
 that human creativity has no 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.610
 limits of each forum 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.740
 good this shaving world until your 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:57.070

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:00.420
 shaving with him the low r test in 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.420

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.840
 in fourth is the blogger that the usual 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.830
 iPhone speaker to generate a lightweight 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.740
 breeze 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.630
 you pay a candle a fossil suddenly 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:25.530
 if the fire is consecrated I do not think 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.720
 That should not be asking, man. 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:34.740
 that because if you stay in sugar 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:39.130
 but if you want to support with style 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:41.650
 low mouth does not have the most useful device 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:49.930
 than that understood right 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:53.410

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.800

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.310

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.820
