later<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.629> macbook<00:01:03.989> which<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.890> go

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
later the the macbook which would go

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.219 
later the the macbook which would go
into<00:01:05.280> sleep<00:01:05.489> mode<00:01:05.610> again<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.510> then<00:01:06.750> wake

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.740 
into sleep mode again and then wake
itself<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.430> was<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.540> bit<00:01:09.720> confusing

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
itself up and it was all a bit confusing

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
itself up and it was all a bit confusing
what<00:01:10.409> was<00:01:10.530> happening<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.979> was<00:01:11.010> good<00:01:11.280> very

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
what was happening it was good very

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760 
what was happening it was good very
frustrating<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.990> only<00:01:13.110> way<00:01:13.260> i<00:01:13.290> could<00:01:13.439> find

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
frustrating so the only way i could find

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570 
frustrating so the only way i could find
around<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.640> basically<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.580> lid

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
around it was basically to have the lid

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.020 
around it was basically to have the lid
of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.850> macbook<00:01:18.210> open<00:01:18.590> now<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.100> quite

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
of the macbook open now this is quite

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.580 
of the macbook open now this is quite
hardly<00:01:21.360> as<00:01:21.420> well<00:01:21.630> because<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> can<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.470> as

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
hardly as well because you can use it as

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.219 
hardly as well because you can use it as
an<00:01:22.680> extended<00:01:23.159> desktop<00:01:23.479> but<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.840> next<00:01:25.049> problem

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
an extended desktop but the next problem

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
an extended desktop but the next problem
i<00:01:25.500> ran<00:01:25.530> into<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.340> was<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.689> macbook

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
i ran into then was that the the macbook

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.710 
i ran into then was that the the macbook
itself<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.579> acting<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> main<00:01:30.360> screen

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
itself and was acting as the main screen

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.620 
itself and was acting as the main screen
with<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.229> 24<00:01:32.040> inch<00:01:32.070> monitors<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.000> sleeve<00:01:33.299> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
with the 24 inch monitors the sleeve and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.899 
with the 24 inch monitors the sleeve and
that<00:01:34.530> meant<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.130> dock<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that meant that your dock was in the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.870 
that meant that your dock was in the
macbook<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.600> all<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.650> menu<00:01:38.070> bars<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
macbook and all your menu bars and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.760 
macbook and all your menu bars and
windows<00:01:39.720> when<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> opened<00:01:40.259> way<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.590> your

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
windows when the opened way in your

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.700 
windows when the opened way in your
macbook<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> drag<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.270> across

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
macbook in you had to drag them across

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.740 
macbook in you had to drag them across
onto<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.189> 24<00:01:44.670> inch<00:01:44.700> screen<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.390> became

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
onto the the 24 inch screen which became

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.050 
onto the the 24 inch screen which became
again<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:47.100> frustrating<00:01:47.700> because<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
again really frustrating because you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.060 
again really frustrating because you
were<00:01:48.119> opening<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.570> something<00:01:49.020> in<00:01:49.350> Safari<00:01:49.799> then

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
were opening up something in Safari then

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
were opening up something in Safari then
dragging<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.640> across<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.270> then<00:01:51.329> open

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
dragging it across and then open

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.990 
dragging it across and then open
something<00:01:52.619> else<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.130> jumped<00:01:53.430> back<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
something else and it jumped back and it

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.859 
something else and it jumped back and it
just<00:01:54.149> was<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> nightmare<00:01:55.219> now<00:01:56.570> this<00:01:57.570> is

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
just was a nightmare now this is

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.480 
just was a nightmare now this is
something<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.320> can<00:01:58.530> be<00:01:58.619> easily<00:01:58.710> fixed<00:01:59.070> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
something that can be easily fixed and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.160 
something that can be easily fixed and
it<00:01:59.909> took<00:02:00.090> me<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.240> little<00:02:00.360> bit<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.659> searching<00:02:00.869> on

window onto the little screen and have
it<00:03:47.820> running<00:03:48.060> and<00:03:48.269> then<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.900> can<00:03:49.079> carry<00:03:49.290> on

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
it running and then I can carry on

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.960

said it's not something hard to do it
just<00:03:58.500> took<00:03:58.799> me<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:58.980> little<00:03:59.040> while<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.579> grasp<00:03:59.820> how

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
just took me a little while to grasp how

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.630 
just took me a little while to grasp how
to<00:04:00.150> do<00:04:00.359> it<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:00.709> trying<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.829> search<00:04:02.040> on<00:04:02.250> Google

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
to do it and trying to search on Google

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.819 
to do it and trying to search on Google
and<00:04:02.880> YouTube<00:04:03.420> didn't<00:04:04.049> really<00:04:04.320> yield<00:04:04.590> any

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
and YouTube didn't really yield any

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.979 
and YouTube didn't really yield any
results<00:04:05.790> so<00:04:05.970> hopefully<00:04:06.299> this<00:04:06.450> video<00:04:06.780> and<00:04:06.959> I

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
results so hopefully this video and I

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.140 
results so hopefully this video and I
