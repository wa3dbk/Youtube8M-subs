00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
to be on for this test and here's your

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.109 
to be on for this test and here's your
IAC<00:01:09.580> connector<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:11.020> 93<00:01:11.740> 2.0<00:01:12.549> automatic

IAC connector on the 93 2.0 automatic

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.210 
IAC connector on the 93 2.0 automatic
anyway<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:14.320> test<00:01:14.619> is<00:01:14.770> only<00:01:14.890> going<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.130> be

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
anyway this test is only going to be

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.910 
anyway this test is only going to be
valid<00:01:15.610> for<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.940> 2.0<00:01:16.390> automatic<00:01:16.960> alright<00:01:17.470> so

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
valid for the 2.0 automatic alright so

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.760 
valid for the 2.0 automatic alright so
we<00:01:18.010> have<00:01:18.040> our<00:01:18.159> probes<00:01:18.520> in<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.900> are<00:01:20.020> getting<00:01:20.170> 10

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
we have our probes in we are getting 10

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.980 
we have our probes in we are getting 10
point<00:01:21.070> oh<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:24.159> that<00:01:24.189> tells<00:01:24.579> us<00:01:24.820> that<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.630> IAC

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
point oh so that tells us that the IAC

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.609 
point oh so that tells us that the IAC
wiring<00:01:27.450> resistance<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.659> good<00:01:28.869> this<00:01:29.259> is<00:01:29.350> just<00:01:29.530> a

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
wiring resistance is good this is just a

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.109 
wiring resistance is good this is just a
real<00:01:29.770> quick<00:01:29.890> test<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.310> see<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.670> integrity

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
real quick test to see if the integrity

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.060 
real quick test to see if the integrity
of<00:01:31.180> your<00:01:31.359> wiring<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.960> your<00:01:32.079> IAC<00:01:32.409> is<00:01:32.590> intact

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070

that's<00:01:33.280> all<00:01:33.609> this<00:01:33.969> test<00:01:34.210> does<00:01:34.479> it<00:01:35.020> doesn't

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
that's all this test does it doesn't

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.080 
that's all this test does it doesn't
tell<00:01:35.500> you<00:01:35.619> if<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.799> operation<00:01:36.280> of<00:01:36.369> your<00:01:36.520> IAC<00:01:36.789> is

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.209 
tell you if the operation of your IAC is
correct<00:01:37.420> just<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.320> wiring<00:01:38.679> I'm<00:01:38.920> just<00:01:39.100> going

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:39.219 
correct just the wiring I'm just going

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:41.310 
correct just the wiring I'm just going
to<00:01:39.250> keep<00:01:39.490> doing<00:01:39.549> all<00:01:40.210> these<00:01:40.359> little<00:01:40.659> tests

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
to keep doing all these little tests

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.289 
to keep doing all these little tests
that<00:01:41.439> I<00:01:41.500> find<00:01:41.770> in<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.920> manual<00:01:42.340> and<00:01:42.490> we're<00:01:43.179> just

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:43.299 
that I find in the manual and we're just

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.639 
that I find in the manual and we're just
going<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.479> keep<00:01:43.630> probing<00:01:43.899> and<00:01:44.170> probing<00:01:44.229> and

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
going to keep probing and probing and

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.590 
going to keep probing and probing and
probing<00:01:44.710> and<00:01:45.130> eventually<00:01:46.000> will<00:01:46.149> come<00:01:46.179> upon

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
probing and eventually will come upon

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.260 
probing and eventually will come upon
something<00:01:47.109> but<00:01:47.469> so<00:01:47.679> far<00:01:47.859> my<00:01:48.100> IC<00:01:48.670> wiring<00:01:49.149> is

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
something but so far my IC wiring is

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.660 
something but so far my IC wiring is
good<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.079> that's<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.979> that's<00:01:51.310> a<00:01:51.429> really<00:01:51.579> easy

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
good so that's that that's a really easy

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.510 
good so that's that that's a really easy
quick<00:01:51.999> test<00:01:52.270> huh<00:01:52.770> bet<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:53.920> go<00:01:54.159> is<00:01:54.249> that<00:01:54.340> easy

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
quick test huh bet you a go is that easy

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.730 
quick test huh bet you a go is that easy
now<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.299> rest<00:01:55.570> of<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.810> test<00:01:56.079> for<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.380> IAC

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
now the rest of the test for the IAC

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.899

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.050 
valve lift with an air dryer and verify
that<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.960> moves<00:02:14.350> forward<00:02:14.650> in<00:02:15.040> in<00:02:15.610> outward

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
that it moves forward in in outward

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.180 
that it moves forward in in outward
direction<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.780> if<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.230> does<00:02:17.410> then<00:02:17.650> your<00:02:17.770> IC<00:02:17.890> is

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
direction and if it does then your IC is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.340 
direction and if it does then your IC is
good<00:02:18.600> that's<00:02:19.600> all<00:02:19.810> there<00:02:19.960> is<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.170> that

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
good that's all there is to that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.620 
good that's all there is to that
that<00:02:21.160> one<00:02:21.310> might<00:02:21.490> take<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.880> an<00:02:22.090> hour<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.330> to

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that one might take you an hour to to

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.420 
that one might take you an hour to to
chill<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.960> that's<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.410> pretty<00:02:23.530> neat<00:02:23.770> test<00:02:24.010> but

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
chill it that's a pretty neat test but

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.070 
chill it that's a pretty neat test but
that's<00:02:24.790> all<00:02:24.970> there<00:02:25.090> is<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.360> testing<00:02:25.690> your<00:02:25.810> IAC

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
that's all there is to testing your IAC

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.140 
that's all there is to testing your IAC
I'm<00:02:26.950> not<00:02:27.159> going<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.340> actually<00:02:27.640> remove<00:02:27.819> it<00:02:28.060> from

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
I'm not going to actually remove it from

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.119 
I'm not going to actually remove it from
my<00:02:28.299> car<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:28.659> do<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> test<00:02:29.110> but<00:02:29.470> that's<00:02:29.950> how

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
my car and do the test but that's how

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.080 
my car and do the test but that's how
you<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.310> it

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
you do it

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.019 
you do it
cool
