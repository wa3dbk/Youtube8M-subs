00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.030
 so finally came this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.089
 significant day you decide to buy 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.010
 yourself motorcycle motives of it 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.890
 responsible action can be 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.460
 very different someone does it for the sake of 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.560
 Ponte 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.580
 Someone thinks that with a motorcycle will 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.039
 lighter with chicks 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.269
 and some who think that now his 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 exactly everyone will be respected and feared however 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 besides all these great bonuses and 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.100
 motorcycles there is one most important 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.950
 feature 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 on them just zashib how great 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.640
 ride as it is known in the world there 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 a huge number of types of motorcycles 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.100
 pretentious chipper undermined sparta 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:53.059
 Street and classics and not to mention 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.620
 all kinds of river inland and colorful and 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.329
 however despite the difference all this 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.420
 technique unites the general principle 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.629
 operation and layout because no matter how 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.990
 cool the bike is exactly that healthy 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.930
 thing between your legs on two wheels with 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.330
 driving the engine gas tank and other 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.510
 the joys of life 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:18.540
 however, even the most expensive motorcycle without 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.020
 Intervention raider remains simple 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.410
 beautiful piece of iron is man 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.760
 have to breathe life into the technique and 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.410
 that person will be you 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.810
 the first thing to understand the future 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.870
 to the motorcyclist this how to result 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.150
 motorcycle in motion for this you 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.130
 you will need a motorcycle itself and 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.020
 good training ground 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is important not to forget the protective 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.210
 equipment without fall fall 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.210
 almost all newbies really hurt 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:05.400
 and so to start the bike you need 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:08.100
 With a confident hand, insert the key in 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:12.770
 ignition lock turn it clockwise 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:15.690
 arrow voila electro system works and 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.580
 here the most interesting begins 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.320
 if you are not happy 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.290
 owner of the Chinese CVT 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.820
 technology you need to learn the principle 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.030
 gear shift 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.920
 As a rule, there are 5 gears in a motorcycle. 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.280
 but as they say in good old 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 joke can be nuances between 1 and 2 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.200
 transmission is the so-called 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.540
 neutral so here how much would you be on 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.580
 neutral transmission of non-gas currencies 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.070
 the rear wheel is spinning 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.350
 will therefore not start a motorcycle 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.630
 necessary exactly on neutral 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.100
 transfer 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.770
 inform about included played intended 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.410
 green light on dashboard 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.980
 if the light is lit boldly press 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:06.510
 starter button 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:09.450
 you hear the sound of a motorcycle running 1 down 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.940
 this is not about your first criminal record 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.910
 or anything like that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.310
 first gear 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.980
 99 percent of experienced motorcyclists if 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 you ask them how to ride a bike 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.400
 I cleared my teeth through the area down to 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.380
 practice is necessary for this left 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.150
 hand hold the clutch lever 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.269
 and press the pedal with your left foot 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.900
 shift down this way 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.329
 first gear will be included 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.430
 and here comes the most exciting for 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:44.159
 any novice motorcyclist moment 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:48.079
 right hand we add turns 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:52.349
 the gas knob is very smooth and neat 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:54.920
 lower the clutch lever and here's the bike 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.920
 and eat 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.680
 at this stage do not try to write 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.840
 aerobatics best 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.960
 project 20-30 meters in a straight line and 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.670
 calmly stop and let 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.460
 Someone says that the brakes have come up 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.190
 cowards are really very important 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.010
 thing to stop the motorcycle 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.010
 you need to reset the gas to squeeze 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.720
 grip and clamp or front lever 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.870
 brakes under your right hand or 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.780
 rear brake pedal from your right 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.530
 foot well, better to do it at the same time 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.180
 so the bike will be much more stable 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.950
 more about braking and maneuvering 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.730
 we will tell you in the next releases a 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.660
 that's all for today 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.660
 smooth roads
