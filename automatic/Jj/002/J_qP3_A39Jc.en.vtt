about this book as you can see the split
has<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> couple<00:02:47.940> grooves<00:02:48.270> underneath<00:02:48.990> here<00:02:49.350> so

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
has a couple grooves underneath here so

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
has a couple grooves underneath here so
when<00:02:50.760> you're<00:02:50.910> sewing<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.360> next<00:02:51.720> pin<00:02:51.990> back<00:02:52.230> you

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
when you're sewing the next pin back you

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.980 
when you're sewing the next pin back you
can<00:02:53.070> place<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.580> previous<00:02:54.000> one<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.960> of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
can place the previous one in one of

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.530 
can place the previous one in one of
these<00:02:55.230> grooves<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:56.640> pick<00:02:56.940> which<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.360> you're

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
these grooves and pick which one you're

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.570 
these grooves and pick which one you're
going<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.780> do<00:02:57.930> how<00:02:58.140> wide<00:02:58.440> how<00:02:58.980> wide<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.520> want

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
going to do how wide how wide you want

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.870 
going to do how wide how wide you want
them<00:02:59.850> to<00:02:59.880> be<00:03:00.150> apart<00:03:00.480> and<00:03:00.750> then<00:03:01.850> place<00:03:02.850> it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
them to be apart and then place it

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.400 
them to be apart and then place it
underneath<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.810> then<00:03:03.840> put<00:03:04.170> your<00:03:04.320> foot<00:03:04.500> down<00:03:04.530> I

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
underneath and then put your foot down I

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:16.440 
underneath and then put your foot down I
can<00:03:07.410> do<00:03:07.590> this

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.369 

put<00:03:17.379> your<00:03:17.500> foot<00:03:17.709> down<00:03:18.599> and<00:03:19.599> right<00:03:19.780> now<00:03:19.930> it's<00:03:20.170> in

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
put your foot down and right now it's in

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.619 
put your foot down and right now it's in
this<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:22.930> second-to-last<00:03:23.709> group<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:25.450> then

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
this the second-to-last group and then

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.390 
this the second-to-last group and then
actually<00:03:25.780> i'm<00:03:26.110> going<00:03:26.290> to<00:03:26.349> make<00:03:26.500> mine<00:03:26.709> over<00:03:27.370> a

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
actually i'm going to make mine over a

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.790 
actually i'm going to make mine over a
little<00:03:27.670> bit<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:28.120> the<00:03:28.209> last<00:03:28.420> one<00:03:29.010> if<00:03:30.010> i<00:03:30.220> can

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
little bit to the last one if i can

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.140 
little bit to the last one if i can
right<00:03:32.800> now<00:03:32.830> it's<00:03:33.160> in<00:03:33.220> this<00:03:33.400> last<00:03:33.640> one<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.090> i

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
right now it's in this last one and i

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:44.990 
right now it's in this last one and i
want<00:03:34.360> to<00:03:34.390> sell<00:03:34.690> down

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.690 

now<00:03:46.000> having<00:03:46.659> it<00:03:46.840> having<00:03:47.680> that<00:03:47.709> next<00:03:48.370> one<00:03:48.519> is<00:03:48.670> a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
now having it having that next one is a

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.199 
now having it having that next one is a
guide<00:03:49.680> put<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.769> in<00:03:50.890> here<00:03:51.069> see<00:03:51.760> a<00:03:51.790> little<00:03:52.090> bit

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
guide put it in here see a little bit

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.270 
guide put it in here see a little bit
better<00:03:52.390> having<00:03:53.349> that<00:03:53.379> next<00:03:53.739> one<00:03:53.859> is<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> guide

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
better having that next one is a guide

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.869 
better having that next one is a guide
just<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.420> makes<00:03:55.810> a<00:03:55.989> very<00:03:56.139> even<00:03:56.709> pintuck<00:03:57.639> for

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
just that makes a very even pintuck for

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:00.209 
just that makes a very even pintuck for
the<00:03:57.939> next<00:03:58.269> line<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:59.049> do<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.319> this<00:03:59.530> fabric<00:04:00.069> is

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
the next line you do in this fabric is

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.099 
the next line you do in this fabric is
actually<00:04:00.639> probably<00:04:01.150> not<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.599> best<00:04:01.629> one<00:04:01.959> to

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
actually probably not the best one to

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.339 
actually probably not the best one to
show<00:04:02.319> you<00:04:02.379> because<00:04:03.219> it's<00:04:03.939> a<00:04:04.209> very<00:04:04.389> stiff<00:04:05.019> and

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
show you because it's a very stiff and

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.800 
show you because it's a very stiff and
this<00:04:05.709> will<00:04:05.889> work<00:04:06.040> much<00:04:06.519> better<00:04:06.579> if<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.299> have<00:04:07.540> a

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
this will work much better if you have a

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.420 
this will work much better if you have a
thinner<00:04:08.109> fabric<00:04:08.379> so<00:04:08.769> let<00:04:08.920> me<00:04:08.980> just<00:04:09.159> try<00:04:09.340> to

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
thinner fabric so let me just try to

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.619 
thinner fabric so let me just try to
show<00:04:09.609> you<00:04:09.700> what<00:04:09.849> it<00:04:09.909> looks<00:04:09.939> like<00:04:10.180> on<00:04:10.299> a<00:04:10.359> thinner

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
show you what it looks like on a thinner

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.879 
show you what it looks like on a thinner
fabric<00:04:11.069> all<00:04:12.069> right<00:04:12.280> this<00:04:12.609> is<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:13.889> lining

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
fabric all right this is a lining

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.129 
fabric all right this is a lining
material<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:16.060> very<00:04:16.329> light<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:16.630> you<00:04:16.989> can

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
material and it's very light and you can

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.390 
material and it's very light and you can
see<00:04:17.410> exactly<00:04:18.370> how<00:04:19.440> pronounced<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.859> pin<00:04:21.130> tucks

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
see exactly how pronounced the pin tucks

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.810 
see exactly how pronounced the pin tucks
are<00:04:22.050> and<00:04:23.050> i<00:04:23.139> want<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.410> mention<00:04:23.560> that<00:04:23.889> when<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.280> I

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
are and i want to mention that when I I

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.100 
are and i want to mention that when I I
have<00:04:25.090> mine<00:04:25.780> set<00:04:26.380> to<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.919> highest<00:04:27.900> tension<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
have mine set to the highest tension and

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.080 
have mine set to the highest tension and
it<00:04:29.199> ended<00:04:29.470> up<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:29.979> don't<00:04:30.490> know<00:04:30.550> if<00:04:30.639> you<00:04:30.729> can<00:04:30.880> see

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
it ended up I don't know if you can see

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.240 
it ended up I don't know if you can see
here<00:04:31.300> where<00:04:31.419> you<00:04:31.479> can<00:04:31.570> see<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.169> bobbin<00:04:32.949> thread

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
here where you can see the bobbin thread

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.129 
here where you can see the bobbin thread
coming<00:04:33.550> up<00:04:33.820> so<00:04:34.150> if<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.419> were<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.720> I<00:04:34.780> probably

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
coming up so if I were you I probably

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.219 
coming up so if I were you I probably
keep<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.560> at<00:04:35.740> a<00:04:36.070> seven<00:04:36.930> instead<00:04:37.930> of<00:04:38.080> your

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
keep it at a seven instead of your

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.200 
keep it at a seven instead of your
highest<00:04:38.620> setting<00:04:38.949> because<00:04:39.160> when<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:39.639> switched

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
highest setting because when I switched

starch<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:02.039> beforehand<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:05.590> it's<00:05:05.919> just<00:05:06.099> so

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
starch on it beforehand and it's just so

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.260 
starch on it beforehand and it's just so
nice<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.330> see<00:05:08.310> how<00:05:09.310> this<00:05:09.520> came<00:05:09.789> out<00:05:09.909> and<00:05:10.180> it

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
nice to see how this came out and it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.060 
nice to see how this came out and it
really<00:05:10.509> the<00:05:10.990> only<00:05:11.080> thing<00:05:11.409> about<00:05:11.620> it<00:05:11.800> i<00:05:11.889> will

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
really the only thing about it i will

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.370 
really the only thing about it i will
say<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.490> that<00:05:12.550> it's<00:05:13.360> a<00:05:13.509> little<00:05:13.720> boring<00:05:13.960> and

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
say is that it's a little boring and

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.740 
say is that it's a little boring and
tedious<00:05:14.560> to<00:05:15.190> make<00:05:15.370> pin<00:05:15.639> tucks<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:16.210> mean<00:05:16.570> it's

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
tedious to make pin tucks I mean it's

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.779 
tedious to make pin tucks I mean it's
the<00:05:16.870> same<00:05:17.169> thing<00:05:17.229> over<00:05:18.159> and<00:05:18.340> over<00:05:18.490> and<00:05:18.699> over

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
the same thing over and over and over

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.740 
the same thing over and over and over
and<00:05:18.970> over<00:05:19.030> over<00:05:19.919> but<00:05:20.919> if<00:05:21.009> you're<00:05:21.159> using<00:05:21.340> this

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
and over over but if you're using this

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.860 
and over over but if you're using this
for<00:05:22.750> a<00:05:22.949> blouse<00:05:23.949> I<00:05:24.280> would<00:05:25.210> recommend<00:05:25.509> making

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
for a blouse I would recommend making

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.990 
for a blouse I would recommend making
the<00:05:26.139> pin<00:05:26.349> tucks<00:05:26.560> on<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:27.009> fabric<00:05:27.190> first<00:05:27.580> and

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
the pin tucks on the fabric first and

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.629 
the pin tucks on the fabric first and
then<00:05:28.180> cutting<00:05:28.509> the<00:05:28.690> pattern<00:05:29.020> out<00:05:29.639> obviously

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:30.639 
then cutting the pattern out obviously

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.700 
then cutting the pattern out obviously
because<00:05:30.909> you<00:05:31.060> don't<00:05:31.270> know<00:05:31.509> how<00:05:31.930> much<00:05:32.440> fabric

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
because you don't know how much fabric

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.580 
because you don't know how much fabric
is<00:05:33.070> going<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.340> need<00:05:34.050> because<00:05:35.050> it's<00:05:35.380> going<00:05:35.530> to

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.490 
is going to need because it's going to
pinch<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.889> fabric<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.430> whole<00:05:36.610> bunch<00:05:37.500> that's
