00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:03.899
 Skyline Plaza announces its appeal from 11 Training Day 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.899
 landscapes 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.759
 Not 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.769
 Walldorf she will be the next company from his new video here 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.229
 the world participated in a company a high ideal value 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:36.379
 it was a throw of Michael's shoulders he has a high 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.960
 Entertainment value had WN 7 1 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.050
 This is called an apartment 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.460
 and I'm funny about his website Stotz but everyone opened up 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.760
 and so many Sunday unharmed on the roof on the occasion of their rights 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.570
 good product or a good book for the hospital to introduce you and also 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.910
 Thanks so much that he never sent one 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.350
 from Siemens and the set up here 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.859
 the monkey and then you would the music to the iPod I'm already in the beginning 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.080
 always very nice and also very stylish try 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.020
 and her ex if you believe the first page on here she was already the first 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.100
 Couple and look at all those apple devices I go to more 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.100
 and her right down a caterpillar and that's a parody of caterpillar 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 glutton 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.319
 the tour numbers on this whole only me ever very nice 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.980
 and in the end you can see how all the devices want to know how 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.409
 the apple so like the apple logo now also adorns the total sentence after the 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.530
 whole book 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.380
 So dictatorship too big are definitely fat coat tolerates 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.490
 To all very very good but my sister disparaging reading found that 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.440
 also pretty funny around this now not so often in the review 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.030
 So if I am through it, too, what the man in there is some jokes in it 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.720
 which probably only apple fans really understand 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.510
 Here is one of my favorite courses nothing when first come to read so Micha 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 ran again 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.729
 and then you see the devil with this and our future ideas have changed 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.440
 because she has read this now 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.479
 ours pretty funny for me 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.479
 or I like this committee very well 

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:31.149
 Century of comics 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.059
 a lot of sites and I want that Bures especially net maybe 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:38.599
 to show us the pleasure of watching between Yichang and ourselves 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 maybe it is also in between on the pole to 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.499
 The book is available for a small price in the bookstores and for every ETA there 

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.499
 and maybe for you too I can not recommend that to you 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.929
 So all sorts of other cities in Capricorn most of the book is such a one 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.369
 small must because it is easy 

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:58.739
 It's not funny about the deal 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.459
 Sing here or death on the website but funny way before Michael and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 There are also in the public new comics you can comment then 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.190
 Star can and so on and so on, and then this very funny 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:14.029
 Of course, not only addressing the crisis is clear 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.469
 and around 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:19.389
 I also like to visit in the distant times and at some times just 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.049
 not all comics and cartoons 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.119
 to get the right ones with them 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:26.379
 No, I am very nice 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:31.299
 that was to be read today we are expecting something a little bit different 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.299
 to do Apple on this topic or more naturally to do something with it 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:38.409
 and then it shows 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:49.259
 fury 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.359
 and 7 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.359
 Bender 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.909
