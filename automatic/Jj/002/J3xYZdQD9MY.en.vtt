00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
all you would have to do it would cover

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.189 
all you would have to do it would cover
up<00:00:13.889> your<00:00:14.160> kind<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.519> your<00:00:14.940> messes<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.870> whatever

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
up your kind of your messes or whatever

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.179 
up your kind of your messes or whatever
along<00:00:17.100> that's<00:00:17.279> along<00:00:18.289> the<00:00:19.289> lines<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:19.890> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
along that's along the lines just to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.630 
along that's along the lines just to
keep<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.760> cleaner<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.510> if<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.720> did<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
keep it cleaner and so if you did that

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.689 
keep it cleaner and so if you did that
it<00:00:23.640> would<00:00:23.760> actually<00:00:23.939> look<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:25.609> and<00:00:26.609> so

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
it would actually look like this and so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.140 
it would actually look like this and so
how<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.449> cleans<00:00:27.750> up<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> lines<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
how it cleans up the lines here and it

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.360 
how it cleans up the lines here and it
kind<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.449> flows<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.960> together<00:00:32.570> and<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.899> you

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
kind of flows it together and so you

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.799 
kind of flows it together and so you
this<00:00:35.370> time<00:00:35.730> or<00:00:36.860> right<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.160> started

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
this time or right when you started

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
this time or right when you started
before<00:00:39.809> you<00:00:40.440> did<00:00:40.649> your<00:00:40.829> first<00:00:41.040> stitch<00:00:41.460> up<00:00:41.760> here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
before you did your first stitch up here

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.240 
before you did your first stitch up here
would<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:42.840> another<00:00:43.379> good<00:00:43.680> time<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.950> add

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
would be also another good time to add

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.270

it<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.670> like<00:00:44.850> to<00:00:45.000> add<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.270> at<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> end<00:00:46.280> now

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
