and<00:03:32.950> close<00:03:33.040> um<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:34.780> didn't<00:03:35.169> have<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.380> do

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
tore apart the back end took out the

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.300 
tore apart the back end took out the
chassis<00:03:39.730> for<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.060> tuner<00:03:40.450> and<00:03:40.739> and<00:03:41.739> the

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
chassis for the tuner and and the

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.460 
chassis for the tuner and and the
amplifier<00:03:42.880> and<00:03:43.209> kind<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.870> blended<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.290> tube

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
amplifier and kind of blended the tube

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.690 
amplifier and kind of blended the tube
back<00:03:44.799> together<00:03:45.329> so<00:03:47.370> yeah<00:03:48.370> it's<00:03:48.549> pretty

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
back together so yeah it's pretty

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.740 
back together so yeah it's pretty
Frankenstein<00:03:49.540> in<00:03:49.780> here<00:03:50.019> but<00:03:50.980> uh<00:03:51.630> like<00:03:52.630> I<00:03:52.720> said

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
Frankenstein in here but uh like I said

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.059 
Frankenstein in here but uh like I said
I<00:03:52.930> drilled<00:03:53.200> a<00:03:53.260> couple<00:03:53.470> of<00:03:53.530> holes<00:03:53.650> through<00:03:53.889> here

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
I drilled a couple of holes through here

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.220 
I drilled a couple of holes through here
so<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.310> knob<00:03:54.459> spouts<00:03:55.450> would<00:03:55.690> fit<00:03:55.900> through<00:03:56.200> a

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
so the knob spouts would fit through a

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.129 
so the knob spouts would fit through a
couple<00:03:56.560> of<00:03:56.680> screws<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.579> hold<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.910> chassis<00:03:58.840> to

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
couple of screws to hold the chassis to

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:03.690 
couple of screws to hold the chassis to
the<00:03:59.230> front<00:03:59.500> and<00:04:01.799> really<00:04:02.799> it's<00:04:03.069> it's<00:04:03.310> set<00:04:03.669> up

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
the front and really it's it's set up

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.449 
the front and really it's it's set up
pretty<00:04:04.090> much<00:04:04.329> stock<00:04:04.950> they<00:04:05.950> took<00:04:06.130> me<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> long

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
pretty much stock they took me a long

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.190 
pretty much stock they took me a long
time<00:04:06.519> to<00:04:06.760> figure<00:04:07.030> out<00:04:07.299> though<00:04:07.540> to<00:04:07.599> use<00:04:07.989> the

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
time to figure out though to use the

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.710 
time to figure out though to use the
phonograph<00:04:09.269> hookups<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.799> guitar<00:04:12.069> input

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
phonograph hookups for the guitar input

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.150 
phonograph hookups for the guitar input
because<00:04:13.720> going<00:04:14.169> through<00:04:14.379> the<00:04:14.470> other<00:04:14.620> way<00:04:14.859> just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
because going through the other way just

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.920 
because going through the other way just
didn't<00:04:15.400> get<00:04:15.459> enough<00:04:15.609> volume<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.269> got<00:04:16.419> really

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
didn't get enough volume you got really

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.810 
didn't get enough volume you got really
no<00:04:17.049> volume<00:04:17.289> at<00:04:17.530> all<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:17.889> something<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.669> was

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
no volume at all and something that was

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.029 
no volume at all and something that was
really<00:04:19.120> important<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.900> there<00:04:20.560> was<00:04:20.709> a<00:04:20.739> ground

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
really important is there was a ground

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.810 
really important is there was a ground
provided<00:04:21.669> here<00:04:22.199> off<00:04:23.199> of<00:04:23.260> the<00:04:24.130> the<00:04:24.400> phonograph

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
provided here off of the the phonograph
