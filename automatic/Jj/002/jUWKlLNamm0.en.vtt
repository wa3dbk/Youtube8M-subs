it's<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.739> longboard<00:00:56.480> that<00:00:57.480> has<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.110> do<00:00:58.260> so

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
it's a longboard that has you can do so

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.310 
it's a longboard that has you can do so
much<00:00:58.650> on<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.700> great<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.120> nose<00:01:00.360> riding<00:01:00.660> we've

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
much on it's great for nose riding we've

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.950 
much on it's great for nose riding we've
run<00:01:01.530> a<00:01:01.640> concave<00:01:02.640> through<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.150> nose<00:01:03.330> coming

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
run a concave through the nose coming

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.540 
run a concave through the nose coming
out<00:01:04.080> through<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> middle<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> board<00:01:05.010> but

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:05.550 
out through the middle of the board but

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.490 
out through the middle of the board but
that<00:01:05.610> allowed<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.270> board<00:01:06.480> to<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.380> a

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that allowed the board to do is have a

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
that allowed the board to do is have a
straighter<00:01:07.830> bottom<00:01:08.250> rocker<00:01:08.460> allowing<00:01:09.330> for

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
straighter bottom rocker allowing for

straighter bottom rocker allowing for
faster<00:01:09.960> paddling<00:01:10.440> and<00:01:10.620> easier<00:01:11.250> catching

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
faster paddling and easier catching

waves<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:13.050> round<00:01:13.409> tail<00:01:14.780> keeps<00:01:15.780> up<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.170> our

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
waves this round tail keeps up with our

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
waves this round tail keeps up with our
whole<00:01:16.500> system<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.730> we<00:01:18.000> want<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.330> tail

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
whole system in that we want a tail

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
whole system in that we want a tail
that's<00:01:18.780> able<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> sink<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> hold<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.159> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
that's able to sink and hold in and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.060 
that's able to sink and hold in and
steeper<00:01:21.600> critical<00:01:22.200> sections<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.890> wave

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
steeper critical sections of the wave

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.930 
steeper critical sections of the wave
without<00:01:23.670> giving<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.270> control<00:01:25.580> for<00:01:26.580> bottom

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
without giving up control for bottom

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.890 
without giving up control for bottom
turning<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.350> vertical<00:01:29.479> it's<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.600> board

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
turning for going vertical it's a board

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.039 
turning for going vertical it's a board
that<00:01:31.080> catches<00:01:31.500> waves<00:01:31.770> easy

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
that catches waves easy

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.569 
that catches waves easy
it'll<00:01:34.049> keep<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.350> smile<00:01:34.710> on<00:01:34.920> your<00:01:35.040> face<00:01:36.500> and

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579 
it'll keep a smile on your face and

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.590 
it'll keep a smile on your face and
basically<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.880> down<00:01:39.060> in<00:01:39.240> Hawaii<00:01:39.479> has

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
basically that's a down in Hawaii has

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.010 
basically that's a down in Hawaii has
always<00:01:39.750> been<00:01:39.990> about<00:01:41.360> if<00:01:42.360> you're<00:01:42.570> not<00:01:42.719> riding

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
always been about if you're not riding

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.979 
always been about if you're not riding
you're<00:01:43.500> not<00:01:43.649> having<00:01:43.950> fun
