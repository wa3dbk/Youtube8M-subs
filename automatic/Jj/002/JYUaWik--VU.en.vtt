 hello youtube friends welcome to the 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.500
 fifth part of curiosities and theories 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.630
 of the pokemon world let's start any 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.340
 that has played the original games of 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.410
 pokemon remember the grumpy old man 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.540
 lying on the street of the green city 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.940
 refusing to let the player pass 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.699
 until you are remarkably coffee 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.890
 in the Japanese version is not grumpy 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.380
 and stubborn but he fainted because he was 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.630
 drunk this was changed by the west 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.990
 since it was considered inappropriate for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.990
 children 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.640
 supreme island is an island that appears 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.579
 only in emerald pokemon and where 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.590
 mind appears however this island only 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.510
 is accessible by carrying the key object 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.879
 old map that you can only get 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.100
 from an event transferred by gift 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:53.079
 mysterious nintendo on the island 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.079
 You will find a little sign on which you put 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.080
 this could be translated as 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.950
 in the Japanese version of the game this 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.990
 message is mysteriously signed and the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.270
 first half of the name is missing 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.310
 the only character in the universe 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.590
 pokemon that really fits the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.659
 signature is Mr. Fuji and it is known that he 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.360
 is involved in the creation of muse 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.100
 with this in mind the supreme island has 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.140
 the 'new that was used to create in 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.479
 youtube as mentioned in a newspaper 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.950
 cinnamon island notes and was taken to a 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.950
 remote island out of danger 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.030
 bolton is really a co that goes to the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.640
 possessed by the unter well just listen to me 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.340
 Have you ever noticed the eyes of a hunter? 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.260
 and voltor's eyes are the same 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.810
 theory is that unter possessed a puch 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.370
 herbal but I could not escape so I 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.979
 the button is gone from the val 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:59.020
 when it is a gate constantly 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.780
 exploits because he's frustrated because he does not 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.729
 can go out in lake that pokemon decks 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.310
 Silver says it could have to do with 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.280
 the few balls in the glass pokédex 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.200
 says this after a lot of research is 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.690
 gave that the elements that make up this 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.730
 Pokemon are not in the wild apart 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.440
 of the artificial there is another thing that 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.239
 could you refer to this 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.310
 description of the pokédex what 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.440
 supernatural since the ghosts are 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.630
 supernatural you have to remember that he 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.410
 It is central power is very close to 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.410
 town band 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.510
 let's start with the introduction for 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.819
 people who do not know that this oasis in 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.819
 the pokemon of pokemon ruby ​​says this 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.950
 after being exposed to a laser beam 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.590
 DNA of a space virus suffered a 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.540
 mutation and gave rise to doses according to 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.640
 it seems the crystalline organ that this 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.190
 Pokémon has in the torso is the brain 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.920
 the theory says that it would come from the 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.110
 same place of space that dose and that 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.080
 both were affected by the same ray 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.780
 laser in lake that of c's of pokemon red 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.430
 and blue of this and says this an enigmatic 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.500
 pokemon that can regenerate with 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.110
 ease any appendix that loses the 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.870
 fight this entry refers to the 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.060
 recovery movement curiously 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.160
 this is the only water type pokemon that 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.620
 can learn recovery by climbing 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.630
 level in red and blue pokemon like they can 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.360
 listen to be there and can recover 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.700
 easily from attacks and heal 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.530
 now I will tell you something about opsis proxies 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.200
 is one of the psychic type pokemon 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.930
 most powerful that exists in the self of a 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.150
 space virus were two of opsis the 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.520
 that emerged from the space of which only 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.470
 one was born when entering the atmosphere 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.930
 inside a meteorite angered array 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.060
 house this added to that of oxy 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.250
 to communicate with your friend using a 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.380
 aurora made angry even more root cuasa 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.900
 because the auroras weaken the layer of 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:54.850
 ozone of opsis was attacked by rayco to 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.160
 out of a hyper ray was destroyed 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.710
 after four years of opsis it 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.210
 regenerated and went in search of his friend the 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.100
 second of opsis was created by the 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.590
 launching a laser beam from a 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:08.140
 laboratory to the space virus the virus 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.120
 mutated and so was born the second of kocsis of 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.760
 opsis was regenerated as it would be 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.590
 of opsis also has recovery on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.690
 core of being and what could be your 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.510
 brain as is the dose now 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.700
 let's talk about its stable evolution in the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.490
 pokemon yellow pokemon to be me 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.070
 says this its central area is known 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.100
 as the core is thought to be communicating 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.110
 by colors precisely this is the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.600
 same method that uses opsis to 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.790
 talk to your friend since opsis is 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.910
 communicates with his friend with an aurora the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.770
 which has many colors sometimes 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.310
 in lake that c's of being well pokemon 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.320
 crystal says this 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.240
 it seems to be using the nucleus 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.390
 Multicolored you have to send waves 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.190
 electric to space to space but 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.790
 because the space wants to communicate 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.940
 with docsis in the pokédex of being well 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.890
 fire red says this is from pokemon has 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.290
 a geometric body that will read a 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:05.180
 extraterrestrial aspect this every time 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.250
 it's getting more curious 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.960
 and remember to be me and to be and one 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.680
 they have gender even though they are not 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.680
 legendary 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.639
 let's go with the next higher pokemon 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:21.680
 could be inspired by the devil and 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.780
 that when he was a living being he had two 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.870
 feet but evolving no longer has 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.699
 feet someone sounds familiar in the 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:30.710
 bible the devil when it takes the form of 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.020
 a snake to tempt eba for 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.000
 eat the forbidden fruit is punished 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.919
 by god taking off his legs and 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.770
 turning it into an animal that crawls 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:42.710
 to move his Japanese name comes 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.289
 of ja that means snake and roda that 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.569
 means trunk this could do 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.030
 reference the tree of knowledge in 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.219
 where was the forbidden fruit now 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.039
 we go with the next curiosity that 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:57.889
 found nintendo fun ft w I'll leave you the 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.690

 black there is a song that is very 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.770
 similar to the song of the throne trailer 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.270
 i 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.570
