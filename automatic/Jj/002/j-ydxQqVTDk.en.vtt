00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.570
 today I come back with the hair 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.080
 anyway 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.099
 you talk about dairy products and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.139
 how can it affect 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.030
 your poor acne so what 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.469
 you know is that here it plantiers 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.450
 can cause problems I would tell you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.910
 no why and how 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 in the video and after I you 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.850
 will also explain how to know if 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 milk can affect you about it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.640
 people 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.859
 they have no problem with that he can 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 eat cheese can melt the 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.250
 milk crisis they will never have anything 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.320
 I like no problem and others like 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.550
 not me we just take a cup of 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.410
 the air we find ourselves two days after 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.070
 with lots of sheep his face when 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.320
 that's wonderful 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.730
 and suddenly I explained to you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.420
 how to substitute 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.890
 dairy products 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.170
 speaking of products to no longer have 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.239
 skin problems because of these 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.340
 products there so saw that you start 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.170
 I will tell you that I hold in no 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.789
 case to create a debate the products 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.300
 dairy with the conditions of the animals 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 and so on 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.110
 it's by a video made for that it's 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.640
 to explain you inform yourself of 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.379
 problems that can cause that can 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 cause the dairy is 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.149
 also all I say do not know 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.979
 not just of my head I did not hurt 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.900
 of research and therefore all my sources 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.060
 will be on the blog I want to make a 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.350
 article specifically for this video 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.729
 is all I said would be 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.140
 also written on the blog because 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.259
 like that if you ever want to come back 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.400
 after seeing what I said and the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.770
 sources you can directly the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.390
 to do via the article so I will put you 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.860
 in the info bar to be more 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.110
 easy for you to find him for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.400
 access to it is so now that everything 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.400
 that's good said we'll be able to start 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.700
 so in fact what happens is that 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.280
 in the milk there are hormones and this 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.100
 are the so- called androgen hormones are 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.470
 the hormones to say masculine but even 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.240
 women have one day ensures one has some 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.240
 but we have both know 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.440
 that too high rates of androgens 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560
 so here in this case in the eye at the 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.970
 testosterone and dhea and a rate too 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 high of these two hormones can you 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.800
 cause acne is so seen how 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.550
 we are already creating if more with the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.110
 dairy products 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.320
 Firstly, there is too much 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.760
 has exceeded the maximum threshold which is one going 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.930
 to say tolerated by our body and suddenly 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.940
 we will have acne 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.399
 in response to this too much at the doses 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.020
 of hormones and so that's the 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.600
 first come problem that can be 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.670
 related to dairy products second their 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.320
 to say little problem is that the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.670
 dairy products as full of 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.440
 products so there is everything that is the 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.000
 sweet products the potatoes the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.200
 refined products actually these products 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.010
 there to create insulin spikes 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.600
 is actually at insulin spikes 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.180
 promotes the creation of a less embarrassing 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.709
 so suddenly you have the milk that you 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.120
 already brings androgenic hormones 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.280
 and in addition who you create a pic 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.440
 of insulin what makes you 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.690
 recreate from above more than you create 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.350
 already you and for explodes eto'o and 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.510
 it was wonderful we acne 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.440
 these are products that nokia not that the 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.120
 dairy products there I told you 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.430
 also processed products so the 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.050
 ready-made dishes productions too 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.850
 Sweet south you add yourself 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.680
 a step south that has already taken contents 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.120
 in the fruit for example that's all 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.590
 that I put everything on the blog but 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.840
 all these products is causing you peaks 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.100
 insulin and therefore promotes milky and 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.480
 other hormones that has in the milk 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.060
 it's normal 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.260
 igf 1 it may sound a bit complex 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.800
 like no I reassure you simple to 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.510
 understand 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.370
 so in fact who I'm hungry it's norman 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.890
 of growth is what it does it's 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.709
 that when we take it that will accelerate the 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.750
 creation of cells and blow over 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.440
 these us to make more dead skin and 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.120
 blow the dead skin and a dead can 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.920
 block actually clog the pores of the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.420
 skin and suddenly favor the appearance 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.670
 buttons so the beast there are some 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.520
 solutions except is scrubs for 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.560
 in the East 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.790
 the excess dead skin it feels 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.680
 sport because that's a word nor can 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.410
 be reduced by physical activity 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.760
 but that's the way it's part of 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.190
 everything when you drink milk is 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.810
 also bring in more of the rest so if 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.580
 you stop your consumption of 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.300
 dairy products Thursday her the mbc 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.890
 dairy products 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.860
 you will not have all the 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.670
 troubles of hormones that I have you 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.870
 mentioned earlier 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.240
 and so now I'm going to you 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.980
 explain how to know if the products 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.550
 dairy also causes you to 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.550
 from the cne 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.850
 so in fact it's extremely simple 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.200
 Just stop dairy products 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.090
 what I did was that I 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.130
 stopped for three weeks every 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:16.370
 dairy products so cream milk 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.050
 and the cheese and after I reinstated 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.890
 each food but as and when 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.760
 not all three at the same time 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:25.950
 first I reinstated the milk is there 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.930
 hello it's me I missed you so 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.760
 here is the milk me it's out of the question 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:32.460
 that I take again that licks me buttons 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.860
 centric crazy so after I stopped the 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.480
 milk I waited a week and a 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.640
 time I had nothing more I took 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.740
 this time cream 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:43.140
 so here I took a lot for 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.210
 to see what it gave it gives a tool 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.830
 22 little buttons but it's okay if I 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.110
 do not take often I want to take some 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.520
 press firm rather cool and after so 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.260
 I waited another week tonight 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.300
 that this is recovering everything in place 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.040
 and I took this cheese trial and 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.780
 it's going old anyway I'm 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.240
 not a very big cheese player at 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.040
 the base but my cheeses it goes 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.830
 pretty good 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.900
 so this is the most painful in 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:12.020
 done it's for me it's milk after 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.020
 you can be cream or cheese 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.290
 so that's what we do is you 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.180
 stop for three weeks a month 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.800
 all the dairy products and wanted 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.600
 reinstate remake measure in your 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.500
 diet to see what you 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.500
 cause problems or not 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.410
 so now you have that the 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.420
 products were useful buttons and 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.880
 that it is absolutely wonderful I you 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:33.730
 explain how and by what to replace 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:34.990
 so these products there so for milk 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.210
 you first have everything ugly 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.770
 plant milk of coconut almonds 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.000
 object well ours coco in the morning in 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.210
 my teeth but seria I find it not 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.980
 wrong 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.440
 or so if you want a lot of milk 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.180
 more neutral there is the rice milk I you 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.650
 do not recommend products necessarily 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:49.840
 soy base because there are also some 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.600
 hormones in soybean rejection not dig 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.640
 a lot of that side but in case 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.620
 I put you aware I told you 

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.140
 then at the level of everything that is 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.540
 cheese to cheese based 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:03.100
 here are two the same plants for the 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.360
 cream to a cream that I recommend 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.920
 to go there the coconut cream but I 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:09.190
 prefer cream of rice because that's it 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:11.560
 it's more neutral at the end and it's going 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.540
 not wear the sweet side of the cream of 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.910
 coconut but after that you can 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:18.040
 find in organic stores there are 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.800
 brands like sojasun montceau ever 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.650
 me and good or who make products of 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.930
 dairy products without name of the products 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.270
 dairy are productive or that kind of 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.840
 brands can offer you 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:32.470
 dairy products 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.250
 these are the substitutes and it's 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.530
 rather not bad 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.120
 after another thing if ever in the morning 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.970
 you like to have a big glass of 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.530
 milk even with cocoa anything 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.180
 you can try to see to take 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.340
 instead of coffee or tea 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.169
 I went up there that I did not drink and 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.250
 who all cold that is not good so to 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:50.710
 sail the phone drink hot by 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:52.780
 constraint because otherwise the weird c1 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.590
 after but here is little replaced easily 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.510
 dairy products 

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.130
 we can believe it's complicated but in 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.110
 does not at all take just a little 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:01.240
 inquire and seek and once 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:03.419
 that we found low by buying the same 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.830
 thing and then it's the world so that's it 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.230
 it was my stick I hope it's two 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.660
 hours more than canceled the idiot of the 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.639
 video all my sources will be on the 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.219
 blog but the 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:16.830
 it's going to be the first link whose 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:18.509
 description will drop them and that's it 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.979
 yesterday to all who will be noted I have you 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:22.020
 also everything recapitulates what comes 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.419
 to say in this video on the blog 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.779
 simple easier I think to go 

00:07:24.419 --> 00:07:29.069
 read that to review the video taxes so 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:32.689
 here everyone is full of kisses 

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:32.689
 and next fugacious
