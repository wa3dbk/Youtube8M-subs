levitating around it but that's what

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.960 
levitating around it but that's what
Media<00:03:16.760> Molecule<00:03:17.090> decided<00:03:17.989> looked<00:03:18.260> cool<00:03:18.560> so

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
Media Molecule decided looked cool so

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.990 
Media Molecule decided looked cool so
we'll<00:03:19.970> go<00:03:20.150> with<00:03:20.180> that<00:03:20.799> make<00:03:21.799> sure<00:03:21.829> right<00:03:22.519> here

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
we'll go with that make sure right here

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.150 
we'll go with that make sure right here
to<00:03:23.810> get<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.140> key<00:03:24.350> up<00:03:24.500> in<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.680> top<00:03:24.890> right<00:03:25.130> I

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
to get that key up in the top right I

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.759 
to get that key up in the top right I
missed<00:03:25.549> it<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:25.910> I<00:03:25.940> just<00:03:26.239> held<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:27.170> just<00:03:27.380> stuck<00:03:27.590> in

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
missed it so I just held I just stuck in

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.710 
missed it so I just held I just stuck in
there<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:27.980> let<00:03:28.250> champio<00:03:28.760> go<00:03:29.060> across<00:03:29.299> and<00:03:29.600> grab

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
there and let champio go across and grab

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.690 
there and let champio go across and grab
it<00:03:30.069> that<00:03:31.069> unlocks<00:03:31.549> a<00:03:33.010> vs.<00:03:34.010> level<00:03:34.370> I<00:03:34.430> think<00:03:34.519> it
