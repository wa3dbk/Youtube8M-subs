00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.629
 Hello everyone, well, today we are going to 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.730
 do the unboxing of two little things that 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.029
 you see here and some are some helmets 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.070
 headphones with micro because I had already 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.869
 a few months ago and the truth that they are 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880
 pretty cheap and I go very well very 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.830
 well I'm even better than 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.039
 last I had to cost me about 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:31.010
 forty euros and these I think were worth 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.829
 about 12 or asia blazquez super good of 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.559
 price and as I said to me to me 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.750
 they are very good and I hope that 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.480
 keep working the same then I'll try it 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.100
 in the computer and well I want this 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.899
 say that they are provisional for the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.500
 channel because the ones I want to buy 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.570
 because they are not much better then here 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.340
 I prefer to save money buy me 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.930
 some flights and at the moment so power 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.270
 record also with ones that I know that I 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.790
 they will work well and not buy me 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.910
 any attitude although good we are going to 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.710
 go doing in a boxing 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.710
 let's go opening it 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.490
 to see around here if he tells us 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.329
 specifications and others to see where 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.329
 is that the espanyol 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.200
 well here we have the technical sheet that 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.670
 tells us that we have two connectors in 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.470
 the exterior is worth of the two connectors 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560
 I understand means it is tickets 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.750
 to enter audio output or from 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.450
 microphone and headphones that is like me 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 I always use them on the computer 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.800
 second I leave you here with my gober de 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.800
 Pokemon 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.190
 and teachers like that to one of the others the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.600
 little gifts that I've had 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.600
 of macho and rubén 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.600
 and I did not expect anything either because I see it 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.990
 I do not know what to give for 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.720
 disappeared I see quite commercial but 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.720
 well hey it 's nice too 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:17.210
 and to see men 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.460
 here we have the helmets that see the 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.250
 probable then they are very small they are 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.810
 super comfortable and the micro can is 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.010
 also very manageable I can put it 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.170
 to the extent that I want I can double it 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.810
 a lot of the ones I had before are 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.820
 super rigid and there were times then that I 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.590
 it cost you vale had to scream a little 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.770
 so that you will be heard 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.480
 decently and then as I was telling you to see 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.480
 that hooks right here 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.480
 where I want to teach 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.990
 here we have to raise and lower the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.960
 volume 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:03.910
 Let's see 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.310
 on a scale I have very bad light here to 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.860
 these hours 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:14.380
 and well, here I have both already worth 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.069
 and good here in the micro and the 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.920
 headphones then well then those 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.050
 I will try and see if they can serve me if 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.060
 I see that they do not go as they were before 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.160
 because I see that they are not exactly 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.560
 same the box is equal for the model 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.959
 yes here it changes a bit with what if not 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.360
 well what you can call yourself buys me 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.819
 of others meanwhile but is that what 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.430
 I said that I spent money on some and 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.019
 I'm missing the ones I do not know 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.019
 if you saw them the other day I made a 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.459
 video with them ones of color like lime and 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.430
 the truth is that you heard that 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:51.010
 I was sorry then for that because that's how 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.599
 but you recommend me some if you know 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.160
