another way to find out if you hit this
proximity<00:01:32.369> box<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.479> drag<00:01:33.750> down<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
proximity box and the drag down is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.780 
proximity box and the drag down is
pointing<00:01:34.500> down<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:34.979> little<00:01:35.250> arrow<00:01:35.460> key<00:01:35.670> is

pointing down this little arrow key is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.310 
pointing down this little arrow key is
pointing<00:01:36.119> down<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.110> show<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
pointing down it's going to show you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
pointing down it's going to show you
that<00:01:37.530> there<00:01:37.680> IM<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.040> available<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.840> containers

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
that there IM is available in containers

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
that there IM is available in containers
and<00:01:40.049> let<00:01:40.170> me<00:01:40.290> show<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.619> how<00:01:40.979> crazy<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.030> gets

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
and let me show you how crazy this gets

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.450 
and let me show you how crazy this gets
all<00:01:42.960> right<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.500> little<00:01:43.710> bit<00:01:43.920> overkill

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
all right this is a little bit overkill

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
all right this is a little bit overkill
but<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.060> get<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.810> this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
but you're going to get the just of this

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.240 
but you're going to get the just of this
right<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.560> you're<00:01:46.680> running<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.009> small

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
right here if you're running a small

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
right here if you're running a small

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.840 
camp of one to two maybe even three
people<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:50.009> only<00:01:50.130> need<00:01:50.310> about<00:01:50.460> three<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
people you only need about three of

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
people you only need about three of
these<00:01:50.909> boxes<00:01:51.450> because<00:01:51.600> they<00:01:51.810> refill

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
these boxes because they refill

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620 
these boxes because they refill
extremely<00:01:53.070> quickly<00:01:53.340> again<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.329> see

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
extremely quickly again the way you see

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.510 
extremely quickly again the way you see
if<00:01:54.750> they're<00:01:54.930> full<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.439> if<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> trap<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.159> down

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
if they're full is if the trap is down

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.639 
if they're full is if the trap is down
the<00:01:56.790> door<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> down<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.750> if<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:57.990> open<00:01:58.350> I've

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
the door is down and if it's open I've

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.170 
the door is down and if it's open I've
already<00:01:58.890> released<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> meat<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.820> they're<00:02:00.000> in

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
already released the meat and they're in

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.910 
already released the meat and they're in
my<00:02:00.329> inventory<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.140> or<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.439> simply<00:02:01.770> hit

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
my inventory here or you can simply hit

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.639 
my inventory here or you can simply hit
tab<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.579> notice<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.750> your<00:02:04.140> proximity

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
tab and notice that in your proximity

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.100 
tab and notice that in your proximity
there's<00:02:05.009> just<00:02:05.189> going<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.460> ton<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.210> rabbit

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there's just going to be a ton of rabbit

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
there's just going to be a ton of rabbit
meat<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> proximity<00:02:07.829> only<00:02:08.459> works<00:02:08.700> for

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
meat and the proximity only works for

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.910 
meat and the proximity only works for
about<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.300> two<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.599> three<00:02:10.020> foot<00:02:10.259> radius<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.800> as

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
about a two to three foot radius so as

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.559 
about a two to three foot radius so as
you<00:02:11.009> walk<00:02:11.190> deeper<00:02:11.400> you're<00:02:12.030> just<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.420> see

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
you walk deeper you're just going to see

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.350 
you walk deeper you're just going to see
this<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.870> is

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this this is

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.390 
this this is
overkill<00:02:14.170> but<00:02:14.680> there<00:02:14.860> are<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> lot<00:02:15.070> of<00:02:15.100> mouths

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
overkill but there are a lot of mouths

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.910 
overkill but there are a lot of mouths
to<00:02:15.610> feed<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.300> wookie<00:02:16.990> camp<00:02:17.290> okay<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.830> next

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
to feed in the wookie camp okay the next

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.740 
to feed in the wookie camp okay the next
thing<00:02:18.070> we<00:02:18.190> want<00:02:18.370> to<00:02:18.400> talk<00:02:18.490> about<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:19.000> hydration

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
thing we want to talk about is hydration

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.180 
thing we want to talk about is hydration
something<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.230> always<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.860> worry<00:02:21.100> about

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
something you always have to worry about

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.230 
something you always have to worry about
h1z1<00:02:21.940> even<00:02:22.930> after<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.980> nerf<00:02:24.250> by<00:02:24.760> developers

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
h1z1 even after the nerf by developers

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.240 
h1z1 even after the nerf by developers
on<00:02:25.360> both<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.720> rate<00:02:25.840> at<00:02:25.960> hydration<00:02:26.380> depletes

on both the rate at hydration depletes
along<00:02:27.730> with<00:02:27.880> your<00:02:28.030> energy<00:02:28.390> levels<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.500> how<00:02:29.680> do

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
along with your energy levels so how do

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.860 
along with your energy levels so how do
we<00:02:29.890> get<00:02:30.130> water<00:02:30.550> we<00:02:30.760> know<00:02:30.910> about<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.270> rivers<00:02:31.660> we

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
we get water we know about the rivers we

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.300 
we get water we know about the rivers we
know<00:02:31.990> about<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.320> lakes<00:02:32.590> more<00:02:33.010> than<00:02:33.160> likely

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
know about the lakes more than likely

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.310 
know about the lakes more than likely
you<00:02:33.580> already<00:02:33.790> know<00:02:33.910> about<00:02:34.030> Wells<00:02:34.360> by<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:34.780> but

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
you already know about Wells by now but

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.020 
you already know about Wells by now but
did<00:02:35.440> you<00:02:35.530> know<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:36.010> could<00:02:36.340> bash<00:02:36.610> a<00:02:36.640> fire

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
did you know you could bash a fire

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.120 
did you know you could bash a fire
hydrant<00:02:37.300> with<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> large<00:02:37.930> object<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.650> open<00:02:39.040> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
hydrant with a large object and open it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.520 
hydrant with a large object and open it
up<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.430> any<00:02:39.610> major<00:02:39.880> city<00:02:40.270> sit<00:02:41.020> next<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
up in any major city sit next to it and

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.410 
up in any major city sit next to it and
refill<00:02:42.400> your<00:02:42.550> bowels<00:02:42.880> but<00:02:43.030> what<00:02:43.180> does<00:02:43.300> this

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
refill your bowels but what does this

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.380 
refill your bowels but what does this
give<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.980> this<00:02:44.980> is<00:02:45.130> going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.370> give<00:02:45.520> you<00:02:45.670> dirty

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
give you this is going to give you dirty

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.150 
give you this is going to give you dirty
water<00:02:46.750> right<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.440> I've<00:02:47.530> got<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> bunch<00:02:47.920> of<00:02:47.980> empty

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
water right so I've got a bunch of empty

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.770 
water right so I've got a bunch of empty
bottles<00:02:48.459> which<00:02:48.700> is<00:02:48.850> typical<00:02:49.390> these<00:02:49.510> things

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
bottles which is typical these things

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.630 
bottles which is typical these things
are<00:02:49.990> very<00:02:50.590> important<00:02:51.160> so<00:02:51.280> we're<00:02:51.430> just<00:02:51.459> going

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
are very important so we're just going

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040 
are very important so we're just going
to<00:02:51.700> go<00:02:51.790> up<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.970> water<00:02:52.180> source<00:02:52.450> whether<00:02:52.660> it's<00:02:52.900> a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
to go up to water source whether it's a

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.430 
to go up to water source whether it's a
well<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.620> river<00:02:54.310> a<00:02:54.580> hydrant<00:02:55.300> or<00:02:55.390> rain<00:02:56.140> water

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
well of river a hydrant or rain water

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.050 
well of river a hydrant or rain water
and<00:02:56.770> we're<00:02:56.860> going<00:02:56.980> to<00:02:57.010> use<00:02:57.190> these<00:02:57.340> now

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
and we're going to use these now

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.050 
and we're going to use these now
normally<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.350> need<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.590> use<00:02:59.770> a<00:02:59.800> fire<00:03:00.340> to

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
normally you need to use a fire to
