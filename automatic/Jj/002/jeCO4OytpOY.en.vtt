00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.150
 our Italian subject we are going to make a 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.760
 Delicious caprese salad for that you 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.480
 I will pass the ingredients 160 grams 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.820
 of panela cheese a tomato ball something 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:36.410
 basil a teaspoon of oil 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:39.190
 olive and balsamic vinegar I bought this 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.180
 Cheese puts the rectangular shape 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.850
 because we 're going to do a little more 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:47.870
 monkey than normal instead of cutting it 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.000
 in slices or cut it into strips or 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.239
 leave it as it is we are going to mount it 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.070
 very nice in a tower shape and for 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.960
 that I brought a cookie cutter not 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.579
 worry if that's enough now 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.760
 I'm going to tell you what you can do with 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.760
 the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.440
 very well with a knife with little finger 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.540
 It is very important that you have little 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.350
 so as not to crush the tomato, let's 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.350
 cut the tomato 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.810
 trying to make everything the same 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.810
 thick this is 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.130
 so that at the time of riding you can see what 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.600
 more harmoniously possible in a dish that 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 you have in your house 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:35.130
 let's put a tomato as a base 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.530
 we put a slice more or less 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.540
 a quarter inch of cheese 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.950
 to continue 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.950
 with another tomato on top 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:52.090
 another slice of cheese 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.090
 and we ended up with another tomato on top 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.080
 I'm going to pepper 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.990
 I use grain salt 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:10.270
 and I like to use the whole peppers 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.930
 because it gives a lot more flavor leaflets 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.180
 of basil 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.180
 which I'm going to chop with my hands 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:28.850
 to give you a more natural look ready now 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.390
 almost ready, I'm just going to put my 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.390
 balsamic vinegar 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.439
 the balsamic vinegar you do not need 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.439
 measures a teaspoon of olive oil 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.690
 with this we finish our recipe 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.550
 This is your dish and you have finished what 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.350
