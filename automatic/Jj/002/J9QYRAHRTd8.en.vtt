00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
then to make a fine dice we're going to

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.400 
then to make a fine dice we're going to
just<00:00:44.879> slice<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.780> want<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.050> leave<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
just slice and you want to leave the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.299 
just slice and you want to leave the
root<00:00:46.620> section<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.140> slice<00:00:49.140> into<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> n

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
root section on and slice into the I n

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.080 
root section on and slice into the I n
three<00:00:53.309> or<00:00:53.460> four<00:00:53.730> times<00:00:54.289> like<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.090> then

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
three or four times like that and then

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
three or four times like that and then
on<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.840> top<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.149> there<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.809> quarter<00:01:01.469> inch

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
on the top and there in a quarter inch

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.420 
on the top and there in a quarter inch
increments<00:01:03.559> you<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:04.890> slice<00:01:07.070> across<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
increments you want to slice across the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.399 
increments you want to slice across the
top<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.150> we're<00:01:09.450> slicing<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:10.140> way

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
top this way so we're slicing this way

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.740 
top this way so we're slicing this way
about<00:01:10.740> four<00:01:11.280> times<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.820> quarter<00:01:12.210> quarter<00:01:12.479> inch

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
about four times in quarter quarter inch

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.380 
about four times in quarter quarter inch
increments<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> top<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:15.180> root

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
increments and then the top the root

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
increments and then the top the root
section<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.049> holding<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> whole<00:01:16.830> onion

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
section is holding the whole onion

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.929 
section is holding the whole onion
together<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.060> I've<00:01:18.479> only<00:01:18.689> cut<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:20.250> heat<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
together and I've only cut to heat to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.230 
together and I've only cut to heat to
here<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.799> root<00:01:23.280> section<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.850> holding

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
here so that the root section is holding

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.370 
here so that the root section is holding
the<00:01:24.360> whole<00:01:24.540> onion<00:01:24.900> together<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:26.360> then<00:01:27.380> with

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
the whole onion together and then with

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.319 
the whole onion together and then with
your<00:01:28.530> fingers<00:01:28.979> bent<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.180> knife

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
your fingers bent so that the knife

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.660 
your fingers bent so that the knife
doesn't<00:01:30.689> cut<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:32.009> going<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.220> hold<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
doesn't cut you you're going to hold the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.350 
doesn't cut you you're going to hold the
onion<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.369> slice<00:01:35.369> across<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.960> onion<00:01:37.470> in

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
onion and slice across that onion in

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.969 
onion and slice across that onion in
quarter<00:01:39.360> inch<00:01:39.570> increments<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.680> get<00:01:40.950> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
quarter inch increments so you get a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.170 
quarter inch increments so you get a
nice<00:01:41.340> fine<00:01:42.090> dice

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.440 

and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:48.040> repeat<00:01:48.430> that<00:01:48.580> with<00:01:48.730> the<00:01:48.880> other<00:01:49.060> half

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
and then repeat that with the other half

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.280 
and then repeat that with the other half
of<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.840> onion<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.610> prepare<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:52.150> garlic<00:01:52.630> first
