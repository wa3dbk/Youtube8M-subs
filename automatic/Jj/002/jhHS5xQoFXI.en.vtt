00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:17.359
 how to respond calmly when husband 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.279
 boosts voice brace explodes 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.289
 react when it means if something 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.470
 explodes you need first 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.199
 fall on the ground close your head and how would 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:33.590
 kicks to the blast lie down until 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:36.899
 everything won't settle down Chopin for something serious 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.110
 if your husband husband exploded and started 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.770
 raise your voice the first thing you need 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.579
 do it in no way 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.500
 continue to communicate further that is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.699
 until one of you of 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.890
 communicate them from swearing 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 from the conflicting parties as long as 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.350
 one of you is in an unstable 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.930
 emotional state of talking 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.170
 further useless why because 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.330
 a man in an unnatural state he 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.580
 can make 6 you can say all that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.060
 pleasing and in fact you are not you 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.799
 so if your situation is heating up 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.040
 and you understand what to talk 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.560
 calmly can not your task 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.259
 stop this conversation and transfer it 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.740
 later later on tomorrow but through 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.810
 a week 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:33.689
 I understand that your task is to get up and 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 go to another room or just say 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.880
 that i'm sorry dear can't in such 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.950
 mode 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.850
 to talk would look man 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:48.149
 he has any natural lion there is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:53.649
 two stress reactions to strong he either 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:54.820
 binds into a fight or runs away like 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.060
 rule a person chooses 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.549
 run away well because danger sat 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.170
 But if there is no way to run 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.740
 human capabilities remains only 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.539
 fight 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.399
 it is as if historically so 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.470
 primitive man look at you 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.060
 same situation your husband exploded he 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.390
 behaves emotionally 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.269
 unbalanced and you can either fight 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.810
 that is, begin to wrangle leave your 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.849
 point of view speaks and you yourself so 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.330
 blame and so on this is a fool 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.299
 either you can hit the road badly off 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.599
 battlefield go away wait out the storm in another 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:34.810
 place so that when all 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:37.560
 settle quietly discuss this situation 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.299
 as already normal calm tone well 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.440
 do it as productively as possible the 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:47.290
 there is understand that it is useless to fight 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.060
 you still will not achieve anything if you 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.989
 I think that you have a reasoned argument 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 you don't really have a fight and she argues 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.269
 real he is good for nothing 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.180
 will lead you can not achieve anything 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.340
 on high tones never easy
