00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
horsepower and get 30 miles to the

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.570 
horsepower and get 30 miles to the
gallon<00:01:51.689> that's<00:01:52.289> incredible<00:01:52.890> that's<00:01:52.950> muscle

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
gallon that's incredible that's muscle

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.370 
gallon that's incredible that's muscle
car<00:01:53.820> power<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.390> compact<00:01:54.840> car<00:01:55.110> fuel

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
car power with compact car fuel

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.539 
car power with compact car fuel
efficiency<00:01:55.920> yeah

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
efficiency yeah

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.609 
efficiency yeah
now<00:01:56.789> the<00:01:56.850> Mustang<00:01:57.330> still<00:01:57.600> uses<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.020> solid<00:01:58.439> rear

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
now the Mustang still uses a solid rear

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.469 
now the Mustang still uses a solid rear
axle<00:01:58.649> but<00:01:59.280> Ford's<00:01:59.729> engineers<00:02:00.149> have<00:02:00.360> been

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
axle but Ford's engineers have been

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.940 
axle but Ford's engineers have been
working<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:00.959> the<00:02:01.049> suspension<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:01.860> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
working with the suspension and the

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.710 
working with the suspension and the
steering<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.670> it's<00:02:02.819> going<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:02.970> handle<00:02:03.179> just<00:02:03.600> as

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
steering so it's going to handle just as

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.510 
steering so it's going to handle just as
well<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.229> independently<00:02:04.799> sprung<00:02:05.009> rivals

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
well as it's independently sprung rivals

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.160 
well as it's independently sprung rivals
and<00:02:05.700> also<00:02:06.149> there's<00:02:06.330> a<00:02:06.390> lighter<00:02:06.630> curb<00:02:06.929> weight

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and also there's a lighter curb weight

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.300 
and also there's a lighter curb weight
so<00:02:07.319> you're<00:02:07.470> really<00:02:07.860> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.130> able<00:02:08.220> to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
so you're really going to be able to

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.710 
so you're really going to be able to
carve<00:02:08.549> those<00:02:08.759> corners<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.120> thing<00:02:12.360> moves

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
carve those corners so this thing moves

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.520 
carve those corners so this thing moves
handles<00:02:13.500> well<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.810> stops<00:02:15.810> pretty<00:02:16.110> well<00:02:16.290> too

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
handles well and stops pretty well too

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.830 
handles well and stops pretty well too
now<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:17.459> talk<00:02:17.790> praise<00:02:18.120> it's<00:02:18.600> pretty

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840
