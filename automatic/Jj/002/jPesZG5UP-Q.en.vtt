a lot of fish in here and the first
thing<00:00:33.899> some<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.530> who<00:00:34.620> are<00:00:34.770> fish<00:00:35.130> experts

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
thing some of you who are fish experts

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.850 
thing some of you who are fish experts
in<00:00:35.820> ponds<00:00:36.210> may<00:00:36.630> look<00:00:36.870> at<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> say<00:00:37.290> whoa<00:00:37.559> there

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
in ponds may look at and say whoa there

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.470 
in ponds may look at and say whoa there
are<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.040> lot<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.370> fish<00:00:38.640> there's<00:00:38.879> too<00:00:39.059> many<00:00:39.180> fish

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
are a lot of fish there's too many fish

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.780 
are a lot of fish there's too many fish
in<00:00:39.510> there<00:00:39.780> they<00:00:40.410> also<00:00:40.620> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.430> very

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
in there they also have a very very

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.520 
in there they also have a very very
high-powered<00:00:42.390> filter<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.020> was<00:00:43.140> talking

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
high-powered filter and I was talking

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.200 
high-powered filter and I was talking
earlier<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> owner<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.090> were

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
earlier with the owner and we were

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
earlier with the owner and we were
saying<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.660> one<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.930> reasons<00:00:46.289> why<00:00:46.469> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
saying that one of the reasons why so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.010 
saying that one of the reasons why so
many<00:00:47.550> fish<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:48.059> probably<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.899> a

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
many fish can probably be in a

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
many fish can probably be in a
relatively<00:00:49.649> small<00:00:49.829> space<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.610> because<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
relatively small space is because of the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.300 
relatively small space is because of the
super<00:00:51.629> filter<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.289> have

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.310 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.040 

the<00:00:56.430> particular<00:00:56.700> system<00:00:57.150> that<00:00:57.360> they<00:00:57.630> have<00:00:57.840> for

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
the particular system that they have for

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
the particular system that they have for
all<00:00:58.080> those<00:00:58.590> fish<00:00:58.860> is<00:00:59.070> very<00:00:59.490> powerful<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.450> have

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
all those fish is very powerful we have

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.710 
all those fish is very powerful we have
a<00:01:00.600> UV<00:01:01.050> filter<00:01:02.040> so<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.790> water<00:01:03.060> actually<00:01:03.360> goes

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
a UV filter so the water actually goes

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.210 
a UV filter so the water actually goes
through<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.110> pipe<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.680> passed<00:01:04.979> through

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
through that pipe and is passed through

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.940 
through that pipe and is passed through
an<00:01:05.640> ultraviolet<00:01:06.330> filter<00:01:06.900> which<00:01:07.290> really<00:01:07.560> helps

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
an ultraviolet filter which really helps

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
an ultraviolet filter which really helps
to<00:01:08.010> kill<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.370> lot<00:01:08.670> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.970> algae<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.720> keep<00:01:10.200> that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
to kill a lot of the algae and keep that

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.710 
to kill a lot of the algae and keep that
water<00:01:10.650> super<00:01:11.100> healthy<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.850> big<00:01:12.150> tank<00:01:12.420> also

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
water super healthy this big tank also

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.320 
water super healthy this big tank also
has<00:01:12.930> more<00:01:13.260> filter<00:01:13.650> medium<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.060> we

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
has more filter medium in it so as we

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.640 
has more filter medium in it so as we
mentioned<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.810> beginning<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> video

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
mentioned at the beginning of the video

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.380 
mentioned at the beginning of the video
one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.100> reasons<00:01:17.430> why<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.700> waters<00:01:18.150> so

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
one of the reasons why the waters so

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
one of the reasons why the waters so
clear<00:01:18.660> and<00:01:19.110> why<00:01:19.560> they're<00:01:19.740> able<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.369> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
clear and why they're able to have so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.240 
clear and why they're able to have so
many<00:01:21.240> fish<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.690> a<00:01:21.840> relatively<00:01:22.320> small<00:01:22.740> space<00:01:22.920> is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
many fish in a relatively small space is

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.760 
many fish in a relatively small space is
because<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> powerful<00:01:24.210> filter<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.619> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
because of the powerful filter so if you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.820 
because of the powerful filter so if you
have<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.010> small<00:01:26.430> water<00:01:26.790> garden<00:01:27.320> really<00:01:28.320> set<00:01:28.710> it

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
have a small water garden really set it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.100 
have a small water garden really set it
up<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.369> best<00:01:29.610> filter<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.960> keep

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
up with the best filter you can to keep

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.340 
up with the best filter you can to keep
the<00:01:31.290> water<00:01:31.500> healthy

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.950 

so<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.130> plants<00:01:36.550> were<00:01:36.670> integral<00:01:37.240> part<00:01:37.630> of<00:01:37.750> any

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
so the plants were integral part of any

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.510 
so the plants were integral part of any
water<00:01:38.320> garden<00:01:38.680> you<00:01:38.770> can<00:01:38.920> see<00:01:39.070> we've<00:01:39.220> got<00:01:39.370> these

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
water garden you can see we've got these

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.510 
water garden you can see we've got these
great<00:01:39.729> reeds<00:01:40.090> here<00:01:40.620> the<00:01:41.620> plants<00:01:42.010> are<00:01:42.100> pulling

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
great reeds here the plants are pulling

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.940 
great reeds here the plants are pulling
the<00:01:42.670> carbon<00:01:43.030> dioxide<00:01:43.150> out<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.990> putting<00:01:44.620> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
the carbon dioxide out and putting the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.280 
the carbon dioxide out and putting the
oxygen<00:01:45.550> in<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.940> that's<00:01:46.450> helping<00:01:46.870> to<00:01:46.930> keep<00:01:47.110> the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
oxygen in and that's helping to keep the

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.950 
oxygen in and that's helping to keep the
fish<00:01:47.530> very<00:01:48.070> healthy<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.760> wide<00:01:49.450> variety<00:01:49.750> of

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
fish very healthy a wide variety of

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.359 
fish very healthy a wide variety of
plants<00:01:50.290> notice<00:01:50.560> we<00:01:50.680> have<00:01:50.770> some<00:01:50.950> plants<00:01:51.250> which

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
plants notice we have some plants which

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.500 
plants notice we have some plants which
are<00:01:51.460> going<00:01:51.640> tall<00:01:52.000> others<00:01:52.869> which<00:01:53.080> are<00:01:53.260> lower

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
are going tall others which are lower

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.810 
are going tall others which are lower
and<00:01:55.600> then<00:01:56.530> this<00:01:56.710> little<00:01:57.070> part<00:01:57.400> of<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> pond

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
and then this little part of the pond
