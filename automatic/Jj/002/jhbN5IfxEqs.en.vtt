so<00:00:00.810> sideshow<00:00:01.319> doesn't<00:00:01.709> have<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.979> have<00:00:02.129> a

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so sideshow doesn't have to have a

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.670 
so sideshow doesn't have to have a
separate<00:00:02.520> display<00:00:02.909> like<00:00:03.270> this<00:00:03.449> us<00:00:03.899> use<00:00:04.230> the

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
separate display like this us use the

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.240 
separate display like this us use the
main<00:00:04.859> LCD<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.000> unit<00:00:06.330> too<00:00:06.629> ah<00:00:06.810> I<00:00:07.770> can<00:00:08.099> give

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
main LCD in the unit too ah I can give

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.760 
main LCD in the unit too ah I can give
it<00:00:08.340> actually<00:00:08.700> switch

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.100 

such<00:00:13.770> a<00:00:13.800> runs<00:00:14.250> on<00:00:14.550> a<00:00:14.660> really<00:00:15.660> low<00:00:16.200> voltage

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
such a runs on a really low voltage

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.230 
such a runs on a really low voltage
microprocessor<00:00:19.110> so<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.190> means<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:21.090> would

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
microprocessor so this means it would

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.800 
microprocessor so this means it would
give<00:00:21.510> us<00:00:22.070> many<00:00:23.070> hours<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.939> battery<00:00:24.779> life

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
give us many hours of battery life

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.280 
give us many hours of battery life
compared<00:00:27.020> to<00:00:28.020> an<00:00:28.640> 23<00:00:29.640> hour<00:00:29.790> battery<00:00:30.029> life<00:00:30.290> it

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
compared to an 23 hour battery life it

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:36.530 
compared to an 23 hour battery life it
gives<00:00:31.650> us<00:00:31.950> secure<00:00:32.669> access<00:00:34.310> to<00:00:35.310> our<00:00:35.489> files<00:00:36.060> it

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
gives us secure access to our files it

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.010 
gives us secure access to our files it
can<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:38.510> secured<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:39.930> pin<00:00:40.230> code<00:00:40.940> it<00:00:42.020> shows

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
hours and of course you could view

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.540 
hours and of course you could view
pictures<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:55.380> could<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.010> meeting<00:01:56.400> and

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
touch screen enabled gadget you could

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.930 
touch screen enabled gadget you could
actually<00:02:11.700> have<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.269> make<00:02:12.569> some<00:02:13.519> notes<00:02:14.519> or

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
actually have a make some notes or

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.490 
actually have a make some notes or
drawings<00:02:15.560> while<00:02:16.560> while<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> meeting<00:02:17.790> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
drawings while while on the meeting and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.790 
drawings while while on the meeting and
and<00:02:19.280> also<00:02:19.550> read<00:02:19.850> possibly<00:02:20.240> hit<00:02:20.720> record<00:02:21.410> sound

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
and also read possibly hit record sound

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.980 
and also read possibly hit record sound
and<00:02:23.530> again<00:02:24.530> because<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:26.150> would<00:02:26.300> all<00:02:26.480> run<00:02:26.750> on

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
and again because it would all run on

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.680 
and again because it would all run on
the<00:02:27.260> side<00:02:27.470> so<00:02:28.450> processor<00:02:29.650> you<00:02:30.650> would<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:31.130> a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
the side so processor you would have a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.690 
the side so processor you would have a
really<00:02:32.690> nice<00:02:32.960> battery<00:02:33.560> life<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:34.040> then

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
really nice battery life and then

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.590 
really nice battery life and then
afterwards<00:02:35.330> stupid<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:36.140> course<00:02:36.530> compare

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
afterwards stupid of course compare

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.010 
afterwards stupid of course compare
convert<00:02:38.600> everything<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:41.060> your<00:02:41.540> useful

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
convert everything to to your useful

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.400 
convert everything to to your useful
tools<00:02:42.350> and<00:02:43.340> even<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:43.940> you<00:02:44.120> would<00:02:45.580> use<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:47.410> full

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
tools and even if you would use the full

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.400 
tools and even if you would use the full
operating<00:02:48.830> system<00:02:49.370> down<00:02:50.330> to<00:02:50.510> time<00:02:50.750> you<00:02:51.170> would

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
operating system down to time you would

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.479 
operating system down to time you would
still<00:02:51.680> get<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:53.209> much<00:02:53.390> better<00:02:53.810> battery<00:02:54.200> life

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
still get so much better battery life

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.140 
still get so much better battery life
and<00:02:55.489> one<00:02:55.790> really<00:02:56.030> nice<00:02:56.300> feature<00:02:56.660> of<00:02:57.820> sight<00:02:58.820> so

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150
