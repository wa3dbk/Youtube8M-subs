away from that section and find

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:33.620 
away from that section and find
something<00:04:32.580> that<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:32.880> really<00:04:33.210> loved<00:04:33.450> and

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
something that I really loved and

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.810 
something that I really loved and
because<00:04:34.140> this<00:04:34.380> item<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:34.770> not<00:04:34.830> in<00:04:35.100> their<00:04:35.280> ships

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
because this item was not in their ships

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.490 
because this item was not in their ships
in<00:04:35.880> 24<00:04:36.300> hour<00:04:36.390> section<00:04:36.780> and<00:04:36.990> meant<00:04:37.230> that<00:04:37.380> it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
in 24 hour section and meant that it

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.860 
in 24 hour section and meant that it
took<00:04:37.740> a<00:04:38.070> wee<00:04:38.460> bit<00:04:38.610> longer<00:04:38.760> together<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.540> think

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
took a wee bit longer together I think

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.110 
took a wee bit longer together I think
it<00:04:39.960> took<00:04:40.110> maybe<00:04:40.230> about<00:04:40.440> two<00:04:40.770> or<00:04:40.920> three<00:04:40.950> weeks

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
it took maybe about two or three weeks

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.480 
it took maybe about two or three weeks
but<00:04:42.120> it<00:04:42.480> was<00:04:42.720> definitely<00:04:43.200> worth<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.500> wait<00:04:43.950> it

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
but it was definitely worth the wait it

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.490 
but it was definitely worth the wait it
comes<00:04:44.730> with<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.300> top<00:04:45.540> and<00:04:45.810> a<00:04:45.900> skirt<00:04:46.140> but<00:04:46.380> I'll

thing<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.360> would<00:05:12.540> say<00:05:12.720> is<00:05:12.900> even<00:05:13.410> the<00:05:13.590> inside

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
thing I would say is even the inside

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.500

white<00:05:14.340> lining<00:05:14.700> is<00:05:14.820> a<00:05:14.850> little<00:05:15.210> bit<00:05:15.330> see-through

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510

I think that it could have been a little
thicker<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.940> would<00:05:18.120> have<00:05:18.240> made<00:05:18.390> this<00:05:18.990> skirt
