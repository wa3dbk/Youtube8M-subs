00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
counter so Fisher was before and this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.510 
counter so Fisher was before and this
was<00:01:06.570> what<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:07.049> saw<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.500> couple<00:01:07.560> years<00:01:08.100> ago<00:01:08.159> and

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
was what we saw a couple years ago and

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
was what we saw a couple years ago and
of<00:01:08.580> course<00:01:08.790> at<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.090> point<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.630> it's<00:01:09.810> pretty

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
of course at this point is it's pretty

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.480 
of course at this point is it's pretty
much<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.320> same<00:01:10.619> thing<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> just

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
much the same thing and this is just

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
much the same thing and this is just
skin<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.689> couldn't<00:01:13.020> really<00:01:13.200> do<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
