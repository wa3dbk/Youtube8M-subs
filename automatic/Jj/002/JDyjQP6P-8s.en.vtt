00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
annotation around the game card alright

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.060 
annotation around the game card alright
so<00:00:24.439> my<00:00:25.439> last<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:26.130> takes<00:00:26.460> I've<00:00:26.730> had<00:00:27.359> trouble

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
so my last two takes I've had trouble

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.690 
so my last two takes I've had trouble
I'm<00:00:29.070> hoping<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.609> this<00:00:29.789> thing<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> red<00:00:32.460> shell

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I'm hoping in this thing the red shell

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.880 
I'm hoping in this thing the red shell
says<00:00:32.910> double<00:00:33.239> protection<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.590> comes<00:00:34.800> with

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
says double protection and it comes with

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.540 
says double protection and it comes with
game<00:00:35.219> storage<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.660> game<00:00:36.870> card<00:00:37.140> storage<00:00:37.860> you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
game storage the game card storage you

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
game storage the game card storage you
know<00:00:38.670> six<00:00:39.090> games<00:00:39.390> now<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.829> try<00:00:41.219> I'm

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
trying to harm the box because I kind of

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.189 
trying to harm the box because I kind of
want<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.199> keep<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:56.420> all<00:00:57.420> right<00:00:57.510> that's<00:00:57.930> good
