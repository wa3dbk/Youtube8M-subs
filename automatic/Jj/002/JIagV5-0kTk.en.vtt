the three types a in network I don't

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.540 
the three types a in network I don't
know<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.200> but<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.620> can<00:01:13.800> use<00:01:14.010> device

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
know that is but then you can use device

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.870 
know that is but then you can use device
which<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.780> camera<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.730> screen<00:01:17.730> which

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
which is the camera and the screen which

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.820 
which is the camera and the screen which
is<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.120> i'm<00:01:18.210> using<00:01:18.420> so<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.650> bad

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
is what i'm using so it's not that bad

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.290 
is what i'm using so it's not that bad
it's<00:01:20.130> very<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.490> pretty<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
it's very actually pretty good and

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.840 
it's very actually pretty good and
pretty<00:01:21.510> impressed<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:22.050> it<00:01:22.400> but<00:01:23.400> i<00:01:23.580> would

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
pretty impressed with it but i would

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.000 
pretty impressed with it but i would
normally<00:01:23.970> fraps<00:01:24.630> ball<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.500> see<00:01:25.680> how<00:01:25.860> this

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
normally fraps ball to see how this

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.380 
normally fraps ball to see how this
would<00:01:26.220> work<00:01:27.080> but<00:01:28.700> yeah<00:01:29.700> I<00:01:29.760> think<00:01:29.940> that's<00:01:30.270> about

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
would work but yeah I think that's about

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.030 
would work but yeah I think that's about
it<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:31.080> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.350> just<00:01:31.380> record<00:01:32.220> with<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
it so you can just record with this and

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.940 
it so you can just record with this and
use<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:36.060> little<00:01:36.930> videos<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.770> want

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
use that for little videos that you want

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
use that for little videos that you want
to<00:01:38.010> make<00:01:39.020> part<00:01:40.020> my<00:01:40.170> case<00:01:40.410> sir<00:01:43.640> but<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.150> think

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to make part my case sir but I think

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.710 
to make part my case sir but I think
that's<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.110> so<00:01:46.980> when<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.430> record<00:01:47.910> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that's about it so when you record you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170 
that's about it so when you record you
won't<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.080> like<00:01:49.340> www<00:01:50.340> whatever<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.850> website

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
won't have like www whatever the website

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.530 
won't have like www whatever the website
is<00:01:51.330> calm<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.370> then<00:01:53.370> like<00:01:53.700> fraps<00:01:54.060> doesn't

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
is calm and then like fraps doesn't

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.320
