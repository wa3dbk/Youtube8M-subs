00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
sky-high you know his economy is

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.910 
sky-high you know his economy is
probably<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:18.990> doing<00:00:19.170> too<00:00:19.320> well<00:00:19.350> anyways<00:00:19.710> his

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920

probably not doing too well anyways his
bases<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.550> about<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> mine<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:21.090> so<00:00:21.240> you

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
bases are about to mine out so you

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.189 
bases are about to mine out so you
wouldnt<00:00:21.480> be<00:00:21.539> able<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> support<00:00:21.960> all<00:00:22.109> those

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199
