00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
articulating boom right here as you see

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.450 
articulating boom right here as you see
the<00:00:20.490> push<00:00:20.730> Blade<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:22.560> tracks<00:00:22.830> on<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.130> machine

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
the push Blade the tracks on the machine

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.400 
the push Blade the tracks on the machine
or<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:24.060> got<00:00:24.210> good<00:00:24.420> tread<00:00:24.779> but<00:00:24.960> they're<00:00:25.380> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
or they got good tread but they're a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
or they got good tread but they're a
little<00:00:25.710> on<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> weak<00:00:26.070> side<00:00:26.130> I'd<00:00:27.090> say<00:00:27.359> they're

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
little on the weak side I'd say they're

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.839 
little on the weak side I'd say they're
probably<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:28.050> 30%<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.980> probably<00:00:29.250> got<00:00:29.429> got

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
probably about 30% you probably got got

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.759 
probably about 30% you probably got got
three<00:00:30.060> four<00:00:30.240> 500<00:00:30.720> hours<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> life<00:00:31.320> left<00:00:31.590> in

three four 500 hours with a life left in

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:32.840 
three four 500 hours with a life left in
and<00:00:31.949> then<00:00:32.040> they're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> probably<00:00:32.610> need

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
and then they're going to probably need

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450 
and then they're going to probably need
to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.090> replaced<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:34.410> door<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> everything
