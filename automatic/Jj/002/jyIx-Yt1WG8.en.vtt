00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
is can fillings in my teeth cause hair

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.060 
is can fillings in my teeth cause hair
loss<00:00:40.970> yes<00:00:41.970> they<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.450> indeed<00:00:42.900> especially<00:00:43.500> if

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
loss yes they can indeed especially if

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.640 
loss yes they can indeed especially if
you<00:00:44.220> have<00:00:44.490> amalgam<00:00:45.270> things<00:00:45.540> in<00:00:45.810> your<00:00:46.020> teeth<00:00:46.290> I

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:46.650 
you have amalgam things in your teeth I

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.330 
you have amalgam things in your teeth I
find<00:00:47.400> that<00:00:47.990> in<00:00:48.990> many<00:00:49.410> many<00:00:49.560> cases

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
find that in many many cases

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.430 
find that in many many cases
I<00:00:50.490> have<00:00:50.700> people<00:00:51.180> when<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> test<00:00:51.930> their<00:00:52.230> hair

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I have people when I test their hair

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.070 
I have people when I test their hair
sample<00:00:53.130> but<00:00:53.700> they<00:00:54.120> actually<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> mercury

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
sample but they actually have a mercury

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.770 
sample but they actually have a mercury
toxicity<00:00:55.740> in<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> body<00:00:56.490> which<00:00:57.240> is<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.420> highly

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
toxicity in the body which is a highly

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.040 
toxicity in the body which is a highly
toxic<00:00:58.140> metal<00:00:58.860> which<00:00:59.190> comes<00:00:59.660> mostly<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
toxic metal which comes mostly from the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.860 
toxic metal which comes mostly from the
fillings<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:01.920> amalgam<00:01:02.630> fillings<00:01:03.630> in

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
fillings in your amalgam fillings in

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.520 
fillings in your amalgam fillings in
your<00:01:03.900> teeth<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.939> this<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.299> seep<00:01:06.840> into<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
your teeth and this can seep into the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.389 
your teeth and this can seep into the
digestive<00:01:07.829> tract<00:01:08.579> and<00:01:09.439> really<00:01:10.439> reap<00:01:10.649> havoc<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
digestive tract and really reap havoc in

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.300 
digestive tract and really reap havoc in
the<00:01:11.579> in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.060> body<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:14.039> ultimately

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
the in the body and that can ultimately

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.899 
the in the body and that can ultimately
affect<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.210> hair<00:01:15.420> very<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:16.049> badly<00:01:16.729> also<00:01:17.729> if

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
affect the hair very very badly also if

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.880 
affect the hair very very badly also if
you<00:01:17.999> have<00:01:18.149> amalgam<00:01:18.630> fillings<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.319> gold

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
you have amalgam fillings and gold

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.090 
you have amalgam fillings and gold
fillings<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.460> well<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.509> creates<00:01:22.200> some

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
fillings as well that creates some

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.120 
fillings as well that creates some
currants<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.999> the<00:01:24.390> mouth<00:01:24.600> which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.649> very

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
currants in the mouth which is very

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.940 
currants in the mouth which is very
detrimental<00:01:26.999> to<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> good<00:01:28.200> functioning<00:01:28.439> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
detrimental to the good functioning of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.559 
detrimental to the good functioning of
the<00:01:29.100> brain<00:01:29.340> because<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.030> can<00:01:30.149> imagine<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
the brain because you can imagine the

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:32.859 
the brain because you can imagine the
mouth<00:01:30.749> is<00:01:30.929> quite<00:01:31.200> near<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.649> brain<00:01:32.069> area<00:01:32.609> and

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
mouth is quite near the brain area and

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.599 
mouth is quite near the brain area and
that<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.170> be<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.530> great<00:01:34.859> problem<00:01:35.159> again

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
that can be a great problem again

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.270 
that can be a great problem again
because<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> pituitary<00:01:36.630> gland<00:01:36.899> in<00:01:37.499> your

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
because the pituitary gland in your

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.139 
because the pituitary gland in your
brain<00:01:38.899> will<00:01:40.039> govern<00:01:41.039> the<00:01:41.069> hormones<00:01:41.670> in<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
brain will govern the hormones in the

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.660 
brain will govern the hormones in the
body<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:43.979> if<00:01:44.249> it's<00:01:44.549> not

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
body so if that is this one if it's not

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.419 
body so if that is this one if it's not
good<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> hair<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.319> if<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.280> are

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
good for the hair and if you are

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.999 
good for the hair and if you are
vulnerable<00:01:47.999> to<00:01:48.060> mercury<00:01:48.630> toxicity<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
vulnerable to mercury toxicity then that

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.129 
vulnerable to mercury toxicity then that
can<00:01:50.219> actually<00:01:50.399> cause<00:01:50.789> your<00:01:51.299> hair<00:01:51.719> to<00:01:51.840> fall<00:01:51.959> out

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
can actually cause your hair to fall out

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.279 
can actually cause your hair to fall out
so<00:01:53.069> Moke<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> very<00:01:53.789> damaging<00:01:54.329> as<00:01:54.479> much<00:01:54.719> it<00:01:55.139> is

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
so Moke is very damaging as much it is

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.980 
so Moke is very damaging as much it is
extremely<00:01:55.889> damaging<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.609> sadly<00:01:57.209> it<00:01:57.780> is<00:01:57.840> not

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
extremely damaging and sadly it is not

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.069 
extremely damaging and sadly it is not
recognized<00:01:58.889> by<00:01:59.759> many<00:01:59.909> dentists<00:02:00.479> still<00:02:00.810> they

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
recognized by many dentists still they

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.300 
recognized by many dentists still they
will<00:02:01.229> still<00:02:01.529> tell<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.069> completely

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
will still tell you it's completely

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.649 
will still tell you it's completely
harmless<00:02:02.840> there's<00:02:03.840> no<00:02:04.020> problem<00:02:04.380> with

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:04.659 
harmless there's no problem with

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.370 
harmless there's no problem with
but<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.619> thing<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:05.829> remember<00:02:06.009> there<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.880> that

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
but the thing to remember there is that

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.710 
but the thing to remember there is that
when<00:02:08.380> your<00:02:09.130> dentist<00:02:09.580> takes<00:02:09.849> out<00:02:10.090> an<00:02:10.270> amalgam

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
when your dentist takes out an amalgam

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.370 
when your dentist takes out an amalgam
filling

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
filling

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.140 
filling
he<00:02:11.830> can't<00:02:12.099> just<00:02:12.190> throw<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.670> in<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.970> bin

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
he can't just throw it in the bin

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.530 
he can't just throw it in the bin
because<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:14.050> is<00:02:14.200> toxic<00:02:14.470> waste<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:16.000> how<00:02:16.239> can<00:02:16.300> it
