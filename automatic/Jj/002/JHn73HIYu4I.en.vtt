editor at Forbes magazine for the past
two<00:00:10.790> weeks<00:00:10.820> I've<00:00:11.150> been<00:00:11.179> driving<00:00:11.630> the<00:00:11.720> new<00:00:11.840> Ford

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
two weeks I've been driving the new Ford

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.980 
two weeks I've been driving the new Ford
Focus<00:00:12.469> Electric<00:00:12.800> the<00:00:13.700> Focus<00:00:14.000> has<00:00:14.150> a<00:00:14.179> 76<00:00:14.750> mile

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
Focus Electric the Focus has a 76 mile

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.660 
Focus Electric the Focus has a 76 mile
range<00:00:15.320> which<00:00:15.650> is<00:00:15.799> comparable<00:00:16.130> to<00:00:16.219> a<00:00:16.340> Nissan

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
range which is comparable to a Nissan

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.490 
range which is comparable to a Nissan
Leaf<00:00:16.700> but<00:00:17.240> one<00:00:17.390> thing<00:00:17.599> for<00:00:17.779> did<00:00:18.020> differently

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
Leaf but one thing for did differently

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.439 
Leaf but one thing for did differently
is<00:00:18.650> they<00:00:18.859> put<00:00:19.130> in<00:00:19.279> an<00:00:19.430> onboard<00:00:19.640> charger<00:00:19.940> that

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
is they put in an onboard charger that

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.720 
is they put in an onboard charger that
is<00:00:20.539> twice<00:00:20.900> as<00:00:20.960> big<00:00:21.199> at<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:21.890> leave<00:00:22.100> so<00:00:22.400> this<00:00:22.550> car

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
is twice as big at the leave so this car

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.880 
is twice as big at the leave so this car
will<00:00:22.850> fully<00:00:23.420> charge<00:00:23.539> up<00:00:24.020> from<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:24.590> depleted

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
will fully charge up from the depleted

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.670 
will fully charge up from the depleted
battery<00:00:25.279> in<00:00:25.369> about<00:00:25.550> three<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:25.760> four<00:00:25.970> hours

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
battery in about three to four hours

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.080 
battery in about three to four hours
another<00:00:27.680> thing<00:00:28.130> I<00:00:28.220> like<00:00:28.430> about<00:00:28.460> this<00:00:28.699> car<00:00:28.910> is

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
another thing I like about this car is

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.679 
another thing I like about this car is
when<00:00:29.240> you<00:00:29.330> approach<00:00:29.570> the<00:00:29.750> car<00:00:29.900> open<00:00:30.769> the<00:00:30.890> door

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
when you approach the car open the door

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.700 
when you approach the car open the door
it'll<00:00:32.689> tell<00:00:32.900> you<00:00:33.019> what<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:33.199> charge<00:00:33.470> is<00:00:33.680> just

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
it'll tell you what the charge is just

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.959 
it'll tell you what the charge is just
by<00:00:33.949> looking<00:00:34.220> at<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.489> charge<00:00:34.699> court<00:00:35.059> itself

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
by looking at the charge court itself

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.819 
by looking at the charge court itself
we're<00:00:37.969> in<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.149> downtown<00:00:38.570> Berkeley<00:00:39.020> garage

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
we're in the downtown Berkeley garage

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.590 
we're in the downtown Berkeley garage
which<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.850> only<00:00:40.940> place<00:00:41.149> in<00:00:41.390> the<00:00:41.450> city

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
which is the only place in the city

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.240 
which is the only place in the city
where<00:00:41.809> I<00:00:41.840> can<00:00:41.989> actually<00:00:42.230> get<00:00:42.500> a<00:00:42.530> charge<00:00:42.890> on<00:00:43.129> the

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
where I can actually get a charge on the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.090 
where I can actually get a charge on the
car<00:00:43.489> they<00:00:43.910> have<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.149> level<00:00:44.450> 2<00:00:44.570> charging<00:00:45.100> port

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
car they have a level 2 charging port

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.590 
car they have a level 2 charging port
which<00:00:46.309> means<00:00:46.520> they'll<00:00:46.730> charge<00:00:47.210> up<00:00:47.360> in<00:00:47.450> about

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
which means they'll charge up in about

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.180 
which means they'll charge up in about
three<00:00:47.780> to<00:00:47.870> four<00:00:47.989> hours<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:48.680> I've<00:00:48.800> been<00:00:48.920> coming

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
three to four hours so I've been coming

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.650 
three to four hours so I've been coming
down<00:00:49.219> here<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.789> charge<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.180> car<00:00:50.360> since<00:00:50.570> I

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
down here to charge the car since I

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.959 
down here to charge the car since I
don't<00:00:50.750> have<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:50.960> charger<00:00:51.260> at<00:00:51.350> home<00:00:51.730> so<00:00:52.730> when<00:00:52.879> the

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
don't have a charger at home so when the

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.639 
don't have a charger at home so when the
ring<00:00:53.120> lights<00:00:53.329> up<00:00:53.539> around<00:00:53.780> the<00:00:53.989> charging<00:00:54.500> port

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
ring lights up around the charging port

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.729 
ring lights up around the charging port
in<00:00:55.070> the<00:00:55.160> case<00:00:55.309> said<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.610> charging<00:00:55.910> and<00:00:56.739> when

in the case said it's charging and when

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.229 
in the case said it's charging and when
it's<00:00:57.860> done<00:00:58.039> charging<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.579> focus<00:00:58.850> will<00:00:59.000> text

almost the same as a gasoline powered

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
see that go down as we go up the hill so

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.170

Rafael which is about 20 miles from here

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.170 
Rafael which is about 20 miles from here
from<00:04:16.060> Berkeley<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.690> about<00:04:16.989> 27<00:04:17.590> miles

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
from Berkeley and about 27 miles

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.790 
from Berkeley and about 27 miles
rumbling<00:04:19.180> that's<00:04:19.299> where<00:04:19.479> I'm<00:04:19.570> going<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:22.800> will

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:06.699 
that's what I do on the weekends most

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:08.939 
that's what I do on the weekends most
weekends<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.690> spor<00:06:08.259> doesn't<00:06:08.529> offer<00:06:08.650> a<00:06:08.740> roof

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
weekends and spor doesn't offer a roof

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.469 
weekends and spor doesn't offer a roof
rack<00:06:09.129> because<00:06:09.580> again<00:06:09.789> because<00:06:10.060> of<00:06:10.089> the<00:06:10.240> drag

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
rack because again because of the drag

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.860 
rack because again because of the drag
would<00:06:10.779> create<00:06:11.139> I<00:06:11.319> suspect<00:06:11.830> but<00:06:12.490> you<00:06:13.060> know<00:06:13.150> not

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
would create I suspect but you know not

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:14.879 
would create I suspect but you know not
something<00:06:14.110> I'm<00:06:14.169> really<00:06:14.289> to<00:06:14.469> give<00:06:14.589> up<00:06:14.710> for<00:06:14.830> an

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
something I'm really to give up for an

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:33.510 
something I'm really to give up for an
electric<00:06:15.190> car

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.820 

so<00:06:34.520> a<00:06:34.550> surfboard<00:06:35.360> rack<00:06:36.050> would<00:06:36.230> be<00:06:36.380> better<00:06:36.620> that

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:36.830 
so a surfboard rack would be better that

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.000 
so a surfboard rack would be better that
it's<00:06:37.670> doable
