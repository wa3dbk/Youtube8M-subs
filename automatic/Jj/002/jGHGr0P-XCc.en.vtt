00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.299
 hi everyone, today I wanted to create 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.540
 this short video to show you 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.110
 an application in my opinion 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.549
 interesting that takes a part 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.170
 of the htc sense 3.0 and in this case 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.010
 screen lock 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.020
 then let's see immediately 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.029
 the application in many of you 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.640
 surely they have already seen how 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.019
 then works to unlock the screen 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.710
 we should go and get this 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.689
 circle and take it to the center like 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.730
 see we just unlocked it 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.700
 screen 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.879
 then let's go to lower the screen e 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.649
 we have the screen as you can see 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.739
 we will have the possibility to set 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.059
 up to four applications on the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:59.340
 screen where to open them we should 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:01:02.579
 take it inside this circle 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.619
 application let's say it seems to me that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 has been recently put on the market 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:12.210
 so there is something to improve there 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.180
 example me on the galaxy s2 bringing in 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.659
 to messages circled the application goes 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.659
 in crash 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.810
 I don't know if it's a bug but I think so because 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.620
 like the other three icons all work 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.780
 and three 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.530
 maybe on other devices it doesn't 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.020
 this thing of this application is there 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.900
 the free version a version a 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.780
 payment where in the free application 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.180
 at the lock screen set by default 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.540
 without the ability to set them all 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.490
 the other settings while that 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.430
 payment we can set the background 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:56.740
 animation the various the four icons 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:01.210
 by default and many other things 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.119
 a flaw that I found both in 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.130
 free version in the paid version 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.550
 is that if we have task manager or 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:12.370
 if you also use faster and booth e 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.530
 we close all this applications 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.270
 it freezes and we in a nutshell will have to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.340
 go and pick it up again to open it and do it 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.410
 stop and start if we use task manager 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.670
 it would be enough that we put 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.849
 the application in the list where 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.650
 where we want them not to close 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.250
 the application while if we use faster 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.459
 boot this thing cannot be remedied 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.380
 let's say this is a window 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.040
 many of you may not even use it 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.110
 fas tribute but I thought it was a lot 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.130
 beautiful this this block stops 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:55.690
 screen to show you anything if you want 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.690
 try it let me know 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.159
 come and find me on the blog where you find 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.190
 the link in the description hello everyone 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.190
