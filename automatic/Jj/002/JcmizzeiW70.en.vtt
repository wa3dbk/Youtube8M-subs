00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.979 
machine have the cleaner head that
covers<00:00:57.399> the<00:00:57.519> width<00:00:57.729> of<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.969> product<00:00:58.329> so<00:00:58.869> the

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
covers the width of the product so the

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.949 
covers the width of the product so the
path<00:00:59.199> it<00:00:59.409> takes<00:00:59.589> is<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.100> path<00:01:00.280> it<00:01:00.489> cleans<00:01:00.959> some

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:01.959 
path it takes is the path it cleans some

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.569 
path it takes is the path it cleans some
other<00:01:02.109> robot<00:01:02.440> machines<00:01:02.799> have<00:01:03.129> these<00:01:03.309> side

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
other robot machines have these side

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.369 
other robot machines have these side
sweepers<00:01:04.030> which<00:01:04.270> are<00:01:04.540> meant<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.750> help<00:01:04.960> make<00:01:05.199> up

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
sweepers which are meant to help make up

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.780 
sweepers which are meant to help make up
for<00:01:05.410> the<00:01:05.680> small<00:01:05.800> width<00:01:06.160> of<00:01:06.280> the<00:01:06.370> cleaner<00:01:06.580> head

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
for the small width of the cleaner head

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.330 
for the small width of the cleaner head
these<00:01:07.540> side<00:01:07.840> sweepers<00:01:08.320> sometimes<00:01:08.830> just

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
these side sweepers sometimes just

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.430 
these side sweepers sometimes just
disturb<00:01:09.790> the<00:01:09.970> dust<00:01:10.240> rather<00:01:10.870> than<00:01:11.110> actually

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
disturb the dust rather than actually

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.590 
disturb the dust rather than actually
sucking<00:01:11.680> it<00:01:11.890> up<00:01:12.070> they<00:01:12.580> can<00:01:12.850> flick<00:01:13.150> dust<00:01:13.420> up

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
sucking it up they can flick dust up

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.910 
sucking it up they can flick dust up
into<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.900> air<00:01:14.080> which<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.410> really<00:01:14.650> the<00:01:14.770> last

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
into the air which is really the last

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.150 
into the air which is really the last
place<00:01:15.220> that<00:01:15.250> you<00:01:15.460> want<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:16.710> having<00:01:17.710> sucked<00:01:17.950> up

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
place that you want to having sucked up

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.530 
place that you want to having sucked up
the<00:01:18.310> dust<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.700> dirt<00:01:18.790> from<00:01:18.910> the<00:01:19.120> floor<00:01:19.360> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
the dust and dirt from the floor the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.000 
the dust and dirt from the floor the
next<00:01:19.570> thing<00:01:19.900> we<00:01:19.990> have<00:01:20.140> to<00:01:20.260> do<00:01:20.350> is<00:01:20.470> separate<00:01:20.950> the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
next thing we have to do is separate the

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.830 
next thing we have to do is separate the
dust<00:01:21.310> from<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.610> airflow<00:01:21.970> and<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.510> way<00:01:22.690> we

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
dust from the airflow and the way we

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.390 
dust from the airflow and the way we
achieve<00:01:23.110> this<00:01:23.290> is<00:01:23.500> by<00:01:23.530> using<00:01:23.650> cyclonic

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
achieve this is by using cyclonic

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.090 
achieve this is by using cyclonic
technology<00:01:24.810> so<00:01:25.810> we<00:01:25.960> have<00:01:26.110> one<00:01:26.350> large<00:01:26.770> outer

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
technology so we have one large outer

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.400 
technology so we have one large outer
cyclone<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:28.000> we<00:01:28.120> have<00:01:28.270> eight<00:01:28.480> inner<00:01:28.810> cyclones

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
cyclone and we have eight inner cyclones

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.530 
cyclone and we have eight inner cyclones
that<00:01:29.710> remove<00:01:29.950> the<00:01:30.070> finer<00:01:30.340> dust<00:01:30.670> and<00:01:30.910> because

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
that remove the finer dust and because

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.090 
that remove the finer dust and because
of<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.720> extremely<00:01:32.140> high<00:01:32.380> velocity<00:01:32.920> of<00:01:33.010> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
of the extremely high velocity of the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.620 
of the extremely high velocity of the
airflow<00:01:33.520> we're<00:01:33.790> even<00:01:34.060> able<00:01:34.150> to<00:01:34.390> remove

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
airflow we're even able to remove

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.370 
airflow we're even able to remove
microscopic<00:01:35.410> particles<00:01:35.860> from<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.130> air
