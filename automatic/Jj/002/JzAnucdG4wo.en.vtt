00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello guys how are you today we are going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.140
 talk about a topic that has caused 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.930
 quite controversy does a lot 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.190
 time and today reviewing the information I 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.010
 I realize that the form is changing 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.170
 in how these encounters are explained 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.240
 Workouts burn more calories is 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.080
 of what we are going to talk about the day how much 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.240
 fat can be burned in each type of 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.029
 training how do we know there are two types 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.670
 of training the aerobic and the aero 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.129
 according to the books we are not explained 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.019
 they say that in the aerobic we burn 

00:00:31.129 --> 00:00:35.670
 approximately from 60 to 70 per 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.519
 one hundred percent of the total number of calories 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.970
 that we eat is fat while from a 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.070
 anaerobic training 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.440
 the amount of fat of all 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.140
 calories comes to be from 30 to 35 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.560
 percent thus according to the books 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.940
 we burn more fat here in the air 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:59.320
 This is what many coaches will 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.670
 they inform their students and many students 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.310
 they understand what you have to train 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.770
 in a very cardiovascular way or very 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.020
 aerobic to lose weight and 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.640
 burn fat but let's put a 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.280
 example and I want you to draw your 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.850
 own conclusions imagine that 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.540
 we train 45 minutes 45 minutes of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.270
 aerobic form at 65% gives us 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.880
 approximately a burn of 220 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 calories if we go to the percentage says 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:32.050
 which of these 220 calories from 60 to 70 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.720
 percent of these calories from fat 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.720
 then drawing blood on the 60th and we're going to 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 put an average of 65 percent of 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:46.050
 these calories did not vote a result of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.050
 143 calories from fat 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.310
 that is, delivering 45 minutes in a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.069
 very aerobic work we carry 220 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.530
 calories of which 143 are calories 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.030
 of fat we are going to talk another part if 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.819
 we trained in aerobic form yes and 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.849
 from 80 to 85 percent we carry 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.690
 approximately 750 calories from 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:14.700
 which 30 35 percent fat 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.069
 taking that out in calculations comes out 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.680
 approximately 260 and 2.5 calories from 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.340
 grease 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.379
 then we return to the case according to 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.790
 books and studies tell us that the 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.129
 work is the only thing that we go much more 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.260
 fat that in the agrarian work but if 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.939
 we go to the practice and we take the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.030
 same calculations that the books tell us 

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:41.780
 we realize that I work training 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.359
 the same time in these areas because it 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.340
 burn more calories from fat in jobs 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.549
 intense with those of anaerobic works 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.680
 here I go with all this to that is not 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.260
 partial that to lose weight there 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.629
 to train aerobically and you have to 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.060
 train in a cardiovascular way you have to 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.069
 also do weights and you have to alternate 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.379
 I know that this will depend a lot 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.230
 of the objective that our students have 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:08.239
 and the goal that we have for 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.340
 our workouts are always going to 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.590
 excel one over the other but 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.150
 always have to go hand in hand is a 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.950
 mistake that people who want to download 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.390
 of weight just do exercises 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:22.140
 cardiovascular because they will be 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.540
 being very very little fat and very 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.670
 little calories even though the 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.590
 book tell us we have 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.400
 another of the things I wanted to tell you already 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.340
 to finish is that this work the 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.610
 aerobic and in this percentage are at 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.819
 that does not listen where it says exercises 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.459
 on-line 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.650
 because online because only when it is 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.139
 connected only when you're doing the 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.109
 work you are burning calories 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.590
 once you stop doing the work already 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:56.170
 there are no more calories while the 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.439
 anaerobic exercise the one here is at 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.469
 we tell you the offline because online 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.870
 because even when we leave 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:08.349
 of doing our body exercise 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.019
 still burning calories then 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:13.719
 no doubt if your goal is to lose weight 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.459
 and burn fat this is your best 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:18.549
 training the training 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.979
 anaerobic that would come to be intense 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.750
 a 45-minute routine because it's going to 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.210
 carry this much more fat 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.389
 and above all it's going to help you burn 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.340
 fats when you're no longer connected to 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.260
 the exercise 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.400
 that was my advice for today 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.350
 Alternative boys 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.350
 this depends a lot also as I told you 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.360
 of the objectives of each type of person 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.009
 and I wanted this to be clear 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.840
 we did with the coaches what 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.310
 let's say that to lose weight alone 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.170
 they have to bring 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.240
 but all this information we are going to 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.240
 keep hanging more videos and not
