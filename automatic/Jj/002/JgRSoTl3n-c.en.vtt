 The break was already a long time for the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:42.059
 three months or so you could not 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
 more break call so no idea 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.530
 she even guessed that she had stopped 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:52.199
 because all my videos could be promised 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.129

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:20.350
 a bit further up front than the penultimate 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:24.060
 or last life's life package star 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.060

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.850

 is turned off okay I'm like 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.380
 I am still a round because I believe 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.370
 that was a little too little three 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.610
 minutes for a tiny shot is yes 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:17.350
 even less than when we do 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:23.590
 another round and then in the evening yes 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.820

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.739
 But what was changed yet 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.230
 So that means I have in my old one 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:34.370
 Akw again so I could access 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.590

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.959
 without rushing 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.680
 always wanted to track displays 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.160

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.110

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.730
 I've got thumbs up or thumbs up 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.590
 of course, if you want to force down 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.700
 Of course you are not only note 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.090

 Of course he runs there or too 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.530
 I can not find one with only one guy 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.990
 ok the type of the other 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.430
 in the other side in any case 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.700
 I got a safety vest there and me 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:50.240
 I hope there in front there is also one 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.990
 pistols symbol 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:56.660
 I hope that there is one 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:58.100
 that's why he or I say knows 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.780
 Of course not, but I call it 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.340
 Just put the sentence eagles or one 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.770
 cheap pistol yet again 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.050
 Nobody needs that either 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.560
 So pistol is for multiplayer 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.940
 nothing that nothing you yes if you already 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.039
 then you have needed pistols so far 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:22.520
 wars now it's down there it looks 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:23.950
 there is michael no, of course 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.950
 ammunition 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.690
 you just take that stock 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:34.130
 no matter then my ak and a safety vest 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.020
 that pastor everything if I'm a car 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:39.740
 you can take like yes and bitched 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.360
 I do not take a car but you see 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.070
 We can not have a car close by 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.580
 Of course , that is quite natural 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.080
 especially in such a place shit 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.830
 then you have to just run and that 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:55.410
 there again a newspaper 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:58.500
 yes why a voice is going on what's mine 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.390
 My voice is loose, I have one 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.590
 slight cold 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.540
 but that does not matter because I'm fine 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.510
 Of course, why do I take it? 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:19.110
 when I'm fine and me 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:20.600
 fun makes it all so approaching the 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:25.340
 it was for this consequence 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:29.810
 I hope you failed deaf 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.810
