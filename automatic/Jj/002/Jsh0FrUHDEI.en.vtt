00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.770 
hence the name Spartan stompers didn't
you<00:00:31.769> get<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.040> anyways<00:00:32.759> yeah<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> Mantis

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
you get that anyways yeah so the Mantis

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.299 
you get that anyways yeah so the Mantis

now<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> Spartans<00:00:35.940> scurry<00:00:36.270> away<00:00:36.420> like<00:00:36.719> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
now the Spartans scurry away like the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
now the Spartans scurry away like the
little<00:00:37.050> mice<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.469> they<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.940> the<00:00:38.940> last

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
little mice that they are the last

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.090 
little mice that they are the last
Spartan<00:00:39.570> standing<00:00:40.050> wins<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.680> mean<00:00:40.890> they<00:00:41.010> don't

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
Spartan standing wins I mean they don't

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
Spartan standing wins I mean they don't
win<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.520> they<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.760> point<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.329> know<00:00:42.450> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
win but they get the point you know and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.970 
win but they get the point you know and
then<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.809> moves<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.350> next<00:00:43.559> round<00:00:43.680> there

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
then it moves on to the next round there

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.529 
then it moves on to the next round there
are<00:00:44.070> four<00:00:44.340> rounds<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.760> believe<00:00:44.969> each<00:00:45.180> round<00:00:45.390> is

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
are four rounds I believe each round is

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.690 
are four rounds I believe each round is
between<00:00:45.809> two<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> three<00:00:46.230> minutes<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.860> you're

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
between two to three minutes and you're

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.950 
between two to three minutes and you're
gonna<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.940> blast<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.539> round<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> mean

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
gonna have a blast in that round I mean

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.959 
gonna have a blast in that round I mean
it's<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.200> simplistic<00:00:49.680> minigame<00:00:50.190> but<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.820> best

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
recommend giving this map a download and

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.999 
recommend giving this map a download and
checking<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.500> however<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> do<00:01:34.680> want<00:01:34.829> to

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
checking it out however I do want to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.020 
checking it out however I do want to
point<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> round<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:35.939> you're

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
point out that the round that you're

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.550 
point out that the round that you're
looking<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.420> now<00:01:36.600> only<00:01:36.990> shows<00:01:37.290> one

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
looking at right now only shows one

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.810 
looking at right now only shows one
mantis<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.340> because<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> other

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
mantis and that's because the other

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.060 
mantis and that's because the other
mantis<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.360> AFK<00:01:39.780> normally<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.530> wouldn't<00:01:40.950> have

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
mantis was AFK normally I wouldn't have

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.130 
mantis was AFK normally I wouldn't have
lasted<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.640> long<00:01:41.759> against<00:01:42.450> two<00:01:42.570> mantises

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
lasted this long against two mantises

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.050 
lasted this long against two mantises
but<00:01:43.590> fortunately<00:01:44.040> there's<00:01:44.310> only<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
but fortunately there's only one so I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.639 
but fortunately there's only one so I
ended<00:01:45.450> up<00:01:45.570> surviving<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.530> longer

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
ended up surviving a little bit longer

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.410 
ended up surviving a little bit longer
than<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.009> anticipated<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.240> actually

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
than that anticipated and I actually

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.999 
than that anticipated and I actually
become<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> last<00:01:49.170> man<00:01:49.380> standing<00:01:49.770> which<00:01:49.890> is

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
become the last man standing which is

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.200 
become the last man standing which is
impressive<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.700> think<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
impressive for me I think this is the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.370 
impressive for me I think this is the
only<00:01:51.329> time<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.720> happened<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.079> figures

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
only time it happened and figures

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.590 
only time it happened and figures
there's<00:01:52.560> only<00:01:52.649> one<00:01:52.860> mantis<00:01:53.189> around<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.450> let's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
there's only one mantis around so let's

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.569 
there's only one mantis around so let's
take<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:54.990> some<00:01:55.110> Spartan<00:01:55.500> pancakes<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
take a look at some Spartan pancakes I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.069 
take a look at some Spartan pancakes I
didn't<00:01:57.030> want<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> make<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.450> joke<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.899> made

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.740 
didn't want to make the joke and I made
