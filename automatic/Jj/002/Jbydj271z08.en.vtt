00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
with all the chapters and units that I

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.700 
with all the chapters and units that I
have<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.030> do<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.480> when<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.899> finish<00:00:49.289> studying

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have to do and when I finish studying

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
have to do and when I finish studying
those<00:00:49.860> chapters<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:50.700> checked<00:00:50.940> them<00:00:51.059> off

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
those chapters I just checked them off

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.790 
those chapters I just checked them off
and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.840> satisfying<00:00:52.440> because<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and it's really satisfying because you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.529 
and it's really satisfying because you
can<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.039> peel<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.579> sticky<00:00:53.910> note<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.510> I

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
can just peel off the sticky note so I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.029 
can just peel off the sticky note so I
think<00:00:54.840> that's<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.379> really<00:00:55.559> cute<00:00:55.800> way<00:00:56.010> to
