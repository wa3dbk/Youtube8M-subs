that<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.400> perfectly<00:01:21.730> fine<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.340> let's<00:01:24.730> explain

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
that is perfectly fine so let's explain

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.880 
that is perfectly fine so let's explain
it<00:01:25.210> here<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:26.560> is<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:28.150> Sun<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:29.590> a<00:01:29.680> heat

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
it here this is the Sun it's a heat

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.250 
it here this is the Sun it's a heat
source<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:30.580> gives<00:01:30.790> us<00:01:30.910> energy<00:01:31.180> its<00:01:31.780> energies

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
source it gives us energy its energies

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.830 
source it gives us energy its energies
infinite<00:01:32.950> or<00:01:33.550> infinite<00:01:34.180> in<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.360> idea<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:34.750> the

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
infinite or infinite in the idea of the

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.380 
infinite or infinite in the idea of the
lifespan<00:01:35.380> of<00:01:35.410> a<00:01:35.590> normal<00:01:35.860> human<00:01:36.150> but<00:01:37.150> we<00:01:37.240> all

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
lifespan of a normal human but we all

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.120 
lifespan of a normal human but we all
can<00:01:37.810> pretty<00:01:37.990> much<00:01:38.080> contest<00:01:38.530> if<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> Sun<00:01:38.950> is<00:01:39.100> a

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
can pretty much contest if the Sun is a

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.820 
can pretty much contest if the Sun is a
good<00:01:39.370> thing<00:01:39.550> it<00:01:40.540> by<00:01:40.930> no<00:01:40.990> means<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:43.740> even<00:01:44.740> in

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
good thing it by no means is even in

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.040 
good thing it by no means is even in
question<00:01:45.220> that<00:01:45.370> we<00:01:45.760> would<00:01:45.940> be<00:01:46.120> better<00:01:46.900> off

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
question that we would be better off

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.140 
question that we would be better off
without<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.710> Sun<00:01:47.920> but<00:01:48.760> here's<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.120> thing

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
without the Sun but here's the thing

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.820 
without the Sun but here's the thing
about<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.659> Sun<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:51.640> star<00:01:52.260> that's<00:01:53.260> exactly

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
about the Sun it's a star that's exactly

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.770 
about the Sun it's a star that's exactly
what<00:01:53.980> it<00:01:54.100> is<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.670> it's<00:01:54.700> our<00:01:55.060> star<00:01:55.420> that's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
what it is it's a it's our star that's

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.570 
what it is it's a it's our star that's
twice<00:01:56.110> more<00:01:56.440> personal<00:01:57.010> than<00:01:57.159> every<00:01:57.550> other

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
twice more personal than every other

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.090 
twice more personal than every other
star<00:01:58.000> but<00:01:58.180> it's<00:01:58.320> really<00:01:59.320> not<00:01:59.650> that<00:01:59.710> different

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
star but it's really not that different

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.260 
star but it's really not that different
from<00:02:00.460> say<00:02:01.350> serious

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
from say serious

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.640 
from say serious
so<00:02:04.270> we've<00:02:04.420> concluded<00:02:04.720> that<00:02:04.990> our<00:02:05.229> Sun<00:02:05.470> is

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
so we've concluded that our Sun is

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.770 
so we've concluded that our Sun is
nothing<00:02:06.100> really<00:02:06.370> that<00:02:06.520> special<00:02:07.180> and<00:02:07.330> if<00:02:07.659> you

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
nothing really that special and if you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.559 
nothing really that special and if you
look<00:02:07.990> at<00:02:08.110> this<00:02:08.229> picture<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.560> serious<00:02:09.450> look<00:02:10.450> at

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
look at this picture of serious look at

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.740 
look at this picture of serious look at
the<00:02:10.629> background<00:02:11.019> of<00:02:11.109> it

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the background of it

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.990 
the background of it
you<00:02:13.750> see<00:02:13.930> all<00:02:14.080> those<00:02:14.290> little<00:02:14.400> white<00:02:15.400> dots<00:02:15.700> in

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you see all those little white dots in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.630 
you see all those little white dots in
that<00:02:16.480> black<00:02:16.720> canopy<00:02:17.230> there's<00:02:17.920> even<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.430> big

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
that black canopy there's even a big

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.540 
that black canopy there's even a big
blue<00:02:18.970> dot<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:20.680> gonna<00:02:20.830> take<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> give<00:02:21.220> you<00:02:21.340> one

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
blue dot I'm gonna take you give you one

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.210 
blue dot I'm gonna take you give you one
guess<00:02:21.760> what<00:02:22.120> all<00:02:22.360> those<00:02:22.780> dots<00:02:23.050> are<00:02:23.760> their<00:02:24.760> sons

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
guess what all those dots are their sons

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.020 
guess what all those dots are their sons
there<00:02:27.220> is<00:02:27.690> something<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:29.070> 200<00:02:30.070> to<00:02:30.220> 400

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
there is something like 200 to 400

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.750 
there is something like 200 to 400
billion<00:02:32.280> stars<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:34.740> our<00:02:35.740> galaxy<00:02:35.800> alone<00:02:36.460> which

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
billion stars in our galaxy alone which

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.230 
billion stars in our galaxy alone which
our<00:02:36.940> galaxy<00:02:37.330> is<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.450> Milky<00:02:37.750> Way<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.000> ask

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
our galaxy is the Milky Way so you ask

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.040 
our galaxy is the Milky Way so you ask
me<00:02:40.980> we<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.130> one<00:02:42.340> planet<00:02:42.610> out<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.970> out<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.570> nine

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
me we have one planet out of out of nine

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.190 
me we have one planet out of out of nine
well<00:02:44.380> eight<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.830> don't<00:02:45.010> count<00:02:45.130> Pluto<00:02:45.520> that

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
well eight if you don't count Pluto that

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.660 
well eight if you don't count Pluto that
can<00:02:47.200> sustain<00:02:47.560> life<00:02:48.090> that's<00:02:49.090> on<00:02:49.270> one<00:02:49.570> star<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
can sustain life that's on one star and

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.490 
can sustain life that's on one star and
you<00:02:52.360> might<00:02:52.510> think<00:02:52.540> well<00:02:52.870> wings<00:02:53.080> all<00:02:53.320> those

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
you might think well wings all those

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.690 
you might think well wings all those
other<00:02:53.680> stars<00:02:53.950> are<00:02:54.070> really<00:02:54.190> close<00:02:54.520> together

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
other stars are really close together

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.360 
other stars are really close together
well<00:02:55.120> they're<00:02:55.930> kind<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.260> not<00:02:56.470> I<00:02:56.800> mean<00:02:57.310> you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
well they're kind of not I mean you

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.100 
well they're kind of not I mean you
can't<00:02:57.700> really<00:02:57.820> tell<00:02:58.060> it<00:02:58.180> nowadays<00:02:58.360> but<00:02:58.900> if<00:02:59.020> you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
can't really tell it nowadays but if you

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
can't really tell it nowadays but if you
go<00:02:59.260> outside<00:02:59.410> at<00:02:59.710> night<00:02:59.740> in<00:03:00.100> like<00:03:00.460> an<00:03:00.610> area<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
go outside at night in like an area that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.840 
go outside at night in like an area that
doesn't<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.330> a<00:03:01.810> lot<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.050> ambient<00:03:02.560> light

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
doesn't have a lot of ambient light

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.450 
doesn't have a lot of ambient light
there's<00:03:04.380> more<00:03:05.380> stars<00:03:05.710> than<00:03:05.920> you<00:03:06.040> can<00:03:06.220> count

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
there's more stars than you can count

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.250 
there's more stars than you can count
that<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.570> can<00:03:07.690> see<00:03:07.840> from<00:03:08.050> Earth<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:10.260> those

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
that you can see from Earth and those

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.660 
that you can see from Earth and those
stars<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.710> brought<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> lot<00:03:12.160> farther<00:03:12.430> apart

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
stars are brought a lot farther apart

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.100 
stars are brought a lot farther apart
than<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.180> seem<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.540> think<00:03:14.100> so<00:03:15.810> well<00:03:16.810> why

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
than you seem to think so well why

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.540 
than you seem to think so well why
haven't<00:03:17.350> we<00:03:17.440> found<00:03:17.770> other<00:03:17.950> plants<00:03:18.280> well<00:03:18.430> we

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
haven't we found other plants well we

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.310 
haven't we found other plants well we
have<00:03:18.730> found<00:03:18.970> other<00:03:19.210> planets<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.810> other<00:03:19.990> stars

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
have found other planets on other stars

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.500 
have found other planets on other stars
but<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.310> fact<00:03:21.520> is<00:03:21.670> they're<00:03:21.940> really<00:03:22.210> far<00:03:22.420> away

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
but the fact is they're really far away

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.170 
but the fact is they're really far away
and<00:03:22.810> they're<00:03:22.930> very<00:03:23.080> hard<00:03:23.440> to<00:03:23.590> see<00:03:24.180> especially

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
and they're very hard to see especially

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.790 
and they're very hard to see especially
when<00:03:25.420> you're<00:03:25.570> dealing<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.290> light<00:03:26.560> that's

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
when you're dealing with light that's

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.060 
when you're dealing with light that's
millions<00:03:27.190> of<00:03:27.310> years<00:03:27.490> old<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:29.680> let's<00:03:29.920> get

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
millions of years old but let's get

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.580 
millions of years old but let's get
let's<00:03:30.220> conclude<00:03:30.490> this<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.960> said<00:03:32.200> one

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
let's conclude this like I said one

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.120 
let's conclude this like I said one
planet<00:03:33.010> out<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:34.090> eight<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.800> can<00:03:35.980> sustain

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
planet out of eight that can sustain

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
planet out of eight that can sustain
life<00:03:36.340> on<00:03:36.730> one<00:03:36.940> star<00:03:38.160> there's<00:03:39.160> 400<00:03:39.910> billion

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
life on one star there's 400 billion

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.100 
life on one star there's 400 billion
stars<00:03:40.600> in<00:03:40.960> this<00:03:41.470> galaxy<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:43.780> a<00:03:43.930> lot<00:03:44.080> of

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
stars in this galaxy that's a lot of

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.930 
stars in this galaxy that's a lot of
chances<00:03:44.530> for<00:03:44.710> life<00:03:44.890> right<00:03:45.100> there<00:03:45.370> just<00:03:45.790> in

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
chances for life right there just in

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.800 
chances for life right there just in
this<00:03:46.060> galaxy<00:03:46.420> alone<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.020> here's<00:03:47.200> the<00:03:47.320> kicker

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
this galaxy alone but here's the kicker

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.480 
this galaxy alone but here's the kicker
there's<00:03:49.810> over<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:51.090> billion<00:03:52.090> galaxies

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
there's over a billion galaxies

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.660 
there's over a billion galaxies
seriously<00:03:55.590> I'm<00:03:56.590> not<00:03:56.650> gonna<00:03:57.070> try<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.280> attempt

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
seriously I'm not gonna try to attempt

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.820 
seriously I'm not gonna try to attempt
to<00:03:57.700> do<00:03:57.880> the<00:03:58.000> math<00:03:58.180> at<00:03:58.420> 400<00:03:58.960> billion<00:03:59.140> times<00:03:59.500> 1

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
to do the math at 400 billion times 1

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.060 
to do the math at 400 billion times 1
billion<00:04:00.100> I<00:04:00.480> mean<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.750> that's<00:04:02.320> just<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.890> if

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
billion I mean and that's just just if

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:04.650 
billion I mean and that's just just if
there's<00:04:03.250> only<00:04:03.430> one<00:04:03.850> banghak<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:04.420> there<00:04:04.540> could

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
there's only one banghak so there could

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.830 
there's only one banghak so there could
be<00:04:04.690> hundreds<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.230> billions<00:04:05.500> of<00:04:05.830> galaxies<00:04:06.840> that

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
be hundreds of billions of galaxies that

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.470 
be hundreds of billions of galaxies that
number<00:04:08.260> is<00:04:08.380> astronomical<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.790> sit<00:04:10.030> here<00:04:10.270> and

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
number is astronomical to sit here and

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.610 
number is astronomical to sit here and
think<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:11.710> we<00:04:12.330> were<00:04:13.330> made<00:04:13.870> in<00:04:13.900> some<00:04:14.350> kind<00:04:14.560> of

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
not think it could happen again I mean

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.659 
not think it could happen again I mean
there's<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.919> thing<00:05:48.160> called<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.430> Drake

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:48.669 
there's a thing called the Drake

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.110 
there's a thing called the Drake

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
Equation and the Drake Equation pretty

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.000 
Equation and the Drake Equation pretty
much<00:05:52.240> breaks<00:05:52.870> down<00:05:53.050> at<00:05:53.320> what<00:05:53.500> the<00:05:53.620> chance<00:05:53.860> of

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
much breaks down at what the chance of

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.620 
much breaks down at what the chance of
life<00:05:54.220> is<00:05:54.490> in<00:05:54.760> any<00:05:55.750> kind<00:05:56.080> of<00:05:56.169> set<00:05:56.410> system<00:05:56.620> and<00:05:57.630> do

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
life is in any kind of set system and do

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.050 
life is in any kind of set system and do
you<00:05:58.810> think<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.380> an<00:05:59.620> alien<00:06:00.160> would<00:06:00.550> evolve<00:06:00.820> any

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
you think that an alien would evolve any

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.659 
you think that an alien would evolve any
different<00:06:01.479> than<00:06:01.570> us<00:06:01.830> we<00:06:02.830> obviously<00:06:03.310> came<00:06:03.520> from

00:06:03.659 --> 00:06:03.669 
different than us we obviously came from

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.170 
different than us we obviously came from
the<00:06:03.789> muck

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
the muck

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.390 
the muck
we<00:06:04.750> obviously<00:06:05.229> you<00:06:05.560> know<00:06:05.710> grew<00:06:05.979> up<00:06:06.160> we

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
we obviously you know grew up we

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.800 
we obviously you know grew up we
obviously<00:06:06.820> evolved<00:06:07.240> into<00:06:07.450> what<00:06:07.539> we<00:06:07.660> are<00:06:07.690> today

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
obviously evolved into what we are today

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.469 
obviously evolved into what we are today
our<00:06:08.260> brains<00:06:08.530> and<00:06:08.770> laurs<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.400> stuff<00:06:09.610> and<00:06:09.850> we

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
our brains and laurs and stuff and we

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.840 
our brains and laurs and stuff and we
evolved<00:06:10.870> to<00:06:10.930> our<00:06:11.110> atmosphere<00:06:11.289> I<00:06:11.919> mean<00:06:12.669> there's

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 
sort maybe but that's not for me to

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.590 
sort maybe but that's not for me to
decide<00:07:38.610> but<00:07:39.610> that's<00:07:39.880> the<00:07:40.000> reason<00:07:40.150> I<00:07:40.450> believe

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.600 
decide but that's the reason I believe

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.260 
decide but that's the reason I believe
in<00:07:40.780> aliens<00:07:41.140> and<00:07:41.260> that's<00:07:41.470> why<00:07:41.650> I<00:07:42.010> take<00:07:42.880> offense

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:43.270 
in aliens and that's why I take offense

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:45.210 
in aliens and that's why I take offense
when<00:07:43.390> somebody<00:07:43.810> laughs<00:07:43.990> at<00:07:44.230> it<00:07:44.260> because

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:45.220 
when somebody laughs at it because

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:47.640 
when somebody laughs at it because
they're<00:07:45.700> aliens<00:07:46.390> in<00:07:46.450> my<00:07:46.990> book<00:07:47.230> are<00:07:47.410> more

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:47.650 
they're aliens in my book are more

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.740 
they're aliens in my book are more
credible<00:07:48.720> than<00:07:49.890> someone<00:07:50.890> walking<00:07:51.250> on<00:07:51.340> water

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:51.750 
credible than someone walking on water

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.580 
credible than someone walking on water
but<00:07:52.750> that's<00:07:52.960> my<00:07:53.080> opinion

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590 
but that's my opinion

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.590 
but that's my opinion
it's<00:07:54.490> when<00:07:54.610> you<00:07:54.700> boil<00:07:54.880> wings<00:07:55.090> of<00:07:55.210> redemption

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:55.600 
it's when you boil wings of redemption

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.870 
it's when you boil wings of redemption
