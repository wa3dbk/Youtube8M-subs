 He's getting out of the ring. 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:58.010
 After that, 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:04.580
 Look at the front. I'll explain the rules now. 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.729
 When the thief was a police officer , the victory condition for the thief team was 1 hour for the boss of the thief. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.810
 If you do not die, the thief team is victorious. 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:15.830
 Now in the FBI, the winning condition is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.890
 Here also the two bosses within an hour the parents are going to win 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.130
 Now I will tell a very simple weapon restrictions 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.880
 Arms Limitation dim gardening 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.640
 Not write out a pistol holster also andoeyo not only in accordance with the general handgun 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.720
 I can not. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.430
 And the thieves have stolen it instead of the band . That's a pair of rpg . 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:39.160
 The thieves stole it . 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.960
 So the boss of the thief can write an rpg for an hour 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.320
 There is 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.920
 Oh , and then the police 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:54.229
 You know everything except the weapons at nine o'clock. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:58.790
 I can give you everything except those weapons at 9 o'clock with that rpg 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:01.310
 So this is the rule until yesterday, and now the police have started five minutes 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.340
 Stand by at the starting point. 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:10.060
 Thieves can ride the German car in the oven dream 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:13.980
 Then the thieves will not be able to drive for five minutes, 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.980
 Now the police can ride and question so far 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.140
 No, no. This is where the rules get. 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.450
 So now it's a patch today. 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:32.150
 What was patched today 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:38.510
 After thirty minutes, the thief can once again drive for five minutes. 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:43.970
 This is the patch today . Oh, and then the radar 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:48.379
 All you have to do is turn off the radar. 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:53.000
 I can see the map. The rest are forbidden. 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:57.530
 Uh, so the rest of us are not allowed to see the map . 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.420
 Only one fbi can see the map and the map viewer 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.799
 I can not participate in the battle. 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.030
