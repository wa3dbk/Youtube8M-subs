00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.070 
are what I say a phosphoric acid which I
mean<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.149> unbelievable<00:01:36.330> how<00:01:36.720> bad<00:01:36.930> that

i'll find it if you're interested i look
for<00:04:40.680> that<00:04:41.639> they<00:04:41.789> have<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.770> substance<00:04:43.770> in<00:04:43.919> them

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
for that they have a substance in them

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:49.159 
for that they have a substance in them
that<00:04:44.159> basically<00:04:45.800> attaches<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:48.169> insulin

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
that basically attaches to the insulin

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.050 
that basically attaches to the insulin
receptor<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:50.099> the<00:04:50.130> insulin<00:04:50.580> receptor<00:04:50.639> is

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
receptor and the insulin receptor is

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.640 
receptor and the insulin receptor is
responsible<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.930> if<00:04:52.020> your<00:04:52.139> blood<00:04:52.380> sugar

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
responsible for if your blood sugar

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.850 
responsible for if your blood sugar
levels<00:04:53.310> get<00:04:53.430> too<00:04:53.490> high<00:04:53.789> the<00:04:54.260> role<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.289> insulin

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
levels get too high the role of insulin

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.439 
levels get too high the role of insulin
is<00:04:56.039> to<00:04:56.220> be<00:04:56.310> secreted<00:04:56.550> from<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.820> pancreas<00:04:57.030> and

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
is to be secreted from the pancreas and

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.659 
is to be secreted from the pancreas and
to<00:04:58.199> sort<00:04:58.650> of<00:04:58.740> make<00:04:59.250> its<00:04:59.400> way<00:04:59.490> to<00:04:59.520> the

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
to sort of make its way to the

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:00.830 
to sort of make its way to the
bloodstream<00:05:00.030> and<00:05:00.270> i<00:05:00.360> believe<00:05:00.659> it's<00:05:00.780> a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
bloodstream and i believe it's a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.120 
bloodstream and i believe it's a
Bartlett<00:05:01.050> bloodstream<00:05:01.409> and<00:05:01.590> attached<00:05:01.889> to

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
fest special insulin receptors that then

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:10.040 
fest special insulin receptors that then
signal<00:05:07.919> sound<00:05:08.340> like<00:05:08.490> a<00:05:08.520> signal<00:05:09.000> you<00:05:09.870> know<00:05:09.960> they

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
the cell to open up sugar like sugar

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.140 
the cell to open up sugar like sugar
sucking<00:05:15.770> pores<00:05:16.770> they<00:05:17.460> shuck<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:17.729> second<00:05:18.030> all

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.730 
sucking pores they shuck a second all
the<00:05:18.240> sugar<00:05:18.419> do<00:05:18.810> you<00:05:18.870> lower<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.229> sugar<00:05:19.440> from

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
the sugar do you lower the sugar from

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.430 
the sugar do you lower the sugar from
the<00:05:19.800> blood<00:05:19.860> stream<00:05:20.219> and<00:05:20.870> kind<00:05:21.870> of<00:05:21.900> sugars

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
the blood stream and kind of sugars

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.420 
the blood stream and kind of sugars
dangerous<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:23.010> can

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
dangerous it can

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.090 
dangerous it can
you<00:05:24.330> can<00:05:24.450> start<00:05:24.720> having<00:05:24.840> toxic<00:05:25.410> problems<00:05:25.890> and

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
you can start having toxic problems and

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.250 
you can start having toxic problems and
corrosive<00:05:26.490> problems<00:05:26.940> and<00:05:27.120> so<00:05:27.240> the<00:05:27.600> sugar<00:05:28.080> is

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
corrosive problems and so the sugar is

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.010 
corrosive problems and so the sugar is
brought<00:05:28.470> in<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.100> cells<00:05:29.340> and<00:05:29.810> more<00:05:30.810> or<00:05:30.870> less

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
brought in to the cells and more or less

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.260 
brought in to the cells and more or less
converted<00:05:31.770> metabolized<00:05:32.370> into<00:05:32.640> chemically

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
converted metabolized into chemically

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.910 
converted metabolized into chemically
neutral<00:05:33.660> fat<00:05:33.930> that's<00:05:34.470> one<00:05:34.590> of<00:05:34.650> the<00:05:34.710> reasons

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
neutral fat that's one of the reasons

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.080 
neutral fat that's one of the reasons
why<00:05:34.980> your<00:05:35.100> body<00:05:35.280> would<00:05:35.460> rather<00:05:35.640> have<00:05:35.850> you<00:05:35.940> be

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
why your body would rather have you be

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.290 
why your body would rather have you be
fat<00:05:36.390> and<00:05:36.570> have<00:05:36.690> to<00:05:36.840> high<00:05:36.960> blood<00:05:37.110> sugar<00:05:37.410> so<00:05:38.300> now

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.300 
fat and have to high blood sugar so now

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.090 
fat and have to high blood sugar so now
that's<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.050> job<00:05:40.230> of<00:05:40.290> insulin<00:05:40.680> but<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.890> turns

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
that's the job of insulin but it turns

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.510 
that's the job of insulin but it turns
out<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.990> what<00:05:42.990> happens<00:05:43.320> with<00:05:43.620> corn<00:05:44.100> products

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
out that what happens with corn products

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.760 
out that what happens with corn products
and<00:05:44.730> wheat<00:05:45.390> products<00:05:45.900> I<00:05:46.020> believe<00:05:46.230> is<00:05:46.410> that

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
and wheat products I believe is that

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.640 
and wheat products I believe is that
they<00:05:47.250> possess<00:05:47.730> something<00:05:48.570> in<00:05:48.840> them<00:05:49.080> and<00:05:49.290> dr.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
they possess something in them and dr.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.440 
they possess something in them and dr.

Peter Dudamel one of the one of the
naturopathic<00:05:52.410> i<00:05:52.770> started<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.130> blood<00:05:53.310> type

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
naturopathic i started the blood type

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.360 
naturopathic i started the blood type
diet<00:05:54.020> cause<00:05:55.020> these<00:05:55.260> things<00:05:55.290> lectins<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.040> then

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
diet cause these things lectins and then

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:57.440 
diet cause these things lectins and then
he<00:05:56.460> didn't<00:05:56.700> call<00:05:56.850> it<00:05:56.940> he's<00:05:57.090> not<00:05:57.180> the<00:05:57.300> first

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
he didn't call it he's not the first

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:58.910 
he didn't call it he's not the first
person<00:05:57.630> to<00:05:57.780> call<00:05:57.900> them<00:05:58.020> lectins<00:05:58.350> they've<00:05:58.800> been

00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:58.920 
person to call them lectins they've been

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.090 
person to call them lectins they've been
called<00:05:59.130> lectins<00:05:59.490> else<00:05:59.670> where<00:06:00.740> they<00:06:01.740> attach<00:06:01.860> to

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
called lectins else where they attach to

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.020 
called lectins else where they attach to
these<00:06:02.430> insulin<00:06:03.060> receptors<00:06:03.510> and<00:06:04.850> so<00:06:05.850> when<00:06:05.940> you

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
these insulin receptors and so when you

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:07.990 
these insulin receptors and so when you
have<00:06:06.180> corn<00:06:06.480> products<00:06:07.050> or<00:06:07.200> wheat<00:06:07.320> products

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
have corn products or wheat products

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.030 
have corn products or wheat products
they<00:06:09.000> have<00:06:09.290> lectins<00:06:10.290> I<00:06:10.410> suppose<00:06:10.650> in<00:06:10.770> them<00:06:10.860> that

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
they have lectins I suppose in them that

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.010 
they have lectins I suppose in them that
attach<00:06:11.460> to<00:06:11.490> these<00:06:11.910> insulin<00:06:12.390> receptors<00:06:12.840> and

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
attach to these insulin receptors and

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.100 
attach to these insulin receptors and
they<00:06:13.830> cause<00:06:14.010> sugar<00:06:14.340> pores<00:06:14.850> to<00:06:15.600> be<00:06:15.690> opened<00:06:15.720> and

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
they cause sugar pores to be opened and

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.400 
they cause sugar pores to be opened and
so<00:06:16.620> what<00:06:16.920> happens<00:06:17.280> is<00:06:17.490> the<00:06:18.000> sugar<00:06:18.810> contents

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
so what happens is the sugar contents

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.410 
so what happens is the sugar contents
the<00:06:19.530> carbohydrate<00:06:20.100> contents<00:06:20.550> are<00:06:21.000> basically

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:21.420 
the carbohydrate contents are basically

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.450 
the carbohydrate contents are basically
brought<00:06:21.660> into<00:06:21.930> the<00:06:22.020> cell<00:06:22.290> they've<00:06:23.070> brought<00:06:23.250> in

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
brought into the cell they've brought in

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.540 
brought into the cell they've brought in
to<00:06:23.640> sell<00:06:23.850> out<00:06:24.030> of<00:06:24.120> the<00:06:24.180> bloodstream<00:06:24.570> and<00:06:25.550> while

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
to sell out of the bloodstream and while

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.650 
to sell out of the bloodstream and while
that's<00:06:26.670> all<00:06:26.880> well<00:06:27.090> and<00:06:27.120> good<00:06:27.240> one<00:06:27.510> of<00:06:27.570> the

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 
that's all well and good one of the

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.350 
that's all well and good one of the
interesting<00:06:27.840> things<00:06:28.230> about<00:06:28.580> these<00:06:29.580> corn<00:06:30.090> and

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360 
interesting things about these corn and

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.240 
interesting things about these corn and
wheat<00:06:30.840> lectins<00:06:31.350> is<00:06:31.470> they<00:06:31.590> do<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.830> job<00:06:32.040> too

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
wheat lectins is they do the job too

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.980 
wheat lectins is they do the job too
well<00:06:32.280> in<00:06:32.670> other<00:06:32.790> words<00:06:33.000> normally<00:06:33.810> with

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
well in other words normally with

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.750 
well in other words normally with
insulin<00:06:34.320> it<00:06:34.470> binds<00:06:34.740> to<00:06:34.980> its<00:06:35.130> receptors<00:06:35.610> and

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
insulin it binds to its receptors and

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.130 
insulin it binds to its receptors and
then<00:06:35.880> kind<00:06:36.030> of<00:06:36.180> I<00:06:36.270> suppose<00:06:36.330> over<00:06:36.690> time<00:06:36.870> gets

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
then kind of I suppose over time gets

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.340 
then kind of I suppose over time gets
degraded<00:06:37.290> or<00:06:37.680> falls<00:06:38.220> off<00:06:38.870> these<00:06:39.870> corn<00:06:40.200> and

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
degraded or falls off these corn and

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.170 
degraded or falls off these corn and
wheat<00:06:40.440> lectins<00:06:40.860> don't<00:06:41.190> they<00:06:41.670> stayed<00:06:41.970> there

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180 
wheat lectins don't they stayed there

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.480 
wheat lectins don't they stayed there
and<00:06:42.330> they<00:06:42.420> keep<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:42.930> sugar<00:06:43.250> pores<00:06:44.250> open

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
and they keep the sugar pores open

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.880 
and they keep the sugar pores open
channels<00:06:45.180> and<00:06:45.390> they're<00:06:46.050> pulling<00:06:46.590> in<00:06:46.680> sugar

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
channels and they're pulling in sugar

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:49.400 
channels and they're pulling in sugar
all<00:06:47.040> times<00:06:47.280> what<00:06:47.430> happens<00:06:47.550> is<00:06:48.080> the<00:06:49.080> bottom

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:49.410 
all times what happens is the bottom

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.460 
all times what happens is the bottom
line<00:06:49.440> is<00:06:49.650> this<00:06:49.770> you're<00:06:50.520> consuming<00:06:51.180> corn<00:06:52.170> and

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
line is this you're consuming corn and

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.860 
line is this you're consuming corn and
corn<00:06:53.430> syrup<00:06:53.610> products<00:06:54.240> stuff<00:06:54.390> like<00:06:54.540> that<00:06:54.570> in

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:54.870 
corn syrup products stuff like that in

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.870 
corn syrup products stuff like that in
order<00:06:55.320> to<00:06:55.500> get<00:06:55.710> sugar<00:06:56.190> increase<00:06:56.610> your<00:06:56.700> sugar

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:56.880 
order to get sugar increase your sugar

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.670 
order to get sugar increase your sugar
but<00:06:57.420> what<00:06:57.510> happens<00:06:57.840> is<00:06:58.050> because<00:06:58.320> of<00:06:58.530> the

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
but what happens is because of the

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.460 
but what happens is because of the
lectins<00:06:59.070> you<00:06:59.730> actually<00:06:59.970> end<00:07:00.120> up<00:07:00.180> it<00:07:01.020> for<00:07:01.440> a

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
lectins you actually end up it for a

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.110 
lectins you actually end up it for a
little<00:07:01.590> while<00:07:01.680> it<00:07:02.010> kind<00:07:02.190> of<00:07:02.250> spikes<00:07:02.730> but<00:07:03.030> then

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
little while it kind of spikes but then

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.180 
little while it kind of spikes but then
what<00:07:03.210> happens<00:07:03.240> is<00:07:03.600> true<00:07:04.410> because<00:07:04.950> of<00:07:05.070> the

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.190 
what happens is true because of the

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.820 
what happens is true because of the
lectin<00:07:05.490> activity<00:07:05.940> you<00:07:06.780> get<00:07:06.930> hypoglycemia

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:07.830 
lectin activity you get hypoglycemia

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.170 
lectin activity you get hypoglycemia
what<00:07:08.070> little<00:07:08.310> sugar<00:07:08.490> you<00:07:08.640> do<00:07:08.760> have<00:07:08.910> in<00:07:09.060> your

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 
what little sugar you do have in your

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.960 
what little sugar you do have in your
bloodstream<00:07:10.520> plummets<00:07:11.520> because<00:07:11.700> it's<00:07:11.850> all

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
bloodstream plummets because it's all

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.820 
bloodstream plummets because it's all
being<00:07:12.180> sucked<00:07:12.510> in<00:07:12.660> and<00:07:12.900> it's<00:07:13.320> being<00:07:13.440> turned<00:07:13.680> to

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830 
being sucked in and it's being turned to

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.400 
being sucked in and it's being turned to
fat<00:07:14.040> and<00:07:14.370> while<00:07:15.360> fat<00:07:15.570> is<00:07:15.660> chemically<00:07:15.990> safer

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:16.410 
fat and while fat is chemically safer

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:20.600 
fat and while fat is chemically safer
nobody<00:07:16.740> likes<00:07:16.890> to<00:07:16.950> be<00:07:17.040> fat<00:07:17.660> so<00:07:18.660> you're<00:07:19.560> in<00:07:20.340> some

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
nobody likes to be fat so you're in some

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.220 
nobody likes to be fat so you're in some

lectins are protecting that you would I
suppose<00:07:26.820> you<00:07:26.940> probably<00:07:27.240> find<00:07:27.510> it<00:07:27.600> even<00:07:27.690> in

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:27.870 
suppose you probably find it even in

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:30.140 
suppose you probably find it even in
corn<00:07:28.110> syrup<00:07:28.640> they're<00:07:29.640> protecting<00:07:30.000> you<00:07:30.060> from

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
the high sugar spike but but the thing

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.950 
the high sugar spike but but the thing
is<00:07:31.740> also<00:07:32.280> you're<00:07:32.820> getting<00:07:33.150> this<00:07:33.240> kind<00:07:33.450> of<00:07:33.750> a

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 
is also you're getting this kind of a

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:34.340 
is also you're getting this kind of a
dick

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.350 
dick

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.930 
dick
of<00:07:34.440> rebound<00:07:34.920> effect<00:07:35.280> because<00:07:35.610> you're<00:07:35.730> getting

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 
of rebound effect because you're getting

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.670 
of rebound effect because you're getting
the<00:07:36.000> sugar<00:07:36.210> rush<00:07:36.420> and<00:07:37.080> then<00:07:37.170> also<00:07:37.290> it's<00:07:37.560> gone

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 
the sugar rush and then also it's gone

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.050 
the sugar rush and then also it's gone
you<00:07:37.860> feel<00:07:38.010> anymore<00:07:38.190> so<00:07:38.490> you<00:07:38.580> want<00:07:38.760> more<00:07:38.850> sugar

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 
you feel anymore so you want more sugar

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.030 
you feel anymore so you want more sugar
and<00:07:39.930> that's<00:07:40.080> that<00:07:40.320> that's<00:07:40.440> the<00:07:40.680> danger<00:07:41.010> of

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:41.040 
and that's that that's the danger of

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:45.110 
and that's that that's the danger of
corn<00:07:41.400> syrup<00:07:43.130> so<00:07:44.130> yeah<00:07:44.280> I<00:07:44.310> ain't<00:07:44.610> nothing<00:07:44.970> good

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:45.120 
corn syrup so yeah I ain't nothing good

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.960 
corn syrup so yeah I ain't nothing good
about<00:07:45.150> soda<00:07:46.070> you<00:07:47.070> belie<00:07:47.400> mean<00:07:47.640> people

hey the carbonated water while it is
mildly<00:07:51.840> acidic<00:07:52.200> it<00:07:53.010> is<00:07:53.220> the<00:07:53.370> least<00:07:53.790> of<00:07:53.970> your

soda<00:07:56.780> so<00:07:57.830> anyhow<00:07:58.910> that's<00:07:59.910> why<00:08:00.150> soda<00:08:00.420> sucks<00:08:01.310> or

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:02.310 
soda so anyhow that's why soda sucks or

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.330 
soda so anyhow that's why soda sucks or
I'll<00:08:02.430> see<00:08:02.580> you<00:08:02.640> guys<00:08:02.670> later<00:08:02.910> have<00:08:03.150> fun
