00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.720
 Hi guys 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:12.300
 good day is I was called here in my 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:16.619
 cook to check something that a 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.570
 fact that was unusual for me I never 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.519
 I had been through it and then I go 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.670
 share with you why it happened 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.050
 Is it good for you to pay attention? 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 enough and use every kind of genius 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.239
 cooking with the food so that the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:42.480
 people do not suffer is even with one 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 entry of parasites between 60 and such I 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 I was called here in my kitchen to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.190
 take a look in the presence of this here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.190
 Instead you can view personal 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:06.020
 You can see that this is a fish. 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.710
 passes I see that here is a 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.520
 beam thinks it's an open fish 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 ok and here you are seeing that you have high 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.520
 his 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.520
 I'm looking 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.220
 OK 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:57.930
 so it's what 's important is what's 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:02:02.220
 important because it 's important to speak 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.360
 about this in terms of public health 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.550
 huh 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.539
 first or this food is 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.430
 this product 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:20.880
 it was frozen and thawed're in 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:24.660
 frozen again or this fish 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.970
 I do not believe it's because of being 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.160
 have already gone through the whole process 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.310
 was caught 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.519
 then I was sent to find that 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.150
 she 's the one to make them socks 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:46.380
 then it is conditioned and in places to 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.890
 be distributed in the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.140
 suppliers distribute to the registry 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.070
 distributors, so I guess it's 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:59.400
 mainly products such as fish 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.040
 which is a perishable product, it is me 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.769
 I think we have to have very much 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.230
 attention and very careful I do not know I 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.680
 For me this origin may have been 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.230
 This is a worm and a worm. 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.880
 It's just you nature because it would have 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.170
 to the laboratory but I do not 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.660
 I'll do it 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:22.489
 honestly I 'm not going but I imagine 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.709
 maybe because of the sea 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.459
 conservation with frost thaw 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.750
 and there may be a lack of people who 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.880
 People do not know what this is like. 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 process and exit would be interesting to 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.480
 people are searching is we organize 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.980
 and maybe to discuss a little about 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.299
 this is 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.120
 I mean I was called here in the 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.519
 kitchen 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:52.239
 to see if it really was a 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.260
 see me right or not, we saw that it is 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.310
 right 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.730
 who knows here is a verb and he is 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.730
 alive 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.930
 It's all here in the queue. 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.830
 what 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.050
 the bay 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.120
 You are dying
