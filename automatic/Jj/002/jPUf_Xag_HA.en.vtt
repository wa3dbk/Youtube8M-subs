00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
let's go check them out we have a

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.599 
let's go check them out we have a
greenhouse<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.450> where<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.870> grow<00:00:16.109> plants<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
greenhouse here where we grow plants and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.730 
greenhouse here where we grow plants and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
herbs but it's warm enough for the

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.859 
herbs but it's warm enough for the
chicks<00:00:20.070> because<00:00:20.340> they<00:00:20.490> need<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.760> be<00:00:20.910> warm<00:00:21.300> and

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
chicks because they need to be warm and

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.880 
chicks because they need to be warm and
we<00:00:22.199> built<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:23.039> box<00:00:23.490> with<00:00:24.420> hay<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.350> his

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
we built a box with hay and with his

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.170 
we built a box with hay and with his
wire<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.760> keep<00:00:27.240> them<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.539> a<00:00:31.940> member<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.030> our

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
wire to keep them in a member of our

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.150 
wire to keep them in a member of our
community<00:00:33.420> actually<00:00:33.960> bought<00:00:34.140> these<00:00:34.350> from<00:00:35.010> a

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
community actually bought these from a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.380 
community actually bought these from a
farm<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:36.180> about<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> dollar<00:00:36.690> fifty<00:00:37.530> each<00:00:37.920> and

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
farm for about a dollar fifty each and

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.180 
farm for about a dollar fifty each and
they<00:00:39.390> had<00:00:39.629> just<00:00:40.050> been<00:00:40.260> hatched<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.129> were

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
they had just been hatched and they were

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.889 
they had just been hatched and they were
put<00:00:41.489> in<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> box<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:42.210> holes<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
put in a box with holes in them and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.319 
put in a box with holes in them and
mailed<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.440> us<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.860> guess<00:00:44.730> that's<00:00:44.940> how<00:00:45.000> they<00:00:45.180> do

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
mailed to us I guess that's how they do

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
mailed to us I guess that's how they do
it<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.570> days<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.680> stay<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.399> for

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
it these days they stay in here for

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.819 
it these days they stay in here for
about<00:00:47.879> four<00:00:48.239> weeks<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.500> go<00:00:49.649> into

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
about four weeks and then they go into

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.119 
about four weeks and then they go into
another<00:00:50.520> it's<00:00:50.760> room<00:00:51.059> where<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> get

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
another it's room where they can get

00:00:52.129 --> 00:01:00.889 
another it's room where they can get
full-grown<00:00:53.129> then<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.910> add<00:00:54.030> them<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> flock
