00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.570
 and his letter is all they 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.650
 soon went like me it's going great 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:12.440
 video that will surely serve you because 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.940
 that if you're running out of pot and ben 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 bassaw will not serve anything because that you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 will have a lot of peace 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 anc she that in minutes in 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.849
 calculation in a few hours if you are 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.019
 really do so 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.160
 so frankly I find that she is 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.820
 really practical 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 if if you are really lacking so 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:39.719
 you're gonna look for a place 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.550
 to place me without doing a big so 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.800
 that you will go into the depths and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.500
 you will stay in the hours 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 verloc part and you will have fun killed 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 to kill and kill mobs like that alain 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.210
 stop being careful not to take 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.989
 too much because because after you 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.390
 risk dying 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 even if they look like they are weak 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.790
 but here we see you I have not 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 a lot of po's but by force 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.439
 to follow you go see I'm going fast 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:18.479
 get to 560 for example here marie 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:24.659
 360 we would see it's not very very 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:28.490
 slow yes but be careful after the work 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.490
 not too much as I did above 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.730
 if you can help yourself not perfect 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.520
 but it is in dps mode so in a 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:43.440
 little bit more attention you'll see 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:45.240
 that it will go up very quickly very quickly 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.340
 yeah on the other hand there is a little bit 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.670
 Too much furniture on me so I risk 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.670
 to die 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.750
 excuse me for my gameplay while 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.030
 rotten because I'm still nil at 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.200
 master this place but once 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.790
 I would like so many people that I have 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.820
 received 42 gold coins at once so 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.229
 frankly it's an oath a norm in 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.710
 a time we do not realize it but 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.710
 it's enormous 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:19.430
 then that I have the skin is perfect you 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 go see it's going to be fast like everything 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.590
 product is not dying because it is 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.300
 very very easy to die in this thing 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:38.160
 there just try to recover the coins 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:41.150
 So here are 27 gold coins Thursday at the ATS 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.040
 545 when you see if you are taking 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.750
 groupings tomorrow like that and that 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.330
 you pay attention you can see 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.950
 that it's going very, very fast 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.989
 so me personally I use this 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.049
 technical close you can use it 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.030
 others she is also mean too 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.260
 well for people pl because he 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.400
 is a lot of my life so so the 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.640
 nobody she gathers all the furniture 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:06.540
 by being groups and by being 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.910
 develop and so and so you you 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.989
 approved the mob do not know if it says 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.760
 you are agro and the furniture 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.950
 so there 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 and you kill them so that she picks up 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:26.430
 from exp to your place here you are here 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.549
 so we're going to go 560 as we had 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.549
 said 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:36.850
 it's going to be fast I just recovered 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:42.270
 the pieces if no yes you can also 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:48.670
 europe 19 about 78 or otherwise 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:51.220
 80 82 yeah so no 78 I created myself 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.530
 to go through to react yeah so yeah 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.330
 you can from more stuff or 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.700
 less big kiff who can who pays 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.370
 really or serve and the top of the top 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.960
 is that you have a mammoth so 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.910
 you have a mammoth you can 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.390
 directly sell end pieces of 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.730
 objects and so drop you full 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:17.230
 objects and there is everything you sell 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.950
 really beautiful start it's 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.950
 really beautiful 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:33.250
 I made because I thought 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:37.750
 my dog thermax so at mauve gives to 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:42.970
 just about one up to 2 pieces never here 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:49.510
 and I'm going to see this year why 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:52.090
 not bad typing if I can good we are his 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.290
 182nd so yes it's really fast I 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.410
 not even at the same time this video 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:59.230
 it will last better but you will see that 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.440
 in minutes you can have 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.700
 a lot of tea to the tricks kit that I have 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.470
 discovered not really long ago and 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.980
 that I 'm going to use I'll 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:13.660
 a lot of people read about all for 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:17.460
 So after this is of course if you 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:20.890
 spend a lot of time you'll 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.070
 about 200 inches and where every 10 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.540
 minutes so 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.790
 so here you go but if you train a max and 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.210
 you would not have a problem with 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.480
 a lot 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.170
 in any case this video is coming to an end 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:38.110
