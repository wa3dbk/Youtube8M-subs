00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
with the lip and it feels like there's

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.240 
with the lip and it feels like there's
electricity<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.750> there<00:00:50.170> is<00:00:50.350> no<00:00:50.680> point<00:00:51.070> where

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
electricity and there is no point where

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.600 
electricity and there is no point where
I<00:00:51.280> don't<00:00:51.400> feel<00:00:51.640> that<00:00:51.970> electricity<00:00:53.400> and<00:00:54.400> the

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
I don't feel that electricity and the

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.509 
I don't feel that electricity and the
upper<00:00:54.879> lip<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.210> completely<00:00:55.690> back<00:00:55.900> and<00:00:56.519> it

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
upper lip is completely back and it

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.250 
upper lip is completely back and it
seems<00:00:57.850> like<00:00:58.089> there's<00:00:58.360> a<00:00:58.479> lot<00:00:58.720> of<00:00:58.839> feeling

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
seems like there's a lot of feeling

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.600 
seems like there's a lot of feeling
coming<00:00:59.530> back<00:00:59.860> I<00:01:00.659> put<00:01:01.659> on<00:01:01.809> some<00:01:02.019> weight<00:01:02.610> from

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
coming back I put on some weight from

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.980 
coming back I put on some weight from
from<00:01:04.059> eating<00:01:04.479> which<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:06.280> 63<00:01:06.970> days<00:01:07.150> I<00:01:07.600> was

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
from eating which at 63 days I was

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
from eating which at 63 days I was
trying<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.350> put<00:01:08.470> on<00:01:08.590> weight<00:01:08.740> but<00:01:08.920> I<00:01:08.980> couldn't

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
trying to put on weight but I couldn't

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.900 
trying to put on weight but I couldn't
but<00:01:10.420> at<00:01:10.540> this<00:01:10.690> point<00:01:10.930> I<00:01:11.080> put<00:01:11.290> on<00:01:11.470> I<00:01:11.790> think<00:01:12.790> I'm

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
but at this point I put on I think I'm

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.580 
but at this point I put on I think I'm
back<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.300> where<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.450> was<00:01:13.630> before<00:01:13.870> having

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
back to where I was before having

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.240 
back to where I was before having
surgery

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
surgery

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.960 
surgery
so<00:01:15.910> the<00:01:16.510> weight<00:01:16.690> does<00:01:16.930> come<00:01:17.230> back<00:01:17.970> within

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
so the weight does come back within

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.030 
so the weight does come back within
three<00:01:19.330> months<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:22.080> lot<00:01:23.080> of<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.290> other<00:01:23.440> issues

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
three months a lot of the other issues

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.300 
three months a lot of the other issues
that<00:01:24.490> I'm<00:01:24.850> having<00:01:25.180> at<00:01:25.270> this<00:01:25.420> point<00:01:25.720> is<00:01:26.310> I've

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
that I'm having at this point is I've

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.630 
that I'm having at this point is I've
almost<00:01:27.910> choked<00:01:28.450> twice<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.530> that's<00:01:30.040> because

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
almost choked twice and that's because

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.010 
almost choked twice and that's because
of<00:01:30.910> eating<00:01:31.710> you<00:01:32.710> don't<00:01:33.120> realize<00:01:34.120> because<00:01:34.870> you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
of eating you don't realize because you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.170

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.050 
almost everything's good
feel<00:02:27.500> strong<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.520> feel<00:02:29.060> motivated<00:02:29.570> and<00:02:30.170> vicious

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
feel strong I feel motivated and vicious

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.229 
feel strong I feel motivated and vicious
things<00:02:32.060> like<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:33.380> I<00:02:34.040> would<00:02:34.670> say<00:02:34.880> at<00:02:35.000> day

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
things like that so I would say at day

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.440 
things like that so I would say at day
95<00:02:36.050> it's<00:02:36.620> basically<00:02:37.310> just<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:38.090> numbness

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
95 it's basically just the numbness

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.530 
95 it's basically just the numbness
tingling<00:02:39.140> pins<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.190> needles<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.820> lack<00:02:41.510> of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
tingling pins and needles and lack of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.500 
tingling pins and needles and lack of
filling<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> mouth<00:02:42.910> which<00:02:43.910> they<00:02:44.120> say<00:02:44.360> is

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
filling in the mouth which they say is

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.090 
filling in the mouth which they say is
probably<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:45.110> to<00:02:45.170> take<00:02:45.380> up<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.739> six<00:02:46.010> months

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
probably going to take up to six months

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.340 
probably going to take up to six months
so<00:02:46.670> at<00:02:47.150> some<00:02:47.390> point<00:02:47.450> I'll<00:02:47.780> do<00:02:47.930> another<00:02:48.110> video

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
so at some point I'll do another video

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.030 
so at some point I'll do another video
but<00:02:48.769> at<00:02:49.040> day<00:02:49.310> 95<00:02:50.260> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.470> what<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.830> should<00:02:51.860> be

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
but at day 95 this is what you should be
