the<00:01:39.210> same<00:01:39.360> time<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.780> just<00:01:40.110> flashed<00:01:40.439> doing<00:01:40.710> so

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
the same time and just flashed doing so

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
the same time and just flashed doing so
much<00:01:41.130> damage<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.610> with<00:01:41.759> these<00:01:41.880> two<00:01:42.060> vultures

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
much damage just with these two vultures

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.480 
much damage just with these two vultures
and<00:01:42.689> that's<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.409> I<00:01:43.439> was<00:01:43.590> talking<00:01:43.770> about<00:01:43.979> you

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
and that's what I was talking about you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.560 
and that's what I was talking about you
know<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:44.850> would<00:01:44.970> have<00:01:45.060> pushed<00:01:45.240> in<00:01:45.420> these

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
know if he would have pushed in these

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
know if he would have pushed in these
vultures<00:01:45.750> would<00:01:45.990> have<00:01:46.110> never<00:01:46.229> gone<00:01:46.439> out<00:01:46.500> he

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
vultures would have never gone out he

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.200 
vultures would have never gone out he
would've<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.430> able<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.729> pretty<00:01:48.000> much<00:01:48.149> take

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
would've been able to pretty much take

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.530 
would've been able to pretty much take
flash<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:49.259> in<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.880> whim<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.270> you<00:01:51.360> would<00:01:51.479> have

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
flash all in a whim if you would have

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.630 
flash all in a whim if you would have
chased<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.869> stupid<00:01:52.649> freaking<00:01:53.040> Goliath<00:01:53.490> I

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
chased that stupid freaking Goliath I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.700 
chased that stupid freaking Goliath I
mean<00:01:53.820> really<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.479> was<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.930> dumb<00:01:55.290> move<00:01:55.560> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
mean really that was just a dumb move I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
mean really that was just a dumb move I
don't<00:01:55.920> think<00:01:55.950> he's<00:01:56.159> even<00:01:56.280> producing<00:01:56.880> vultures

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
don't think he's even producing vultures

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
don't think he's even producing vultures
of<00:01:57.420> his<00:01:57.570> oh<00:01:57.750> there's<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.110> going<00:01:58.229> straight

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of his oh there's just going straight

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.459 
of his oh there's just going straight
for<00:01:59.549> Goliath<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.930> right<00:02:01.110> move<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.439> think

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
for Goliath not the right move I think

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.840 
for Goliath not the right move I think
that's<00:02:01.740> kind<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:01.950> dumb<00:02:02.130> cg<00:02:02.490> up<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> see

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's kind of dumb cg up and see

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.550 
that's kind of dumb cg up and see

here<00:03:01.909> it<00:03:02.000> looks<00:03:02.150> like<00:03:02.530> turn<00:03:03.530> is<00:03:03.709> gonna<00:03:03.889> come<00:03:04.069> in

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
here it looks like turn is gonna come in

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.770 
here it looks like turn is gonna come in

some<00:03:14.449> hits<00:03:14.540> off<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:14.930> looks<00:03:15.560> like<00:03:15.709> a<00:03:16.040> nice<00:03:16.489> job

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
some hits off and looks like a nice job

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.539 
some hits off and looks like a nice job
by<00:03:17.150> turn<00:03:17.480> able<00:03:17.840> to<00:03:17.900> pick<00:03:18.019> up<00:03:18.079> those<00:03:18.230> two<00:03:18.590> units

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
by turn able to pick up those two units

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:20.890 
by turn able to pick up those two units
after<00:03:19.669> the<00:03:19.790> top<00:03:20.030> there<00:03:20.209> he<00:03:20.329> comes<00:03:20.449> five<00:03:20.720> four

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
after the top there he comes five four

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.180 
after the top there he comes five four
more<00:03:21.049> reinforcements<00:03:21.650> so<00:03:21.739> he's<00:03:21.919> gonna<00:03:22.010> have

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
more reinforcements so he's gonna have

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.189 
more reinforcements so he's gonna have
to<00:03:22.220> back<00:03:22.400> up<00:03:22.639> going<00:03:23.269> to<00:03:23.419> lose<00:03:23.660> that<00:03:23.690> Goliath

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:24.199 
to back up going to lose that Goliath

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.860 
to back up going to lose that Goliath
and<00:03:24.620> now<00:03:25.519> I<00:03:25.549> think<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:26.060> would<00:03:26.209> pretty<00:03:26.780> much

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
and now I think it would pretty much

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.069 
and now I think it would pretty much
back<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.230> square<00:03:27.680> one<00:03:27.829> back<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.190> even<00:03:29.079> no

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
back to square one back to even no

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.470 
back to square one back to even no
longer<00:03:30.470> has<00:03:30.680> the<00:03:30.859> lead<00:03:31.069> just<00:03:31.730> really<00:03:32.180> kind<00:03:32.419> of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
longer has the lead just really kind of

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.220 
longer has the lead just really kind of
lost<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:33.669> advantageous<00:03:34.669> me<00:03:35.449> no<00:03:35.599> time<00:03:35.959> frame

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
lost that advantageous me no time frame

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.430 
lost that advantageous me no time frame
where<00:03:36.769> he<00:03:36.980> could<00:03:37.280> have<00:03:37.370> pushed<00:03:37.639> in<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.440> same

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
where he could have pushed in and same

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.860 
where he could have pushed in and same
thing<00:03:39.470> with<00:03:40.030> same<00:03:41.030> thing<00:03:41.209> with<00:03:41.299> junie<00:03:41.720> you

lurkers<00:03:43.729> fast<00:03:43.909> enough<00:03:44.090> I<00:03:44.180> think<00:03:44.209> players<00:03:44.569> get

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
lurkers fast enough I think players get

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.050 
lurkers fast enough I think players get
just<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.319> scared<00:03:45.829> when<00:03:46.459> they<00:03:46.549> play<00:03:46.790> flash

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
just really scared when they play flash

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.369 
just really scared when they play flash
to<00:03:47.269> be<00:03:47.359> honest<00:03:47.599> I<00:03:47.690> think<00:03:47.750> they<00:03:47.930> just<00:03:47.959> get<00:03:48.229> you

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
to be honest I think they just get you

bit<00:03:50.150> more<00:03:50.269> conservatively<00:03:50.810> than<00:03:51.019> they<00:03:51.139> would

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
bit more conservatively than they would

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.649 
bit more conservatively than they would
have<00:03:51.349> usually<00:03:51.799> and<00:03:52.280> they<00:03:52.760> just<00:03:52.940> end<00:03:53.120> up<00:03:53.209> losing

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:46.800 
exactly what he should be doing looks
like<00:05:45.759> he<00:05:45.880> might<00:05:46.000> be<00:05:46.240> going<00:05:46.360> in<00:05:46.539> for<00:05:46.750> a

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
like he might be going in for a

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.870 
like he might be going in for a
counter-attack<00:05:47.289> a<00:05:47.710> counter-offensive<00:05:48.430> but

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
counter-attack a counter-offensive but

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.860 
counter-attack a counter-offensive but
this<00:05:49.030> force<00:05:49.240> is<00:05:49.300> not<00:05:49.479> gonna<00:05:49.599> be<00:05:49.690> enough

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
this force is not gonna be enough

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.779 
this force is not gonna be enough
especially<00:05:50.110> with<00:05:50.500> all<00:05:50.530> the<00:05:50.770> forces<00:05:51.130> that<00:05:51.400> are

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:51.789 
especially with all the forces that are

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.939 
especially with all the forces that are
at<00:05:51.940> flashes<00:05:52.479> front<00:05:52.780> here<00:05:53.050> flash<00:05:53.530> available

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:53.949 
at flashes front here flash available

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.890 
at flashes front here flash available
for<00:05:54.130> vultures<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.729> I'm<00:05:55.270> assuming<00:05:55.570> that

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
for vultures and I'm assuming that

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.540 
for vultures and I'm assuming that
there's<00:05:56.080> gonna<00:05:56.169> be<00:05:56.349> a<00:05:56.380> GG<00:05:56.830> pretty<00:05:57.099> soon<00:05:57.340> here

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
there's gonna be a GG pretty soon here

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.879 
there's gonna be a GG pretty soon here
because<00:05:57.789> he's<00:05:57.940> really<00:05:58.240> limited<00:05:58.630> to<00:05:58.840> two<00:05:59.530> bases

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
because he's really limited to two bases

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.680 
because he's really limited to two bases
flash<00:06:00.070> looks<00:06:00.310> like<00:06:00.400> he's<00:06:00.520> picked<00:06:00.729> up<00:06:00.969> another

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
flash looks like he's picked up another

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.020 
flash looks like he's picked up another
base<00:06:01.960> at<00:06:02.139> that<00:06:02.289> top<00:06:02.530> right<00:06:02.740> position<00:06:03.159> maybe

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
base at that top right position maybe

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:05.760 
base at that top right position maybe
another<00:06:04.360> base<00:06:04.630> at<00:06:05.169> that<00:06:05.380> bottom<00:06:05.530> but<00:06:05.740> I

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
another base at that bottom but I

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.230 
another base at that bottom but I
believe<00:06:06.009> that<00:06:06.070> but<00:06:06.280> that's<00:06:06.639> his<00:06:06.820> natural<00:06:07.210> I

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
believe that but that's his natural I

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.189
