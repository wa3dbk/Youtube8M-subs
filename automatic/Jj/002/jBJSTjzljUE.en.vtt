00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
rounders comments and mainly just throw

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.579 
rounders comments and mainly just throw
a<00:00:17.410> couple<00:00:17.679> factoids<00:00:18.339> at<00:00:18.460> you<00:00:18.640> all<00:00:19.259> one<00:00:20.259> being

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:20.589 
a couple factoids at you all one being

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.319 
a couple factoids at you all one being
and<00:00:21.070> actually<00:00:21.490> I<00:00:21.550> was<00:00:21.699> just<00:00:21.730> reading<00:00:22.060> this

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
and actually I was just reading this

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:26.809 
and actually I was just reading this
right<00:00:22.570> here<00:00:22.929> you<00:00:23.349> can<00:00:23.499> see<00:00:23.679> it<00:00:23.769> here<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.539> earth

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:26.819 
right here you can see it here the earth

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.960 
right here you can see it here the earth
supposedly<00:00:27.989> with<00:00:28.989> your<00:00:29.169> theory<00:00:29.529> spins<00:00:30.519> at<00:00:30.909> a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:30.970 
supposedly with your theory spins at a

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:38.190 
supposedly with your theory spins at a
speed<00:00:31.329> of<00:00:31.980> 1,000<00:00:32.980> 38<00:00:33.790> miles<00:00:34.120> per<00:00:34.510> hour<00:00:35.460> now<00:00:37.200> I'm

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.200 
speed of 1,000 38 miles per hour now I'm

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.960 
speed of 1,000 38 miles per hour now I'm
no<00:00:38.820> Brainiac<00:00:39.820> but<00:00:40.420> seems<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.050> me<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.800> if<00:00:42.310> the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
no Brainiac but seems to me that if the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.180 
no Brainiac but seems to me that if the
earth<00:00:43.270> is<00:00:43.510> actually<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:43.990> ball<00:00:44.260> spinning<00:00:44.800> around

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
earth is actually a ball spinning around

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.480 
earth is actually a ball spinning around
that<00:00:45.910> fast<00:00:46.290> that<00:00:47.290> the<00:00:47.740> oceans<00:00:48.160> are<00:00:48.250> going<00:00:48.430> to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
that fast that the oceans are going to

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.620 
that fast that the oceans are going to
fly<00:00:48.790> off<00:00:49.090> and<00:00:50.550> trees<00:00:51.550> are<00:00:52.030> going<00:00:52.450> to<00:00:52.510> get

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
fly off and trees are going to get

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.700 
fly off and trees are going to get
uprooted<00:00:53.080> and<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.820> imagine<00:00:55.600> houses<00:00:56.350> we<00:00:56.500> go

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
uprooted and I imagine houses we go

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.860 
uprooted and I imagine houses we go
flying<00:00:57.130> in<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.520> sky<00:00:57.790> people<00:00:58.180> would<00:00:58.750> be

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
flying in the sky people would be

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.690 
flying in the sky people would be
screaming<00:00:59.170> but<00:01:00.160> you<00:01:00.280> don't<00:01:00.460> see<00:01:00.670> that

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
screaming but you don't see that

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.720 
screaming but you don't see that
happening<00:01:00.880> now<00:01:01.510> do<00:01:01.570> you<00:01:01.950> but<00:01:02.950> I<00:01:03.190> know<00:01:03.310> you<00:01:03.490> all

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
have fixed goals so I just wanted to you

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.620 
have fixed goals so I just wanted to you
know<00:01:07.630> hopefully<00:01:08.110> get<00:01:08.470> that<00:01:08.530> through<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.630> also

a<00:01:10.659> little<00:01:11.020> observation<00:01:11.590> i<00:01:11.770> personally<00:01:12.280> made

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
a little observation i personally made

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.630 
a little observation i personally made
while<00:01:13.330> i<00:01:13.360> was<00:01:13.720> walking<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.200> other<00:01:14.350> day<00:01:14.640> was

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
while i was walking the other day was

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.690 
while i was walking the other day was
how<00:01:16.570> mountains<00:01:16.960> go<00:01:17.110> up<00:01:17.350> they<00:01:17.890> go<00:01:17.920> down<00:01:18.280> and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
how mountains go up they go down and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.880 
how mountains go up they go down and
then<00:01:18.790> they<00:01:18.970> go<00:01:19.150> back<00:01:19.450> up<00:01:19.720> and<00:01:19.990> they<00:01:20.229> go<00:01:20.380> down<00:01:20.560> up

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
then they go back up and they go down up

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.210 
then they go back up and they go down up
and<00:01:21.070> down<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.490> get<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.670> picture<00:01:22.710> which<00:01:23.710> to<00:01:24.040> me

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
and down you get the picture which to me

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.560 
and down you get the picture which to me
is<00:01:24.580> really<00:01:25.120> an<00:01:25.300> argument<00:01:25.780> for<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.050> flat<00:01:26.380> earth

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is really an argument for a flat earth

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.710 
is really an argument for a flat earth
if<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:29.200> earth<00:01:29.290> was<00:01:29.710> actually<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.430> ball<00:01:30.760> then

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
if the earth was actually a ball then

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.649 
if the earth was actually a ball then
the<00:01:32.229> mountains<00:01:32.530> would<00:01:32.650> just<00:01:32.830> keep<00:01:32.979> going<00:01:33.310> down

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
the mountains would just keep going down

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.380 
the mountains would just keep going down
but<00:01:34.659> they<00:01:34.780> don't<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.380> yeah<00:01:36.310> just<00:01:37.210> little

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
but they don't so yeah just little

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.610 
but they don't so yeah just little
kindling<00:01:38.229> on<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.590> fire<00:01:38.830> there<00:01:39.130> it's<00:01:39.549> good<00:01:40.180> for

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:40.620 
kindling on the fire there it's good for

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.830 
kindling on the fire there it's good for
intellectual<00:01:41.909> conversation<00:01:42.909> keep<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
intellectual conversation keep the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.520 
intellectual conversation keep the
comments<00:01:44.049> come<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.799> I<00:01:46.140> apologize<00:01:47.140> for<00:01:47.409> my
