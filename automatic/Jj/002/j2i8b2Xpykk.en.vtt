 I made the best vending machine ever made 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.630

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.580
 From the introduction of anxiety 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.420

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.960
 There is this behind 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:27.610
 Turtle But 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.960

 I have not done this 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.360
