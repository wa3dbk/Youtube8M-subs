00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
too much and eventually I figured it out

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.219 
too much and eventually I figured it out
and<00:05:01.550> then<00:05:01.580> my<00:05:01.729> character<00:05:02.120> was<00:05:02.300> obviously<00:05:02.990> gone

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
and then my character was obviously gone

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.170 
and then my character was obviously gone
because<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.710> had<00:05:03.830> spread<00:05:04.039> my<00:05:04.220> stats<00:05:04.789> out<00:05:04.970> so

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
because I had spread my stats out so

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.180

much<00:05:05.360> and<00:05:05.660> so<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:06.199> started<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.800> new<00:05:06.919> character

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
much and so I started a new character

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.800 
much and so I started a new character
and<00:05:07.550> then<00:05:07.639> I<00:05:07.669> started<00:05:08.330> another<00:05:08.539> one<00:05:08.720> in

was just focusing on assassin you know
and<00:05:38.380> that<00:05:39.380> was<00:05:39.530> when<00:05:39.650> I<00:05:39.680> was<00:05:40.039> kind<00:05:40.340> of<00:05:40.400> stopping

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
and that was when I was kind of stopping

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:43.240 
and that was when I was kind of stopping
playing<00:05:41.780> dead<00:05:41.990> frontier<00:05:42.199> as<00:05:42.530> hardcore<00:05:42.830> as<00:05:43.039> I

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
playing dead frontier as hardcore as I

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.490 
playing dead frontier as hardcore as I
used<00:05:43.490> to<00:05:43.669> you<00:05:44.180> know<00:05:44.210> as<00:05:44.449> I<00:05:44.659> was<00:05:44.840> before<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.260> guess

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
used to you know as I was before I guess

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.350 
used to you know as I was before I guess
um<00:05:46.039> oh<00:05:47.440> yeah<00:05:48.440> then<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.710> focus<00:05:49.070> on<00:05:49.240> assassin<00:05:50.240> then

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
um oh yeah then I focus on assassin then

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.439 
um oh yeah then I focus on assassin then
I<00:05:50.419> created<00:05:50.659> another<00:05:50.870> character<00:05:51.289> it<00:05:51.710> was<00:05:52.070> um

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
I created another character it was um

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.980 
I created another character it was um
Stephen<00:05:53.449> Hawking<00:05:54.250> one<00:05:55.250> point<00:05:55.550> oh<00:05:55.729> I<00:05:56.000> guess<00:05:56.870> you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
Stephen Hawking one point oh I guess you

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.409 
Stephen Hawking one point oh I guess you
could<00:05:57.020> say<00:05:57.259> but<00:05:57.560> that<00:05:58.250> character<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:59.270> was

00:05:59.409 --> 00:05:59.419 
could say but that character it was

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.490 
could say but that character it was
inactive<00:05:59.960> so<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:01.550> got<00:06:01.699> deleted<00:06:01.970> but<00:06:02.500> yeah

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
inactive so it got deleted but yeah

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.560 
inactive so it got deleted but yeah
assassin<00:06:04.130> has<00:06:04.250> stood<00:06:04.430> the<00:06:04.460> test<00:06:04.610> of<00:06:04.970> time<00:06:05.030> and

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:05.570 
assassin has stood the test of time and

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.960 
assassin has stood the test of time and
I<00:06:06.380> guess<00:06:06.500> my<00:06:06.650> point<00:06:06.889> here<00:06:07.340> is<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.550> I've<00:06:07.849> been

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
I guess my point here is that I've been

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.969 
I guess my point here is that I've been
playing<00:06:08.300> for<00:06:08.539> so<00:06:08.780> long<00:06:08.960> I've<00:06:09.229> gotten<00:06:09.530> so<00:06:09.860> much

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169
