00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the fruit the kiwifruit through the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.390 
the fruit the kiwifruit through the
glass<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.170> top<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> chair<00:01:34.860> we're

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
glass on the top of the chair we're

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.920 
glass on the top of the chair we're
going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.549> bounce<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.180> light<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.600> from<00:01:36.810> this

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
going to bounce the light up from this

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.420 
going to bounce the light up from this
bold<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.710> be<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> floor

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
bold which is going to be on the floor

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.490 
bold which is going to be on the floor
back<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.210> into<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.689> fruit<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.079> well<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
back up into the fruit as well and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.350 
back up into the fruit as well and
hopefully<00:01:40.920> make<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> completely<00:01:41.850> transparent

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
hopefully make it completely transparent

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.450 
hopefully make it completely transparent
blow<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> background<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.100> well<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
blow out the background as well with a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
blow out the background as well with a
flash<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.939> completely<00:01:45.360> over<00:01:45.659> exposed<00:01:45.960> to

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
flash so completely over exposed to

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.870 
flash so completely over exposed to
background<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.009> hopefully<00:01:47.520> what<00:01:47.640> we<00:01:47.729> should

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
background and hopefully what we should

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.359 
background and hopefully what we should
end<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:49.619> nice<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:50.189> kind

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
end up with is a really nice little kind

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.670 
end up with is a really nice little kind
of<00:01:50.460> abstract<00:01:50.850> image<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.930> anyway<00:01:52.140> guys<00:01:52.320> let<00:01:52.649> me

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
of abstract image so anyway guys let me

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880 
of abstract image so anyway guys let me
crack<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:53.070> with<00:01:53.100> this<00:01:53.220> bit

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.290 

now<00:01:57.890> what<00:01:58.040> we're<00:01:58.160> going<00:01:58.250> to<00:01:58.340> do<00:01:58.430> now<00:01:58.670> is<00:01:59.240> just

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
place the fruit on top of the

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.330 
place the fruit on top of the
transparent<00:02:02.570> panel<00:02:02.840> on<00:02:02.930> top<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.260> the<00:02:03.320> chair

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.620

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
connected together right guys now we've

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.650 
connected together right guys now we've
done<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:10.820> we<00:02:10.940> just<00:02:11.000> gotta<00:02:11.240> check<00:02:11.450> that<00:02:11.480> our

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
done that we just gotta check that our

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.990 
done that we just gotta check that our
remote<00:02:11.930> flashes<00:02:12.440> are<00:02:12.560> working<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.100> let's<00:02:13.820> just

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
remote flashes are working so let's just

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.460 
remote flashes are working so let's just
check<00:02:14.120> this<00:02:14.270> one<00:02:14.510> first<00:02:14.810> when<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.110> press<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
check this one first when I press the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.640 
check this one first when I press the
shutter<00:02:15.650> button<00:02:15.790> bang<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:17.330> then<00:02:17.810> let's<00:02:18.470> just

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
shutter button bang and then let's just

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.870 
shutter button bang and then let's just
check<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.920> second<00:02:19.310> one<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:19.550> when<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.760> press

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
check the second one now when I press

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.870 
check the second one now when I press
the<00:02:20.090> shutter<00:02:20.240> button<00:02:21.430> bang<00:02:22.430> that<00:02:22.730> one's

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
the shutter button bang that one's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.480 
the shutter button bang that one's
working<00:02:23.060> as<00:02:23.330> well<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.170> first<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.590> all<00:02:24.680> I'm

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
working as well so first of all I'm

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.190 
working as well so first of all I'm
going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.820> try<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.030> without<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.480> bottom<00:02:26.930> flash

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
going to try it without the bottom flash

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720 
going to try it without the bottom flash
and<00:02:27.440> see<00:02:27.590> if<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.740> can<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:27.920> over<00:02:28.280> expose<00:02:28.580> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
and see if we can just over expose the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.400 
and see if we can just over expose the
background<00:02:29.120> value<00:02:29.510> but<00:02:29.900> if<00:02:29.960> that<00:02:30.110> doesn't

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
background value but if that doesn't

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.540 
background value but if that doesn't
work<00:02:30.440> then<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.830> have<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.130> introduce<00:02:31.340> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
work then we have to introduce the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.190 
work then we have to introduce the
second<00:02:32.030> flash<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:32.450> just<00:02:32.600> over<00:02:32.840> expose<00:02:33.170> that

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
second flash and just over expose that

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.570 
second flash and just over expose that
background<00:02:34.000> so<00:02:35.000> let's<00:02:35.180> give<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.420> go<00:02:35.570> guys

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
background so let's give it a go guys

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.090 
background so let's give it a go guys
now<00:02:37.580> I've<00:02:37.640> got<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.880> macro<00:02:38.270> lens<00:02:38.510> on<00:02:38.750> here<00:02:39.100> so

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
now I've got the macro lens on here so

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.970 
now I've got the macro lens on here so
um<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:41.540> thing<00:02:41.780> can<00:02:41.930> literally<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.380> Y<00:02:42.740> up

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
um this thing can literally get Y up

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.890 
um this thing can literally get Y up
close<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.910> be<00:02:44.090> interesting<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.570> see<00:02:44.720> what<00:02:44.810> the

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
close so be interesting to see what the

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:57.960 
close so be interesting to see what the
results<00:02:45.290> are

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.420 

but<00:02:58.970> now<00:02:59.390> that's<00:02:59.570> not<00:02:59.750> bad<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:01.130> if<00:03:01.190> you<00:03:01.280> can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
but now that's not bad and if you can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.870 
but now that's not bad and if you can
see<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.390> we<00:03:02.870> can<00:03:03.020> still<00:03:03.230> kind<00:03:03.500> of<00:03:03.680> see<00:03:04.580> a

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
see that but we can still kind of see a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.700 
see that but we can still kind of see a
bit<00:03:05.510> too<00:03:05.690> much<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:06.050> what's<00:03:06.230> going<00:03:06.410> on<00:03:06.560> in<00:03:06.650> the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
bit too much of what's going on in the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.950 
bit too much of what's going on in the
background<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.400> what<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> need<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.330> do<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.780> look

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
background so what I need to do is look

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.480 
background so what I need to do is look
up<00:03:09.080> just<00:03:09.350> blowing<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.770> background<00:03:10.220> out<00:03:10.340> of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
up just blowing that background out of

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.730 
up just blowing that background out of
it<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.390> let's<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.200> put<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> flash

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
it so let's just put the flash

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.920 
it so let's just put the flash
underneath<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:14.330> then<00:03:14.360> we<00:03:14.510> can<00:03:14.630> just<00:03:14.660> totally

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
underneath and then we can just totally

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
underneath and then we can just totally
over<00:03:15.410> expose<00:03:15.770> that<00:03:15.800> background<00:03:17.800> I'm<00:03:18.800> going<00:03:18.890> to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
over expose that background I'm going to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.360 
over expose that background I'm going to
put<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.160> flash<00:03:19.400> on<00:03:19.550> about<00:03:19.760> half<00:03:20.030> power<00:03:21.370> to

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
put the flash on about half power to

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.260 
put the flash on about half power to
start<00:03:22.730> with<00:03:24.459> because<00:03:25.459> what<00:03:25.670> we<00:03:25.730> don't<00:03:25.910> want<00:03:26.030> is

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.270 
start with because what we don't want is

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.050 
start with because what we don't want is
too<00:03:26.510> much<00:03:26.720> of<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:26.930> coming<00:03:27.170> back<00:03:27.440> up<00:03:27.680> and<00:03:28.060> then

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
too much of it coming back up and then
