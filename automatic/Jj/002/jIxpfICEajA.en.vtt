00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.890
 as you can see here they are 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.740

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:16.330
 written calmly 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.280
 it's stupid but that's where your 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.550
 device 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.450
 then the tablet whatever 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.709

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.350
 true 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.910
 and here 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.110
 for all the tests because as they 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.060
 I said in a previous video I do not have 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.320
 computer right now because I do not 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 it serves 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.170
 let's talk as I like excellent 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.970
 but something that I did not like this kind of 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.370
 let's say this 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.880
 if I am an event but what you can is that 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.060
 this 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.160
 how to put it 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.260
 there's that particle here 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:13.840
 but in itself very well its sets of 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:16.319
 they cost me very very cheap 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:22.410
 I bought at the famous coppel store 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:26.430
 I got out in 100 209 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.560
 and it goes very well I do not tell you that this is not 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.069
 you can open a lot and the local stoke 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.129
 and cove 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.450
 well there is something very practical that 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:39.550
 can fold 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.550
 around here and enters 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.310
 day 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:51.590
 then carry syndicated as they see 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.590
 as we see here nothing more 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:56.049
 the cables good 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.790
