00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.550
 more than a month of brides I will have magazines today open a series of 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.990
 reports on marriage and when the probe gets married there is not much to change 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.290
 right wrong at least in the invitations the option is the one that does not lack in savior 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.400
 can be found with a wide range of tailor-made 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 each type of ceremony 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.179
 brides month and wedding reminds of joy 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:42.529
 Every party has an invitation but that classic invitation is 

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:43.570
 past 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.970
 a Salvadoran plastic artist decided to modernize the invitations of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.400
 wedding has all the colors and shapes and even has an invitation that is to leave 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.650
 the most democratic marriages end that fight for the goal that the bride's 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.950
 is that in this marriage each invitation has its own talk 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.340
 who is going to marry on the beach can invite constance by using waves already for 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.460
 weddings at the farm even gives you the opportunity to use a small straw hat when 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 close the invitation 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.600
 the most modern bride and groom can use invitations with glowing corregidor works 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.860
 different it is possible to deliver the invitation in the form of a cone 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.650
 the Angolan artist Guida Capelo in Salvador, 27, likes both 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.620
 wedding invitations that even did a historical research according to her so 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.520
 were the invitations of the time of discovery 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.830
 in 1700 the invitations were doubled as the titles of nobility glue crisis 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.370
 custom 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.010
 in 1800 the invitation was already more like today's letters 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.540
 already in the 50's tommasi screens 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.130
 all the paper used in the invitations is recycled made at the artist's house. 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.110
 mix in some plants and seeds I want to draw attention 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.150
 for the preservation of nature 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.260
 my work was treated with my creativity because of this 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.549
 in the end a surprise 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.200
 this is how Guida imagines that it was the invitations in the time of the caves 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 pictures of the bride and groom 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.350
 this from the time of the dry Bernabeu 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.450
