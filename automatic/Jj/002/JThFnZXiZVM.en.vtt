00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
built and if we just try to show it in

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.190 
built and if we just try to show it in
action<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.860> find<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.340> place<00:01:48.200> with

action see if we can find a place with

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.280 
action see if we can find a place with
with<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> mobs<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.729> yeah<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:52.049> one
