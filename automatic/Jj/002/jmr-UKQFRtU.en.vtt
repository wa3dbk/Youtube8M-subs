tell you anyway the WTF montages come

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.390 
tell you anyway the WTF montages come
along<00:01:54.890> very<00:01:55.550> nicely<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:56.240> might<00:01:56.300> add<00:01:57.190> I'm<00:01:58.190> going

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
along very nicely I might add I'm going

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.860 
along very nicely I might add I'm going
to<00:01:58.460> cut<00:01:58.640> it<00:01:58.730> down<00:01:58.760> to<00:01:58.910> probably<00:01:59.270> about<00:01:59.540> five

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
to cut it down to probably about five

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.530 
to cut it down to probably about five
minutes<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:01.190> that<00:02:01.550> just<00:02:01.850> because<00:02:02.120> it<00:02:02.240> takes<00:02:02.390> a

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
minutes if that just because it takes a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.870 
minutes if that just because it takes a
long<00:02:02.720> time<00:02:02.780> to<00:02:03.110> get<00:02:03.500> clips<00:02:03.800> together<00:02:03.950> because

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
long time to get clips together because

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.430 
long time to get clips together because
each<00:02:05.030> clip<00:02:05.470> lasts<00:02:06.470> about<00:02:06.560> maybe<00:02:08.050> 20<00:02:09.050> to<00:02:09.230> 30

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
each clip lasts about maybe 20 to 30

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.280 
each clip lasts about maybe 20 to 30
seconds<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.730> that's<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.390> lot<00:02:11.630> of<00:02:11.660> work<00:02:11.900> to<00:02:12.140> get

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
seconds so that's a lot of work to get

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.800 
seconds so that's a lot of work to get
like<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.530> 10<00:02:12.800> minute<00:02:13.100> video<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.240> really<00:02:14.690> want

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
like a 10 minute video and I really want

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.640 
like a 10 minute video and I really want
to<00:02:14.930> upload<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.230> now<00:02:15.650> i'm<00:02:16.550> very<00:02:16.610> impatient<00:02:17.650> so

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
to upload it now i'm very impatient so

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.080
