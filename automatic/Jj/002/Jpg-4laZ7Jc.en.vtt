00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.139
 hello everyone welcome once again to 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.750
 art track today we will be doing 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.059
 the bands but colors and we're going to 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.590
 be doing with papers so 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.810
 let's take some of this some of 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.009
 glue and let's start first 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.419
 What we are going to do is grab a leaf 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.099
 anyone as I said they were going to be 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.050
 colors does not necessarily have to be 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.970
 violet so let's grab this 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.790
 celestial leaf and we're going to have 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.349
 to cut first one more rectangle or 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.719
 less than this size let's do the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:39.090
 double so they have an idea like that 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.560
 in this way and we are going to cut it 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.080
 once we do not have that we are going to do 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.330
 small unfinished tacos to cut 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.970
 all paper and in this way to 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.980
 that we complete the whole sheet try to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.980
 leave it at least until this space 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.600
 Now we come to the moment where we are going 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.829
 to have to level our patience 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.680
 because what we are going to be doing 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.470
 now it is to roll up each of these 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.450
 strips until you reach the end 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.150
 what we are going to be doing this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.460
 rollito in this way with each of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.000
 the strips so to develop the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
 patience 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.970
 let's grab the green leaf let's 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:24.009
 give it a fold in this way almost 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.960
 same as we did with the blue sheet and 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.450
 let's cut it in this case well what 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.840
 made it a little smaller because it's going to be 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.640
 the stem we are only going to grab it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.039
 well in this way and carefully 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.220
 let's bend one of the tips to 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.710
 to be able to roll the paper in a 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.289
 oblique it is not necessary that it be so 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.580
 perfect in horizontal way they are going to 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.979
 do in this way so that they are left 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.630
 very firm and tight so let's 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 make the stem 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.920
 now let's take this thing that we just 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.510
 realize that we cut in half that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.120
 they will symbolize the part of the 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.070
 growth of sil flowers and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.350
 let's put it this way from 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.530
 up so we place it much better 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:12.410
 so let's hit here with our 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.920
 glue stick let's start 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.920
 roll it up 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
 and 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.790
 let's make a small union for 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.070
 give a few leaves to the flower and this 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.800
 way we are going to cut a piece of paper 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.380
 It can be a small rectangle or 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.120
 square as you want we are going to 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.920
 do this way and we will perform 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.920
 small triangles 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.700
 let's put this here between the union 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.230
 of the flower and the stem so let's 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.000
 give a little one pass with the 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.430
 glue here on the edge and let's 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.380
 do the same procedure that we did 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.380
 with the sticking of the petals 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.650
 and so the flower is running 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.989
 finished note that here I doubled a bit 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 the leaves so it does not stay so straight 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.700
 so ugly you already gave it then if 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.470
 you want to make it the best 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.959
 possible way take the time 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.870
 take a deep breath and have a lot of patience 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.720
 because make all these petals of 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.250
 the flower is a bit tedious work 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.409
 certain way but that gives a result 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.510
 very beautiful and combined with several 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.700
 colors is even better and if they liked it 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.079
 this video can give you like and share 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.760
 cheese the truth to me would help me a 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.019
 lots to be able to spread all these 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.489

 people left us another program another 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.040
 episode here in art track we finish 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.900
 a flower that we are going to put in the 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.450
 new background so that it decorates together with the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.250
 sunflower will be a little contrasted 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.620
 but it will be good if we accommodate it 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.980
 well so good we'll be watching 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:11.550
 in the next video to see 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.550
 and much more here in art track chau
