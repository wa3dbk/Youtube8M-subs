would<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:01.920> not<00:02:02.310> do<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.240> try<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> do

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
would you not do that just to try to do

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.510 
would you not do that just to try to do
a<00:02:03.750> move<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.470> doesn't<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.890> any<00:02:05.039> sense<00:02:05.280> it's

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
a move that doesn't make any sense it's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.609 
a move that doesn't make any sense it's
like<00:02:05.640> if<00:02:05.759> a<00:02:05.850> cop<00:02:06.090> sees<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.630> God<00:02:06.780> speeding<00:02:07.440> like
