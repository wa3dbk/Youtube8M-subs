00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:05.869 
dream and then it started all kind of

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:08.380 
dream and then it started all kind of
fading<00:01:06.289> away<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:07.160> I<00:01:07.190> focused<00:01:07.880> on<00:01:08.000> things<00:01:08.270> that

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
fading away so I focused on things that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.850 
fading away so I focused on things that
were<00:01:08.570> in<00:01:08.720> the<00:01:08.869> dream<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.259> that<00:01:09.380> seemed<00:01:09.830> to

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
were in the dream and that seemed to

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.620 
were in the dream and that seemed to
work<00:01:10.039> pretty<00:01:10.100> well<00:01:10.369> like<00:01:10.700> I'd<00:01:10.940> look<00:01:11.210> at<00:01:11.420> I

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
work pretty well like I'd look at I

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.270 
work pretty well like I'd look at I
think<00:01:12.020> I<00:01:12.080> was<00:01:12.170> a<00:01:12.229> castle<00:01:12.619> at<00:01:12.740> one<00:01:12.860> point<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.250> I

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
think I was a castle at one point and I

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.800 
think I was a castle at one point and I
just<00:01:13.310> start<00:01:13.670> looking<00:01:13.939> at<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.210> focusing<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.720> it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
just start looking at it focusing on it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.560 
just start looking at it focusing on it
and<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.380> dream<00:01:15.560> would<00:01:15.680> come<00:01:15.740> back<00:01:16.040> into<00:01:16.570> play

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
and the dream would come back into play

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.300 
and the dream would come back into play
and<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:18.350> was<00:01:18.439> a<00:01:18.500> strange<00:01:18.740> thing<00:01:19.010> I<00:01:19.130> could

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
and it was a strange thing I could

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.760 
and it was a strange thing I could
control<00:01:19.460> absolutely<00:01:20.150> anything<00:01:20.960> anything<00:01:21.470> I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
I thought the countries are really

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.860 
I thought the countries are really
interesting<00:04:25.699> but<00:04:25.820> not<00:04:25.880> many<00:04:26.240> people<00:04:26.419> got<00:04:26.659> to

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
interesting but not many people got to

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.140 
interesting but not many people got to
see<00:04:27.229> them<00:04:27.440> so<00:04:27.979> if<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.280> did<00:04:28.490> miss<00:04:28.699> those<00:04:28.909> guys
