 tears 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:53.739

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.390

 let's play who will marry sponge objects 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.820
 you have to get to the legend of 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.860
 finish line 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:39.160
 and you only have one pair of skis per team 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:40.600
 that you have or my god ready to not 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.280
 own 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.910
 I still wonder why you did this 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.590
 meanwhile I enjoy the recreation center of 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.660
 ice will make it back to invite of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 new and how it is getting worse and the 2 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.590
 rocchi here 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.600
 321 jump 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.690
 I don't know which is water 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.250
 ice 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.480
 well even an apple would understand that i 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.070
 soft beans are dry seconds but 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.290
 I'm not sure which team he has 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.450
 won by lost so we'll do another 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.700
 challenge this really a lot 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.920
 you have to do the vertical when I press the 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.970
 red button the strings will leave you if 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.340
 you are the last to stay in balance 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.690
 win and you will receive a token for 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.260
 team with all players on the ground 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.260
 vip 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.880
 another name lost in 3.7 seconds e 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:13.580
 cherries win but who will have the 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:15.890
 victory token but his wins 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.410
 second token you can only use one 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.299
 at a time or cherries are prime ones 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.209
 other last name look how far it is 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:26.269
 beautiful my first real the first remembers 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.190
 It s right now for my life 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.950
 what you think of dreams of that cloud 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.060
 I think that cloud looks like a ball 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.890
 tennis court 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:40.010
 I therefore think more of tennis halle 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.989
 body based or my sige no 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.269
 rocky I think you have serious 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.790
 comic problems but look at the side 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:49.450
 positive knows exactly where it should can 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.450
 to avoid 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.840
 guys because seen posed is 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:08.450
 useless but it is credit and what it does to us 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.580
 the speaker here is here to tell you that the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.500
 your team lost another name 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.430
 go to the elimination area e 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.430
 let's see who will be eliminated 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.740
 the two objects with the most votes 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.840
 high will leave the team one will go 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.690
 from cherries and the other will be eliminated 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.470
 goal ball and fire you have a token 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.820
 of victory you want to use it now 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.790
 remember if you will use your votes 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:47.000
 they will be halved I use it and what it is 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.700
 makes today we have 37 hunchbacks bible 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.650
 except with only two yes accounts but why 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.080
 my slice of cake was aimed at 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.580
 cakes cost so here's a slice of 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:02.690
 imaginary cake can 4 edotti coin from 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:05.300
 5 golf balls and drums have 12 and 15 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:09.290
 votes fell even with the token the data 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.740
 He speaks for potentially online courses are 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:14.930
 stayed with the golf ball jerks and 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.700
 rocky fluffy cherries will vote for 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.720
 who to let stay and for whom to eliminate 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:23.630
 well yes I vote to whom to stay with us 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.940
 parry the operational grandmother I say rocky 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.700
 because pallate crow pretends to be a 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.960
 male when instead a female e 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.480
 this is wrong I choose rocky 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.900
 because the golf pole is a robot company 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.570
 I say rocky because I'm not great 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.400
 fan of dimples I choose drums 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.129
 why neck golf after mine 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.540
 small brain 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:50.510
 all right 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.700
 he chose rocchi therefore he is looking for that 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.730
 I also talk about goals 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.180
 you are too vigilant today as I like you 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:02.510
 of me people now the possible ways e 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:07.880
 victories have fallen from 71 to 43 percent 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:11.060
 make 0 0 0 0 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.930
 and finally we are at the final at 13 but 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.930
 you to make me an adult
