00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
found is that I can send a sample from

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.959 
found is that I can send a sample from
OS<00:00:31.050> 10<00:00:31.349> point<00:00:31.590> six<00:00:31.830> point<00:00:32.009> seven<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:32.820> this

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
OS 10 point six point seven on this

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.389 
OS 10 point six point seven on this
machine<00:00:33.890> now<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> Mac<00:00:35.760> Mini<00:00:37.579> Intel

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399

so<00:00:53.640> what<00:00:54.640> I<00:00:54.670> have<00:00:54.969> is<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.360> have<00:00:55.390> a<00:00:55.539> castle<00:00:56.050> would

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
so what I have is I have a castle would

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.650 
so what I have is I have a castle would
us<00:00:58.809> be<00:00:59.019> discussing<00:00:59.440> adapter<00:01:00.269> connected<00:01:01.269> from

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
us be discussing adapter connected from

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.350 
us be discussing adapter connected from
my<00:01:01.750> Mac<00:01:01.960> Mini<00:01:02.199> going<00:01:02.649> into<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:02.980> back<00:01:03.129> of<00:01:03.370> my

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.749 

and<00:01:08.940> what<00:01:09.940> I've<00:01:10.060> done<00:01:10.240> here<00:01:10.300> is<00:01:10.950> made<00:01:11.950> a<00:01:12.009> loop

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:12.759 
and what I've done here is made a loop

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.340 
and what I've done here is made a loop
in<00:01:13.000> Pro<00:01:13.420> Tools<00:01:13.450> actually<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:17.020> messing

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
in Pro Tools actually just messing

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.440 
in Pro Tools actually just messing
around<00:01:17.440> with<00:01:17.619> some<00:01:17.909> settings<00:01:18.909> and<00:01:19.000> Pro<00:01:19.210> Tools

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
around with some settings and Pro Tools

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:30.990 
around with some settings and Pro Tools
and<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.869> kind<00:01:20.440> of<00:01:20.500> made<00:01:20.680> this<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.610> you<00:01:30.729> get<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
and I kind of made this so you get the

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.050 
and I kind of made this so you get the
idea<00:01:31.470> so<00:01:32.470> I<00:01:32.530> bounce<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.429> down<00:01:33.490> as<00:01:33.700> an<00:01:33.789> audio

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
idea so I bounce it down as an audio

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.340 
idea so I bounce it down as an audio
file<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:35.970> been<00:01:36.970> loaded<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.479> into<00:01:37.659> peak

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
file I been loaded that into peak

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.660 
file I been loaded that into peak
version<00:01:39.100> 5.2<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:42.929> here's<00:01:43.929> today's<00:01:44.110> menu<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
version 5.2 and here's today's menu so

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.180 
version 5.2 and here's today's menu so
in<00:01:45.789> peak<00:01:49.050> basically<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.080> take<00:01:50.289> the<00:01:50.470> WAV<00:01:50.860> file

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
in peak basically I take the WAV file

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.999 
in peak basically I take the WAV file
say<00:01:51.520> my<00:01:51.729> file<00:01:52.000> I<00:01:52.030> can<00:01:52.420> select<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.350> all<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.500> play

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
say my file I can select it all and play

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.280 
say my file I can select it all and play
it<00:01:54.700> slow<00:01:54.940> quieter<00:01:55.390> cuz<00:01:55.630> it's<00:01:55.750> coming<00:01:55.990> through

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
it slow quieter cuz it's coming through

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.499 
it slow quieter cuz it's coming through
my<00:01:56.439> Mac<00:01:56.710> sound<00:01:57.100> card<00:01:59.729> this<00:02:00.729> is<00:02:00.820> pretty<00:02:01.180> simple

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
my Mac sound card this is pretty simple

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.679 
my Mac sound card this is pretty simple
little<00:02:02.140> loop<00:02:02.320> and<00:02:02.740> then<00:02:03.640> once<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.180> select<00:02:04.390> it

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
little loop and then once I select it

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.590 
little loop and then once I select it
all<00:02:04.840> I<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:05.229> go<00:02:05.380> into<00:02:05.500> sampler<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.390> really
