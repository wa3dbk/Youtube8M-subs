00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
you need is for double-a batteries and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.770 
you need is for double-a batteries and
three<00:00:40.129> Triple<00:00:40.430> A<00:00:40.520> batteries<00:00:40.550> for<00:00:41.239> Thomas<00:00:41.660> and

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
three Triple A batteries for Thomas and

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.619 
three Triple A batteries for Thomas and
the<00:00:42.470> radio<00:00:42.800> control<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:43.970> will<00:00:44.120> also<00:00:44.300> need<00:00:44.570> a

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
the radio control you will also need a

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.979 
the radio control you will also need a
cup<00:00:44.930> of<00:00:44.960> water<00:00:45.320> now<00:00:45.980> what<00:00:46.280> you<00:00:46.400> do<00:00:46.640> is<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.780> take

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
cup of water now what you do is you take

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:50.439 
cup of water now what you do is you take
this<00:00:48.199> out<00:00:48.470> and<00:00:48.650> you<00:00:49.220> must<00:00:49.670> use<00:00:49.820> distilled

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
water if you use regular water particles

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:54.549 
water if you use regular water particles
will<00:00:53.059> get<00:00:53.239> in<00:00:53.420> here<00:00:53.629> and<00:00:53.809> Thomas<00:00:54.170> might<00:00:54.379> not

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
will get in here and Thomas might not

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.340 
will get in here and Thomas might not
operate<00:00:55.250> correctly<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.300> remember<00:00:57.019> to<00:00:57.140> use
