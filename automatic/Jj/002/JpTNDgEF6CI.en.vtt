bring the hoop against your body and
straight<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.640> front<00:01:39.240> of<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.630> then<00:01:40.619> from

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
straight up in front of you then from

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.410 
straight up in front of you then from
there<00:01:41.100> you're<00:01:41.220> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> give<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.939> hoop<00:01:42.119> some

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
there you're going to give the hoop some

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.600 
there you're going to give the hoop some
momentum<00:01:43.159> to<00:01:44.159> continue<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.909> rotation

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
momentum to continue that rotation

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.180 
momentum to continue that rotation
so<00:01:47.540> one<00:01:48.020> more<00:01:48.230> time<00:01:48.260> slowly<00:01:49.660> poop<00:01:51.040> around<00:01:52.040> my

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
so one more time slowly poop around my

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.650 
so one more time slowly poop around my
waist<00:01:52.460> hand<00:01:53.450> against<00:01:53.930> my<00:01:54.080> back<00:01:55.120> pull<00:01:56.120> straight

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
waist hand against my back pull straight

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.480 
waist hand against my back pull straight
up<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.610> then<00:01:58.610> I've<00:01:58.760> got<00:01:58.940> my<00:02:00.040> lasso<00:02:01.040> over<00:02:01.340> my

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
up and then I've got my lasso over my

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.850 
up and then I've got my lasso over my
head<00:02:01.730> let's<00:02:02.690> do<00:02:02.810> that<00:02:02.930> one<00:02:03.110> more<00:02:03.200> time<00:02:03.470> just<00:02:03.500> a

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
head let's do that one more time just a

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.340 
head let's do that one more time just a
little<00:02:04.100> bit<00:02:04.220> faster<00:02:04.460> I'll<00:02:05.390> do<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.660> once<00:02:05.840> facing

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
little bit faster I'll do it once facing

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.219 
little bit faster I'll do it once facing
the<00:02:06.440> front<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.890> ones<00:02:07.040> facing<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.550> back

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
the front and ones facing the back

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:16.680 
the front and ones facing the back
so<00:02:09.229> straight<00:02:10.190> up<00:02:11.380> and<00:02:12.380> back

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.050 

grabs<00:02:17.690> Trina

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
grabs Trina

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.990 
grabs Trina
so<00:02:20.600> that's<00:02:20.780> section<00:02:21.170> one

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
so that's section one

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.229 
so that's section one
