worked the storm and when I then stood
there<00:05:03.420> and<00:05:03.630> the<00:05:04.170> storm<00:05:04.470> started<00:05:04.860> to<00:05:04.980> kick<00:05:05.160> up

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
there and the storm started to kick up

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.830 
there and the storm started to kick up
and<00:05:05.670> suddenly<00:05:05.880> I<00:05:06.060> turned<00:05:06.420> at<00:05:06.570> the<00:05:06.660> right

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
and suddenly I turned at the right

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.600 
and suddenly I turned at the right
moment<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.320> see<00:05:07.530> the<00:05:07.650> lightning<00:05:08.070> strike<00:05:08.340> that

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
moment to see the lightning strike that

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.850 
moment to see the lightning strike that
the<00:05:09.120> windmill<00:05:09.540> we<00:05:10.080> took<00:05:10.230> it<00:05:10.410> out<00:05:10.530> you<00:05:10.740> know

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
window then I'm back to what I fear when

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.350 
window then I'm back to what I fear when
we<00:05:15.240> did<00:05:15.390> 1942<00:05:16.260> I<00:05:16.470> wasn't<00:05:16.650> wake<00:05:16.950> island<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:18.240> at

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
we did 1942 I wasn't wake island and at

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.200 
we did 1942 I wasn't wake island and at
some<00:05:18.570> point<00:05:18.810> 64<00:05:19.410> players<00:05:19.730> playing<00:05:20.730> surround

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
some point 64 players playing surround

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.580 
some point 64 players playing surround
you<00:05:21.390> and<00:05:21.420> everything<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.020> just<00:05:22.080> look<00:05:22.470> around

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
you and everything and just look around

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.910 
you and everything and just look around
it's<00:05:22.980> kind<00:05:23.160> of<00:05:23.190> I<00:05:24.050> can't<00:05:25.050> believe<00:05:25.260> that<00:05:25.470> we've

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
it's kind of I can't believe that we've

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.670 
it's kind of I can't believe that we've
done<00:05:26.190> this<00:05:26.400> and<00:05:26.810> you<00:05:27.810> don't<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.200> there<00:05:28.470> by

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
done this and you don't get there by

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.160 
done this and you don't get there by
looking<00:05:29.100> at<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.520> competition<00:05:30.120> you<00:05:30.630> should

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
looking at the competition you should

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.170 
looking at the competition you should
get<00:05:31.320> inspired<00:05:31.710> by<00:05:31.980> the<00:05:32.040> competition<00:05:32.640> but<00:05:33.090> you

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
get inspired by the competition but you

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.150 
get inspired by the competition but you
need<00:05:33.360> to<00:05:33.510> run<00:05:33.690> your<00:05:33.900> own<00:05:33.930> race<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:34.950> truly

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
need to run your own race and I truly

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.190 
need to run your own race and I truly
believe<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.580> that<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.450> what<00:05:36.630> died<00:05:36.840> stars

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
believe that that is what died stars

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.410 
believe that that is what died stars
that's<00:05:37.530> why<00:05:37.800> we<00:05:37.890> need<00:05:38.010> to<00:05:38.190> build<00:05:38.310> frostbite<00:05:39.270> 3

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
that's why we need to build frostbite 3

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.030 
that's why we need to build frostbite 3
your<00:05:39.690> own<00:05:39.810> engine<00:05:40.200> to<00:05:40.380> do<00:05:40.500> what<00:05:40.680> no<00:05:40.800> one<00:05:40.830> else

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040

can<00:05:41.280> do<00:05:41.720> and<00:05:42.720> it's<00:05:42.960> proven<00:05:43.410> a<00:05:43.440> winning<00:05:44.220> concept

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430
