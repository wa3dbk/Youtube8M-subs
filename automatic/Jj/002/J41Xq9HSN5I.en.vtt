 almost a good you bought online 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.110
 in november 2013 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.539
 because we then come in so kind 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.289
 I signed the property in June 2013 but me 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:21.280
 I have guys that you will make cuttings and 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.670
 scenes though I find at 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:31.270
 marseille I found at 35 as shooting 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:33.340
 and Marseille so I had two thousand 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.380
 euros of painting work 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.929
 interests also the notary fees is 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.420
 good in all that makes me laugh tired 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.130
 after 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:46.409
 189 190 euros insurance all sound 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.720
 credit and so that's good when I play 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.880
 on average 37 euros a night for two 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.299
 people and 47 euros a night for two 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.060
 people 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.280
 and that's a good thing that makes me feel 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.700
 close between is about 1000 without 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.700
 robin 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.000
 it will be clearly 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.100
 seven hundred 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:14.290
 because here 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.880
 it's really in 2008 credit on a 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.620
 car I was praying 310 euros 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.120
 so people that's what they pay to 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.880
 one that perishable for a car from 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.340
 sport an apartment less than 300 euros 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.230
 Ouattara super kf the parking lots 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.330
 say thank you and so it's not as a result 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.510
 while his accomplice Bella actually follows 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.530
 I have a little bit 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.209
 so suddenly I put a little bit of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.159
 money aside so suddenly bah there 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.379
 I chained this week the man on 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.090
 a second seasonal apartment so 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.129
 there I went to visit at the beginning of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.439
 week and there I should sign the 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.939
 compromised next week okay 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.290
 and suddenly it's 700 euros there you 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.299
 so every month profits 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.890
 set aside to build a 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.620
 intake actually that's quite actually 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.569
 I have not all there good 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.829
 fully self-financing with 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.510
 charges the taxes all that all 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.890
 self-finance everything else I leave of 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.569
 side that allows me to have a contribution 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.640
 for our well being 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.400
 it actually allows you to go up a little bit 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.049
 your salary or to make a half month of 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.730
 salary in short here is downright 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:10.780
 now he was holding a council to 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.590
 give people watching us 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.970
 people who want to start 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.140
 invest in real estate that would be 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.640
 what advice is patient 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.410
 because the bargain she is 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.780
 somewhere you just have to look for it 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.400
 and here she is, so be patient 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.319
 have tried to spend time looking for 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.750
 that's the good deal she's here it's 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.709
 the sphere do I did that is to say 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.209
 that it's a stroke of luck but good I 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.770
 was looking for a little bit here is the good 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.420
 case she's here she's in the 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.800
 corner somewhere here are just a 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.730
 little passer you're going to find and 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.959
 as I often do not have it 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.310
 will leave the band to do it's she 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:40.690
 who find us and if we want to find 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.610
 a flat united against the blow there 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.900
 unfortunately it's going to be complicated there 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 have to really be covered we'll say and 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.350
 look for them a little bit 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.140
 bitumen said that so on marseille 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.520
 it's really very interesting 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.530
 shots compared to Parisians by 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.300
 example that there is a good return to 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.890
 general to marseille yeah then 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.060
 marseille comes to find roughly 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.160
 between 1500 and 3000 euros square meter I 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.110
 would say that I have big margins 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.910
 kamal bargain here and the 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.410
 profitability we come to find still 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.110
 a lot of good with a profitability 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.920
 close to 10% 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.540
 because quite often people think 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.920
 we can do that only in paris 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.150
 third parties in Paris from where then as a 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.650
 tool contrary to not to paris 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.390
 you're lucky because in paris 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.500
 it's more expensive it's more complicated 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.080
 there is more competition besides 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.240
 competition is always the 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.490
 the seller how who has the last word 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.710
 and 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.870
 simpler we will say in France bat 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.099
 eric congratulations for this for this deal 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.970
 thank you is not the daily 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:34.970
 thank you that's true 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.880
 Oh
