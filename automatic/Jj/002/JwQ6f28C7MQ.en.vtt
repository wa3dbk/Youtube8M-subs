and<00:00:45.690> probably<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.260> like<00:00:46.440> outer<00:00:46.649> space<00:00:46.800> record

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and probably one like outer space record

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.740 
and probably one like outer space record
there<00:00:47.550> has<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> be<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.120> kind<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.360> record<00:00:48.480> if

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
there has to be some kind of record if

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.330 
there has to be some kind of record if
you're<00:00:48.840> believing<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.350> friggin<00:00:49.649> earth<00:00:49.770> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

first<00:00:52.079> person<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:53.010> break<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.430> speed<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.760> sound

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
first person to break the speed of sound

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
first person to break the speed of sound
in<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:54.690> skydiving<00:00:54.930> free<00:00:55.649> fall<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:56.160> pretty<00:00:56.610> sure

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
in a skydiving free fall I'm pretty sure

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.430 
in a skydiving free fall I'm pretty sure
I<00:00:57.120> would<00:00:57.329> never<00:00:57.480> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.840> break<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.050> record

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
I would never want to break that record

guys be the drugs of that one the ascent
into<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.760> stratosphere<00:01:06.030> should<00:01:06.900> take<00:01:07.080> about

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
into the stratosphere should take about

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.940 
into the stratosphere should take about
2.5<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.340> 3<00:01:08.700> hours<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.659> descent<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.560> only

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
2.5 to 3 hours but the descent it's only

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.039 
2.5 to 3 hours but the descent it's only
to<00:01:11.130> take<00:01:11.280> 15<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> 20<00:01:12.119> minutes<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.689> just<00:01:12.930> tells

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
to take 15 to 20 minutes that just tells

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.750 
to take 15 to 20 minutes that just tells
you<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.350> fast<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.950> guy's<00:01:14.159> actually<00:01:14.460> gonna

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you how fast this guy's actually gonna

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.880 
you how fast this guy's actually gonna
go<00:01:14.850> he<00:01:15.390> should<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.720> moving<00:01:15.869> faster<00:01:16.619> than<00:01:16.830> the

chance of that actually happening

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.719 
chance of that actually happening
