with<00:02:56.629> the<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.769> arm<00:02:57.980> regardless<00:02:58.549> now<00:02:58.760> I<00:02:58.790> wished

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
with the the arm regardless now I wished

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.819 
with the the arm regardless now I wished
I<00:02:59.150> was<00:02:59.510> instead<00:02:59.750> of<00:02:59.840> being<00:03:00.019> purple<00:03:00.409> and<00:03:00.650> blue

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.830 
I was instead of being purple and blue
they<00:03:01.010> would<00:03:01.250> change<00:03:01.489> to<00:03:01.579> baby<00:03:01.970> blue<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.510> think

they would change to baby blue I think

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.390

that would be really really cool this is

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.559 
that would be really really cool this is
what<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.730> looks<00:03:04.879> like<00:03:05.000> with<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.269> lucky

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
what it looks like with the lucky

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.440 
what it looks like with the lucky
raspberry<00:03:06.079> I<00:03:06.859> wish<00:03:07.370> the<00:03:07.549> dots<00:03:07.819> would<00:03:08.060> be<00:03:08.209> baby

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
raspberry I wish the dots would be baby

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.670 
raspberry I wish the dots would be baby
blue<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:08.989> think<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.319> would<00:03:09.409> have<00:03:09.500> been<00:03:09.590> the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
blue I think that would have been the

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.619 
blue I think that would have been the
cool<00:03:09.859> with<00:03:10.129> changing<00:03:10.370> this<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.269> what<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.480> looks

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
cool with changing this is what it looks

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.300 
cool with changing this is what it looks
like<00:03:11.750> with<00:03:11.930> the<00:03:12.049> radiance<00:03:12.650> lava<00:03:13.069> dance

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
like with the radiance lava dance

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.160 
like with the radiance lava dance
machines<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.879> wish<00:03:14.269> those<00:03:14.540> bright<00:03:14.810> there<00:03:15.019> would

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
machines I wish those bright there would

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.449 
machines I wish those bright there would
be<00:03:15.200> instead<00:03:15.590> of<00:03:15.680> being<00:03:15.890> neon<00:03:16.159> green<00:03:16.340> they

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
be instead of being neon green they

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.699 
be instead of being neon green they
would<00:03:16.579> just<00:03:16.700> be<00:03:16.909> automatically<00:03:17.540> baby<00:03:17.900> blue<00:03:18.169> it

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
would just be automatically baby blue it

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.050 
would just be automatically baby blue it
would<00:03:18.829> be<00:03:18.980> really<00:03:19.340> hard<00:03:19.549> to<00:03:19.609> be<00:03:19.760> on<00:03:19.849> like<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
would be really hard to be on like a

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420 
would be really hard to be on like a
neon<00:03:20.269> baby<00:03:20.630> blue<00:03:20.900> color<00:03:21.139> coin<00:03:21.829> and<00:03:22.130> setting

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
neon baby blue color coin and setting

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.009 
neon baby blue color coin and setting
but<00:03:22.579> overall<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:23.209> like<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.660> way<00:03:23.750> it<00:03:23.870> looks

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
but overall I do like the way it looks

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.210 
but overall I do like the way it looks
like<00:03:24.169> with<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.410> mask<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.739> the<00:03:24.829> third<00:03:25.040> man

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
like with the mask of the third man

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.190 
like with the mask of the third man
that's<00:03:25.880> kind<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.269> like<00:03:26.419> my<00:03:26.569> favorite<00:03:26.840> run

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
that's kind of like my favorite run

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.520 
that's kind of like my favorite run
right<00:03:27.380> now<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:28.519> I<00:03:29.030> do<00:03:29.480> like<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.169> way<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.379> looks

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
right now and I do like the way it looks

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.440 
right now and I do like the way it looks
like<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:30.980> symbol<00:03:31.669> light<00:03:32.000> I<00:03:32.030> think

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
like with the symbol light I think

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.849 
like with the symbol light I think
that's<00:03:32.599> a<00:03:32.690> simple<00:03:33.049> light<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.410> don't<00:03:33.590> even<00:03:33.680> know

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859 
that's a simple light I don't even know

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.650 
that's a simple light I don't even know
how<00:03:33.980> to<00:03:34.010> pronounce<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.459> name<00:03:34.609> with<00:03:34.700> that<00:03:34.730> that

man<00:03:48.799> let's<00:03:49.190> move<00:03:49.280> over<00:03:49.430> to<00:03:49.579> the<00:03:49.699> Titan<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.629> is

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
man let's move over to the Titan this is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.750 
man let's move over to the Titan this is
what<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.959> Titan<00:03:51.290> looks<00:03:51.500> like<00:03:51.709> with<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.579> baby

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
what the Titan looks like with the baby

what the Titan looks like with the baby
blue<00:03:53.030> shader<00:03:53.359> now<00:03:53.629> we're<00:03:53.870> able<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.199> change

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
blue shader now we're able to change

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.869 
blue shader now we're able to change
helmets<00:03:54.889> I'm<00:03:55.069> gonna<00:03:55.250> show<00:03:55.340> you<00:03:55.430> guys<00:03:55.579> what<00:03:55.790> it

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
helmets I'm gonna show you guys what it

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.689 
helmets I'm gonna show you guys what it
looks<00:03:55.910> like<00:03:56.150> with<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.109> following<00:03:57.669> with<00:03:58.669> the

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:58.699 
looks like with the following with the

00:03:58.699 --> 00:04:00.339 
looks like with the following with the
following<00:03:59.150> units<00:03:59.449> so<00:03:59.569> let's<00:03:59.720> go<00:03:59.840> ahead<00:03:59.959> and

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
following units so let's go ahead and

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.979 
following units so let's go ahead and
start<00:04:00.620> with<00:04:00.859> the<00:04:01.010> helmet<00:04:01.370> part<00:04:01.720> first<00:04:02.720> of<00:04:02.870> the

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
start with the helmet part first of the

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.420 
start with the helmet part first of the
glasshouse<00:04:03.260> I<00:04:03.590> think<00:04:03.799> is<00:04:03.919> the<00:04:04.099> best-looking

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
glasshouse I think is the best-looking

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.670 
glasshouse I think is the best-looking
helmet<00:04:04.970> for<00:04:05.150> this<00:04:05.299> shader<00:04:05.599> it<00:04:06.199> just<00:04:06.440> matches

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
helmet for this shader it just matches

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.949 
helmet for this shader it just matches
so<00:04:07.099> perfectly<00:04:07.609> well<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.120> love<00:04:08.599> the<00:04:08.750> way<00:04:08.840> it

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
so perfectly well I love the way it

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:09.369 
so perfectly well I love the way it
looks

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
looks

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:11.439 
looks
very<00:04:09.949> very<00:04:10.129> cool<00:04:10.519> I<00:04:10.730> think<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.030> glass<00:04:11.239> house

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
very very cool I think the glass house

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:13.839 
very very cool I think the glass house
is<00:04:11.629> the<00:04:11.750> best<00:04:11.930> one<00:04:12.199> on<00:04:12.620> the<00:04:12.680> Titan<00:04:13.280> when<00:04:13.730> you

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
is the best one on the Titan when you

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:15.490 
is the best one on the Titan when you
have<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.120> equipped<00:04:14.510> it<00:04:14.750> just<00:04:15.079> matches<00:04:15.260> the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
have that equipped it just matches the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.909 
have that equipped it just matches the
sheeter

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
sheeter

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.589 
sheeter
this<00:04:16.310> one<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.609> wish<00:04:16.789> that<00:04:16.970> the<00:04:17.120> middle<00:04:17.419> portion

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
this one I wish that the middle portion

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:18.789 
this one I wish that the middle portion
that<00:04:17.930> little<00:04:18.079> middle<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.410> a<00:04:18.530> little<00:04:18.709> more

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
that little middle and a little more

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.250 
that little middle and a little more
purple<00:04:19.190> line<00:04:19.280> would<00:04:19.940> be<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.209> baby<00:04:20.690> blue<00:04:21.019> and

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
purple line would be a baby blue and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.440 
purple line would be a baby blue and
changed<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:21.979> wish<00:04:22.159> this<00:04:22.340> one<00:04:22.610> you<00:04:23.240> know<00:04:23.360> the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:23.450 
changed I wish this one you know the

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.630 
changed I wish this one you know the
dots<00:04:23.719> that<00:04:23.900> are<00:04:24.020> inside<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.590> LEDs<00:04:24.860> would<00:04:25.400> turn

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
dots that are inside the LEDs would turn

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.010 
dots that are inside the LEDs would turn
baby<00:04:25.880> blue<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.150> think<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.539> would<00:04:26.630> make<00:04:26.750> it
