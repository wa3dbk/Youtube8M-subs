frustrated and actually quit the game
and<00:01:53.520> then<00:01:54.000> took<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.180> right<00:01:54.390> back<00:01:54.600> off<00:01:54.810> because

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
and then took it right back off because

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then took it right back off because
there<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.290> no<00:01:55.560> way<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:55.799> can<00:01:56.159> actually<00:01:56.340> use

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
there was no way you can actually use

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.750 
there was no way you can actually use
the<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.120> ACOG<00:01:57.510> itself<00:01:57.870> in<00:01:57.990> my<00:01:58.080> opinion<00:01:58.380> with

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
the I the ACOG itself in my opinion with

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.020 
the I the ACOG itself in my opinion with
because<00:01:59.270> just<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.510> recoil<00:01:59.930> is<00:02:00.110> so<00:02:00.260> high

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
because just the recoil is so high

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.490 
because just the recoil is so high
sometimes<00:02:02.030> you<00:02:02.900> actually<00:02:03.080> run<00:02:03.350> that

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
sometimes you actually run that

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.770 
sometimes you actually run that
ammunition<00:02:03.800> I<00:02:04.220> did<00:02:04.460> i<00:02:04.580> do<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.790> quite<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.000> bit<00:02:05.060> i

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
ammunition I did i do it quite a bit i

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.780 
ammunition I did i do it quite a bit i
definitely<00:02:06.320> recommend<00:02:06.620> scavenger<00:02:07.550> if<00:02:07.700> you

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
definitely recommend scavenger if you

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.609 
definitely recommend scavenger if you
got<00:02:07.970> it<00:02:08.149> that's<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.810> only<00:02:09.050> way<00:02:09.200> that<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.590> can

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
got it that's the only way that you can

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.440 
got it that's the only way that you can
compensate<00:02:10.100> for<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.490> low<00:02:10.670> clips<00:02:11.090> i<00:02:11.240> mean<00:02:11.390> you

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
compensate for the low clips i mean you

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.990 
compensate for the low clips i mean you
only<00:02:11.570> get<00:02:11.720> 120<00:02:12.470> rounds<00:02:12.770> with<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.400> if

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
only get 120 rounds with this and if

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.430 
only get 120 rounds with this and if
you're<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.210> using<00:02:14.390> extended<00:02:14.930> mag<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.320> have

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
you're not using extended mag you have

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.930 
you're not using extended mag you have
to<00:02:15.560> reload<00:02:15.920> quite<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> bit<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.400> time<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.730> believe

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
to reload quite a bit of time to believe

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.690 
to reload quite a bit of time to believe
like<00:02:17.090> four<00:02:17.300> times<00:02:17.800> with<00:02:18.800> extended<00:02:19.340> mag<00:02:19.460> going

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
like four times with extended mag going

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.020 
like four times with extended mag going
at<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.850> Reno<00:02:20.090> twice<00:02:20.390> with<00:02:20.660> 60<00:02:20.990> rounds<00:02:22.030> living

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
at the Reno twice with 60 rounds living

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.690 
at the Reno twice with 60 rounds living
