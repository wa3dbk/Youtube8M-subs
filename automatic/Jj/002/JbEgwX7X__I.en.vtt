 don't just say for different wallets 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.269
 created a new tiguan not changed much 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.210
 the same proportions but the lines have become 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.460

 in Europe daytime running lights and most importantly 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.120
 tiguan began to look a little more expensive 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.860
 respectable just for decent

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.400
 maybe the whole family as well 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.720
 there is enough space for three in the back seat 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:14.170
 children therefore the client himself is found for 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.800

 to him 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.170
 tiguan though was not a legislator of the genre 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.420
 to Suvorov but on the other hand he took from 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
 competitors all the best and embodied 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.160
 in themselves and in the last generation just on 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.290
 everything turned into a sort of small 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.630
 touareg he is so solid even 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.010
 a little aggressive but compact 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.470
 to make it easy to move around 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.619

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:41.110
 did not he changed slightly in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.150
 the item got a new dashboard

 golf vi steering wheel 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.400
 from him is the big screen multimedia

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:56.950

 fleeting desire 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.210
 release the tie knot if outside and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.810
 tiguan is like a whole older brother 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.050
 Tuareg 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.640
 then inside it is closer to more budget and 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.990
 affordable models such as golf jetta 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.540
 take at least the steering wheel panel 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.780
 instruments center console all this 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.050
 reminds 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.850
 car golf 6 generation but on 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.040
 quality of materials did not save here 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.250
 softness and plastic says Katya blocks 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.560
 dashboard visor which 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.930
 literally bends under your fingers in 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.180
 ergonomics driver seat touareg we are not 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.090
 doubted because the school is nowhere 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.840
 getting rid of wide ranges of adjustments 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.819
 what's the steering wheel chair that allows 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.120
 quickly select the optimum fit 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:50.060
 moreover, with relatively compact 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.019
 iguana size provides enough 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.400
 space and amenities for rear passengers 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.130
 Volkswagen tiguan rear seats done 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.830
 would honor any family vein because 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.050
 that there is everything for family 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.760
 felt cozy and comfortable during 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.319
 first here are such folding tables in 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.640
 backside front seats 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.060
 second back sofa can 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.709
 adjust length 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.300
 increasing trunk volume but reducing 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.069
 with space for passengers and 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:20.630
 one more is the angle adjustment 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.810
 so you can choose either vertical 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.030
 landing either lower and in order to 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.540
 relax on the long road trunk 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.209
 nice addition to everyone else 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.920
 the dignity of the interior of its volume can 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:40.100
 vary from 407 rivers to 1500 10 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.430
 liters of which will be useful each 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.190
 liter we see the trunk rpats agent iguanas 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.730
 reigns full German corps 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.560
 and beat Roman speaking at the apparatus all 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.030
 begins with the organization of this very 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.460
 luggage space 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.500
 everything superfluous is hidden here such convenient 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.500
 closing below 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.070
 unfortunately not stored under the floor 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:08.300
 full reserve and only 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.890
 guess and have all sorts of nice little things 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.780
 like these hooks 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.020
 click here you can hang 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.630
 some kind of bag or package and push so 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.370
 can tie a rope and and 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.260
 fix heavy load trunk 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.840
 we have in hand tiguan with diesel power 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.490
 170 horses combination 7 speed 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.790
 dsg robot 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.680
 this gearbox has replaced 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:37.370
 traditional torque converter nai 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.420
 powertrain robot is great especially in 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.090
 sport mode 

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.430
 fast transfer switch keeps 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.500
 turn course that rely on and 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:48.530
 reliably high-torque motor and a diesel 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.960
 or gasoline and gearbox which 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.970
 thinks before you can understand 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.490
 when you go crossover 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.050
 how do you your eyes stop 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:02.090
 notice fossa speed bumps 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:05.030
 tram tracks everything that is normal 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.550
 the car would normally try to play and here 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.230
 ap cube suspension worked and drove 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.750
 further though actually 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.200
 suspension tiguan u days suv a 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:18.080
 passenger and sharpened to ride in fact 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.410
 by people they are to hard off-road on 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.480
 any speed tiguan remains obedient 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.900
 and understandable on the steering wheel 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:31.150
 intelligible effort by straight boom thread 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:34.250
 shallow high-speed cornering and stable 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:36.830
 sound insulation sleep even at the limit 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.940
 you can communicate without increasing speed 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:42.880
 voices by the way some of the tests we conducted 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.230
 on the asphalt part on easy off-road 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.870
 here is a great way to check 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.520
 full wheel drive won like 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.050
 before 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.430
 automatically connected starts with 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:54.680
 places tiguan 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:56.990
 preload when the rear wheels 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.800
 served 10 percent of torque 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:03.650
 enough to drive front wheels 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.540
 scroll 5 degrees to empathetic 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.810
 the electronics immediately connected 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:12.130
 rear axle as before tiguan 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.510
 exists in two forms of road and 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:17.120
 off road they differ greatly 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.600
 account only front bumpers to 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.890
 advanced electronics features 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.230
 principle imitates electronics well 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.220
 operation of differential locks 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.600
 braking wheels sticking 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.550
 she is generally like this and off road 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.310
 the test is very harmful to the transmission 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.320
 tiguan especially for ds jim grip 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.380
 slips and wear much 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.430
 more intense therefore better of course so 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:42.940
 things not winter cloning operation 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:44.090
 passed some mistakes successfully 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.150
 corrected 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.950
 and ended up getting quite 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.540
 balanced crossover with excellent 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:56.830
 manageable on asphalt and moderate 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.830
 off-road capability
