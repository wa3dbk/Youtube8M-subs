00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.750
 my good 15 years is already 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.670
 we say happy birthday 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.590
 rollercoaster tycoon the legendary 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.990
 building game is celebrating this year 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.710
 anniversary and we we congratulate 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.050
 to congratulate 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.760
 especially chris hoy who made it 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.619
 after which 100,000 magath already had 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.300
 knocked on anyone at all 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.340
 find this ingenious game 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 has funded and helped it in 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 to put the shelves what strange enough 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.759
 is a few years before with so 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 yes, the 90s has peter moll end 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.360
 with 4 park already proved that it is a 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.340
 Demand indicates such construction 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.840
 play and the course has its own direction 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.180
 all alone this wonderful game 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.190
 programmed only supported by 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 one of a graphic artist at the other 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.379
 Everything was handmade and that was the case 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 successful that deals with total 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.149
 five million copies so well 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.100
 That's easily sold for three years 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.989
 later came the follower 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.190
 but you do not care about this 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.320
 the first look that I'm really there 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.420
 what has done 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.960
 the resolution has increased a bit 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.030
 larger resolutions there are additional ones 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.820
 roller coasters even more sophisticated construction 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.439
 Options The cards are bigger though 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.750
 otherwise it is of course the same 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.759
 later what makes you build 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.049
 There's no roller coaster at all 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.700
 that actually improves in comparison 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.920
 for the first part for me that always works 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
 still a little bit chubby 40 has 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.369
 It did not take forever until you had one 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.140
 beautiful train had timed together yes 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.200
 but that was just the joke 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.150
 to play because you really are with 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.820
 corkscrew years and loopings and 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.920
 curves really build exactly 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.150
 was what in reality is also to 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.729
 depending on have just the 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.799
 centrifugal forces and speeds 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.700
 the track develops and does that 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.470
 actually the attraction of rollercoaster 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.369
 tycoon especially since you too 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.420
 can build underground and even and 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 waters through it already 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.159
 really fascinating 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.960
 There were also different theme worlds in 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.509
 their parks, for example, an animal 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.090
 seen because here you could do Middle Ages 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.069
 the bees right four parks 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.060
 in the western countries, that's yes 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:16.110
 even so it's different 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:18.620
 thematic groups are jÃ¶rg scenario as 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620
 belongs 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.120
 If that's not enough, he will 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.069
 could also create scenarios himself 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.130
 assemble because there was indeed a 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:32.780
 really great scenario editor important of 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.180
 was also relatively powerful you could 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.370
 unbelievably much adjust so with 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.550
 which start conditions were there 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.709
 wants to get started with difficulty levels 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.750
 the landscape looks like something already 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.290
 present and of course the game goals 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.540
 itself just as easy to use 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.430
 yourself like the real game and 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.400
 There was, of course, a huge one 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.569
 Selection of challenging signals 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.720
 Just download yourself on the net 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.180
 could and to keep track of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.250
 Why does the park work or not ? 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.049
 Also, there were not tons of 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.760
 statistics a window you could 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.040
 actually full to full screen 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.540
 almost 100 cinemas and yes again in its 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.849
 really milk every single one 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.040
 Visitors to every old employee each 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.959
 ground-click and watch a whether 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.870
 Visitors for example had thirst or 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.920
 But something in the purse had to on 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.920
 to spend something 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.010
 yes and then everything has changed with 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.230
 rollercoaster tycoon 3 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.049
 really there was really a break for 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.570
 instead of third league 2d graphics there were in 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:37.740
 the case the 3d graphics and that was too 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.510
 especially pretty 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.670
 that had a real 3d engine as well 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.600
 Regards only has advisory function 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.640
 as well as not yourself anymore 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.569
 programmed that would be asking too much 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.490
 from a single person and why it 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.110
 was very pretty 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.090
 also the day and night you changed 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.790
 then look at it in time then so 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.510
 really spectacular super lighting effects 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.520
 So really beautiful to look at and 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.310
 there were now animals correctly in the 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.560
 additional packages you could buy the 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.489
 here for example the option of a picture 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.790
 to build a park 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.900
 It was also a real innovation back then 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.160
 menus there were still were 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.190
 kept a little smaller this time 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.169
 but actually less in the 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.640
 mass you want to say that the 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.450
 Construction of the roller coasters clear 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:28.360
 Fuller was just a real 3D perspective 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.410
 that much more effort is needed 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.790
 and there were also addons you could get 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.889
 including both again 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.900
 teams are really building real ones 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:40.120
 water parks but the real thing 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.340
 highlight of rollercoaster tycoon 3 was 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.950
 these costs would come from the 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.479
 ego-perspective you could just with the 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.010
 ride along 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:51.130
 we are just here in one 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.440
 take handmade roller coaster place 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.539
 and then look how that feels and 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.380
 under which sits the bag hidden 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.530
 exactly 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.060
 yes 15 years are over we work 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.039
 normal would be birthday rollercoaster 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.650
 tycoon and we look forward to the 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.900
 fourth part of the first for tablets 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.880
 comes for ipad among other things though 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.010
 allegedly also a correct pc version 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:16.350
 and of course we hope for one 

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.350
 really great complex strategy games
