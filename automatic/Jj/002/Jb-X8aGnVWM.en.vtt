00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.930
 and what happens youtube people today os 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:12.960
 I bring a video tutorial of how we are going to 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:15.670
 prepare this mazda rx7 efe of 2002 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.000
 to make trees the configuration of 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:21.530
 gearbox and suspension rest of us 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.250
 with that 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.270
 Well, here I bring you the 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:32.419
 following suspension settings 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:37.940
 height adjustment 84 front 86 back 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:41.090
 index springs 5 74 forward 51 54 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.880
 back compression cushion 5 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.489
 forward 5 back cushion extension 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.000
 6 front 7 back bars 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:55.430
 stabilizers 66 front and rear 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.190
 Drop angle 0.2 forward 10 back 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.040
 before eating people and doing 100 of the 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:06.440
 1 095 behind brakes 55 gearbox 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.990
 here we are simply going to put the 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.200
 maximum speed 250 kilometers per 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.200
 hour 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.300
 in transmission the initial torque we go to 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.330
 put at 45 the sensitivity of steel to 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.240
 46 and sensitivity brake 20 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.700
 I think it 's the one that's coming 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.270
 in potentiality we put everything to the maximum 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.729
 do not go to you and expose everything and if 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.900
 you put nitro you can put a hundred 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.050
 one hundred power 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.830
 in body he put weight of the 350 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.000
 kilos and I 've put it at 40 percent 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:47.460
 and well this is all in theory 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.460
 from reality to work let's try it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.510
 Well, here we are in the circuit 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.680
 of your Cuba 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.680
 we are going to give him cane 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.000
 with little volume 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.850
 good and if you liked this video
