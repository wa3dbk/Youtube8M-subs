00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.240
 hi this is exaggerated xo-airways point fr 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.099
 today a little tutorial for the 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.740
 replacing the battery on the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.630
 macbook pro 13 inches it works 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.040
 also for the 15 and the 17 that's the 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.020
 even about the same way 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.430
 today I 'm doing it on the 13th 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.260
 inch you'll see it's rather 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.820
 simple it really takes against 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.010
 follow all the steps well and have 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.660
 the right tools we will start with 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.870
 tooling it will take us a black 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.550
 stick in they really have you can 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.620
 find it almost everywhere 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.150
 that's where it's going to hold a little more 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.879
 complicated we will need a screwdriver 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.430
 trilobed I'll show you there 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.250
 the impression that it gives is a y 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.159
 if he arrives on the focus here is 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.670
 we need this model and that's 1 y 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.640
 which is called there a sense screwdriver there in 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.070
 do you can not disassemble the battery 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 and we 're going to need a cruciform a 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.950
 double zero 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.049
 traditional philips so we're going 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.320
 to start I have already removed up levis 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.150
 I have already dismounted them in fact always 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.330
 watch the three screws here 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.860
 on that side that are longer 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.870
 see who are screws a little bit more 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
 long 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.510
 so we pay attention to these 3 6 1 that's 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.560
 really of the three here the rest is 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.850
 So there like I had started after 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 unscrewed to save time 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.109
 here and there we will lift our hood 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:00.140
 it's always easier to take it 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:03.350
 here and here is the battery is this 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.119
 together too so she is held by 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.119
 a connector that is here all 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.910
 simply with the nylon one comes 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.799
 remove and with his fingers if there 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.290
 come 

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:17.720
 the connector here is it 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.660
 the computer does not have any more two 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.069
 batteries we will find just screw 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.959
 one that is here 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.040
 we will try to make a close up in 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.690
 our center it gets better 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:34.640
 here we are actually going to find a screw 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:39.920
 here on the corner and a vi right here you 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:46.030
 simply take the trilobate then 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.030
 to see her tight here is 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.810
 and here's be careful there is a 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.360
 longer model of screw is a model 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.530
 shortest the longest go y if the most 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.290
 what's going on here so here is right after 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.840
 the nylon tool there is the only one 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.280
 security system 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.870
 then you have to come and take it off and get 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.850
 take off easily jars the mans I 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.239
 take by the connector I get 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.910
 help and see the battery in fact 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.769
 take off like this it is important not to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.890
 press them have no shots 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.269
 screwdriver no tutor things like that 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.100
 because you have them directly 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.560
 cells that are there electrolytes 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.040
 so you can ruined it and it can be 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.470
 dangerous 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.720
 so really take it gently without 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.480
 force here I have no other models 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.760
 as I could do on the iphone 4 and 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.250
 4s whose germs is simply the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.330
 battery that I have you can find 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.799
 at brico mac and fix it a site 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.569
 American I will put goods in 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.790
 below 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.769
 here we come then before we but 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.000
 novice 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.600
 often there is a sticker that is 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.630
 provided you put back nothing really 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.630
 complicated but novice 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:29.770
 this is where have tightened moderately then the 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.770
 time you have to find the hole 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.300
 so here we put everything at 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.850
 tights and we come back is another 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.670
 power connector so there our 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.020
 battery and reattach we see it is 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.640
 well put was soon going to its location 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.530
 did not especially force for 

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:56.180
 the hour m we will recover 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:05:01.990
 as we were we put our lid back 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:05.090
 hop here you can see 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:10.669
 in general I therefore advise started to 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:13.430
 put the vices of the bottom the big ones 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:17.780
 cities that are here like this 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:22.300
 takes a bribe to be deceived tac and 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.300
 another third who are here right here 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:33.169
 Here we put his vices quietly 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:54.220
 avoid losing lilies here I put 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.600
 not everything it was just to show you 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.630
 to check what you can do 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.020
 seeing a witness here see the battery 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:05.110
 is well recognized and we will check if 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:11.500
 it works well just by 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:13.660
 starting with the button we hear the 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.900
 start noise there it is good 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:18.880
 the internet is ready this was a 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.480
