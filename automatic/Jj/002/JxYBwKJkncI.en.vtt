00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.069 
if you can see this the tents attaches
to<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:54.990> pole<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.500> these<00:01:55.649> hooks<00:01:56.280> here<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
to the pole on these hooks here and

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.780 
to the pole on these hooks here and
poles<00:01:58.079> stick<00:01:58.320> out<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.740> good<00:01:58.950> hand<00:01:59.219> with<00:01:59.369> out

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
poles stick out a good hand with out

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.280 
poles stick out a good hand with out
there<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> rain<00:02:00.570> fly<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:00.960> sits<00:02:01.200> on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
there and then the rain fly just sits on

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.060 
there and then the rain fly just sits on
the<00:02:01.409> pole<00:02:02.149> stakes<00:02:03.149> in<00:02:03.360> at<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.570> bottom<00:02:03.770> so<00:02:04.770> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
the pole stakes in at the bottom so the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.330 
the pole stakes in at the bottom so the
fly<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.850> actually<00:02:06.240> touching<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:07.069> tent<00:02:08.069> at

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
fly is not actually touching the tent at

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.559 
fly is not actually touching the tent at
all<00:02:08.489> which<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:10.039> awesome<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.569> rainstorms

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
all which is awesome for rainstorms

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.860 
all which is awesome for rainstorms
whatever<00:02:12.810> because<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.470> don't<00:02:13.620> get

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
whatever because you don't get

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.970 
whatever because you don't get
at<00:02:13.989> all<00:02:14.110> I've<00:02:14.680> been<00:02:14.739> in<00:02:15.190> some<00:02:16.150> pretty<00:02:16.450> bad

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
at all I've been in some pretty bad

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.699 
at all I've been in some pretty bad
rainstorms<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.159> wind<00:02:18.400> storms<00:02:18.909> and

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
rainstorms and wind storms and

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.110 
rainstorms and wind storms and
especially<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> Midwest<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.670> didn't<00:02:21.940> I

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
especially in the Midwest and I didn't I

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.649 
especially in the Midwest and I didn't I
wasn't<00:02:22.720> wet<00:02:22.959> at<00:02:23.110> all<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:23.590> also<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.790> ground

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
wasn't wet at all I also have the ground

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.509 
wasn't wet at all I also have the ground
cloth<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.379> goes<00:02:26.830> right<00:02:27.069> into<00:02:27.250> the

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
cloth that just goes right into the

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:33.140 
cloth that just goes right into the
poles<00:02:28.980> fits<00:02:29.980> nicely<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:32.140> there<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.860> have<00:02:32.920> it

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
poles fits nicely so there you have it

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.199 
poles fits nicely so there you have it
he<00:02:34.150> said<00:02:34.450> I<00:02:34.480> wouldn't<00:02:34.840> recommend<00:02:35.079> it<00:02:35.349> for

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
he said I wouldn't recommend it for

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.399 
he said I wouldn't recommend it for
lightweight<00:02:37.209> backpacking<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.989> pretty

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
lightweight backpacking it's pretty

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.759 
lightweight backpacking it's pretty
heavy<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.769> doesn't<00:02:39.670> pack<00:02:39.849> up<00:02:40.030> terribly<00:02:40.329> small

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
heavy and doesn't pack up terribly small

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.470 
heavy and doesn't pack up terribly small
but<00:02:41.769> for<00:02:42.069> what<00:02:42.159> I'm<00:02:42.280> doing<00:02:42.310> I'm<00:02:42.790> quite

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
but for what I'm doing I'm quite

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.060 
but for what I'm doing I'm quite
satisfied<00:02:43.750> with<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.409> very<00:02:44.760> much<00:02:45.760> so
