00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:39.970
 and let's see inside the house 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.610
 as you have seen before I made a 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.020
 tutorial to teach how to build this 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.299
 house that you have asked me many times 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.520
 that he does then is divided into three 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.100
 parts the first is to build the part 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.500
 front the second back the third 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.810
 interior so I'll leave you here 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.689
 link again so you keep building 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.490
 the idea and sectorial and if you get lazy 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.760
 build it so you can download it as 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.620
 forever 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.370
 well we come here we have the 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.650
 dinning room 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.110
 we have here the table with the chairs and 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.720
 others as is usually three 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.680
 Here we have a small room with the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.680
 tele and all this 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.690
 here there would be a a mini terrace 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.640
 to me 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.220
 if we come around here we have a piano 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.400
 and here the kitchen 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 what would we have garbage and everything 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.480
 here to shoot down 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.220
 is sideburns down the garbage and by 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.810
 here 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.860
 we would have sinks 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.050
 the ace 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.800
 remarkable and more over here we have the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.930
 portal to the missned but I hope not 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.620
 confuse me and here we would have a 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.590
 interior office 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.980
 here with little height and here with more 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.700
 and here would be the bathrooms for 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.599
 the boys star pool 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.599
 I think the girls 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.630
 now let's go to the other talks about the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.630
 home 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.600
 here we would have a small leisure area 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.020
 of leisure with this casino table I do not know 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.930
 what is it called besides the idea is called 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.520
 here would be the pool table here there was 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.520
 a stereo with the discs 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.540
 and now it is I do not know why but I 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:43.100
 beginners here a small room with 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.100
 another giant TV the table 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.000
 some sofas and down here we would have 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.000
 a tiny basement 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.470
 and so we would go up 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.390
 we went up here we have a terrace 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.470
 I do not see that you were our 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.470
 cultures of the house and the sea 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.990
 up here we would have these in this 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:12.090
 terrace from here we could go down here 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.090
 enter and start the house 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.570
 and here there would be two rooms the 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.570
 first is 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.710
 and the second these are all similar 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.919
 well there the laptop in the beds and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.919
 the rest 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.010
 it is believed for this bed 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:43.130
 passionate is the text that is wrong 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:45.820
 done as always these cancers and 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.820
 others are writing 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.850
 we could be pulling light from more bathrooms 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:57.370
 here with the fight also in that case the 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:01.469
 water is the same as using phoenix here 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.469
 also here the toilet 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.650
 with this that is upside down also 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:15.040
 now the toilet 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:17.910
 but here is another terrace that gives the 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.910
 back of the house 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:25.320
 and around here we will be in this terrace 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.570
 here 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.050
 and we could come here and go to the other 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.050
 side of the house 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:38.569
 and there would be the other wing of the house 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:42.150
 we will have here a terrace with some 

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:44.630
 hammocks here this to sit and such 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.630
 i 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.100
 here would be the stairs for 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:53.150
 go down 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.150
 we would be down 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.889
 and you can go up here 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.630
 we would have another floor 

00:05:58.889 --> 00:06:03.340
 with another room 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.930
 that would be the room with the beds 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.570
 and else 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.180
 and here we would have a terrace the most 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.500
 high 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.500
 stay to the rear too 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:19.809
 here we would have a library with the 

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:19.809
 typical enchantment tables here 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.880
 and here are some desks and besides 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.770
 to work 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.550
 if we go up here we have a super 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:31.380
 terrace here 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.380
 with some hammocks tables 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.740
 and if it is not around here we can see the sea 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.910
 we see the sea and the whole house 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.630
 and 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.000
 let's leave again 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.880
 and we come for this bridge that also 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.900
 have a rise 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.610
 and here there would be another 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.610
 we can go up the bridge over here 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.480
 and we would have a room here 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.200
 and here we would have two more 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.060
 equal rooms 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.270

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:18.310
 home you know you have the link to 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:21.520
 tutorial to build it in the 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:24.770
 description are the three inner parts 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.169
 and the front and back 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.770
 and you have the link to download it as 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:34.530
 always in case you do not want to do it 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:34.530
 and well this is all until another goodbye
