he implied that the big toilet stronger

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.330 
he implied that the big toilet stronger
because<00:04:16.109> their<00:04:16.410> bottom<00:04:16.739> teams<00:04:16.979> are<00:04:17.160> better

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340

don't play everybody enough in the big
12<00:04:24.720> or<00:04:25.200> whatever<00:04:25.560> it<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.000> so<00:04:27.000> i<00:04:27.060> don't

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
12 or whatever it is and so i don't

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.640 
12 or whatever it is and so i don't
really<00:04:27.300> know<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.600> much<00:04:27.810> about<00:04:27.960> their<00:04:28.440> league

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
really know that much about their league

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.050 
really know that much about their league
we<00:04:28.889> have<00:04:28.919> a<00:04:29.070> lot<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.250> respect<00:04:29.669> for<00:04:29.820> what<00:04:29.940> they

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
we have a lot of respect for what they

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.480 
we have a lot of respect for what they
do<00:04:30.120> it<00:04:30.330> Oklahoma<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.590> I<00:04:31.950> really<00:04:32.220> don't<00:04:32.370> think

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
do it Oklahoma and I really don't think

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.190 
do it Oklahoma and I really don't think
that<00:04:32.729> people<00:04:33.150> that<00:04:33.270> don't<00:04:33.450> plan<00:04:33.690> our<00:04:33.930> league

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
that people that don't plan our league

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.050 
that people that don't plan our league
really<00:04:34.800> don't<00:04:35.010> understand<00:04:35.490> the<00:04:35.610> quality<00:04:35.820> of

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
really don't understand the quality of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.450 
really don't understand the quality of
our<00:04:36.240> league<00:04:36.479> from<00:04:36.660> top<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.930> bottom<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.650> I<00:04:37.919> think

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
our league from top to bottom so I think

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.580 
our league from top to bottom so I think
there's<00:04:38.790> probably<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.330> lot<00:04:39.479> of<00:04:39.660> you<00:04:40.470> no

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
there's probably a lot of you no

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.740 
there's probably a lot of you no
animosity<00:04:41.100> out<00:04:41.550> there<00:04:41.760> because<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.300> success

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
animosity out there because the success

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.990 
animosity out there because the success
that<00:04:42.780> we<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.260> in<00:04:43.380> our<00:04:43.500> league<00:04:43.740> but<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.310> think

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
that we have in our league but I think

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.240 
that we have in our league but I think
that<00:04:45.060> kind<00:04:45.419> of<00:04:45.540> goes<00:04:46.080> with<00:04:46.320> the<00:04:46.350> territory<00:04:46.440> and

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
that kind of goes with the territory and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.510 
that kind of goes with the territory and
we<00:04:48.060> can<00:04:48.240> I<00:04:48.860> understand<00:04:49.860> that<00:04:50.100> but<00:04:50.250> we

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
we can I understand that but we

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.190 
we can I understand that but we
certainly<00:04:50.729> respect<00:04:51.389> you<00:04:51.750> know<00:04:51.870> the<00:04:51.990> great
