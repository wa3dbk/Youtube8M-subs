00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:10.309
 We continue to make bread dough is our step 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:16.109
 which stood overnight on the battery 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:18.609
 in the lukewarm here she came up so now 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:23.739
 we will knead 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:40.960
 trail so i need here 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:48.040
 400 gr 130 water add 300 grams of flour 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.040
 and 400 ready stupidly 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.210
 all this is now necessary 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.800
 good deputy so here 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:24.450
 kneaded dough now need it 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:35.510
 cover and leave to insist well 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.510
 somewhere for an hour forty well an hour has passed 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:46.630
 knead dough salt to 1 tea 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:52.760
 a spoon now it's all ok 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:57.790
 knead and leave to rest somewhere else 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:02:03.680
 for half an hour as well, that's got past 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:10.489
 the amount is dissolved and I think the dough 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:17.050
 beginning to approach so now we need 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:30.350
 and trumpet a little desk jobs with 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:32.200
 flour put here our dough so here 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.900
 our dough 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:41.080
 it's already on steel now we need it 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.220
 make shape make with it 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.569
 loaf of bread 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:53.200
 which we want i use the tool 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:55.209
 this is called a spatula floor of three 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.799
 completely ordinary building 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:04.510
 spars in the kitchen still needed there 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:10.349
 special traits try to find the difference 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:13.120
 between the building and the kitchen 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.790
 Basically no there is no that clip I 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.860
 I make such an envelope and I 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.500
 add up 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:25.540
 what is our need for 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:29.980
 our dough has already begun to come up and in 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:36.609
 the result of life here those 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:39.910
 the most bacteria that were leaven in 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.910
 our dough appears inside the dough floor 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.170
 bubbles appear you here they look 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:49.410
 have it there is a bubble this time 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.840
 accumulated it 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.740
 the subject of our life 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.740
 microorganisms 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:01.670
 so here if after here it is small 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:09.019
 proofing here they can see bubbles 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:10.340
 he's on top here and don't fold or not 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:15.669
 get sick and dough 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:16.870
 then the bread on your bubbles will turn out 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.079
 large 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:27.770
 big bubble and stand will be big 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:29.990
 there will be cancer and so that I don't have them 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.720
 I apply this method here 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:37.660
 folding dough to everyone now we 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.990
 we put in the form 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:05:01.660
 this trace we need this dough to us 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:05:07.120
 need to cover further not so here they are 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:10.099
 4 forms of mine they get upset now 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:13.639
 infuse they will now 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:16.460
 about half an hour after half an hour I am a couple 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.110
 cartoon forms a couple of blanks clean in 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.039
 fridge 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:24.169
 why because four loaves 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.740
 simultaneously from the liver and mouth and here they are 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:30.080
 children will start to rebuild 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.889
 it is already too bad to have 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:37.699
 the moment to which she approached them as much as possible 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.860
 dough and not yet started to fall because 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.860
 when it stops and begins to fall
