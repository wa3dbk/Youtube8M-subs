00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:16.289
 So hajdu review of the sony nex-5n camera 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.279
 I have my phone today 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.060
 to get 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 that is the objective 18 to 55 mm and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.289
 I really missed a zoom 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.599
 that they are closer to the things 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.610
 come to the comparison and how this is here 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 is mounted you want to you the times 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.320
 here I have and here I have here 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:43.469
 my scales brought with us, too 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:48.809
 Let's see what the camera with the 18th 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:52.070
 up to 55 mm zoom lens weight the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:55.170
 The thing is called at 467 grams 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 then I can remove that objectively 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:05.330
 We will do that through the first 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.360
 let's show it that 's 55 to 210 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 tele plans before 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:17.310
 that means you can according to the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.520
 Objective extend very handy very 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.490
 compact is well in the hand we have 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.030
 we have no metal structure on the lens 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.860
 here but a rubberized structure for 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.020
 But turning is very handy so that 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:40.829
 There is no difference so compact here 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:45.290
 unscrew the sun visor 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.290
 Of course, a slightly longer pipe 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:18.910
 Of course we see ours very well 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:20.110
 aps-c ship that's what you see 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.940
 Of course, that's quite another 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 House number 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.650
 You can keep it that way accordingly 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.090
 hard to attack you will be far too much 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.890
 you really have to wiggle 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.630
 keep compact with your left hand here 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.540
 Let's get in touch with where we are 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:42.340
 lie now 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 ok at 600 calls 600 grams 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.360
 that means we have 120 grams 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.860
 about more 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.410
 but I think in comparison to one 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.930
 big barrier flex is that still 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:01.269
 We are very good at weight 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:05.140
 show that means you can do that 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:11.070
 extend accordingly to 210 full 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:15.540
 lengthen while eating the whole thing is 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:20.130
 yes me 14 centimeters with objective 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.430
 extended state then it is 18 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:28.660
 about and for comparison we can 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.570
 here the 1855 millimeter objective times 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.290
 show that yes of course already 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.290
 smaller and more compact 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.390
 Well then I'll go to the 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.959
 go hunting and little video or 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:51.630
 for the first time to show you one 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:54.930
 bright lens 45 63 and there 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.160
 let's see if that's enough and 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.160
 what the sum can really do
