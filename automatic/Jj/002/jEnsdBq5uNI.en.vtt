00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
go back into game setup and you want to

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.950 
go back into game setup and you want to
make<00:02:02.340> sure<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.640> care<00:02:02.820> class<00:02:03.350> it

CAIR class is on any but for some reason
they<00:02:08.860> always<00:02:09.069> stay<00:02:09.459> on<00:02:09.700> s<00:02:10.060> so<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:10.750> you<00:02:10.959> do<00:02:11.170> is

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440

car brand you want I'll just use Ferrari

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.229 
car brand you want I'll just use Ferrari
here<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.490> can<00:02:18.610> go<00:02:18.700> ahead<00:02:18.819> and<00:02:19.090> use<00:02:20.050> as

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
here and you can go ahead and use as

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.280 
here and you can go ahead and use as
fast<00:02:22.239> for<00:02:22.569> care<00:02:22.750> as<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.900> want

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
so I'll just use this f1 Ferrari or not

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.000 
so I'll just use this f1 Ferrari or not
it's<00:02:26.260> our<00:02:26.739> one<00:02:27.069> time<00:02:28.380> and<00:02:30.300> now<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.860> an

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
it's our one time and now you have an

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.010 
it's our one time and now you have an
instant<00:02:33.400> advantage<00:02:33.790> over<00:02:33.940> them<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.750> now<00:02:34.840> in

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
instant advantage over them but now in

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.390 
instant advantage over them but now in
the<00:02:35.140> game<00:02:35.290> we<00:02:35.500> have<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> little<00:02:35.920> bit<00:02:36.069> more<00:02:36.250> of<00:02:36.340> an

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the game we have a little bit more of an

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.750 
the game we have a little bit more of an
advantage<00:02:36.700> than<00:02:37.120> just<00:02:37.540> speed<00:02:38.519> we're<00:02:39.519> gonna

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
advantage than just speed we're gonna

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.479 
advantage than just speed we're gonna
have<00:02:40.560> quite<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> bit<00:02:41.830> actually<00:02:41.980> on<00:02:44.850> sneakiness

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
have quite a bit actually on sneakiness

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.280 
have quite a bit actually on sneakiness
so<00:02:48.489> basically<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.390> map<00:02:49.600> is<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.019> one<00:02:50.140> big

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
so basically this map is just one big

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.770 
so basically this map is just one big
square<00:02:50.590> we're<00:02:51.220> one<00:02:51.430> big<00:02:51.580> rectangle<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.300> you

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
square we're one big rectangle and you

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.970 
square we're one big rectangle and you
go<00:02:52.930> around<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.290> whole<00:02:53.440> way<00:02:53.530> out<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.830> outside

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
go around the whole way out the outside

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.330 
go around the whole way out the outside
but<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:55.420> inside<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:56.200> rectangle<00:02:56.830> there<00:02:57.190> is<00:02:57.310> a

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
but the inside the rectangle there is a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.070 
but the inside the rectangle there is a
little<00:02:57.610> smaller<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> can<00:02:58.930> go

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
little smaller one that you can go

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.229 
little smaller one that you can go
around<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.680> still<00:02:59.860> counts<00:03:00.220> as<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.370> lap<00:03:00.580> so

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
around and it still counts as a lap so

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.300 
around and it still counts as a lap so
you're<00:03:01.480> doing<00:03:01.720> quite<00:03:02.050> a<00:03:02.110> shorter<00:03:02.709> lap<00:03:02.890> when

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
you're doing quite a shorter lap when

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.830 
you're doing quite a shorter lap when
you're<00:03:03.459> following<00:03:03.670> this<00:03:03.970> one<00:03:04.209> so<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.690> don't

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
you're following this one so you don't

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.449 
you're following this one so you don't
need<00:03:04.989> to<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.200> as<00:03:05.350> good<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.680> a<00:03:05.739> driver<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.250> get<00:03:06.340> as

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
need to be as good of a driver to get as

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.070 
need to be as good of a driver to get as
much<00:03:06.580> XP<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.269> because<00:03:07.930> they're

just<00:03:53.849> caught<00:03:54.090> up<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.360> them<00:03:54.739> now<00:03:55.800> yep<00:03:56.250> that

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
just caught up with them now yep that

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.059 
just caught up with them now yep that
probably<00:03:56.880> just<00:03:57.060> too<00:03:57.209> because<00:03:57.390> then<00:03:57.860> they<00:03:58.860> have

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
probably just too because then they have

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.210 
probably just too because then they have
a<00:03:59.100> slower<00:03:59.850> parents<00:04:00.330> book<00:04:00.560> now<00:04:01.560> as<00:04:01.739> you<00:04:01.890> can<00:04:01.980> see

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
a slower parents book now as you can see

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.100 
a slower parents book now as you can see
you<00:04:03.090> know<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.360> really<00:04:03.510> working<00:04:03.780> to<00:04:03.989> my

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you know it's really working to my

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.600 
you know it's really working to my
advantage<00:04:04.140> now<00:04:04.709> because<00:04:04.980> I'm<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> mile<00:04:05.459> ahead

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
advantage now because I'm a mile ahead

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.640 
advantage now because I'm a mile ahead
of<00:04:05.730> them<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.150> I'm<00:04:06.780> doing<00:04:06.959> quite<00:04:07.140> short<00:04:07.410> laps

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
of them and I'm doing quite short laps

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.470 
of them and I'm doing quite short laps
and<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.160> see<00:04:08.310> the<00:04:08.519> lap<00:04:08.670> counter<00:04:09.120> there

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
and you can see the lap counter there

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.140 
and you can see the lap counter there
it<00:04:09.540> has<00:04:09.780> counted<00:04:10.230> as<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.410> full<00:04:10.680> lap<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.150> they

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
it has counted as a full lap and they

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.300 
it has counted as a full lap and they
currently<00:04:12.330> patch<00:04:12.750> that<00:04:13.050> because<00:04:13.440> you<00:04:13.980> know<00:04:14.100> if

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
currently patch that because you know if

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.670 
currently patch that because you know if
you<00:04:14.600> what<00:04:15.600> they<00:04:15.810> do<00:04:15.870> win<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.620> game<00:04:16.919> is<00:04:18.410> in<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
you what they do win the game is in the

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.879 
you what they do win the game is in the
game<00:04:20.010> when<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.030> go<00:04:21.180> around<00:04:21.299> a<00:04:21.780> lap<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.500> counts

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
game when you go around a lap it counts

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.100 
game when you go around a lap it counts
as<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.070> lap<00:04:23.220> because<00:04:24.030> you've<00:04:24.180> got<00:04:24.750> around<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
as a lap because you've got around the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.010 
as a lap because you've got around the
whole<00:04:25.260> track<00:04:25.590> you<00:04:26.520> can't<00:04:26.820> really<00:04:27.090> detect<00:04:27.690> if

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
whole track you can't really detect if

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.890 
whole track you can't really detect if
you've<00:04:28.200> got<00:04:28.470> around<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.850> inside<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.630> track

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
you've got around the inside the track

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.830 
you've got around the inside the track
and<00:04:31.139> that's<00:04:31.770> why<00:04:32.040> this<00:04:32.220> track<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.910> really<00:04:33.510> the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
and that's why this track is really the

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.930 
and that's why this track is really the
next<00:04:34.200> one<00:04:34.410> some<00:04:35.100> other<00:04:35.220> tracks<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.669> can<00:04:35.820> do

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
next one some other tracks you can do

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.640 
next one some other tracks you can do
like<00:04:36.120> shortcuts<00:04:36.660> and<00:04:36.810> stuff<00:04:37.020> but<00:04:37.260> they're<00:04:37.500> not

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
like shortcuts and stuff but they're not

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.000 
like shortcuts and stuff but they're not
as<00:04:37.770> good<00:04:38.479> but<00:04:39.479> I<00:04:39.540> like<00:04:40.200> this<00:04:40.350> one<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> best<00:04:40.770> on

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
as good but I like this one the best on

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.439 
as good but I like this one the best on
it<00:04:41.190> and

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.209 

you<00:04:44.449> know<00:04:44.569> it<00:04:45.349> does<00:04:45.529> get<00:04:45.709> a<00:04:45.739> little<00:04:45.800> bit<00:04:45.979> boring

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219 
you know it does get a little bit boring

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.949 
you know it does get a little bit boring
so<00:04:46.339> what<00:04:46.580> I<00:04:46.610> like<00:04:46.759> to<00:04:46.819> do<00:04:47.029> is<00:04:47.239> put<00:04:47.449> on<00:04:47.539> a<00:04:47.569> car

so what I like to do is put on a car

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.689 
so what I like to do is put on a car
that<00:04:48.259> you<00:04:48.349> can<00:04:48.499> drift<00:04:48.770> in<00:04:49.039> and<00:04:49.189> stuff<00:04:49.429> and<00:04:49.580> have

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
that you can drift in and stuff and have

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:50.320 
that you can drift in and stuff and have
a<00:04:49.759> bit<00:04:49.879> of<00:04:49.909> fun

a bit of fun

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.059 
a bit of fun
now's<00:04:50.779> the<00:04:50.899> important<00:04:51.379> Cara's<00:04:51.649> aren't<00:04:51.860> really

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
now's the important Cara's aren't really

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.159 
now's the important Cara's aren't really
drifting<00:04:52.519> cars<00:04:52.729> are<00:04:52.969> that<00:04:53.209> so<00:04:53.779> I'm<00:04:53.959> trying<00:04:54.139> to

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
drifting cars are that so I'm trying to

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.959 
drifting cars are that so I'm trying to
keep<00:04:54.349> this<00:04:54.469> guy<00:04:54.739> under<00:04:54.979> wraps<00:04:55.249> for<00:04:55.399> he<00:04:55.699> cannot

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
keep this guy under wraps for he cannot

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:00.070 
keep this guy under wraps for he cannot
spin<00:04:56.509> out<00:04:56.689> but<00:04:58.029> you<00:04:59.029> know<00:04:59.149> you<00:04:59.629> can<00:04:59.779> do<00:04:59.869> little

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
spin out but you know you can do little

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.689 
spin out but you know you can do little
things<00:05:00.139> to<00:05:00.379> keep<00:05:00.559> game<00:05:00.830> interesting<00:05:01.189> for<00:05:01.580> you

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
things to keep game interesting for you

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.759 
things to keep game interesting for you
can<00:05:01.969> change<00:05:02.300> your<00:05:02.509> tuning<00:05:03.080> settings<00:05:03.469> on<00:05:03.649> your

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:03.769 
can change your tuning settings on your

00:05:03.769 --> 00:05:05.919 
can change your tuning settings on your
car<00:05:04.009> so<00:05:04.639> it's<00:05:04.789> really<00:05:04.909> hard<00:05:05.179> to<00:05:05.269> drive<00:05:05.539> or<00:05:05.899> you

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:05.929 
car so it's really hard to drive or you

00:05:05.929 --> 00:05:07.719 
car so it's really hard to drive or you
can<00:05:06.169> put<00:05:06.379> the<00:05:06.469> hub<00:05:06.649> right<00:05:06.889> height<00:05:07.129> really<00:05:07.519> high

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
can put the hub right height really high

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.570 
can put the hub right height really high
so<00:05:08.089> trees<00:05:08.300> to<00:05:08.629> turn<00:05:08.869> over<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.949> know<00:05:10.069> there's

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
so trees to turn over you know there's

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.089 
so trees to turn over you know there's
no<00:05:10.969> different<00:05:11.509> ways<00:05:11.659> I<00:05:12.019> like<00:05:12.529> to<00:05:12.769> make<00:05:12.919> the

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
no different ways I like to make the

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.559 
no different ways I like to make the
game<00:05:13.279> a<00:05:13.309> little<00:05:13.429> bit<00:05:13.669> more<00:05:13.819> fun<00:05:14.059> on<00:05:14.089> and<00:05:14.360> doing

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
game a little bit more fun on and doing

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:17.230 
game a little bit more fun on and doing
this<00:05:14.689> and<00:05:15.189> you<00:05:16.189> know<00:05:16.279> isn't<00:05:16.550> it<00:05:16.669> the<00:05:16.789> boring

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
this and you know isn't it the boring

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.549 
this and you know isn't it the boring
because<00:05:17.389> you<00:05:17.479> just<00:05:17.659> go<00:05:17.839> and<00:05:17.959> laps<00:05:18.139> and<00:05:18.379> apps

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:18.559 
because you just go and laps and apps

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:20.350 
because you just go and laps and apps
and<00:05:18.800> apps<00:05:18.949> and<00:05:19.129> apps<00:05:19.309> and<00:05:19.580> apps<00:05:19.729> and<00:05:20.089> the<00:05:20.149> track

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
and apps and apps and apps and the track

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.939 
and apps and apps and apps and the track
is<00:05:20.389> just<00:05:20.569> a<00:05:20.839> square<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.469> it's<00:05:21.619> not<00:05:21.679> really

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
is just a square so it's not really

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:25.629 
is just a square so it's not really
challenging<00:05:23.259> but<00:05:24.259> then<00:05:24.469> again<00:05:24.649> if<00:05:25.039> you're<00:05:25.339> one

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
challenging but then again if you're one

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.189 
challenging but then again if you're one
of<00:05:25.669> those<00:05:25.849> players<00:05:26.149> who<00:05:26.389> just<00:05:26.449> started<00:05:26.899> into

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 
of those players who just started into

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.619 
of those players who just started into
the<00:05:27.289> game<00:05:27.469> and<00:05:27.759> you<00:05:28.759> really<00:05:29.029> want<00:05:29.209> to<00:05:29.300> get<00:05:29.419> up

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:29.629 
the game and you really want to get up

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:32.019 
the game and you really want to get up
the<00:05:29.809> XP<00:05:30.199> get<00:05:30.439> some<00:05:30.619> better<00:05:30.830> tires<00:05:31.159> so<00:05:31.759> you<00:05:31.849> can

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
the XP get some better tires so you can

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:36.219 
the XP get some better tires so you can
play<00:05:32.209> a<00:05:32.240> little<00:05:32.509> bit<00:05:32.629> better<00:05:32.839> and<00:05:33.279> you<00:05:35.229> know

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
play a little bit better and you know

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:37.779 
play a little bit better and you know
you<00:05:36.319> can<00:05:36.529> go<00:05:36.679> ahead<00:05:36.800> and<00:05:37.039> do<00:05:37.129> this<00:05:37.309> get<00:05:37.610> loads

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
you can go ahead and do this get loads

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.509 
you can go ahead and do this get loads
of<00:05:37.879> money<00:05:37.939> in<00:05:38.329> by<00:05:38.749> your<00:05:39.379> fan<00:05:39.769> scares<00:05:40.189> but<00:05:40.459> I

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:40.519 
of money in by your fan scares but I

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:43.299 
of money in by your fan scares but I
would<00:05:40.759> recommend<00:05:41.269> in<00:05:42.199> the<00:05:42.439> slower<00:05:42.679> cars<00:05:43.009> first

00:05:43.299 --> 00:05:43.309 
would recommend in the slower cars first

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.309 
would recommend in the slower cars first
because<00:05:43.669> it's<00:05:43.789> a<00:05:43.879> lot<00:05:44.029> easier<00:05:44.239> to<00:05:44.509> master<00:05:45.139> this

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
because it's a lot easier to master this

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:48.579 
because it's a lot easier to master this
look<00:05:45.589> the<00:05:45.919> skills<00:05:46.279> of<00:05:46.639> driving<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.959> cars<00:05:48.199> when

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:48.589 
look the skills of driving the cars when

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:50.889 
look the skills of driving the cars when
you're<00:05:48.740> in<00:05:48.800> a<00:05:48.860> slower<00:05:49.069> car<00:05:49.369> I<00:05:49.729> find<00:05:50.419> that<00:05:50.509> it<00:05:50.659> oh

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:50.899 
you're in a slower car I find that it oh

00:05:50.899 --> 00:05:54.249 
you're in a slower car I find that it oh
yeah<00:05:51.559> that<00:05:51.889> was<00:05:52.009> a<00:05:52.039> quick<00:05:52.550> f1<00:05:53.119> drift<00:05:53.389> so<00:05:53.990> nice

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:54.259 
yeah that was a quick f1 drift so nice

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:56.109 
yeah that was a quick f1 drift so nice
when<00:05:54.829> you<00:05:54.919> finish<00:05:55.159> the<00:05:55.279> race<00:05:55.429> anyway<00:05:55.789> he's

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:56.119 
when you finish the race anyway he's

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:59.739 
when you finish the race anyway he's
high<00:05:56.629> back<00:05:56.869> to<00:05:57.050> one<00:05:57.199> and<00:05:58.329> it's<00:05:59.329> a<00:05:59.419> bit<00:05:59.539> funny

00:05:59.739 --> 00:05:59.749 
high back to one and it's a bit funny

00:05:59.749 --> 00:06:02.439 
high back to one and it's a bit funny
because<00:05:59.959> um<00:06:00.919> didn't<00:06:01.729> actually<00:06:01.849> do<00:06:02.149> the<00:06:02.179> full

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
because um didn't actually do the full

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:05.350 
because um didn't actually do the full
lap<00:06:02.629> here<00:06:03.369> when<00:06:04.369> you<00:06:04.490> finish<00:06:04.759> the<00:06:04.879> lap<00:06:05.029> Dai

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
lap here when you finish the lap Dai

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.689 
lap here when you finish the lap Dai
that<00:06:05.809> goes<00:06:05.959> like<00:06:05.990> to<00:06:06.829> go<00:06:07.189> around<00:06:07.309> the<00:06:07.519> track

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699 
that goes like to go around the track

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.549 
that goes like to go around the track
with<00:06:07.849> your<00:06:08.029> car<00:06:08.300> while<00:06:08.539> you're<00:06:08.659> waiting<00:06:09.079> goes

00:06:09.549 --> 00:06:09.559 
with your car while you're waiting goes

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.469 
with your car while you're waiting goes
a<00:06:09.589> bit<00:06:09.800> derpy<00:06:10.189> and<00:06:10.399> it<00:06:10.819> just<00:06:10.939> keeps<00:06:11.119> crashing

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
a bit derpy and it just keeps crashing

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:15.419 
a bit derpy and it just keeps crashing
into<00:06:11.659> the<00:06:11.749> wall<00:06:11.929> I<00:06:12.519> think<00:06:13.519> it's<00:06:13.639> layers

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:15.429 
into the wall I think it's layers

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:17.769 
into the wall I think it's layers
eventually<00:06:16.429> they<00:06:16.550> might<00:06:16.669> get<00:06:16.909> back<00:06:17.119> depends

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
eventually they might get back depends

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.409 
eventually they might get back depends
on<00:06:17.869> how<00:06:17.990> long<00:06:18.169> everybody<00:06:18.529> else<00:06:18.709> takes<00:06:19.240> man<00:06:20.240> the

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:20.419 
on how long everybody else takes man the

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:22.329 
on how long everybody else takes man the
race<00:06:20.569> just<00:06:20.599> finishes<00:06:21.319> when<00:06:21.709> that<00:06:21.860> mean<00:06:22.009> timer

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:22.339 
race just finishes when that mean timer

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:24.360 
race just finishes when that mean timer
at<00:06:22.519> the<00:06:22.579> top<00:06:22.789> goes<00:06:23.089> down<00:06:23.300> so<00:06:23.569> now

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
at the top goes down so now

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.870 
at the top goes down so now
and<00:06:26.440> all<00:06:27.440> great<00:06:27.740> thing<00:06:27.919> is<00:06:28.070> it<00:06:28.220> says<00:06:28.370> nobody

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
and all great thing is it says nobody

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.939 
and all great thing is it says nobody
finished<00:06:29.120> says<00:06:29.810> did<00:06:30.020> not<00:06:30.199> finish<00:06:30.500> so<00:06:30.800> I<00:06:30.830> think

00:06:30.939 --> 00:06:30.949 
finished says did not finish so I think

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:32.740 
finished says did not finish so I think
that's<00:06:31.220> a<00:06:31.280> little<00:06:31.340> bit<00:06:31.520> funny<00:06:31.639> so<00:06:32.449> then<00:06:32.630> he

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:32.750 
that's a little bit funny so then he

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.659 
that's a little bit funny so then he
just<00:06:32.780> wanted<00:06:33.139> to<00:06:33.199> continue<00:06:33.440> and<00:06:33.949> as<00:06:34.280> you<00:06:34.460> see

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:34.669 
just wanted to continue and as you see

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.480 
just wanted to continue and as you see
you<00:06:34.820> get<00:06:35.120> your<00:06:35.150> credits<00:06:36.110> for<00:06:36.590> being<00:06:36.889> first<00:06:37.130> you

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:37.490 
you get your credits for being first you

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.020 
you get your credits for being first you
get<00:06:37.580> your<00:06:37.759> credits<00:06:38.120> for<00:06:38.419> your<00:06:38.660> difficulty<00:06:40.030> and

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 
get your credits for your difficulty and

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.999 
get your credits for your difficulty and
race<00:06:41.330> feats<00:06:41.630> are<00:06:41.870> just<00:06:42.080> like<00:06:42.229> drifting<00:06:42.560> and

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009 
race feats are just like drifting and

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:46.029 
race feats are just like drifting and
good<00:06:43.820> turning<00:06:44.240> and<00:06:44.389> then<00:06:45.080> damage<00:06:45.500> is<00:06:45.770> if<00:06:45.919> you

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 
good turning and then damage is if you

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:48.400 
good turning and then damage is if you
don't<00:06:46.280> have<00:06:46.520> it<00:06:46.669> on<00:06:46.960> cosmetic<00:06:47.960> if<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.199> have<00:06:48.289> it

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
don't have it on cosmetic if you have it

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.219 
don't have it on cosmetic if you have it
on<00:06:48.500> simulation<00:06:49.220> if<00:06:49.729> you<00:06:49.910> damage<00:06:50.120> the<00:06:50.360> car<00:06:50.600> it

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:51.229 
on simulation if you damage the car it

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:54.070 
on simulation if you damage the car it
will<00:06:51.639> do<00:06:52.639> a<00:06:52.699> lot<00:06:52.850> of<00:06:52.910> damage<00:06:53.090> now<00:06:53.419> you<00:06:53.479> see<00:06:53.840> you

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
will do a lot of damage now you see you

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.629 
will do a lot of damage now you see you
saw<00:06:54.259> there<00:06:54.470> that<00:06:54.710> I<00:06:54.740> got<00:06:54.949> a<00:06:54.979> little<00:06:55.130> bit<00:06:55.280> of<00:06:55.370> XP

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
saw there that I got a little bit of XP

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:56.800 
saw there that I got a little bit of XP
that<00:06:55.669> was<00:06:55.910> only<00:06:56.090> because<00:06:56.180> I<00:06:56.300> was<00:06:56.449> doing<00:06:56.570> five

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
that was only because I was doing five

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.920 
that was only because I was doing five
laps<00:06:57.050> but<00:06:57.770> if<00:06:57.860> you<00:06:57.949> do<00:06:58.099> 20<00:06:58.550> laps<00:06:58.759> you<00:06:59.060> I<00:06:59.570> can

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
laps but if you do 20 laps you I can

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:01.990 
laps but if you do 20 laps you I can
guarantee<00:07:00.229> you<00:07:00.590> most<00:07:00.770> likely<00:07:01.070> will<00:07:01.340> get<00:07:01.490> a<00:07:01.550> one

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 
guarantee you most likely will get a one

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.760 
guarantee you most likely will get a one
car<00:07:02.360> level<00:07:02.630> depends<00:07:03.289> on<00:07:03.349> what<00:07:03.440> level<00:07:03.650> you're

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:03.770 
car level depends on what level you're

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.300 
car level depends on what level you're
on<00:07:03.889> I<00:07:04.070> think<00:07:04.460> I'm<00:07:04.729> on<00:07:04.849> 36<00:07:05.479> so<00:07:06.050> it's<00:07:07.039> a<00:07:07.220> little

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:07.310 
on I think I'm on 36 so it's a little

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.129 
on I think I'm on 36 so it's a little
bit<00:07:07.490> more<00:07:07.639> to<00:07:07.880> get<00:07:08.030> up<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.270> level<00:07:08.509> but<00:07:08.960> if<00:07:09.080> you

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
bit more to get up a level but if you

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:12.550 
bit more to get up a level but if you
run<00:07:09.289> the<00:07:09.710> lower<00:07:10.270> them<00:07:11.270> if<00:07:12.169> you're<00:07:12.380> on<00:07:12.440> the

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
run the lower them if you're on the

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.460 
run the lower them if you're on the
lower<00:07:14.259> levels<00:07:15.259> then<00:07:15.530> you<00:07:15.770> can<00:07:16.720> just<00:07:17.720> go<00:07:17.870> just

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:18.470 
lower levels then you can just go just

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.800 
lower levels then you can just go just
as<00:07:18.620> fast<00:07:18.889> and<00:07:19.220> I<00:07:19.400> mean<00:07:19.430> you<00:07:19.610> level<00:07:19.880> up<00:07:19.970> if<00:07:20.240> you

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:20.810 
as fast and I mean you level up if you

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.270 
as fast and I mean you level up if you
want<00:07:21.020> to<00:07:21.110> go<00:07:21.259> get<00:07:21.500> your<00:07:21.620> free<00:07:21.830> care<00:07:22.070> you<00:07:22.220> just

want to go get your free care you just
