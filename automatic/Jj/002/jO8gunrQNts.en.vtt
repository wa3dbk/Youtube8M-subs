00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
depressing things about the game where's

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.449 
depressing things about the game where's
the<00:03:12.930> sanity<00:03:13.350> meter<00:03:13.380> that<00:03:14.070> was<00:03:14.190> one<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.400> the

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
the sanity meter that was one of the

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.610 
the sanity meter that was one of the
cooler<00:03:14.670> features<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.390> game<00:03:15.570> itself<00:03:15.989> and<00:03:16.290> i

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
cooler features of the game itself and i

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.870 
cooler features of the game itself and i
actually<00:03:16.829> liked<00:03:17.190> having<00:03:17.430> them<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.730> game

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
actually liked having them the game

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.460 
actually liked having them the game
because<00:03:18.180> if<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.390> stared<00:03:18.780> at<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> character

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
because if you stared at the character

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
because if you stared at the character
your<00:03:19.739> screen<00:03:20.220> distorts<00:03:20.940> and<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:21.180> music<00:03:21.510> goes

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
your screen distorts and the music goes

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.330 
your screen distorts and the music goes
all<00:03:21.900> crazy<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.410> you<00:03:22.500> eventually<00:03:22.769> die<00:03:23.310> from

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
all crazy and you eventually die from

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.610 
all crazy and you eventually die from
madness<00:03:23.850> if<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.690> looked<00:03:24.870> at<00:03:24.959> an<00:03:25.109> enemy<00:03:25.380> long

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
madness if you looked at an enemy long

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.199 
madness if you looked at an enemy long
enough<00:03:25.890> essentially<00:03:26.519> it<00:03:26.640> would<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:27.000> say

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
enough essentially it would just say

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.150 
enough essentially it would just say
ellipses<00:03:27.870> because<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.590> would<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.709> like<00:03:28.889> fuck

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
ellipses because it would be like fuck

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.949 
ellipses because it would be like fuck
this<00:03:29.190> i<00:03:29.549> have<00:03:29.669> no<00:03:29.880> idea<00:03:30.030> what<00:03:30.419> the<00:03:30.540> fuck<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:30.840> do
