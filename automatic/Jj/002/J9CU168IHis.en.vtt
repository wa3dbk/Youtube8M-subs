00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
beforehand this isn't a great map for it

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.480 
beforehand this isn't a great map for it
because<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> canopy's<00:00:13.139> it's<00:00:13.740> really<00:00:14.160> hit<00:00:14.370> or

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
because the canopy's it's really hit or

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
over here to defend B again it could be

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.340 
over here to defend B again it could be
hit<00:00:20.010> or<00:00:20.039> miss<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.609> I<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.330> gotten<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.720> nuke<00:00:21.960> off
