00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
a special order but apparently that was

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.150 
a special order but apparently that was
it<00:03:36.900> actually<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.319> might<00:03:37.410> not<00:03:37.709> be<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:38.010> there

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
it actually it might not be it there

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.130 
it actually it might not be it there
might<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.310> something<00:03:38.580> secret<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.780> we'll<00:03:40.020> go

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
might be something secret so we'll go

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.720 
might be something secret so we'll go
watch<00:03:40.319> youtube<00:03:40.650> videos<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.100> because<00:03:41.459> we

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
watch youtube videos on it because we

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.130 
watch youtube videos on it because we
actually<00:03:42.000> didn't<00:03:42.150> really<00:03:42.450> watch<00:03:42.630> all<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> bunch

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
actually didn't really watch all a bunch

of<00:03:43.200> YouTube<00:03:43.440> videos<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.860> we<00:03:44.010> just<00:03:44.040> decided<00:03:44.610> to

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
of YouTube videos on we just decided to

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.000 
of YouTube videos on we just decided to
play<00:03:44.850> because<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.690> looked<00:03:45.840> pretty<00:03:45.930> cool<00:03:46.230> so

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
play because it looked pretty cool so

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:48.770

that<00:03:47.160> was<00:03:47.250> actually<00:03:47.340> really<00:03:47.550> short<00:03:48.390> so

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
that was actually really short so

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.690 
that was actually really short so
hopefully<00:03:49.530> there's<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.770> secret<00:03:49.950> room<00:03:50.040> but<00:03:50.610> so
