00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
aftertaste

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.620 
aftertaste
these<00:04:45.460> actually<00:04:46.000> they're<00:04:46.300> not<00:04:46.420> bad<00:04:46.600> they're

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
these actually they're not bad they're

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.080 
these actually they're not bad they're
um<00:04:47.080> they're<00:04:47.350> kind<00:04:48.220> of<00:04:48.250> plain<00:04:48.520> -<00:04:48.760> they<00:04:48.940> have<00:04:49.060> a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
um they're kind of plain - they have a

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.820 
um they're kind of plain - they have a
little<00:04:49.420> bit<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.540> that<00:04:49.690> onion<00:04:49.930> powdery<00:04:50.470> taste

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
little bit of that onion powdery taste

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.030 
little bit of that onion powdery taste
to<00:04:51.040> them<00:04:52.110> but<00:04:53.110> they're<00:04:53.260> not<00:04:53.290> too<00:04:53.620> far<00:04:53.650> off<00:04:53.860> of

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
to them but they're not too far off of

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.160 
to them but they're not too far off of
the<00:04:54.310> air<00:04:54.490> pop<00:04:54.730> so<00:04:55.090> if<00:04:55.450> you<00:04:55.540> don't<00:04:55.720> like<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.900> lot

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
the air pop so if you don't like a lot

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.390 
the air pop so if you don't like a lot
of<00:04:56.260> sour<00:04:56.410> cream<00:04:56.590> on<00:04:56.710> you<00:04:56.770> maybe<00:04:56.890> want<00:04:57.130> a<00:04:57.190> little

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
of sour cream on you maybe want a little

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.800 
of sour cream on you maybe want a little
bit<00:04:57.550> of<00:04:57.640> flavor<00:04:57.820> these<00:04:58.150> are<00:04:58.360> probably<00:04:58.630> better

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
bit of flavor these are probably better

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.380 
bit of flavor these are probably better
than<00:04:59.080> they<00:04:59.290> had<00:04:59.770> to<00:04:59.950> rank<00:05:00.190> them<00:05:00.460> it<00:05:01.150> would<00:05:01.270> be

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
than they had to rank them it would be

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.960 
than they had to rank them it would be
the<00:05:01.570> plane<00:05:01.870> or<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.440> worse<00:05:02.710> these<00:05:03.700> are<00:05:03.940> a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
the plane or the worse these are a

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.370 
the plane or the worse these are a
little<00:05:04.120> bit<00:05:04.270> better<00:05:04.420> because<00:05:04.720> it<00:05:04.960> adds<00:05:05.140> just<00:05:05.230> a

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
little bit better because it adds just a

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.320 
little bit better because it adds just a
little<00:05:05.410> more<00:05:05.770> flavor<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:06.430> whole<00:05:06.910> lot<00:05:07.120> just

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
little more flavor to it whole lot just

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.940 
little more flavor to it whole lot just
a<00:05:07.450> little<00:05:07.660> bit<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.080> if<00:05:08.320> barbecue<00:05:08.740> are

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
a little bit and if barbecue are

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:15.450 
a little bit and if barbecue are
actually<00:05:09.520> pretty<00:05:09.760> good<00:05:10.000> yeah<00:05:14.130> probably<00:05:15.130> not

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
actually pretty good yeah probably not

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.510 
actually pretty good yeah probably not
no<00:05:16.090> no<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:17.260> just<00:05:17.320> think<00:05:17.740> they're<00:05:17.980> too<00:05:18.220> expensive

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
no no I just think they're too expensive

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.740 
no no I just think they're too expensive
that's<00:05:19.060> my<00:05:19.270> problem

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
that's my problem

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.480 
that's my problem
well<00:05:19.960> I<00:05:19.990> like<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.560> barbecue<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.100> best<00:05:21.310> I

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
well I like the barbecue the best I

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.690 
well I like the barbecue the best I
don't<00:05:21.580> like<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:22.000> Oh<00:05:22.440> like<00:05:23.440> a<00:05:23.590> same<00:05:24.220> order

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700
