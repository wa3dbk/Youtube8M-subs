and<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.790> think<00:00:41.969> that's<00:00:42.120> what<00:00:42.270> happened<00:00:43.100> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and I think that's what happened you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.069 
and I think that's what happened you
guys<00:00:44.280> thought<00:00:44.520> off<00:00:44.700> hit<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.000> first<00:00:45.270> ten<00:00:45.510> what

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
guys thought off hit the first ten what

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.680 
guys thought off hit the first ten what
change<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.559> me<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.390> weren't<00:00:48.570> getting

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
change for me but we weren't getting

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.959 
change for me but we weren't getting
stops<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.190> were<00:00:50.309> scoring<00:00:50.730> but<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
stops you know we were scoring but we

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.220 
stops you know we were scoring but we
weren't<00:00:51.120> getting<00:00:51.300> stops<00:00:51.629> were<00:00:51.809> just<00:00:52.050> trading

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
weren't getting stops were just trading

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.750 
weren't getting stops were just trading
baskets<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:55.260> as<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:55.860> just<00:00:56.010> said<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.640> know<00:00:56.730> I

think that's what caught up with we

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
think that's what caught up with we
stopped<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.500> stopped<00:00:58.800> making<00:00:59.100> shots<00:00:59.449> and<00:01:00.449> we

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570
