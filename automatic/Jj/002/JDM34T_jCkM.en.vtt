00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
something like that and yes that would

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.870 
something like that and yes that would
not<00:01:12.630> work<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.560> tick<00:01:14.310> would<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.670> too

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
not work because it tick would be too

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
not work because it tick would be too
long<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.990> lava<00:01:16.259> will<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.430> too

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
long and the lava will be there for too

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
long and the lava will be there for too
long<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.820> will<00:01:18.150> burn<00:01:18.330> all<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.570> items<00:01:18.890> so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
long and will burn all your items so

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.190 
long and will burn all your items so
that's<00:01:20.520> why<00:01:20.759> we<00:01:20.790> add<00:01:21.180> this<00:01:21.450> block<00:01:21.720> with<00:01:21.990> this

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
that's why we add this block with this

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160 
that's why we add this block with this
redstone<00:01:22.560> torch<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.180> shorten<00:01:25.020> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
redstone torch and it will shorten the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.920 
redstone torch and it will shorten the
delay<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.790> make<00:01:27.299> sure<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.689> lava

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
delay and it will make sure the lava

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.539 
delay and it will make sure the lava
will<00:01:28.380> go<00:01:28.799> away<00:01:29.280> earlier<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.450> yes<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.320> will

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
will go away earlier so yes that will

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.670 
will go away earlier so yes that will
make<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.850> animals<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.450> killed<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:34.350> still

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
make the animals get killed but still

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.399 
make the animals get killed but still
drop<00:01:34.950> their<00:01:35.159> items<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:36.299> yeah<00:01:36.509> you're<00:01:37.020> probably
