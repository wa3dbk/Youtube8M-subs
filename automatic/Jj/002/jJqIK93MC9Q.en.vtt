00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
enough of the plating there to make a

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.590 
enough of the plating there to make a
good<00:01:23.600> solid<00:01:24.289> flow<00:01:24.740> with<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.100> solder<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.640> then

piece<00:03:27.950> screws<00:03:28.280> out<00:03:28.549> this<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.600> what<00:03:29.780> lines<00:03:30.079> the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
piece screws out this is what lines the

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.800 
piece screws out this is what lines the
cover<00:03:30.620> up<00:03:30.859> it's<00:03:31.100> what<00:03:31.310> makes<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.269> cover<00:03:32.450> pop

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810

cover up it's what makes the cover pop
into<00:03:33.109> place<00:03:33.700> so<00:03:34.700> I'll<00:03:35.269> go<00:03:35.450> ahead<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.900> I'll

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
into place so I'll go ahead and I'll

fits perfect so you can see I back the
screws<00:03:42.829> out<00:03:43.010> just<00:03:43.310> enough<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:44.209> they're<00:03:44.920> going

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
screws out just enough so they're going

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.009 
screws out just enough so they're going
to<00:03:46.010> line<00:03:46.220> up<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.489> holes<00:03:46.910> on<00:03:47.239> the<00:03:47.299> cover<00:03:47.600> but

that<00:03:55.340> works<00:03:55.700> really<00:03:55.970> well<00:03:56.180> for<00:03:56.239> this<00:03:56.570> type<00:03:56.840> of

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
that works really well for this type of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.870 
that works really well for this type of
stuff<00:03:57.140> you<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:57.620> use<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.799> small<00:03:58.160> C<00:03:58.459> clamp<00:03:58.760> you

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
stuff you can use a small C clamp you

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.610 
stuff you can use a small C clamp you
don't<00:03:59.000> even<00:03:59.120> have<00:03:59.299> to<00:03:59.450> use<00:03:59.569> a<00:03:59.600> clamp<00:03:59.900> the

don't even have to use a clamp the
clamps<00:04:01.010> just<00:04:01.069> going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> really<00:04:01.730> give<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
clamps just going to really give the

flowing the solder in against the cover

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.620 
flowing the solder in against the cover
and<00:06:05.630> I'm<00:06:05.960> watching<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.560> as<00:06:07.010> it<00:06:07.670> flows<00:06:08.120> out<00:06:08.360> onto
