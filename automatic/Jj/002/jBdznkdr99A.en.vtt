00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
to dry our machine dry with low heat now

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.599 
to dry our machine dry with low heat now
what<00:03:46.579> I<00:03:46.609> did<00:03:46.940> is<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.780> have<00:03:48.709> a<00:03:48.739> fabric<00:03:49.040> bar<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:49.579> I

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
what I did is I have a fabric bar so I

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.940 
what I did is I have a fabric bar so I
don't<00:03:49.849> throw<00:03:50.090> it<00:03:50.150> in<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.450> dryer<00:03:50.720> I<00:03:51.139> air<00:03:51.650> dry<00:03:51.919> a

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
don't throw it in the dryer I air dry a

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.650 
don't throw it in the dryer I air dry a
lot<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.250> stuff<00:03:52.459> so<00:03:52.639> I<00:03:52.669> just<00:03:52.910> watch<00:03:53.120> this<00:03:53.329> an<00:03:53.510> air

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:53.660 
lot of stuff so I just watch this an air

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:54.099 
lot of stuff so I just watch this an air
dry<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
dry it

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.900 
dry it
it's<00:03:54.349> a<00:03:54.410> safest<00:03:54.799> bet<00:03:55.040> for<00:03:55.280> almost<00:03:55.519> anything

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
it's a safest bet for almost anything

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:57.970 
it's a safest bet for almost anything
you<00:03:55.940> wash<00:03:56.200> if<00:03:57.200> you<00:03:57.290> don't<00:03:57.440> want<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.650> shrink

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
you wash if you don't want the shrink

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.530 
you wash if you don't want the shrink
and<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.609> reason<00:03:58.849> they<00:03:58.940> don't<00:03:59.060> want<00:03:59.269> to<00:03:59.359> use

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
and the reason they don't want to use

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.170 
and the reason they don't want to use
the<00:03:59.690> fabric<00:03:59.900> softener<00:04:00.430> is<00:04:01.430> because<00:04:01.879> this<00:04:02.030> is

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
the fabric softener is because this is

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.990 
the fabric softener is because this is
sort<00:04:02.329> of<00:04:02.419> like<00:04:02.510> an<00:04:02.629> absorbent<00:04:03.169> material<00:04:03.709> and

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
sort of like an absorbent material and

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.920 
sort of like an absorbent material and
usually<00:04:05.000> stuff<00:04:05.209> like<00:04:05.359> that<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.599> don't<00:04:05.690> want

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
usually stuff like that you don't want

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.740 
usually stuff like that you don't want
to<00:04:05.989> clog<00:04:06.230> up<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:07.389> property<00:04:08.389> if<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:08.599> will

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
to clog up that property if you will

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.140 
to clog up that property if you will
with<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:09.079> fabric<00:04:09.560> with<00:04:09.799> fabric<00:04:10.459> softener<00:04:10.879> so

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
with this fabric with fabric softener so

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.430 
with this fabric with fabric softener so
that's<00:04:11.269> why<00:04:11.449> you<00:04:11.510> you<00:04:11.840> don't<00:04:11.989> want<00:04:12.109> to<00:04:12.169> do<00:04:12.260> that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
that's why you you don't want to do that

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.830 
that's why you you don't want to do that
this<00:04:12.980> does<00:04:13.190> have<00:04:13.340> an<00:04:13.430> antimicrobial<00:04:14.000> kind<00:04:14.720> of

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
this does have an antimicrobial kind of

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.740 
this does have an antimicrobial kind of
silver<00:04:15.199> impregnated<00:04:15.949> our<00:04:16.280> silver<00:04:16.789> treated

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
silver impregnated our silver treated

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.810 
silver impregnated our silver treated
solar<00:04:18.590> treatment<00:04:18.979> to<00:04:19.099> it<00:04:19.250> so<00:04:19.519> it's<00:04:19.669> definitely

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
solar treatment to it so it's definitely

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.089 
solar treatment to it so it's definitely
antimicrobial<00:04:20.389> so<00:04:21.289> that's<00:04:21.410> another<00:04:21.620> benefit

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:22.099 
antimicrobial so that's another benefit

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:24.909 
antimicrobial so that's another benefit
to<00:04:22.159> it's<00:04:22.669> this<00:04:22.849> cool<00:04:23.060> little<00:04:23.210> PT<00:04:23.630> towel<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.560> if

look at this through the camera but uh
was<00:04:45.530> it<00:04:45.710> this<00:04:45.889> up<00:04:46.130> here<00:04:46.400> and<00:04:46.550> what<00:04:46.639> this

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
was it this up here and what this

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.210 
was it this up here and what this
actually<00:04:46.880> is<00:04:47.180> for<00:04:47.530> just<00:04:48.530> one<00:04:48.740> little<00:04:48.889> slot

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
actually is for just one little slot

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.010 
actually is for just one little slot
here<00:04:49.460> you<00:04:49.910> can<00:04:50.060> see<00:04:50.240> this<00:04:50.389> is<00:04:50.569> here<00:04:50.840> you

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
here you can see this is here you

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.320 
here you can see this is here you
actually<00:04:51.440> take<00:04:52.400> this<00:04:52.610> and<00:04:52.819> put<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.090> out

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
actually take this and put this out

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.230 
actually take this and put this out
through<00:04:53.660> here<00:04:53.870> so<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.139> can<00:04:54.289> hang<00:04:54.500> it<00:04:54.710> like

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
through here so you can hang it like

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.629 
through here so you can hang it like
this<00:04:56.240> get<00:04:56.810> this<00:04:56.960> through<00:04:57.259> here<00:04:59.080> there<00:05:00.080> we<00:05:00.199> go

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
this get this through here there we go

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.740 
this get this through here there we go
and<00:05:01.639> then<00:05:01.759> you<00:05:01.849> can<00:05:01.970> actually<00:05:02.090> just<00:05:02.270> zip<00:05:02.599> this

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
and then you can actually just zip this

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.189 
and then you can actually just zip this
up<00:05:03.610> throw<00:05:04.610> it<00:05:04.669> in<00:05:04.759> a<00:05:04.819> bag<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.780> if<00:05:05.870> you<00:05:05.960> need<00:05:06.110> to
