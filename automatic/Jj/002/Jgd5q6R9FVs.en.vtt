00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
black just about a year earlier I began

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.450 
black just about a year earlier I began
to<00:00:39.030> paint<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.570> black<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.980> see

to paint on black and you can really see

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.740 
to paint on black and you can really see
underneath<00:00:42.210> everything<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.100> very

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
underneath everything the the very

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.920 
underneath everything the the very
prominent<00:00:45.750> black<00:00:46.469> layer<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.640> black<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
prominent black layer of black the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.580 
prominent black layer of black the
thickness<00:00:52.590> of<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.730> colors<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.270> day<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thickness of the colors the day the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.520 
thickness of the colors the day the
amazing<00:00:56.460> impact<00:00:57.000> that<00:00:57.570> they<00:00:57.840> create<00:00:58.260> is

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
amazing impact that they create is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.939 
amazing impact that they create is
simply<00:00:59.340> due<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.760> black<00:01:00.260> underneath<00:01:01.260> so

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
simply due to the black underneath so

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
simply due to the black underneath so
this<00:01:02.160> was<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.969> earliest<00:01:03.329> paintings

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this was one of the earliest paintings

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.590 
this was one of the earliest paintings
with<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.559> black<00:01:04.860> background<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.119> painted

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
with a black background when I painted

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350 
with a black background when I painted
this<00:01:06.750> painting<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.439> painted<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.330> upside<00:01:09.330> down

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
this painting I painted it upside down

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.420 
this painting I painted it upside down
so<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.799> sky<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.909> can<00:01:12.060> see<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:12.540> was

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
so the sky which you can see now was

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.649 
so the sky which you can see now was
actually<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.880> bottom<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
actually on the bottom and the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.350 
actually on the bottom and the
pomegranates<00:01:16.409> were<00:01:16.890> painted<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.610> here<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
pomegranates were painted up here and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
pomegranates were painted up here and
the<00:01:18.869> reason<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.409> started<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.520> then

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
the reason I started to do it back then

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.710 
the reason I started to do it back then
was<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.630> order<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.400> create<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:24.000> feeling<00:01:24.689> of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
was in order to create this feeling of

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.880 
was in order to create this feeling of
of<00:01:25.439> warmness<00:01:26.369> like<00:01:26.970> things<00:01:27.390> were<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> bit<00:01:27.900> like

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of warmness like things were a bit like

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.109 
of warmness like things were a bit like
edward<00:01:29.430> monk<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:31.670> bit<00:01:32.670> um<00:01:33.770> twisted<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:35.909> fact

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
edward monk a bit um twisted the fact

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.340 
edward monk a bit um twisted the fact
that<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.299> painted<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.689> upside<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.049> is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350
