came into the series blind I didn't know

anything about it I was met with this

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.940 
anything about it I was met with this
abundance<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.660> world-building<00:02:24.080> information

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
abundance of world-building information

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.250 
abundance of world-building information
that<00:02:25.130> I<00:02:25.160> thought<00:02:25.520> might<00:02:25.880> be<00:02:26.090> significant<00:02:26.780> but

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
that I thought might be significant but

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.770 
that I thought might be significant but
in<00:02:27.380> reality<00:02:27.620> most<00:02:28.400> of<00:02:28.670> it<00:02:28.790> was<00:02:29.000> irrelevant<00:02:29.360> due

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
in reality most of it was irrelevant due

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.180 
in reality most of it was irrelevant due
to<00:02:30.020> this<00:02:30.200> and<00:02:30.440> the<00:02:30.500> amount<00:02:30.709> of<00:02:30.890> light-hearted

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
to this and the amount of light-hearted

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.220 
to this and the amount of light-hearted
comedy<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.030> felt<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.540> this<00:02:32.690> series<00:02:33.020> was

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
comedy I felt that this series was

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.350 
comedy I felt that this series was
sending<00:02:33.560> me<00:02:33.680> a<00:02:33.709> lot<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.190> mixed<00:02:34.459> signals<00:02:34.580> pacing

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
sending me a lot of mixed signals pacing

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.810 
sending me a lot of mixed signals pacing
was<00:02:35.510> another<00:02:35.810> major<00:02:36.110> flaw<00:02:36.560> many<00:02:37.220> people<00:02:37.580> say

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
was another major flaw many people say

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.850 
was another major flaw many people say
that<00:02:38.060> it<00:02:38.150> takes<00:02:38.330> 12<00:02:38.780> episodes<00:02:39.350> for<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.770> get

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
that it takes 12 episodes for it to get

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.860 
that it takes 12 episodes for it to get
interesting<00:02:40.550> in<00:02:40.730> my<00:02:40.880> opinion<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.510> only<00:02:41.660> took

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
interesting in my opinion it only took

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.750 
interesting in my opinion it only took
me<00:02:42.020> about<00:02:42.050> nine<00:02:42.260> but<00:02:42.830> that<00:02:42.980> is<00:02:43.130> still<00:02:43.340> far<00:02:43.730> too
