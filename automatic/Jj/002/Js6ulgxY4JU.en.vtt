00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.010 
here are three framed prints that I just
printed<00:00:41.350> from<00:00:41.710> online<00:00:42.220> and<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:43.329> put<00:00:43.570> them<00:00:43.720> in

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020

Dollar<00:00:44.530> Tree<00:00:44.910> frames<00:00:45.910> so<00:00:46.480> that<00:00:46.510> was<00:00:46.899> just

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
Dollar Tree frames so that was just

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.050 
Dollar Tree frames so that was just
