00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
engineering building and you can craft

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.080 
engineering building and you can craft
it<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.330> 50<00:00:22.220> gearspring<00:00:23.220> parts<00:00:24.289> all<00:00:25.289> right<00:00:25.470> so

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
it for 50 gearspring parts all right so

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.220 
it for 50 gearspring parts all right so
this<00:00:27.380> even<00:00:28.380> -<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.429> looks<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:30.029> toy<00:00:30.449> it's<00:00:30.929> not

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230

a toy you will have to keep it on your
in<00:00:34.320> your<00:00:34.530> bag

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
in your bag

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.610 
in your bag
right<00:00:37.559> right<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.390> what<00:00:39.390> exactly<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:40.110> does<00:00:40.350> it

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
right right so what exactly it does it

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.350 
right right so what exactly it does it
is<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.520> when<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.300> use<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:43.520> when<00:00:44.520> in<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
is that when you use it when in the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.380 
is that when you use it when in the
place<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:46.110> use<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.940> will<00:00:48.000> trigger<00:00:49.010> a

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
place that you use it it will trigger a

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.920 
place that you use it it will trigger a
lightning<00:00:51.390> cloud<00:00:52.430> effect<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.570> looks

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
lightning cloud effect and it looks

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.209 
lightning cloud effect and it looks
something<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:56.520> monk<00:00:57.300> ability<00:00:57.870> and<00:01:01.219> an

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
something like a monk ability and an

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.520 
something like a monk ability and an
image<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.789> your<00:01:03.090> character<00:01:03.840> will<00:01:04.080> remain

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
image of your character will remain

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.070 
image of your character will remain
there<00:01:04.799> almost<00:01:05.129> invisible<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.390> if<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.780> click

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
there almost invisible but if you click

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.170 
there almost invisible but if you click
it<00:01:07.310> you<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.460> see<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:11.010> make<00:01:11.250> Road<00:01:11.520> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it you will see it you can make Road the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.010 
it you will see it you can make Road the
item<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:13.250> have<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> macro<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.180> my<00:01:15.840> disengage

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
item I have it macro it on my disengage

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.789 
item I have it macro it on my disengage
even<00:01:19.020> twice<00:01:19.320> because<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:20.490> felt<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.799> sometimes

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
even twice because I felt that sometimes

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.899 
even twice because I felt that sometimes
it<00:01:23.390> it<00:01:24.390> doesn't<00:01:24.840> get<00:01:24.960> triggered<00:01:25.490> right<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.729> I'm

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
it it doesn't get triggered right so I'm

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:33.220 
it it doesn't get triggered right so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.150> show<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.810> exactly<00:01:27.869> what<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.560> does

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.960 

so<00:01:34.230> you<00:01:34.290> see<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> blue<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> blue<00:01:36.690> effect<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
so you see the blue the blue effect and

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.530 
so you see the blue the blue effect and
if<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.120> click<00:01:39.450> here<00:01:39.480> you<00:01:40.170> will<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.680> that

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
if you click here you will see that

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.830 
if you click here you will see that
there<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.570> an<00:01:42.840> image<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.380> my<00:01:43.650> character<00:01:44.400> almost

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
there is an image of my character almost

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.240 
there is an image of my character almost
invisible<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.630> difference<00:01:49.230> between<00:01:49.710> this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
invisible the difference between this

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.900 
invisible the difference between this
item<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:52.460> AD<00:01:53.460> sky<00:01:54.060> mirror<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:56.580> one

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
item and AD sky mirror is that this one

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.160 
item and AD sky mirror is that this one
you<00:01:57.240> can't<00:01:59.150> you<00:02:00.150> can<00:02:00.420> click<00:02:00.780> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you can't you can click it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.030 
you can't you can click it
oh<00:02:01.640> no<00:02:02.640> no<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> think<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.290> another<00:02:04.590> item

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
oh no no I think it's it's another item

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:14.980 
oh no no I think it's it's another item
that<00:02:06.710> from<00:02:08.479> archeology<00:02:10.400> which<00:02:11.400> will<00:02:12.360> create

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.210 

an<00:02:15.990> image<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.740> character<00:02:19.580> yes<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.880> one

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
