unfortunately<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.730> library<00:00:12.150> folder<00:00:12.300> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
unfortunately the library folder is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.390 
unfortunately the library folder is
hidden<00:00:12.960> and<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.590> lot<00:00:13.740> of<00:00:13.769> people<00:00:14.099> aren't<00:00:14.309> quite

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
hidden and a lot of people aren't quite

see<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.009> library<00:01:17.460> appear<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.420> click<00:01:18.720> on

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
the preference files here you can see

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.929 
the preference files here you can see
your<00:01:45.899> caches<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> delete<00:01:47.729> them

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
your caches if you want to delete them

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.749 
your caches if you want to delete them
manually<00:01:48.619> that's<00:01:49.619> always<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.920> good<00:01:50.159> thing<00:01:50.189> that

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
manually that's always a good thing that

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.810 
manually that's always a good thing that
if<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:52.159> system<00:01:53.159> that's<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.369> working

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
if you have a system that's not working

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.010 
if you have a system that's not working
properly<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.329> want<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.540> get<00:01:54.630> rid<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> some<00:01:54.960> of

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
properly you want to get rid of some of

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.780 
properly you want to get rid of some of
the<00:01:55.079> cache<00:01:55.229> files<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.009> drag<00:01:56.460> them

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
the cache files you can just drag them

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.999 
the cache files you can just drag them
out<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.060> here<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.360> delete<00:01:57.600> them<00:01:57.810> also<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
out of here and delete them also the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.690 
out of here and delete them also the
preference<00:01:59.460> files<00:01:59.700> are<00:01:59.939> in<00:02:00.060> here<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.610> so<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
preference files are in here and so you

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.880 
preference files are in here and so you
can<00:02:02.939> also<00:02:03.119> delete<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.540> preference<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> usually

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
can also delete a preference and usually

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.319 
can also delete a preference and usually
those<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:05.310> will<00:02:05.460> get<00:02:05.549> recreated<00:02:06.119> on

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
those things will get recreated on

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.290 
those things will get recreated on
reboot<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.459> also<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> preference<00:02:09.000> panes

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
reboot and also the preference panes
