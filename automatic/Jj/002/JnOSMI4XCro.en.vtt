00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello and welcome to do it 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.850
 yourself inspiration and a new one 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.620
 favorite video of us both and that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 We'll stand over nail this time 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.889
 today our favorite nail polishes 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.070
 in front 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:17.070
 and yes, I just went for it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.960
 here one of these two from artdeco the 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.600
 be called 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.970
 this is the number 112 number 115 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.210
 the train from the together in the set and the 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.939
 door is actually quite similar there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.170
 a little brighter the other a little darker 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.829
 a gray bit in the purple wet and gray 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.829
 room 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.250
 and I think that's really nice 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:46.260
 that is quite simple and you can stop 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.789
 the two combine nicely but 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
 first make the light or still in the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.770
 darken a little detail with it 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.809
 or so I did not say so 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 Often the nails but when I'm with the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 paint for not the heat very much 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.170
 beautiful again determine the alternately 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 fingernails not really crass too 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.470
 Different is a start so completely 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.650
 light 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.000
 more interesting than a stark contrast 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.780
 how do I start? I catch mine 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.750
 oldest 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.870
 that brought in my elders 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.820
 magid golden goal of p2p i do know 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.610
 not sure if I got the own brand of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.960
 which I pronounce exactly how you say it 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:35.920
 this is the 08 03 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.530
 that's the golden thing yes yes you see 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.710
 you can see the football up here 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.850
 here magic with the footballer between 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.200
 I have that during the wm 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.000
 I had actually bought it with the 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.590
 to paint hunters so black and gold 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.490
 I have mainly but then 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.550
 in gold had last and were lucky 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 brought 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.690
 I simply talk further 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:04.080
 because I have a golden one too 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:07.090
 a new york city new york all top gold 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.119
 top coach is still below 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.380
 probably at some point there will be one 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 make other color under 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.040
 I think I also had you one time 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 I've had a semester situation 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.150
 black and over this top supervisor 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.450
 Gold number 10 is that 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.960
 and looks really nice find 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.470
 that's nice size right 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.820
 I really wear the article many times 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.320
 but you can not turn 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.910
 because really such a highlight today 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.370
 I also thought of combining names 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.080
 I got this clock with turquoise gold 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.580
 and then I have it 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.970
 you can make nice to now 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:47.910
 that could read totally or loser 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:51.100
 So set off the clan exactly ballack 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.450
 of it from manhattan not very much of 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.670
 Manhattan's carpet has in mine 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.120
 Industry experts almost only a trader 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.490
 just 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.440
 I like him very much of a serious 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.190
 limited edition of the citizens from the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.560
 brush critical dancing we wanna dance 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.560
 fever than that only for 2001 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.980
 he is really happy so that is 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.130
 dark purple and there are blue 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.540
 and pink silver particles are in it 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.700
 very very nice was the know also 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.650
 super nice in the light of these particles 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 Trojan has been so small 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.490
 you have to drive right that is 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.940
 so that you actively see beautiful as willing 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.940
 so party 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:39.150
 I continue with my last one 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.150
 is useful colors professional user 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.140
 that is actually in dense 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.700
 turquoise and with very small ones 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.590
 silver particles 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.750
 I think it 's really nice because we have the 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.500
 color so the beautiful ones are good and easy 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.810
 nice but this 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.440
 matt lacquer over to paint with the top 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:10.590
 coat normal mass effect cabbage for making 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:13.500
 here is synonymous with apple with apple 947 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.019
 the number we are ripe apple says 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.670
 the whole thing a bit serious 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:20.299
 So I think that's all mine too 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.160
 his favorite colors are his beautiful colors 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.760
 yes and I still have the spring color 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.650
 here I do not believe that is that 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.990
 no special edition from manhattan 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.790
 that's the spring color there is 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.570
 I believe in manhattan now 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.740
 that is so very light pink I think 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.240
 is a super nice colors for the 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.370
 spring I wear currently also 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:47.250
 very often we have very light 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.060
 also done so silvery and very silver 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.160
 I have a beautiful one at the moment 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.860
 Another top coat I hope you 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.110
 to see reasonably 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:03.160
 I hope it works 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.160
 that's exactly what my daughter was 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.520
 but is not beautiful finds ever 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.130
 After who and how can you be so beautiful 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.540
 says it very differently because of that 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.640
 I had to be here three now 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.590
 I also have other choices 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.360
 So well, depending on where you go 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.950
 then you want what you have that is also what 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.750
 one plans to have New Year's Eve as if 

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.220
 christmas of demolition i want too 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:32.000
 that is definitely the disappearance so 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.500
 It is important that you also in winter 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.600
 series of manhattan that was in the winter 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.670
 really so that christmas new year's eve 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.810
 is attracting chic with you and then 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.400
 Nice to do so and here the football is not 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.960
 we hope you enjoyed it and have fun 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.610

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.100
 Another issue has exact damage in
