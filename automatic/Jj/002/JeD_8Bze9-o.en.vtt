you like to see Boba Fett do if he came
back<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.399> of<00:01:41.490> these<00:01:41.549> spin-offs<00:01:42.349> Boba

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:43.349 
back for one of these spin-offs Boba

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.190 
back for one of these spin-offs Boba
Fett<00:01:43.560> should<00:01:43.889> be<00:01:44.189> as<00:01:44.880> cool<00:01:45.209> as<00:01:45.479> he<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.840> right

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Fett should be as cool as he was right

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.379 
Fett should be as cool as he was right
at<00:01:46.349> the<00:01:46.380> beginning<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.490> he<00:01:47.789> doesn't<00:01:48.240> move

00:01:48.379 --> 00:01:48.389 
at the beginning and he doesn't move

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:51.139 
at the beginning and he doesn't move
very<00:01:48.450> much<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.469> a<00:01:49.499> little<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.549> with<00:01:50.999> their

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
very much so a little look with their

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.659 
very much so a little look with their
helmet<00:01:51.569> on<00:01:51.779> is<00:01:52.380> dangerous<00:01:53.099> so<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.340> don't<00:01:53.609> know

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:53.669 
helmet on is dangerous so you don't know

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:55.309 
helmet on is dangerous so you don't know
what<00:01:53.789> he's<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.299> but<00:01:54.990> there's<00:01:55.169> going

00:01:55.309 --> 00:01:55.319 
what he's going to do but there's going

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:56.809 
what he's going to do but there's going
to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:56.130> there's<00:01:56.429> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.639> be<00:01:56.669> an

00:01:56.809 --> 00:01:56.819 
to be I think there's going to be an

00:01:56.819 --> 00:01:59.510 
to be I think there's going to be an
awful<00:01:57.179> lot<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.169> with<00:01:58.439> him<00:01:58.619> but<00:01:59.189> at<00:01:59.399> the
