 to teach how to update it 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.180
 sandra this but they have the inconvenience 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.700
 which are headers that if you do not update 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:43.079
 is not the person you want to enter the 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.079
 game do not enter this screen 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.230
 well first let's go to this folder 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:57.760
 here in search and start 1 2 % app 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 intact percent and we get this 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.079
 folder that is called roaming 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.229
 good here is the jail our 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.330
 minecraft point folder we give you and we 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.080
 all this comes out in this portfolio 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.820
 little we take out a singing line 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.880
 and everything else we eliminate 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:23.399
 without fear that he does not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:27.110
 good and now this folder will be empty 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.110
 Well, the place to do is 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:35.480
 this is the printer skills you do not go 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.390
 because this is now the exam drawer 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.909
 data 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 good is your name for this 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.210
 process 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.330
 well and now this is going to be 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.730
 loading or going to update to the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.640
 last version that you 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.320
 and will create everything again everything 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 that we have eliminated before but to the 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.330
 new version as it is here is 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.940
 if you already have updated, you may not 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 as I am not encumbered 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.830
 but well I do not eliminate it I have it 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 here so good has already been updated 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.640
 this here we have it and as you see and here 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.360
 we have line 3.4 point 5 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360
 coma 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.300
 the body of guys commons 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.490
 good 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.820
 here the world 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.620
 good at the worlds I had before the 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.120
 imac and copied to not lose grades and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.000
 then I'll put them 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:50.170
 If you also want to copy it in 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.120
 this folder because it is necessary that you 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.610
 keep the worlds so that if 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.330
 we copy and we have it we have it in no 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.330
 let's put 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.470
 then to the only inconvenience that has 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.890
 is 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:16.080
 it's a bit slow sometimes because it 's 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.080
 new still has to charge 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.250
 what can be done in a convent 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:28.840

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.810

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:36.090
 you will notice that they have put things as 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.950
 heads that can equip 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.739
