00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
 the rome that can do it 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.310
 the electromagnetic bomb ob combat 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.030
 ap some kind of weapon that is being developed and that 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.150
 e would be destructive in ways that we are not used to seeing is a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.360
 based on the idea of ​​an electromagnetic pulse could be treated by 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.520
 example of the type of pump that was designated in the atmosphere on a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.660
 city ​​and that would create an impulse from a very powerful electromagnetic field that 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.910
 it would cover the city 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.790
 and that would generate short circuits in all electronic equipment that 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:30.360
 she 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.490
 Clares computers automobiles 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.310
 in everything that was within reach would generate a short and 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.090
 they would have destroyed 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.100
 again 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.780
 this is where the scientific fact gets 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.260
 I'm enormously interested in seeing one of these artifacts installed in the 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.840
 mobile platform 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.380
 either on a cruise missile or on some other platform little by little 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.710
 this artifact could fly over and affect without any collateral damage the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.500
 electronic systems of your enemies 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.660
 attorney 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.620
 technically this type of electromagnetic field pump is not lethal anymore 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.650
 that does not kill anyone directly but of course if that happened in a 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.360
 populated area there were many deaths the people who were inside the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.700
 automobiles would lose control of these 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.840
 in addition the anarchy that would be unleashed instantly source ap 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 just like lasers and the rays of death 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.360
 a p-pump can impact with surprising accuracy 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.490
 what happens with this type of electromagnetic field weapons is that scale 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.730
 very easy menseguéz and you could use something that was like a bomb and 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.330
 detonate them just sweat to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.280
 try to destroy an entire city but you could also create artifacts 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 much smaller ones that would have a much more limited scope 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.030
 that way could attend a particular neighborhood could be a 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.320
 flatter these reimbursements together to try to destroy the stock exchanges 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.280
 the war of the future looks more and more like a scene from a movie of 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.150
 Science fiction 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.930
 and perhaps frustrated only protection to avoid being annihilating them too 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.010
 come from science fiction 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.159
 the energy barrier produced 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:12.159
 a force field 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.489
 year and almost magical 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.589
 it is the fourth state of matter 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.339
 after the solid the liquid and the gas 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.760
 müller a lot of fascinating research is being done 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:32.969
 related to the plasma the plasma is a type of matter and that is composed 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:37.159
 by highly initiated gas is literally the substance from which the 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:38.899
 stars 

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:40.759
 the deadline is the election 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.079
 indicates that the stars are seen in the Milky Way 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.079
 the largest portion of plasma that we see daily is the sun 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:52.979
 plasma is as effective as a force field because it is composed of a 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:57.309
 moving mass with very excited atoms that act like tornadoes that 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.139
 fractures and destroy the energy waves that try to pierce it 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.669
 the air force of the united states knows the potential of the plasma and from 

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:13.299
 1996 have funded the work of dr universal music a pioneer in the field 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.299
 of the plasma 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:20.010
 working in his laboratory the nickname miguel diversity in norfolk virginia 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.230
 the doctor looked like he showed the power of the plasma using an artifact that 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.129
 the invention called on the asthma track 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.379
 emits a small burst of plasma that can kill germs that 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.149
 instantly 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.619
 grandson to the tip of the plasma pencil that came practically what I am 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.549
 doing is eliminating any practice since it could be there 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.459
 but it is not yours estimating an individual in a mourning 

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:49.059
 can kill bacteria but we are not human to 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:56.150
 the army is already trying to place plasma force fields in 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:57.540
 the home reactors 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.819
 as the next generation of furtive technology 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.519
 the idea is to take something like the plasma pen expand it kim mount it on 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.659
 different points of the plane 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:11.920
 the plasma emitted by the device will create a force field that 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.919
 will protect the aircraft from the fierce highs 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.229
 the army is already trying to place plasma force fields in 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.780
 the home reactors as the next generation of furtive technology 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.600
 the idea is to take something like on the track the sma expand it kim ride it on 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.740
 different points of the plane 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.010
 the plasma emitted by the device will create a force field that 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.009
 protect the plane from the fierce reach of ground radars 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.200
 an opera radar reflecting electromagnetic waves in an object 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.909
 the plasma field would destroy these waves 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.909
 making the plane undetectable 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:56.289
 the doctor's studies accuse him of focusing on what is known as 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:57.740
 cold plasma 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.740
 because it can be created in environments at room temperature 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.250
 is the type of plasma observed in the glow of a teleocho screen or 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.520
 in the image of a plasma screen television 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.919
 even when development on the tracks goes for non-military use 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.840
 for lakes and it is clear that the first deadlines may one day serve as 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.309
 defense against certain types of directed energy weapons 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.689
 we know that plasma can absorb and reflect the radiation we know from 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.210
 example that you can do with microwaves 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.479
 but radiation there are different frequencies and energies and we can not 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:35.449
 declare in general that it can absorb all kinds of energy or all kinds of 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:38.499
 radiation 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:42.789
 but the objective is to develop force fields that serve as a defense against 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.629
 all 

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:47.639
 from the rays of death to nuclear missiles and the solution can 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.769
 be in the hot plasmas of the guy seen in a ray who the sun 

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:56.899
 if the country fairer and cleaner and could evaporate divert objects 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.919
 physical ap 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.099
 a hot plasma force field pap urizar and here instantaneously 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.240
 any gun fired at him 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.009
 he would be the great innovator in the war 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.479
 but it can be built 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.710
 scientists from the energy department of the national laboratory of 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.710
 brookhaven created the first hot plasma force field 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.669
 they call them plasma windows 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:26.219
 with almost one meter in height and less than 30 centimeters in diameter the 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:30.799
 If you reduce the temperature of this miniature force field, 

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:35.229
 12 thousand degrees Celsius approximately three hundred times hotter than the 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:38.229
 air at room temperature 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:43.679
 the challenge is to expand a plasma window in a force field that can protect 

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:48.879
 silos missile tanks in cluso entire cities without reducing the passes 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:51.050
 lists 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.039
 It would be very expensive pig so it will not happen in the near future but 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.909
 physically it is not impossible 

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:01.349
 One solution could be to place hot and cold plasma capable 

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:03.989
 similar to how the bid is placed
