00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.839
 on the occasion of the Christmas season 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.620
 we set up several devices 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:19.830
 so in the terminals we have a lot of 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:23.610
 decoration and games 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.310
 interactive with the lights have little 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.240
 changed the lights tumble fir trees 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.240
 in the terminals 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.289
 Oh 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 e 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.440
 how 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 and 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.370
 we put a new device so that 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.800
 this terminal is simultaneously in the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.050
 terminals and on our facebook page 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000
 airports of lyon where we put 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.860
 provision an advent calendar 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 so fit 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.140
 Christmas balls so every day the 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.450
 people click on a ball and there 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.030
 there are some possibilities either there is 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.490
 a draw and there are thousands 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.760
 of gifts to win an ipad tickets 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.030
 airplane wonder boxes or packs 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.040
 family or then second possibility 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.250
 Santa Claus who wander in our 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.170
 terminals are taking pictures with the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.540
 passengers they distribute flyers there 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.330
 has an ipad for more interactivity 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.690
 either he also takes some videos a little 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.610
 fun and crazy to entertain our 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.009
 travelers and there is a fourth 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.280
 the challenges in fact we ask 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.369
 our netizens to propose clears so 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.020
 Santa Claus that day must realize the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.950
 pledge so today for example must 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:47.900
 to blackmail 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.200
 little santa claus to the passengers killed 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:56.009
 we 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:57.770
 when you come down from the sky I played 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.800
 not better 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.990
 do not forget 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.610
 my little shoe 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.490
 the idea yes is to energize the airport 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.630
 of the animated during the period 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.420
 christmas which is a period like enough 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 important and loaded at the airport and 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.730
 it's also to create interactivity 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.650
 with our fans on the facebook page 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
 really wanted to connect the two this 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.700
 we do a lot things a little 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.080
 separately a lot on facebook and he 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.580
 No link of our terminals and 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.270
 today it's really a 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.000
 innovation on 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.080
 we also promise our two airports pages 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.890
 from lyon facebook in 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890
