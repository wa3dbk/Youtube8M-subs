00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:15.500
 So let's see how good we are now in 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.369
 this new track for indesign c 2014 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.830
 in the pop fixed layout the big one 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.560
 advantage of epub text layout is just 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.619
 that the layout remains similar 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.920
 as it has the pdf with the advantage 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.750
 but that we just html here 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.890
 have substructure 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:40.210
 I'm never going to export one 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:44.300
 animation put in indesign and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:46.039
 export the whole thing to a pop fixed 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.120
 learn everything clearly 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.569
 Exactly I am now animated in aix 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.729
 I'm in a lonely hotel night 

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:58.549
 assembled something I'll show you 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.979
 In short, the preview that is such a small 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:04.220
 animation when i put the lightbulb 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:06.320
 meet so comes from light and exactly that 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.899
 I want to layout now in my text 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.289
 have in there 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:15.829
 I go purely animated and match 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:19.490
 publish this from an arrow 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:22.990
 animated clearing package where do I do that 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.380
 I do that in my case on the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:29.990
 desk and I have that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.609
 Preview the post your image already 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.859
 deposited and can now publish 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.909
 I write that out now have to 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.189
 the desktop of this behavior and 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.520
 switch to design and can do it all 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:50.329
 to place normally like an image file 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:55.159
 So this arrow will place this arrow 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:56.590
 animation from being opened at it 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.380
 just times 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.030
 now the preview of the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:07.720
 so I put that whole there 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.190
 down and of course, too 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.350
 the background and everything I have now 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:20.170
 still exporting is to one 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:24.210
 pop fixed layout file export firmly 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.440
 the layout is simply translated fixed 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.600
 and I'm going with it 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.300
 default settings through here 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.040
 I say in which sender 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:35.860
 be shown 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.110
 I have a book on it now than mine 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:47.410
 simulation and I have to do that now 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:49.600
 sometimes it just says export and 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:53.260
 here you can see in ibooks running 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.910
 animation and I can even light one 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.620
 and switch off 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:02.890
 genius is really a digital one 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.240
 The interactive format was the visit 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:09.700
 that's exactly what i like dfb 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.300
 Eleven I can for example message 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.230
 search and have the meeting in it 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.230
 my article
