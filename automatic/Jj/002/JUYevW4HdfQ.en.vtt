00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.520
 on a piece of land lost in the Mount a 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:19.220
 single young man has built this 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:22.310
 good chalet I really know what 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.650
 they installed the house of 60 in two days 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.919
 square meters and all permits in 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.140
 rule is actually an old container 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:32.780
 who sailed the seas of ship by boat 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.090
 transporting a thousand and one goods like this 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.300
 that a Basque company has transformed into 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.320
 functional sustainable housing and more 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.320
 cheap than the chalet 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.769
 waiting in factories cheaper 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.769
 trunks 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.829
 the houses are always endowed 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.629
 with what is the kitchen and all the 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.250
 appliances and bathroom equipment then 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.989
 already the distribution of 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.000
 rooms the furniture and so on 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.799
 brand the end customer the adventure 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.019
 business to equip as homes 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.360
 maritime containers has been met 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.610
 However, with the problem of lack of 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.680
 financing banks and the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.170
 potential clients so a 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.360
 company with roofs has decided to give 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.880
 a twist to the idea of 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.880
 recycle the goods carrier drawers 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.970
 We decided to diversify a bit and we 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.590
 it happened then to reach agreements of 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.120
 collaboration with other types of companies and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.460
 this is one of them for example here 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.290
 you have a playground that was designed 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.540
 Well with an iso 20 and good and we can 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.600
 design then with two containers one 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.760
 large one small one a children's park in 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.110
 the inside of a container is a 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.840
 more example of the projects 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.330
 alternatives that the company shuffles to 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.290
 get ahead how to convert those 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.820
 gigantic chests in mobile workshops 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.880
 mobile laboratories cameras 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.340
 refrigerating nomadic ice factories or 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.930
 industrial kitchens with spirit 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.810
 traveler the facilities that 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.950
 we organize are mobile facilities 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.110
 Normally, the same as what is then 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.580
 you have never a little camp of 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.770
 work of a company that is 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.420
 destined in mining and we need a 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.340
 industrial kitchen then when the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 exploitation or if you want to move it 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.489
 Well, they have no problem, 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.630
 which would take the industrial kitchen the 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.760
 I would move to another camp 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.980
 who was going to tell this container 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.810
 that covered the route of the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.510
 americans transporting screws and 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.210
 industrial engines that would end up like 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.260
 pool of balls enjoying the 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.260
 endless energy
