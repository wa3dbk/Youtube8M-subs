00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.390
 my friends of the three months is a trio of classical music not really classic 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.850
 it is a cordesse formation of trumpets which explora directory of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.980
 Baroque music after two years of tour in France and Belgium and its 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.320
 three young musicians have just released their first CD 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.330
 his first CD revealing their enthusiasm and talent 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.330
 among the three months earlier the compound trio of the game when we need 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.610
 of a + law the questions of the trumpet 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.300
 and the domain of rocks goffette on the organ 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.239
 all three met at the end of their graduate studies and 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.200
 discovered musical affinities we from mikel landa we first started 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.520
 to work a little together cons 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.140
 even though our studies 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.220
 together at the conservatory of cork 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.220
 we started to work for a few months 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.650
 my concern is precisely 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.740
 12 grand slam 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.090
 and that's how the trio started 4 because we were all 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.390
 two 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.570
 attracted by this repertoire and will help really wanted to found something 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.970
 so they decided to shout certainly the safest 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.880
 mm it's only for the trumpets to make a recent text its 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.490
 members the most extreme is that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.060
 to expand a little 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.259
 in our program with more contemporary pieces in hand now 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.280
 a friend who make up a room for us three 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.500
 it is therefore 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.390
 to but otherwise it concentrates 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.990
 census will be happy German Italian Baroque music 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.390
 and a small English hollow 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.700
 over two years of work directories 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.010
 they occur on many occasions in Belgium and abroad 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.950
 strong of this experience they decided to release their first cd we have 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.640
 decided to record in bastogne 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.950
 why the theme 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.850
 she asks France 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.130
 a win in the teacher's contest claims opponent who holds 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.100
 the organ so we had secure access 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.170
 instrument 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.480
 we follow his city not only from time to time 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.670
 for all they have precisely it is much more practical for the technique 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
 how did this influence 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.520
 we recorded years 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.530
 four nights you can fight all that is beautiful he the dollar saw that the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.289
 two behemoths I listened to the high street 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.379
 otherwise it's going very well 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.749
 several prisons a little tired from time to time but still in the 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:23.099
 good mood and the result is there our young musicians are particularly 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.700
 proud to present this cd 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.150
 and it is the result of a long work in search of the quality 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.410
 in phrasing the technique of interpretation products found 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.750
 most of the repertoire of the concerts essentially the written pieces 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.869
 originally for two trumpets except for 

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:40.899
 of the concerto de jean-baptiste related 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.879
 so if it's disconcerting who are they for two trumpets and and aurier to 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.109
 originally we who said on Saturday the mans of freddy nor 36 water ski supposedly 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.419
 hospital bar 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.419
 we still wanted to put a coin 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.879
 the author of the piece to let him rest a few days 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.459
 so we heard to make a little touch 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.499
 for our country this first self-produced cd with the help of some 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:10.949
 sponsors and all an excellent business card to destroy it allows us 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:11.629
 better 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.089
 and make us known and demonstrate 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.089
 a bit of a glimpse of 2012 in addition to what we can give 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.059
 as for available 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.179
 he is available at the virton tourist office 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:24.969
 to the tourist office 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.579
 of gembloux 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.899
 it is available on our website so we can order on our website 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:34.609
 for the rock mickaÃ«l chain orange foot 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.379
 the minister is scheduled to appear on July 20 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.629
 this contest 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.629
 in total the result in brussels to which flowers in the city 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.969
 in paris 2 1% in marly
