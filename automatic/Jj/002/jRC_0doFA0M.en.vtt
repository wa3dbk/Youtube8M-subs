00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 This video can be a bit provocative 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.140
 I want to work on a whole 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.680
 certain thing goes out and that's why 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.680
 until the end 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.469
 oh vegan since new are everywhere 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.389
 Almost everything is vegan milan vegan 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.949
 patties away a doner so it can 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.330
 that's why eight reasons do not go further 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.859
 why you should not become a vegan 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.779
 First, you are on animal cruelty 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.430
 to listen to someone an animal in the whole 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.050
 lock small cage and without him 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.430
 narcosis or analgesic the testes too 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.289
 remove and sound like one to you 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.599
 then you should not have a lot of fun 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.560
 second, you have the environment 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.000
 the production of animal products 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.410
 It's a pretty big problem 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 for the environment at least for the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.260
 Climate change is the city's responsibility 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.000
 for everyone out there the environment 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.770
 Huston continues to be the most effective way 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.840
 To destroy is the food of milk 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 Eggs and meat printing you are then 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.620
 Are you a lion running the saliva ? 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.329
 mouth together if anna booty behind 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 hunt and as soon as it got caught 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.250
 you tear it with your fangs 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 and eats the meat raw on the spot if 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 yes, then the vegan lifestyle 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.079
 nothing for you fat world hunger goes 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.640
 past the ass by a kilogram 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.079
 you need 16 to produce meat 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.550
 kilograms of grain that would be with 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.229
 following situation you comparable 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.640
 cooks seven kilograms of spaghetti 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 absolutely in the program and throw the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 remaining 65 kilograms just garbage 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.680
 maneuverably keeps this waste cold 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
 then I will definitely not vegan 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.310
 You could run a factory or 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.600
 a slaughterhouse seriously 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.340
 slaughterhouse operates the coal making 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.900
 So it is important to the consumer 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.100
 then the meat of animals eat suffer 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.659
 and would have to die does not matter 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.009
 the main thing is the profit are wrong 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.500
 attitude we totally talk that 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 Vegan lifestyle 6 is for you 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.530
 law of the stronger so some people 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.820
 it is morally acceptable to believe 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.250
 to abuse someone only at times 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.240
 is simply stronger or opposite to her 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.979
 weak if you are with this 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.720
 view again then recognize finger away 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.280
 from the vegan lifestyle looks 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 you are a calf producing a cow 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.549
 just as people again for a reason 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.070
 Milk as food for the newborn 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.840
 why with the tiny calf to one 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.490
 strong crew grows up even 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.079
 can be up to 1200 kilograms 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 if you are too strong a beef 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.079
 want to grow up then drinks 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.399
 continue cow milk and the last point 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.110
 your health is the dumbest 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.750
 Studies prove that animal fats 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.460
 meat cheese 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.200
 Milk is not healthy we fucking fuck it 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.210
 continue to eat heart-circulation problems 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.190
 Diabetes cancer is overweight yet 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.540
 to get everything but fantasies of others 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.710
 but that perhaps I do not if 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.810
 the your attitude then makes 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.270
 a big bow around the vegan 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.470
 lifestyle 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.030
 Fun aside this video was on 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.500
 a peter article built exactly like that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.640
 Sarcastic was just like watching videos 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.050
 I personally do not think that mine 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.280
 evil man is one meat 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.260
 After all , we were meat eating 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.580
 educated and the human being is also generally 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.350
 An omnivore I do not think so 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.790
 good because trying to convince so leeb 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.260
 absolutely because everyone has to be on their own 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.670
 discover yourself and then live it out 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.900
 For example, if not at all 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.580
 how can what but shit 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.410
 nobody thinks this is true anyway 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.120
 they will live a better vegan life 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.860
 you can even get completely unhealthy as a vegan 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 doing a very healthy life right then 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.880
 Two very popular youtubers live vegan 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.220
 namely accident so played 7-leadership and 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.050
 A total of 21 in the process of building muscle 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.520
 is and played around because he is healthy 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.780
 and probably also if I am here 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.010
 I do not know exactly at this point 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.540
 We too can dream of creating ourselves 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.410
 greet namely cook because of the ever 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.260

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.459
 live between these two fronts and 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.140
 I would say that is life 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.580
