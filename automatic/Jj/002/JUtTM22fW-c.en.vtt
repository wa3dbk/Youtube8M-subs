00:01:32.889 --> 00:01:32.899 
is so ridiculous amount of damage that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.960 
is so ridiculous amount of damage that
two-handed<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.310> pope<00:01:34.520> wear<00:01:34.700> that<00:01:34.789> does

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
800 damage almost it's ridiculous but I

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.880 
800 damage almost it's ridiculous but I
figured<00:01:38.810> it'd<00:01:38.930> be<00:01:38.960> more<00:01:39.200> entertaining<00:01:39.409> more
