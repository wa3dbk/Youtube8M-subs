00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.650
 We are going to prepare some fake ice cream 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.240
 with cupcakes or muffins 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.210
 The first thing you need is our 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 contests that you are seeing here ice cream 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.750
 and some muffins 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.520
 you can fill us with trout or with 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.060
 some gift that you want some candy or 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.250
 some surprises on top we put the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 cupcake check that the diameter is 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.590
 Now we're going to decorate them with 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.980
 fondant to cover them with different 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.980
 colors 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.380
 i 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 Well the first thing is that you have to do 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.920
 a circle that covers it more or less and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 now you remember it like that, undulating 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.489
 making a kind of waves so that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.489
 look like melted ice cream 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.650
 with the circle above we have already 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.760
 proven that it is enough 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.309
 big enough to cover all the maddalena 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.140
 we are not going again it is correct then now 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.610
 to paste it, we are going to mount it in this 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.950
 I'm going to use marmalade 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.570
 strawberry but you can use a toilet 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.979
 cream or anything else that is a 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.990
 little of the thing to hit is 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.970
 important if you want you can also 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.619
 Fill the cupcake with chocolate 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.259
 example you have a hole and fill it 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.909
 jce a little the same good jam 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.009
 Well here we have it well stuck and 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:26.890
 we do the same with the others I'm going to 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:30.270
 do 31 yellow not pink and one green 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.270
 and we repeat the operation 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.950
 now to decorate it is a little bit and 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.090
 make them more fun I'm going to make them 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.780
 a few eyes blank background style and with 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.280
 a straw a little wide the cane 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.500
 it marked the eyes that I have been left 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.440
 inside with a skewer a stick 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.050
 the retreats here to paste them 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.440
 just a little bit of jam with 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.710
 a pincelito ready here I already have both 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.710
 bear 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.700
 I do the same with the other three 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.430
 to draw the pupil I will use a 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.090
 edible black marker also 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.010
 you can put another piece of fondant or 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.410
 draw some other color to use 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.080
 green red markers you are the 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.820
 way you want 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.340
 I think they're more fun if 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.720
 they look sideways in pink as it goes 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.660
 being a girl had drawn him some 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.380
 eyelashes also with the marker 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.380
 i 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.470
 Y 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.920
 good for the mouth with the same page 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.269
 you see simply pressed and the 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.269
 brand we make a half moon 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.430
 the girl had placed a bow 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.920
 then with white sleeve on this 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.640
 case the color you want obviously 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.260
 I do this way that you are seeing 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.050
 I crush the sides and the one in the 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.910
 center and now I'm just going to 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.200
 cut out another piece to close the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.670
 loop to simulate the new center for 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.390
 I have it look that is easy to make a 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.150
 side and I paste it again with a little 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 of jam 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.760
 I'm going to put it aside so that 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.299
 stay and look funnier list or 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.299
 The habitat 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.140
 to others of them what draw a mouth 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.750
 I will make a half moon or half 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:31.870
 circle better in red and I'll put it 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.410
 a little wind dish calculation a little 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.410
 measures 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.500
 and placed a little fondant on top of it 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.450
 I have my little mouth with a tooth and I go back 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.950
 to stick with my jam with a lot 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.360
 Be careful not to put too much and not 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.520
 come out on the sides that if you do not 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.260
 would see and that the combative 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.650
 and the third one so I'm going to do it 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.650
 little hat 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.380
 a circle 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.850
 with green fondant I always use the 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.030
 same color of fondant to make 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.709
 fire with each other and how 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.390
 you lived from a little ball the 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.490
 crush to make a kind of barrel 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.940
 or cylinder and placed it on top of me 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.510
 circle 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.130
 to decorate a little red strip 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.130
 simulate a loop around the 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.270
 men and before you can invent 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.380
 a cap other tie hair what you want 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.770
 decorate your fakes a little 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.770
 ice creams 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.270
 and then later also on a side there 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.490
 there's another one that I see that stays a little 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.020
 calvete I'll make some ricitos know 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.910
 I make a trickle of fondant what 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.250
 I'm going to roll in a spiral like a 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.250
 piglet ball more or less rolled 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.870
 if you do not have these cones these contests 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.880
 that are a bit hard to find 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.889
 you can use the normal courses 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.570
 finished in tip and slide the trick 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:57.979
 what we have done in the cones of 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.220
 popcorn that I leave the video here at 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.220
 final 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.790
 the expert 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:12.300
 I have ready for the snack 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.300
 God
