00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 but I'm here with a passion of the mass 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.090
 there of conception of the palace spirit 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.179
 santo marcio dal bo 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.990
 I think the globe writes me right for 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.870
 on here 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:21.119
 He sent me some pictures of the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:23.100
 board the notebook is diagrams 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.310
 schematic and he was doubtful about 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.859
 esse sk 1045 and 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.859
 It's good, first I wanted to talk to you. 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.750
 next is very interesting for those who 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.059
 works with electronics today maintenance 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.610
 electronics is the knowledge of 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.070
 with you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.840
 catalog component you take photo 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.780
 giving this helps a lot 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 so he diagnoses electronics 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.500
 It's better with the use of information technology then 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 here i have his folder here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.570
 his great dilemma is this component 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.399
 Here I'll show you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.129
 seeing that the plate this component here 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.290
 I think it 's over 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.720
 I'll zoom in on another question for the 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.720
 visual inspection a high photo 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.040
 It helps a lot of people a lot. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.310
 even without having the notion 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.500
 then the great doubt of it here is this 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.259
 component here ok sk sk 1045 y on the plate 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.780
 is marked as pdd 16 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.869
 It's good, first I wanted to 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.960
 bit about this board is me 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.560
 make a new visual evaluation of the board 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.350
 I find soldering is mainly in this 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.960
 connector that gives very bad input 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.670
 quality you are seeing here you see that the 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.240
 amount of sodium is required 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:49.740
 learn the component the board is lower 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.229
 then you see that there are gaps between the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.380
 then soldered and connected that the connector 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 which is connected to the source has reduced 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.909
 little here we're able to see 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.430
 the connector as soon as it comes from the 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.189
 source then the first situation to 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.530
 inspect whether revise these studio only 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.200
 that seen this board is not calling 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 so he comes here and you were going to make a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 visual inspection seems to me that this welding 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.360
 it's not a 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.299
 lead tin a single solder 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.040
 I do not know if this equipment was 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.010
 made in Brazil 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.430
 if it was made in Brazil 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:30.989
 It could use welding of is lead tin 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:34.890
 here's his model, okay, compaq 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.659
 and that 42 of the angels are 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.220
 which does not have a specification of 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.260
 where it was made but we will not 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.120
 learn a lot in this 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.370
 so his big dilemma is the question 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.879
 this component is good that it 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.680
 dodo was left a zoom and is to 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.989
 people work on that purchase 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
 this component here that looks 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.470
 interesting when you zoom in on 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.720
 can clearly see here the sk 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.950
 1045 and often with the naked eye you 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.920
 Can not you see, then it 's interesting. 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.629
 you do that review with a photo're 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.859
 Good, I'll stop by the video. 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.859
 here a little while back
