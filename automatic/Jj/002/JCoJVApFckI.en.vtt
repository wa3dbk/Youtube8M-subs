00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:17.810
 is so 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.060
 I have brought some of you here today. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.730
 the instructions 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.109
 about 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.939
 the use very interesting 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.329
 crying is seven 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.130
 of playstation 3 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.850
 or any other st peter pan 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.550
 you do not use it on your computer 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 if he offers this technology 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 What happens in the last period the last video I made for you I 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.070
 warm my curiosity a little 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.310
 and decided to check 5 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.650
 occurs from 7 to fall only 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.490
 better than these occupants 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.480
 is also compatible with your computer 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 it is then mp also thinking I decided to test 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.490
 and I discovered that it is really possible for you to get out of 7 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.000
 in your computer 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.180
 and today I'm going to show you how you do it 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.920
 I blame them I do not intend to be filming the screen of my computer because as 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.560
 you can see 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890
 not very clear in the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.149
 so I'll make a small cut that in the river of a small incision 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.140
 I'm a young girl on the screen but with sharma that for now on the side of 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.350
 It's what you need to do. 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.990
 first of all 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.700
 on your computer or notebook I'm going to have you here in the leg and neck 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.590
 and i'm sorry 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.280
 given on your computer or on your notebook and probably 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.740
 you must have a key 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.420
 show me my choice 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.060
 no prosel 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.280
 You took your bluetooth. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.460
 in the case of my notebook this key quit 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.750
 so we already help you, you want 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.550
 you do not know very well 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.800
 a serious reason 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.250
 they are a little more limited 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.130
 so the special functions are on the keys that function like airplane here 2 and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.110
 3 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 in case of mine where I use this special function 'has a key that only 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.439
 the notebooks have that is a key that is used for you to use 

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:13.099
 is a second function of the other three 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.579
 so I'll press this one up with here 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.009
 our kind in a way a little more 

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:22.879
 and then I'll press that one up here 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.669
 you can see that that called the rec 7 seemed to message but did not give much 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.429
 time 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.469
 so down here 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.290
 let's go here 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.529
 here too the rock icon 7 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:37.179
 positive aspect of poland tourism very well because the camera has little 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:38.799
 resolution 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.559
 but I'll sort this out very soon 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:46.619
 or so far we've been here almost half the way just doing this 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.829
 After you're going to do 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.469

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:52.899

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.779
 according to him 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.169
 for about a 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.219
 if it's going to hold the ground it starts to blink 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.049
 and even between search mode I need to have skin pressed 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.229
 read is also not in search mode now 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:10.539
 What are you going to do on your computer? 

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.969
 you will enter the options 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:14.989
 I'm looking for a network 7 now 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.579
 Looking for something here with some gadget 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.560
 so now I can have a child 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.310
 and I'm going to put that maximum computer so you can see better 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.589
 on sunday squid 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.069
 after you leave the industry 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.349
 the redesign tina modotti 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.209
 larry king gross 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.789
 rock classics 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.329
 added a device 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.659
 that already the unions 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.959
 so that's how it appeared in the air the naspers explained 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.769
 hostel click here above 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.089
 It is okay to connect the device 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:51.539
 have to wait a long time 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.699
 There you come here. 

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:56.969
 enter the pairing code it's always good to come here 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.439
 the reds study these others have none so rushed and only you 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.249
 because 000 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.129
 Ah, it's four fiscal years 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.129
 and you will advance 

00:04:17.249 --> 00:04:20.499
 here you can see why Sergio was installed 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.640
 then merchant has been installed and you are going to make yourselves go 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.639
 start testing the device here 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:33.039
 that is between Tunisia 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.539
 and in the recent one on the power button you will press once 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.050
 he already recognizes in it 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:46.139
 recognize your device it will probably start another 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.139
 soon he will install the driver 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 then it will be possible since the device 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:57.779
 So how would you fish now? 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.889
 here is a device that we just installed now partners want to give up 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:07.759
 it's working 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.430
 I ask you to explain is my truth from here people seem what 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.330
 assumes your computer it will start always the action is constituted 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.379
 a headset then it starts appearing on your recent possible you 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:23.089
 is able to earn his livelihood 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:26.179
 so it was all this if you want to use some kind of recording 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:28.990
 still king 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:31.529
 in the southern options 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:34.300
 evair recording devices 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.589

 It's already working perfectly. 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:42.789
 that rita space indicating it here because it is the microphone of my notebook 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.889
 It's being used now for the card is not to capture that my voice 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.050
 that is why you will notice that they involved my voice so little 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.529
 distant because I'm able to use my 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:55.029
 is seven points 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.949
 decreed in the problem that is full of the south 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:01.930
 but spain having a microphone doubles over Japan runs in the gulf 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.669
 Themes were for you and great 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:04.749

 if they are military 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.969
 already increased here 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.639

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:22.129
 from windows 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.379
 only one of them is possible for any 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:26.460
 problem 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.110
