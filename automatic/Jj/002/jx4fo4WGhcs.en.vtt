00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 Hey, man, it 's starting here one more. 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.270
 video so I'm playing here stark 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.410
 71 Which is a horror game is at night 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.059
 at home in the home of others and this 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.120
 good to play terror games so let's 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.120
 over there 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.439
 matters then the game is based on that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.289
 baggage is here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.760
 it's kind of like a pacman you have 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.369
 Cutting on the steps is a joke in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 and is based on taking everything but 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.120
 There are obstacles that I still do not know. 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:45.809
 that that little monkey was there 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:55.590
 Calm down, let's go there again. 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:58.260
 now I've been able to do well because every 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.760
 centimeter of a monkey 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
 I've never had problems with the monkey in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.760
 my life I think it's not a question of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.850
 if the monkey think the question of you 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.320
 come to have a thing know how the water is 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.689
 fill has speedy 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.360
 nothing will happen now now 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.240
 I lost my fear now it's over 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.240
 the magic of terror is over 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.850
 there we go there 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.060
 It's good that it at least saves my status. 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.640
 he does not he has to start everything 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.450
 back to the bag 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:48.990
 will be this human chaff like that 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:52.579
 we're talking about right near one is more 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.140
 Let's not go there instead 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.390
 now it goes 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.880
 I think he's in a red square. 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.490
 It is quite likely that more and more 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.009
 be the monkey it's not close yet 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.729
 So there's no way I'm worried about 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.729
 that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.790
 but I have not even started yet, it 's coming 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:30.050
 And what is this? 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:33.640
 is not to the writer then I get there and 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.640
 15 bye
