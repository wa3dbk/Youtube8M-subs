realistic looking underneath you just

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.000 
realistic looking underneath you just
see<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.200> where<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> was<00:04:07.410> made<00:04:07.620> and<00:04:07.680> it's

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
see that where it was made and it's

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.670 
see that where it was made and it's
pretty<00:04:08.250> basic<00:04:08.640> but<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:09.120> top<00:04:09.360> really<00:04:10.230> nicely

done I really like this weight I think

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.539 
done I really like this weight I think
our<00:04:15.990> deep-sea<00:04:16.470> diver<00:04:16.709> detects<00:04:17.310> something
