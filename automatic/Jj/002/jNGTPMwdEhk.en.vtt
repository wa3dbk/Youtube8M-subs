in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> NBA<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.980> think<00:00:35.370> he<00:00:35.489> will<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.760> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
in the NBA I think he will be a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.940 
in the NBA I think he will be a
first-round<00:00:36.329> draft<00:00:36.870> pick<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.770> see<00:00:37.920> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
first-round draft pick and I can see a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.799 
first-round draft pick and I can see a
team<00:00:38.190> like<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.550> Denver<00:00:38.910> Nuggets<00:00:38.940> taking<00:00:39.629> him

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
team like the Denver Nuggets taking him

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.930 
team like the Denver Nuggets taking him
where<00:00:40.260> coach<00:00:40.500> Brian<00:00:40.860> Shaw<00:00:41.160> runs<00:00:41.460> an<00:00:41.579> up-tempo

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
where coach Brian Shaw runs an up-tempo

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.910 
where coach Brian Shaw runs an up-tempo
style<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:42.870> think<00:00:43.110> would<00:00:43.200> be<00:00:43.350> great<00:00:43.739> for

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
style which I think would be great for

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.490 
style which I think would be great for
TJ<00:00:44.340> Warren<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.870> him<00:00:46.050> making<00:00:46.289> an

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
TJ Warren and I see him making an

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.590 
TJ Warren and I see him making an
adjustment<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.129> high<00:00:47.460> altitude<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:48.420> there

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
adjustment to the high altitude up there

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
adjustment to the high altitude up there
