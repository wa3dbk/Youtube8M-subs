give them life course so life cores are
like<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.139> and<00:02:55.500> a<00:02:56.400> life<00:02:56.549> core<00:02:56.790> is<00:02:56.970> crafted

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:57.389 
like this and a life core is crafted

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.360 
like this and a life core is crafted
just<00:02:57.599> like<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.170> for<00:02:58.409> power<00:02:58.680> course<00:02:59.010> which

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
just like this so for power course which

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
and then a lava bucket so these will

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.550 
and then a lava bucket so these will
increase<00:03:05.099> their<00:03:05.310> life<00:03:05.579> but<00:03:06.389> then<00:03:06.689> if<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.379> want

to take this right here and then give

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.379 
to take this right here and then give
them<00:03:10.470> an<00:03:10.650> infinite<00:03:12.290> infinite<00:03:13.290> life<00:03:14.189> core<00:03:14.459> they

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
them an infinite infinite life core they

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.509

can have this all done behind the back
so<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:13.530> could<00:04:13.680> build<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:14.010> wall<00:04:14.250> here<00:04:14.669> put<00:04:15.000> a

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
so you could build a wall here put a

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.610 
so you could build a wall here put a
chest<00:04:15.299> be<00:04:15.479> at<00:04:15.599> put<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.870> anvil<00:04:16.019> behind<00:04:16.500> there

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
chest be at put an anvil behind there

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.830 
chest be at put an anvil behind there
and<00:04:16.650> keeping<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.130> in<00:04:17.430> there<00:04:17.669> pop<00:04:18.449> your<00:04:18.630> stuff

and keeping this in there pop your stuff
in<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.260> then<00:04:19.709> he'll<00:04:19.859> take<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:21.239> then

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
in there and then he'll take it and then

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.330 
in there and then he'll take it and then
bring<00:04:22.139> it<00:04:22.229> back<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.560> you<00:04:22.889> want<00:04:23.039> to<00:04:23.099> take<00:04:23.190> that

bring it back in you want to take that

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.379 
bring it back in you want to take that
because<00:04:23.639> it's<00:04:23.820> fully

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
because it's fully

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.550 
because it's fully
done<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:26.520> I<00:04:26.550> guess<00:04:26.669> I'll<00:04:26.939> show<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.210> just<00:04:28.050> one

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
done so I guess I'll show you just one

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.260 
done so I guess I'll show you just one
last<00:04:28.590> thing<00:04:28.919> before<00:04:29.039> is<00:04:29.930> the<00:04:31.819> the<00:04:32.819> cube<00:04:33.060> call

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
last thing before is the the cube call

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.200 
last thing before is the the cube call
and<00:04:33.539> the<00:04:34.110> instant<00:04:34.529> queue<00:04:34.650> call<00:04:34.949> the<00:04:35.759> cube<00:04:35.969> Carl

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
and the instant queue call the cube Carl

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.850 
and the instant queue call the cube Carl
will<00:04:36.360> just<00:04:36.509> bring<00:04:36.689> them<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.139> it's<00:04:37.409> crafted

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
will just bring them to you it's crafted

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.670 
will just bring them to you it's crafted
like<00:04:38.249> this<00:04:38.460> in<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:39.659> instant<00:04:40.020> group<00:04:40.169> call<00:04:40.439> it's

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
like this in the instant group call it's

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.200 
like this in the instant group call it's
crafted<00:04:41.039> like<00:04:41.189> this<00:04:41.370> obviously<00:04:41.909> you<00:04:41.999> need<00:04:42.150> a

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
crafted like this obviously you need a

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.100 
crafted like this obviously you need a
normal<00:04:42.509> cube<00:04:42.719> call<00:04:42.930> first<00:04:43.199> so<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.889> cube<00:04:44.099> call

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
normal cube call first so the cube call

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.920 
normal cube call first so the cube call
will<00:04:46.110> tell<00:04:46.259> them<00:04:46.409> hey<00:04:46.680> come<00:04:46.919> here<00:04:47.719> so<00:04:48.719> he'll

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
will tell them hey come here so he'll

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:50.600 
will tell them hey come here so he'll
walk<00:04:49.110> to<00:04:49.289> you<00:04:49.409> and<00:04:49.620> then<00:04:49.949> an<00:04:50.069> instant<00:04:50.460> cube

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
walk to you and then an instant cube

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.959 
walk to you and then an instant cube
call<00:04:50.879> is<00:04:51.409> a<00:04:52.409> teleporter<00:04:53.129> so<00:04:53.520> he<00:04:53.610> kind<00:04:53.759> of<00:04:53.819> just

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
call is a teleporter so he kind of just

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:55.999 
call is a teleporter so he kind of just
teleports<00:04:54.509> to<00:04:54.599> you<00:04:54.840> as<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.199> he<00:04:55.379> was<00:04:55.590> using<00:04:55.830> an

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:56.009 
teleports to you as if he was using an

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.980 
teleports to you as if he was using an
ender<00:04:56.249> pearl<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:58.080> yeah<00:04:58.199> that<00:04:59.039> is<00:04:59.370> cube<00:05:00.090> BOTS<00:05:00.629> i

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
ender pearl so yeah that is cube BOTS i

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.920 
ender pearl so yeah that is cube BOTS i
think<00:05:01.590> i<00:05:01.740> am<00:05:01.800> going<00:05:01.979> to<00:05:02.310> use<00:05:03.000> this<00:05:03.330> module

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
think i am going to use this module

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.390 
think i am going to use this module
early<00:05:04.139> and<00:05:04.319> survival<00:05:04.800> because<00:05:05.009> it<00:05:05.159> seems

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
early and survival because it seems

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.589 
early and survival because it seems
pretty<00:05:05.669> cool<00:05:05.909> and<00:05:06.529> nothing<00:05:07.529> really<00:05:07.949> seems

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:08.599 
pretty cool and nothing really seems

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.080 
pretty cool and nothing really seems
overpowered<00:05:09.599> about<00:05:09.779> it<00:05:09.930> i<00:05:10.020> mean<00:05:10.610> don't<00:05:11.610> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
overpowered about it i mean don't the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.939 
overpowered about it i mean don't the
way<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.389> transfers<00:05:12.990> like<00:05:13.379> you<00:05:13.500> would<00:05:13.620> think<00:05:13.740> Oh

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
way it transfers like you would think Oh

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.689 
way it transfers like you would think Oh
repairing<00:05:14.610> it<00:05:14.759> takes<00:05:14.969> XP<00:05:15.839> levels<00:05:16.229> but<00:05:16.699> there's

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
repairing it takes XP levels but there's

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.939 
repairing it takes XP levels but there's
a<00:05:17.759> time<00:05:18.060> the<00:05:18.659> more<00:05:18.870> damage<00:05:19.080> the<00:05:19.529> longer<00:05:19.860> it

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
a time the more damage the longer it

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.769 
a time the more damage the longer it
takes<00:05:20.129> for<00:05:20.279> it<00:05:20.460> to<00:05:20.490> repair<00:05:20.969> it<00:05:21.120> so<00:05:21.300> it's<00:05:21.689> not

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:21.779 
takes for it to repair it so it's not

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:24.019 
takes for it to repair it so it's not
like<00:05:21.930> instant<00:05:22.409> repair<00:05:22.710> every<00:05:23.099> single<00:05:23.490> time<00:05:23.729> it

00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.029 
like instant repair every single time it

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:26.089 
like instant repair every single time it
does<00:05:24.210> take<00:05:24.449> time<00:05:24.719> to<00:05:24.930> repair<00:05:25.289> I<00:05:25.499> think<00:05:26.009> it's

00:05:26.089 --> 00:05:26.099 
does take time to repair I think it's

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:28.399 
does take time to repair I think it's
five<00:05:26.490> seconds<00:05:27.210> or<00:05:27.419> something<00:05:27.839> like<00:05:27.930> that<00:05:28.020> /

00:05:28.399 --> 00:05:28.409 
five seconds or something like that /

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:30.469 
five seconds or something like that /
something<00:05:29.039> or<00:05:29.279> other<00:05:29.400> so<00:05:30.000> it's<00:05:30.180> definitely

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
something or other so it's definitely

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.659 
something or other so it's definitely
not<00:05:30.839> overpowered<00:05:31.409> though<00:05:31.949> some<00:05:32.250> people<00:05:32.550> might

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
not overpowered though some people might

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:34.550 
not overpowered though some people might
think<00:05:32.729> so<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.779> does<00:05:33.990> take<00:05:34.020> a<00:05:34.199> bunch<00:05:34.469> of

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
think so it does take a bunch of

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.950 
think so it does take a bunch of
material<00:05:35.129> you<00:05:35.789> need<00:05:35.909> a<00:05:35.969> lot<00:05:36.180> of<00:05:36.300> redstone<00:05:36.689> as

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:36.960 
material you need a lot of redstone as

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.260 
material you need a lot of redstone as
you<00:05:37.050> can<00:05:37.229> see<00:05:37.439> not<00:05:38.069> easily<00:05:38.339> for<00:05:38.849> these<00:05:38.969> things

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
you can see not easily for these things

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.700 
you can see not easily for these things
these<00:05:39.449> are<00:05:39.509> replaceable<00:05:40.169> with<00:05:40.379> different

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
these are replaceable with different

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.889 
these are replaceable with different
types<00:05:40.860> of<00:05:41.219> so<00:05:42.060> you<00:05:42.149> can<00:05:42.270> put<00:05:42.419> wood<00:05:42.629> in<00:05:42.659> there

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:42.899 
types of so you can put wood in there

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:45.469 
types of so you can put wood in there
stone<00:05:43.710> in<00:05:43.860> there<00:05:43.979> iron<00:05:44.370> in<00:05:44.490> there<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:45.180> I<00:05:45.240> guess

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
stone in there iron in there and I guess

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.019 
stone in there iron in there and I guess
