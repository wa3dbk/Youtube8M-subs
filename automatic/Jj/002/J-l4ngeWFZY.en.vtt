lot better than the default one for one

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040 
lot better than the default one for one
thing<00:00:17.010> you<00:00:17.130> can<00:00:17.250> search<00:00:17.490> by<00:00:17.520> type<00:00:18.000> which<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
thing you can search by type which I

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.990 
thing you can search by type which I
actually<00:00:19.289> use<00:00:19.590> an<00:00:19.740> add-on<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:20.730> on<00:00:20.880> the

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
actually use an add-on for to do on the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.570 
actually use an add-on for to do on the
default<00:00:21.390> one<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.689> well<00:00:21.900> because<00:00:22.460> searching<00:00:23.460> by

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
default one as well because searching by

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.640 
default one as well because searching by
types<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.180> really<00:00:25.140> really<00:00:26.130> good<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.500> does

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
types is really really good so it does

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.960 
types is really really good so it does
that<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:29.010> well<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.460> also<00:00:29.490> searches

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
that as well but it also searches

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
that as well but it also searches
against<00:00:30.660> type<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.230> if<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.470> want<00:00:31.650> something

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
against type so if you want something

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.770 
against type so if you want something
that's<00:00:32.070> good<00:00:32.309> against<00:00:32.610> aqua<00:00:33.120> types<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.570> shows

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that's good against aqua types it shows

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.930
