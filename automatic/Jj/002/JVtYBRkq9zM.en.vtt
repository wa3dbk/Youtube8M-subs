00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 do not 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.670
 and good from head to toe the colors 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.759
 cakes that shine until darkness 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:15.160
 they are the latest fashion some will feel 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.710
 we will feel like in the 80s 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.540
 because the neon is back in clothes 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.250
 of shoes sectors in this summer good 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.050
 to talk about this trend we 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.750
 accompanies is seen in the franklin and juan 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.810
 Barraza to the life of experts in style 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.250
 and fashion guys, well, as the 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.890
 eighty and well here we can see a 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.560
 clear example of this do not forget 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.350
 do not forget sln and ricardo get into 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.940
 a little bit to your trunk so that they take out 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.870
 some of the clothes they wore in their 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 high school times 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.620
 it's good that they are not offering now 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.079
 these colors that I imagine that then they are 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.960
 aggressive not in any way good 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.340
 we still have influence over the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.440
 last summer the summer trend 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.239
 last that was black color of 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.790
 precisely as it says as well you say 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.649
 80's where colors are combined 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.790
 very strong with especially with the 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:10.729
 black 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.150
 shirts for women good blouses 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.520
 long illusions and so on but in this 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.830
 season the neon comes back and 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.170
 as well you said it even you 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.110

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.570

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:29.170
 and everyone here ando also blocks 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.750
 landmarks that are colors this combined with 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.340
 neutral neutrals as we well know 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.469
 to make kroes marked him 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.820
 in this picture we're going to go our 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.700
 little graphists with about time in 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.369
 this photo we have kim kardashian with 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.219
 a yellow dress is wearing many 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.240
 colorful dresses like yellow 

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.630
 oranges mixed with jazz and accessories 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.909
 neutral color or you can even be 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.759
 Neutral color dress and accessories 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.880
 colors here we are seeing this by 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:06.349
 example in this photograph especially 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:09.470
 for people with something a little bit 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:13.610
 more weight for example the top of the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.290
 belt is your view is going precisely to 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.690
 this season to see those little ones 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.670
 shelves for example she who is 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.930
 obviously it's a little more caderona 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.239
 that you like neutral colors that in 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.989
 this case the black to decrease a 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.660
 bit 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.360
 It has a slimming effect the colors 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.340
 blacks as we all know then in 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.660
 this occasion then in this photograph 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.990
 see what I say 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.290
 in the photo on the right side we see a 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.720
 girl with a neutral color clothes in gray 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.450
 more or less and you can afford to 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 use phosphorescent colors as 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.930
 Casanare wants to enter here clear 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.580
 visible that you do not forget that if 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.930
 they have a strong garment in the part of 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.840
 above try that the bottom part 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.250
 be neutral or vice versa so no no no 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.470
 are going to get strong thing up 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.570
 you run for work only when 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.040
 have some accessories that 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.510
 neutralize for example there we have 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.360
 different jeans 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.210
 this is super trendy the science of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.640
 colors this pastels but it shines but 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.800
 bright not in this case you can 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.150
 combine perfectly with colors 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.250
 neutral as we are seeing that is a 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.630
 perfect example 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.430
 the neutral colors in the part of 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.990
 up and the color jean of course 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.050
 in the bottom part combined also 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.970
 with accessories in neutral colors like 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.860
 in this case black coffee and so on 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.600
 etcetera here are the accessories that 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.580
 It's amazing because you can play with 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.830
 different colors and more 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.090
 daring obviously get several 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.519
 colors 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.989
 but that is a clear example that 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.790
 you can use the neutral colors in the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.590
 red and it 's right the stars of the 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.690
