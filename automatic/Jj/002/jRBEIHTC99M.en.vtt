types<00:00:32.430> guns<00:00:32.820> maps<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.420> everything<00:00:33.780> um<00:00:34.469> so<00:00:34.860> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
types guns maps and everything um so the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.740 
types guns maps and everything um so the
snipers<00:00:35.399> you're<00:00:35.579> starting<00:00:35.820> off<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.090> dsr-50

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
snipers you're starting off the dsr-50

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.130 
snipers you're starting off the dsr-50
and<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.770> ballista<00:00:38.730> i<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.540> tell<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:39.780> guys<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
and the ballista i will tell you guys in

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.840 
and the ballista i will tell you guys in
my<00:00:40.350> opinion<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> ballista<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.700> better

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
my opinion the ballista is the better

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
my opinion the ballista is the better
sniper<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.079> reason<00:00:43.320> behind<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.590> is

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sniper and the reason behind that is

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.610 
sniper and the reason behind that is
it's<00:00:44.489> easier<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.000> pinpoint<00:00:45.450> with<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.899> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
it's easier to pinpoint with and it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.010 
it's easier to pinpoint with and it
comes<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.190> tad<00:00:47.430> faster<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.629> same<00:00:48.809> time

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
comes up a tad faster but the same time

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.170 
comes up a tad faster but the same time
the<00:00:49.170> dsr-50<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:50.879> get<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the dsr-50 you can kind of get that

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
sniping community hopefully something

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.530 
sniping community hopefully something
that<00:01:38.100> will<00:01:38.189> really<00:01:38.369> bring<00:01:39.030> competitive

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that will really bring competitive

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.120 
that will really bring competitive
sniping<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> next<00:01:40.259> level<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.680> really

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
sniping to the next level and I really

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.200 
sniping to the next level and I really
hope<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> see<00:01:41.579> that<00:01:41.790> now<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.560> maps

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
hope to see that now for the maps

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.690 
hope to see that now for the maps
nuketown<00:01:45.210> 2025<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:46.200> my<00:01:46.320> favorite<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.159> far<00:01:47.189> and

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
nuketown 2025 is my favorite so far and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
nuketown 2025 is my favorite so far and
the<00:01:48.659> reason<00:01:48.810> behind<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.290> there's<00:01:49.530> only

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
the reason behind that is there's only

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.870 
the reason behind that is there's only
two<00:01:49.890> head<00:01:50.070> glitches<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.759> whole

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
two head glitches really in the whole

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.679 
two head glitches really in the whole
game<00:01:51.090> maybe<00:01:51.810> three<00:01:52.049> um<00:01:52.369> and<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> really

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
game maybe three um and it's a really

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.420 
game maybe three um and it's a really
balanced<00:01:55.200> math<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.860> fight<00:01:56.250> for

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
balanced math you can really fight for

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.649 
balanced math you can really fight for
the<00:01:56.520> headquarters<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.090> really<00:01:57.329> get<00:01:57.509> they

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
the headquarters you really get they

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.649 
the headquarters you really get they
really<00:01:57.990> cap<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.619> flag<00:01:58.649> it's<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.219> really

the one where you're on top of a boat a
carrier<00:02:25.860> boat<00:02:26.040> carrier<00:02:26.400> that's<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.850> map<00:02:27.030> um

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
carrier boat carrier that's the map um

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.530 
carrier boat carrier that's the map um
that<00:02:29.190> was<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> only<00:02:29.610> map<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:29.970> really<00:02:30.360> had<00:02:30.510> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
that was the only map I really had a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.240 
that was the only map I really had a
problem<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.290> only<00:02:31.470> played<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.770> couple<00:02:31.860> so

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
problem with I only played a couple so

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.890 
problem with I only played a couple so
far<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.700> i'll<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.210> a<00:02:33.300> more<00:02:33.540> in-depth

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
far so i'll have a more in-depth

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.530 
far so i'll have a more in-depth
commentary<00:02:34.620> somewhere<00:02:35.250> down<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> road<00:02:35.550> but

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
commentary somewhere down the road but

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.850 
commentary somewhere down the road but
this<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.080> everyone<00:02:37.380> could<00:02:37.500> get<00:02:37.770> an

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
this is just so everyone could get an

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
this is just so everyone could get an
idea<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.220> everything<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.060> map<00:02:39.360> wise<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.930> maps

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
idea of everything so map wise the maps

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750 
idea of everything so map wise the maps
are<00:02:40.320> very<00:02:40.530> balanced<00:02:40.920> except<00:02:41.160> for<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.460> which<00:02:41.640> i

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
are very balanced except for one which i

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.670 
are very balanced except for one which i
think<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.150> map<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.510> called<00:02:42.870> carrier<00:02:43.380> excuse

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
think the map is called carrier excuse

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.510 
think the map is called carrier excuse
me<00:02:43.800> if<00:02:43.860> i'm<00:02:44.010> wrong<00:02:44.040> um<00:02:46.010> so<00:02:47.010> other<00:02:47.130> than<00:02:47.310> that

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
me if i'm wrong um so other than that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.870 
me if i'm wrong um so other than that
the<00:02:48.330> maps<00:02:48.510> are<00:02:48.630> decent<00:02:48.990> game<00:02:49.710> types<00:02:49.980> i<00:02:50.250> had<00:02:50.850> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.570 
the maps are decent game types i had a
chance<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.270> play<00:02:51.510> hard<00:02:52.470> hard<00:02:53.130> point<00:02:53.370> and

goes i enjoyed it i really didn't get
the<00:03:07.020> point<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.440> it<00:03:07.590> being<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.920> fact<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:08.280> they

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
the point of it being the fact that they

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.370 
the point of it being the fact that they
have<00:03:08.640> headquarters<00:03:08.910> in<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.450> game<00:03:09.600> but<00:03:10.320> i

have headquarters in the game but i

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.840 
have headquarters in the game but i
guess<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:10.920> something<00:03:11.220> different<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.550> know<00:03:11.640> it

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
guess is something different you know it

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.430 
guess is something different you know it
lets<00:03:12.000> everybody<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.600> a<00:03:12.630> new<00:03:12.870> Phil<00:03:13.140> for<00:03:13.350> the
