to their for continuing these are
actually<00:01:14.560> an<00:01:14.680> additive<00:01:15.100> which<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.490> haven't

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
actually an additive which I haven't

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.029 
actually an additive which I haven't
mentioned<00:01:15.939> yet<00:01:16.270> they're<00:01:17.020> active<00:01:17.560> speakers

with<00:01:18.219> you<00:01:18.310> have<00:01:18.429> built-in<00:01:18.850> they're<00:01:19.000> not

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
with you have built-in they're not

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.669 
with you have built-in they're not
actually<00:01:19.390> only<00:01:19.750> here<00:01:20.140> because<00:01:20.229> some<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.530> them

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679

passive<00:01:21.100> speakers<00:01:21.490> are<00:01:21.609> around<00:01:21.880> twenty<00:01:22.689> four

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
passive speakers are around twenty four

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.870 
passive speakers are around twenty four
kilos<00:01:23.380> now<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.039> reason<00:01:24.250> they've<00:01:24.490> kept<00:01:24.759> the

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
kilos now the reason they've kept the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.609 
kilos now the reason they've kept the
weight<00:01:25.060> down<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.570> lot<00:01:25.780> of<00:01:25.869> manufacturers<00:01:26.289> do

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
weight down is a lot of manufacturers do

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.660 
weight down is a lot of manufacturers do
at<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.799> moment<00:01:26.920> they've<00:01:27.219> got<00:01:27.340> a<00:01:27.369> class-d

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
at the moment they've got a class-d

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.300 
at the moment they've got a class-d
amplifier<00:01:28.270> built<00:01:29.079> in<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:29.859> it's<00:01:30.009> more<00:01:30.130> of<00:01:30.249> a

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
amplifier built in so it's more of a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.069 
amplifier built in so it's more of a
switch<00:01:30.579> mode<00:01:30.880> power<00:01:30.909> supply<00:01:31.570> keeping<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
switch mode power supply keeping the

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.340 
switch mode power supply keeping the
weight<00:01:32.259> down<00:01:33.509> if<00:01:34.509> I<00:01:34.659> show<00:01:34.899> you<00:01:34.960> some<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.229> the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
weight down if I show you some of the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.529 
weight down if I show you some of the
features<00:01:35.380> on<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.920> back<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:36.880> here<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.149> have<00:01:37.179> on

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
microphone the third channel is line

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.639 
microphone the third channel is line
only<00:01:48.789> by<00:01:49.060> two<00:01:49.119> quarter<00:01:49.659> inch<00:01:49.749> jacks<00:01:50.170> and<00:01:50.469> the

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
only by two quarter inch jacks and the

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.529 
only by two quarter inch jacks and the
inputs<00:01:51.039> on<00:01:51.189> one<00:01:51.369> and<00:01:51.520> two<00:01:51.700> re<00:01:51.969> the<00:01:52.149> quarter

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
inputs on one and two re the quarter

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.649 
inputs on one and two re the quarter

so<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.869> can<00:01:56.020> use<00:01:56.170> both<00:01:56.439> through<00:01:57.369> sockets<00:01:57.850> out

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:57.999 
so you can use both through sockets out

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:59.160 
so you can use both through sockets out
as<00:01:58.179> well<00:01:58.359> as<00:01:58.479> you<00:01:58.630> can<00:01:58.749> actually<00:01:58.899> go<00:01:59.139> through

haven't<00:03:13.630> even<00:03:13.750> told<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.320> yet<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:16.320> 1500<00:03:17.320> watts

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
haven't even told you yet is 1500 watts

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.880 
haven't even told you yet is 1500 watts
of<00:03:18.220> power<00:03:18.600> which<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.750> absolutely<00:03:20.650> amazing

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
of power which is absolutely amazing

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.699 
of power which is absolutely amazing
1500<00:03:21.820> watts<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.150> power<00:03:22.390> which<00:03:23.080> equates<00:03:23.530> to

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
1500 watts of power which equates to

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:28.440 
1500 watts of power which equates to
about<00:03:24.150> 550<00:03:25.150> 600<00:03:25.690> watts<00:03:26.160> continuous<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.730> not

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
about 550 600 watts continuous so not

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.210 
about 550 600 watts continuous so not
