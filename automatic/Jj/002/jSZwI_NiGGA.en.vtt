00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.110
 Hmm 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:13.100
 Radiology is an indispensable field in current medical care 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:18.800
 There are one thing that I do four kinds of work when I divide roughly 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:24.560
 Images using various shooting county exsen shooting ct mri are dead 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:25.430
 The other one includes nuclear medicine examination spect and that Ted, but used it 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:32.180
 Dead virtual 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 The other is angiography, and treatment is performed while observing ultrasound images 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.380
 Become an interface 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.650
 Not 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.280
 a Another is radiation therapy for malignant tumors 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.810
 Monday is that three divisions diagnosis department each medicine-free pot 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:49.570
 Divided into three treatment departments 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:52.200
 I am trusting Masanobu, but everyone is getting along well 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.200
 It is doing 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:01.020
 I'm not crying just because I'm making it to the opposite lane 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:24.659
 here listen Well then or say a high level 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:29.060
 What is the director star of 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.060
 Knowledge is very against me 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.830
 2 There seems to be no match for the patient 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:47.820
 Kedomo I think ct Toka r and Kaa and good will or to talk to a professional teacher to see the other 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:51.420
 It is Cho a patty place 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:57.500
 Provide enough skills to teach to those who handed out 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.500
 We thought that do unless we doing on one end and a doctor 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 Since becoming a new hospital, pet ct has been introduced 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:20.000
 Well that's still all good and what so old back then that's the latest equipment 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:23.260
 I think it is most important to have a reduced production system for patients and nature 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.260
 Is saying 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:36.010
 It is called interventional radiology, so far that angiography or such diagnostic 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.990
 There was a technology but I used that to cure cancer etc. 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.870
 Vessel Clogged Results 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:49.110
 I'm doing such a kind of point Shinshu treatment like spreading 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.890
 Choose a treatment that suits your body and make sure that you do it half 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.610
 I want 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:03:01.090
 I have radiation therapy for cancer to protect 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:06.530
 Since cancer patients as most of the ear to the anxiety of the patients in the I will not have everyone anxiety 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:11.030
 Beppu I 'm inclined to listen to a lot of that story 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:16.760
 I think that I want to be able to treat according to hope 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:21.740
 After Toka It pinpoint irradiation called low-radiation therapy is referred to as intensity-modulated radiation therapy 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:25.620
 You can avoid going to the original place while avoiding normal organs, etc. It is such words actively 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.560
 As we do, we think that such a place is characteristic 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.069
 Well after all well each one patient 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.360
 Since the are different in until it or rather background thinking 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.080
 For example 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:41.330
 Even if it's a little hard 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.700
 Not anyone the quality of life without want to do or so tightly received good treatment, even a little 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.580
 Well also of whether it is Toka that sort of thing 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.010
 Including 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.500
 Let me talk about the treatment policy in it 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.670
 As decided 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.670
 If you can do it
