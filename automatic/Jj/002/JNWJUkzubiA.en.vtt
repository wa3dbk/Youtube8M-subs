00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 welcome to our scrabble game who 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.020
 do not dare not win so that is called 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.880
 a clever proverb yes and today invite 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 I last for you this year 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.439
 but do not be afraid next year 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.029
 of course it's the crib play again 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.980
 you need is the first, however, 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.380
 our phone number will grab you completely 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.250
 quickly listen and dial 0 221 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.750
 45 and three times the four here in Cologne 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.489
 Well, if you have a bit of luck 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 maybe you are my candidate 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 but they should not come through 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 then that's no problem at all 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.719
 is still a second chance 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.940
 win 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.710
 how is what you want to do for it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.590
 I'll have to tell you that in the end 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.690
 of the game and now I am 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.899
 curious if anyone can already welcome 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.899
 Hello 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.940

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.730
 klaus dieter nice that I play 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.710
 do you have the christmas party well? 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.340
 yes and they really overcame me 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.070
 fit i'm assuming that you that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.299
 piano playing is good for everyone 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.650
 I have the others again shortly 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.540
 please do not know any rules 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.439
 Foreign words do not use proper names 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.210
 no shortcuts 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 otherwise everything is actually allowed 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 which is also in the German dictionary 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.080
 not and we have seven today 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 letters prepared for you again 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.520
 that the three times that it is with these 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 letters klaus-dieter formulate them 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.170
 please use as many words as possible 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.509
 you also score a lot afterwards 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.729
 to have 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.979
 Okay you have two minutes for this 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.509
 game when you are ready I am 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.509
 and I 'll turn the hourglass over 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:55.460
 okay maybe someone okay with that 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460
 hourglass runs 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.860
 maybe a tip claus-dieter 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.390
 think a bit about them 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.150
 letters because you know once 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.200
 hang the letters and I hang 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.200
 can not take back 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.280
 think a little more about the choice 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.180
 I say again that we are colorful 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 have fields 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:25.060
 the light blue field at the double 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:28.970
 Letters become a journey a journey yes 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.640
 a trip think again 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:40.550
 certain a series that we now 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:48.620
 already great there you could please one 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:51.790
 speak very little louder so de l 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.790
 are still available 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:00.600
 yes you can still create something that it 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.500
 free here and here is even one more 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.780
 Sometimes it's not like the red field 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.100
 easy but I can say we have 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:15.020
 also a bit tinkered here 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:15.020
 earlier d and e 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:42.180
 here and in the assumption that works 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.980
 we are not allowed to place personal names 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.340
 I'll have to go back then 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.550
 do not hang their own neither 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.550
 Swed 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.450
 it is not so easy not already 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.430
 at the end klaus-dieter but have at least 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.459
 we have a word and now it starts 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:11.569
 counting a blue is also the case 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:13.250
 tent triple 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 points the 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 is not bad at all 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.509
 we still have the possibility of ten 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.430
 to get klaus-dieter namely 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.709

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.509

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.340
 will hold it will hit a letter 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:30.400
 get ten points from us 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.400
 yes, I do not say go running 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.400
 what a shame 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.919
 klaus-dieter but at least seven points 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.750
