00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.099
 it's a harm to my liberation 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.680
 she is beautiful 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.259
 my part karim mameri i'm proud fart 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.280
 logghe so reptile specialist 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:37.260
 as such I organize exhibitions 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.250
 about reptiles everywhere 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.480
 in switzerland in europe 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.730
 I also take advantage of these opportunities to 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.489
 train different trades like 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.050
 firefighters ambulance 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.199
 even private individuals who would like to hold 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.760
 reptiles subject to authorization from 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.829
 will cross their hosts mali will try 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.030
 to oust him can float like that him 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.219
 to the climb after quietly 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.100
 returned to his wife watching the liana 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.080
 scored just spinning at 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.399
 side the couple or evil yole and that of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.399
 stimulate the week be below 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.040
 for someone who comes to walk in 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.880
 banter and snakes one can 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 allow flip flops 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.030
 I show a very bad example in 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 doing that but he's going ahead 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.050
 quietly and I do not necessarily 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.910
 a lot of km Julian I'm here 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.280
 a moment I take some pictures on 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.590
 my phone to film too and then 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.180
 I observe nothing around me his life 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 completely staying 20 minutes here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:45.240
 there are plenty of things going on 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 currently great these animals do not need 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.670
 not disturb them and even less the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.680
 move it's the same thing in 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.200
 interventions of like people 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.600
 call me to finally move 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.800
 because they saw an animal a snake 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.479
 who were in their property 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.610
 generally I will talk about places 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.380
 is far away because it is there is 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.930
 one that has been seen but they are rarely 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.660
 all alone so after that it's also a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.860
 question of education and then people 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.290
 have to learn to live and that these 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.649
 animals it's really a very very beautiful 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.649
 animal 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:23.409
 so here we are at servian so that's where 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.170
 where are all our animals based off 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:29.109
 exhibition this local las the local where we 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.329
 actually stores our 150 poisonous snakes 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.939
 some of which are extremely venomous 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:36.329
 and here I am going to feed a lost life 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.329
 Gabon 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.840
 this is a montpellier snake 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.590
 in the colors there are some who 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.659
 are venomous 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.959
 and then that if we send these covers 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:00.209
 Sasson Turkey is in the game 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.920
 southern center of turkey in a 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.049
 old area where I was not expecting 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.909
 especially to fall on these snakes 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.469
 there and then there we did a session 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.840
 photo the evil was really hot because 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.299
 that he had to do 24 degrees a little 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.250
 almost in the afternoon so well 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.189
 full of energy so there to achieve 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.389
 some photos with it was we had 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:21.720
 even had a lot of time 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:23.760
 to act fears no no if we had 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.510
 fear do not we go we will go by 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.060
 find in a tube 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.319
 and then I was already bitten a 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.090
 times but not at all in these 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.310
 circumstances there I was trying to 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.980
 clean his box in a box in the open 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.510
 that I protect and take the water change 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.590
 the water put back the top finally voila 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.090
 it's all the time the same thing and 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.819
 then when we have 50 who can 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.439
 appreciate each other like that ben the unc have to 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.310
 the mind that can start thinking about 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.409
 something else that's what happened to me 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.239
 I raised the lid I forgot to 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.500
 remove the snake from the crate i 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:53.069
 plunged my hand to take the word the 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:55.769
 bomb 20 cm from the snake its missed part 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.260
 then in addition he apparently had to his 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.159
 end day so as soon as they had 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.000
 even approached live he attacked then me 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:08.989
 bitten in the back so you're dead now 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.180
 it's it's my ghost who were here 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.810
 so here I spent this total of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.669
 tropics it's for a training it 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.769
 is happy there there is not very 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.729
 happy by the way, that means 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.349
 that's why they ring because 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.400
 that they were disturbed the support of all 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.050
 the rattlesnakes that makes 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.139
 really part of this worse tale 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.610
 character I have a colleague who has 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.150
 bitten by a too talented 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.570
 tropics 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.009
 I would say good to you okay which he in 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.090
 exists 26 subspecies but in friborg 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:42.190
 in the exhibition of 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.199
 reptiles of the world that I'm organizing there 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.010
 the exhibition is over this 18 years and 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:47.320
 more visitors 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.570
 I take the opportunity to teach a course 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.699
 for a group of firefighters from the 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.139
 professional actually saw its size 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.060
 it's still an animal that is 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.070
 well respected she will tell you 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.740
 bunny rabbit look I stand up to him 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.110
 imposing I am dangerous if you 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.620
 not leave it will not turn back 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.580
 again I come back the reins but 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.320
 she's not looking specifically for 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.190
 to attack me to bite what we have 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.470
 she could do it 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.930
 differently but this is really 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.050
 deterrence 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.870
 Great it scares you 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:22.000
 personally behind the notice three 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.260
 personal bamba now to handle 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.770
 I think we still have to have 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.510
 the habit 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.889
 I think you have to know his 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.110
 limits may have said stop 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.810
 like a lot in everything 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.400
 may not be at all you 'll buy a 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:36.340
 or no I do not think it's cute a 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:40.860
 time but after I think it's the dog 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:45.130
 who would pass from his strength 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:47.550
 because I'm going to annoy him very well 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:55.210
 must think it's like with women 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:57.360
 coco is 35 and here I am in period 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.360
 adjustment 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.970
 I must not look at it because 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.550
 it is not he who will come to rest on 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:05.490
 your nursery is no 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.170
 the cdu launched must still lift it 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.660
 when I read you the lift it's a 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.140
 pole very quickly then see he's going to 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:14.310
 stabilize on the on the hook it's 

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.470
 a one-way pleasure 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.990
 the snake and for him that makes no 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.060
 difference be less than it is you 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.190
 whether it's someone else it's okay 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.650
 changed at all for him 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.990
 you get affection for 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:32.350
 to see in the collection that we 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:35.090
 exposes the first or second name what is 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:38.320
 somewhere completely absurd but 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.320
 we get affection for them thank you 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.659
 It's okay
