00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello and let's start small 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 quite a long time mini was reviews but 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.490
 I hope soon we are all 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.870
 fix a toy called author epc 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.869
 At first when I downloaded it I think that there 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.760
 there will be something interesting because well 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.439
 Land's End or after the land as yet 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.529
 given the name of this game I think 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.960
 she was quite promising but 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.029
 when it launched i mean i didn't see 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.050
 nothing to surprise me 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.309
 the toy is in fact usually early 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.460
 unremarkable plot just 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 go ahead the gameplay of course 0 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.550
 dodge to turn left 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 jump un roll back 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.750
 Well, there is still a small piece of it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 This game is a circle that 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.809
 see to the left when you push it 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.539
 you can reach for the sword and fight it 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.239
 pretty cool but I don't know for 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.370
 whom will this game be created after all 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.850
 the genre is simply not erased before the holes 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.250
 even when the output of the peak of the game give Gauguin 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.830
 you yourself surf comes podday days like 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.100
 taxi cab and this game came out just the same 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.869
 I do not think that in them you can already in 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.700
 the end of this genre because but 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.110
 quite a few people will 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.310
 consequences to play than the game like 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.990
 scared it's not bad though how to say 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.250
 not bad when you sin 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.400
 that started to bother rights 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.950
 oh damn and carry what is to the right what is left 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.750
 there the game is pretty cool but 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.340
 when a little start to look around 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.890
 you see the texture doesn't move at all 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.200
 it's just drawn they were just 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.120
 bread long wall 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.830
 No, of course, a little saddened and danis 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.590
 present not so much of you 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.260
 you can look ahead of me 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.080
 a slight dusty mist in the distance on 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.670
 I do not know her on the game 15 meters further 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.830
 he can not see anything that is a game 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.630
 draws close she certainly does not 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.910
 lucky we will go for the weak 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.200
 devices i don't even know whether it will go 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.460
 assign force frs this recently drill on 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.050
 sony ericsson live with walkman in 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.360
 there were no problems because yes 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.179
 really not resource intensive much 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.980
 it's harder to do everything with an agent and so here 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.790
 such a thing and the whole game which drives 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.010
 no one has 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.260
 after passing the level you are given here 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.200
 such a bonus receipt is impossible simply 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.319
 score points you can spend on 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.480
 upgrade your character's own strength on 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.069
 changing the appearance of the character well 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.549
 that is, you can simply replace the body 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:32.499
 one to the other and just pass 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.969
 the game and earns a record not for if 

00:02:32.499 --> 00:02:35.469
 on you with friends though and who was in it 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.999
 play another distinctive 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:39.040
 feature what you saw on the screen 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:42.569
 that is , my crooked hands for kosyachit 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.819
 again I will not die as a whole surfer 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.230
 there will be only one life my life 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 will be measured to the left which will 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.389
 then still run play this 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.950
 play well and do not know it is possible of course but it is necessary 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.769
 there will be a lot to go through it very much 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.989
 try to make the game pretty 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.930
 not bad but so i'm talking to the six 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.129
 I don't know who might like to try 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 or not try it yourself 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.449
 I will not recommend anything about him 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.949
 I'll say bad things 

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.930
 please yourself now I just but 

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:13.739
 got so that everyone see you 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.739
 the whole world on the channel
