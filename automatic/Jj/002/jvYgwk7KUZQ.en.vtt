00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.950

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.289
 and yes of water 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.449

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.350
 veterinarians and biologists 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.030
 these pictures show the whole 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.219
 that scared the bathers 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 this Sunday at tip beach 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.469
 It was early afternoon that the alligator was 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 sighted for the first time after the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.870
 confirmation by the body of 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.210
 firemen 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 bathers were instructed to leave the 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.579
 water claims to have seen three 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 animals but the fire department only 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.270
 confirms the appearance of an alligator 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.710
 It was informed with precisely that oo 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 which was adjusted which was one was 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.390
 captured 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.310
 the other two is no longer officially the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.159
 firefighters struggled to try 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.930
 take the animal out of the water using a 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.299
 after a few hours the reptile was 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.759
 captured and taken to the fluvial base 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.770
 of the corporation this morning 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.229
 military police environmental battalion 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.479
 provided support to firefighters to 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.170
 transportation of the animal to a safe place 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.270
 the alligator of almost three meters 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.890
 he had to be totally immobilized 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.229
 was taken to the animal reserve 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 wild sauim chestnut tree in the area 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.240
 east of Manaus where it should be evaluated 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.110
 clinically before being returned to the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.180
 nature 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.890
 according to the fire department at 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.229
 black tip beach is not 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.420
 but they work with the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.430
 hypothesis that there are more alligators 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.040
 in that area and expect the positioning 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.350
 of the prefecture of manaus population 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.119
 reported that an animal was spotted today 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.990
 one more firefighter made a sweep 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.540
 throughout the beach by the waterfront and not 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.460
 was identified that there was no presence of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 alligator reptile with the beach like me 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.860
 said it is the administration of the city hall 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.250
 Manaus and it 's working right now. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.780
 usually but then the city hall already has 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:21.750
 of the situation and should take 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.150
 its provisions so further informed in 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.670
 notes that this is an isolated fact and 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.280
 due to a movement of passage 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.860
 animal at this time of the year according to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.260
 there is no relation between the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.300
 presence of animals and agglomeration of 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.730
 people since the species is 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.879
 territorialist and does not usually go to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.310
 areas where agglomerations also said 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.830
 that there is no technical justification for 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.129
 panic animals are naturally 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.220
 present in igarapÃ©s and water bodies of the 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.220
 City
