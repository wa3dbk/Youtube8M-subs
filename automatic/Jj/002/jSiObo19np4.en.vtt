00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.700
 welcome to another one piece 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.460
 theories like this one is about rafas 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.460
 next stage , his awakening 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.820
 So gear4 is not a secret for you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.560
 more and if so then I should am 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.279
 best disconnection now in because you 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.080
 otherwise it could be saved very hard 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.410
 and all the least on mine 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.420
 Chapter 785 stand are able to continue 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.500
 look without fear that something 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.239
 because they have to be afraid and the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.739
 keep others and are not ready 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.750
 You can keep quieter halter already 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.469
 if the two but I warn you 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.870
 spoiler and yes I know I know rafi 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.090
 has only just got an upgrade 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.309
 but you can do that here too 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.100
 quietly keep spinning and his 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.680
 next form theory is this time 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.800
 but no new greed in the sense 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.799
 but you just wake up 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.600
 chapter 285 has anyway flamengo us 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.040
 first insights into the new devils 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.510
 awakened 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.100
 Based on the first impression one can 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.930
 say that you do not wake up with that 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.910
 only change yourself but 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.820
 at the same time his whole environment 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.290
 I think maybe I am now so as 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.090
 his whole environment just a rubber 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.270
 can change and now know that 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.640
 we are idiot myself but I say 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.530
 you that's not all if you have it 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.840
 this is not really the case 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.760
 just a kind of change of his 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.820
 environment but in the way extended 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.979
 control of his ability still a few 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.170
 head de Rossi's head does not agree 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.509
 100 percent rubber as many think 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.340
 his teeth hair and fingernails 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:47.740
 He just can not do that, for example 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.450
 firmly 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.940
 whoa bit weird if you are 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.190
 so 10 could have been flying around now 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.040
 Do not eat for mafia in the world 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.050
 and so if he has more control over 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.970
 his skills would have too 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.650
 That's why the few are called because 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.410
 not misses is in rubber 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.520
 could thus transform to 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.220
 for example with his hair 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.840
 can intervene and with his hair 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.019
 to attack in everything is nothing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.570
 new is a lot so that's still 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:20.780
 relatively unspectacular but what if 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.260
 he increase the elasticity of the body 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.670
 could be such a fucking hard fortune 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.230
 By that I mean that he is his poor and 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.320
 legs not for one for a single 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.420
 attack the pistol or bazooka et 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.030
 cetera can go but also to one 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.680
 longer time can let the times 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.230
 without having to be firm about 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.049
 rocket if you want to see it that way as well 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.239
 a snake with its 220 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.239
 Human head I think you know 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 what I mean 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.940
 so he could continue against 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.769
 Keep distance and with the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.780
 buildings that angry turned 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.690
 just hit the enemy 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.490
 Hopefully the banker would turn down 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.320
 also a new tactic could be that 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:03.040
 he simply turns out to be awesome for a short time 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.930
 lets do and so and then comes 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.850
 he shot at the enemy or he 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.930
 just gives way to attacks from all over 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.280
 fast at an age of walking on the 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.800
 soil will then come up again and the 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.720
 Indie feed box in combination with 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.520
 but his armor hook could as well 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.140
 his hands in sound or something similar 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.790
 used to have eg the giant and then 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.460
 just hang around it la 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.140
 that was relatively fresh yes yes 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.050
 then all kinds of shapes are formed 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.520
 want to have with his rating or said 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.740
 with better control over his 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.490
 Good foot so many fucking him 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.500
 doors open 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.570
 I think this is still one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.560
 major step be for rafi than 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.870
 the 44th 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.970
 with the rating he will easily double 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.500
 be as strong as three times now 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.110
 is and I'm just looking forward to it 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.180
 big on it when he form this new one 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.780
 I learned this new skill 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.280
 say you because then it goes off right 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.160
 then you can shoot a bunch already 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.280
 so in the first with my theory too 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.770
 newer of the rating 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.260
 if you think so or yourself 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.760
 new ideas you have as yet for the 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.650
 could for the comments 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.930
 would be cool what you as a theory 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.209
 could put together a bit 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.770
 continue to expand old and expressed 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.690
 I would just say so if 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.880
 you liked the video then give 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.549
 again after a thumbs up 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.139
 because great and I would be right 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.760
 happy and if not a channel 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.210
 subscribed to see this stuff 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.340
 then just wanted to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.780
 so he will not miss any more and in that 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.520
 I would just say we say 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.980
 then we see that when or exactly hears 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.980
 See you at the next video until then 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.449
 that's really great this clock 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:01.430
 Construction workers on a Saturday but 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.180
 It must season think you can easily 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.449
 do not record video 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.349
 I think maybe it's me 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.349
 my
