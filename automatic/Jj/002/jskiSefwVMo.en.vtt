confidence<00:00:52.730> is<00:00:52.820> believing<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.690> your

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
abilities and believing that you will

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.220 
abilities and believing that you will
succeed<00:00:57.940> it's<00:00:58.940> when<00:00:59.090> you<00:00:59.180> truly<00:00:59.540> think<00:00:59.809> that

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
succeed it's when you truly think that

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.299 
succeed it's when you truly think that
you<00:01:00.440> can<00:01:00.860> and<00:01:01.280> will<00:01:02.110> win<00:01:03.110> or<00:01:03.140> succeed<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.159> this

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
you can and will win or succeed and this

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.429 
you can and will win or succeed and this
is<00:01:04.489> both<00:01:04.850> on<00:01:05.149> the<00:01:05.269> court<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:05.719> off<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.170> court

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
is both on the court and off the court

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.709

so<00:01:07.159> we're<00:01:07.250> simply<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.700> basketball<00:01:08.450> this

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:08.719 
so we're simply the basketball this

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.200 
so we're simply the basketball this
could<00:01:08.930> mean<00:01:09.280> believing<00:01:10.280> that<00:01:10.549> you're<00:01:11.090> going

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
could mean believing that you're going

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.060 
could mean believing that you're going
to<00:01:11.270> shut<00:01:11.690> down<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:12.229> guy<00:01:12.380> that's<00:01:12.620> guarding<00:01:12.950> you

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
to shut down the guy that's guarding you

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.610 
to shut down the guy that's guarding you
or<00:01:13.340> it<00:01:13.880> could<00:01:14.030> be<00:01:14.060> believing<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.110> that<00:01:15.170> next

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
or it could be believing that that next

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.930 
or it could be believing that that next
shot<00:01:15.950> is<00:01:16.310> going<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:18.580> like<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:19.700> mentioned

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:19.940 
shot is going to go in like I mentioned

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.000 
shot is going to go in like I mentioned
there<00:01:20.840> are<00:01:20.900> a<00:01:21.020> few<00:01:21.200> ways<00:01:21.380> you<00:01:21.440> can<00:01:21.860> develop

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
there are a few ways you can develop

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.440 
there are a few ways you can develop
their<00:01:22.250> confidence<00:01:22.400> so<00:01:23.090> I'm<00:01:23.180> going<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.330> give

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450

their confidence so I'm going to give
you<00:01:23.600> a<00:01:23.630> few<00:01:23.960> of<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.170> ways<00:01:24.290> that<00:01:24.680> I've<00:01:24.860> seen<00:01:25.190> in

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
you a few of the ways that I've seen in

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.039 
you a few of the ways that I've seen in
and<00:01:25.580> used<00:01:25.850> over<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.330> years<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:28.159> first<00:01:28.430> one<00:01:28.700> is

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
and used over the years the first one is

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.310 
and used over the years the first one is
simple<00:01:30.049> it's<00:01:30.619> train<00:01:31.250> hard<00:01:31.930> now<00:01:32.930> this<00:01:33.080> might

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
simple it's train hard now this might

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.789 
simple it's train hard now this might
make<00:01:33.619> not<00:01:33.979> make<00:01:34.220> a<00:01:34.490> lot<00:01:34.729> of<00:01:34.760> sense<00:01:34.880> at<00:01:35.330> first

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
make not make a lot of sense at first

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.469 
make not make a lot of sense at first
but<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:36.950> is<00:01:37.159> a<00:01:37.369> great<00:01:37.880> way<00:01:37.909> to<00:01:38.240> develop

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
but this is a great way to develop

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.620 
but this is a great way to develop
confidence<00:01:39.340> here's<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.400> reason<00:01:40.640> if<00:01:41.420> you

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
confidence here's the reason if you

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.010 
confidence here's the reason if you
train<00:01:41.990> hard<00:01:42.290> you<00:01:42.799> put<00:01:43.070> in<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.310> time<00:01:43.580> and<00:01:44.030> you

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
train hard you put in the time and you

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.570 
train hard you put in the time and you
know<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.439> you're<00:01:45.560> working<00:01:45.830> harder<00:01:46.430> than

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
know that you're working harder than

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.460 
know that you're working harder than
everyone<00:01:46.820> else<00:01:47.150> how<00:01:47.570> can<00:01:47.780> you<00:01:47.810> not<00:01:48.170> be

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
everyone else how can you not be

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.280 
everyone else how can you not be
confident<00:01:49.070> in<00:01:49.100> your<00:01:49.250> abilities<00:01:50.290> another

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
confident in your abilities another

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.920 
confident in your abilities another
thing<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:51.560> measuring<00:01:52.549> your<00:01:53.090> training<00:01:53.689> and

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
thing is measuring your training and

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.969 
thing is measuring your training and
setting<00:01:54.799> goals<00:01:56.170> this<00:01:57.170> goes<00:01:57.439> hand<00:01:57.770> in<00:01:57.920> hand

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
setting goals this goes hand in hand

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.340 
setting goals this goes hand in hand
with<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.400> train<00:01:58.670> hard<00:01:59.000> piece<00:01:59.450> but<00:01:59.900> if<00:02:00.170> you

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
with the train hard piece but if you

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.830 
with the train hard piece but if you
measure<00:02:00.799> your<00:02:01.189> training<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:01.939> you<00:02:02.360> start<00:02:02.689> out

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
measure your training and you start out

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:03.640 
measure your training and you start out
the<00:02:03.049> summer
