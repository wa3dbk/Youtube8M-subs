00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello to all I am delighted to 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.890
 find for this second part of 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.950
 the setting in the square then I regroup 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.250
 all these painting sessions under this 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.980
 title putting in tiles that evokes that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.390
 quite incredible process that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.189
 facilitates and allows to work 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.900
 immediately to have right away 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:31.800
 instant reproduction results I 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:36.600
 go now in this e in this 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:41.670
 video show you little by little 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 how it is possible to move to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 the stage of painting the setting 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.600
 instead of paint and and 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 possibility to carry out his portrait 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.539
 with oil painting here I am 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.930
 would like to apologize already proved my 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.400
 speaker talents a little bide years and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.460
 this is the most important thing is that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.780
 it's the rest so that's what goes into 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.430
 anyway I hope to help you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.330
 progress 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.330
 I would like right away then 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.280
 no 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.140
 so big hello to all of you here so I 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.640
 you had explained formerly in two 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.720
 words that I could tell you 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.120
 how center and drawing once 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.980
 that he had been squared on the 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.790
 sheet of tracing paper then everything 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:00.810
 so you just have 10 10 tiles 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.930
 which are in the left-right direction 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.760
 you see well here here at this place 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.270
 in by his right coach you count 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.670
 so you have 2 3 4 5 6 7 and stretches 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.580
 up to 10 while then for sentry must 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.550
 just count 5 to roussines 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.430
 so up 2 3 4 5 you have 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:26.040
 your sixth line here from top to bottom 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.620
 and this way guiding you on 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.020
 this line there you reproduce at 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:37.170
 the identical what is on the canvas 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:41.310
 that's what you'll get from a 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.220
 cross to retrace in the middle so 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.850
 the two axes of this rectangle of the 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:52.620
 canvas your sixth line here is a 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:58.950
 seeing we look good and we check 1 2 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:03.660
 3 4 5 and 6 it gives you 5 euros to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.020
 left and 5th tile right that are 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.790
 identical to those that happened 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.620
 exactly also on the tracing paper 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.950
 here it was the little the little more 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:19.320
 it's not very very very inventive title 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.230
 is really exceptional but finally 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.080
 that's how you let your 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:30.480
 your pattern later on canvas 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:32.900
 proceed that way so what I 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.410
 advise you to do is erase 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:39.750
 illiterate who were drawn on the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:44.270
 face then I had traced his 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.270
 traits with a blood pencil 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.960
 to expand then you will erase his 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.500
 traits because after that there is a risk of 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.990
 see or 6 years and also dirty the 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.370
 painting the moment you get 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.620
 need to have parts 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.330
 clear in painting with paint 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.320
 white or the gray paint that is 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.260
 pretty clear 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.960
 we do not see through the trace of 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.640
 grid with its very orange 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:18.630
 so where it's clear see that 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:21.230
 corresponds to what is in the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:27.630
 photo the particular you erase them 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.760
 where there are u16 see a little 2.2 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.490
 blood also pencil store you the 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:37.860
 want it because the milk would 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:43.129
 part of the grid will be black but at 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:45.129
 other places where it's clear there 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.129
 e
