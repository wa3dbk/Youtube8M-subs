for<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.159> reason<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:32.970> accidentally

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
for some reason it just accidentally

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.510 
for some reason it just accidentally
activates<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.189> do<00:01:35.400> it

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
activates and you can actually do it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
activates and you can actually do it
twice<00:01:35.700> again<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.720> should<00:01:36.900> turn<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> off

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
twice again and it should turn it off

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.530 
twice again and it should turn it off
and<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.860> does<00:01:38.009> so<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> really

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
and it does so just like so so a really

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.630 
and it does so just like so so a really
neat<00:01:39.810> feature<00:01:40.380> again<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:41.100> along<00:01:41.400> with<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
neat feature again going along with the

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.429 
neat feature again going along with the
double<00:01:41.939> twist<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.420> activate<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> camera<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
double twist to activate the camera on

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.190 
double twist to activate the camera on
your<00:01:43.590> Moto<00:01:43.770> X<00:01:43.860> 2014<00:01:44.700> another<00:01:45.270> update<00:01:45.720> should

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
your Moto X 2014 another update should

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
your Moto X 2014 another update should
just<00:01:46.380> be<00:01:46.500> overall<00:01:46.829> performance<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.610> should<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
just be overall performance it should be

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.499 
just be overall performance it should be
a<00:01:47.909> little<00:01:48.030> bit<00:01:48.180> better

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
a little bit better

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
a little bit better
I<00:01:48.750> believe<00:01:49.290> they<00:01:49.470> helped<00:01:50.340> with<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> memory

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
I believe they helped with the memory

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.310 
I believe they helped with the memory
leak<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.509> it's<00:01:51.600> completely<00:01:51.720> fixed

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
leak I don't think it's completely fixed

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
leak I don't think it's completely fixed
but<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.500> think<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.890> better<00:01:53.100> on<00:01:53.220> android<00:01:53.970> 5.1

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
but I think it's better on android 5.1

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
but I think it's better on android 5.1
just<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.200> mean<00:01:55.350> overall<00:01:55.619> performance<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
just I mean overall performance on the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.190 
just I mean overall performance on the
Nexus<00:01:56.969> 6<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.299> better<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:57.810> assuming<00:01:58.079> it's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
Nexus 6 is better so I'm assuming it's

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.109 
Nexus 6 is better so I'm assuming it's
gonna<00:01:58.290> be<00:01:58.409> better<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.740> Moto<00:01:58.920> X<00:01:58.979> as<00:01:59.399> well

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
gonna be better on the Moto X as well

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.480 
gonna be better on the Moto X as well
also<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.810> noticed<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> camera<00:02:01.950> kind<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.189> seems

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
also I noticed the camera kind of seems

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.800 
also I noticed the camera kind of seems
like<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.820> opens<00:02:03.119> up<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.329> little<00:02:03.420> bit<00:02:03.659> quicker

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
like it opens up a little bit quicker

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.590 
like it opens up a little bit quicker
now<00:02:04.770> taking<00:02:05.130> pictures<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:05.909> very<00:02:06.240> similar

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
now taking pictures about very similar

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.589 
now taking pictures about very similar

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.210 
lollipop just yet unfortunately also it
said<00:02:13.760> it<00:02:13.909> changed<00:02:14.480> some<00:02:15.170> some<00:02:15.620> features<00:02:16.010> on

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
said it changed some some features on

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.220 
said it changed some some features on
the<00:02:16.280> front-facing<00:02:16.580> camera<00:02:17.269> just<00:02:17.780> to<00:02:17.930> fix<00:02:18.110> a

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the front-facing camera just to fix a

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.930 
the front-facing camera just to fix a
little<00:02:18.409> bit<00:02:18.500> better<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.830> also<00:02:19.310> with<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:19.760> rear

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
little bit better and also with the rear

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.580 
little bit better and also with the rear
camera<00:02:20.209> it<00:02:20.450> helped<00:02:20.690> with<00:02:20.840> low-light

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
camera it helped with low-light

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.680 
camera it helped with low-light
situations<00:02:22.280> as<00:02:22.489> well<00:02:22.519> and<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:23.150> finally<00:02:23.540> when

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
situations as well and then finally when

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:24.850 
situations as well and then finally when
the<00:02:23.780> last<00:02:23.989> things<00:02:24.230> I<00:02:24.319> want<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.470> show<00:02:24.620> is<00:02:24.739> with

the last things I want to show is with

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.320 
the last things I want to show is with
ambient<00:02:25.280> display<00:02:25.400> they<00:02:25.819> changed<00:02:26.209> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
ambient display they changed the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.589 
ambient display they changed the
distance<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:27.620> unlock<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.190> device<00:02:28.340> when<00:02:29.330> using

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
distance to unlock the device when using

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.600 
distance to unlock the device when using
it<00:02:29.900> or<00:02:30.170> going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.799> a<00:02:30.829> notification<00:02:31.099> just<00:02:31.370> so

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
it or going to a notification just so

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.130 
it or going to a notification just so
you<00:02:31.670> don't<00:02:31.819> accidentally<00:02:32.390> do<00:02:32.569> something<00:02:32.989> on

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
you don't accidentally do something on

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.130 
you don't accidentally do something on
it<00:02:33.290> it<00:02:33.980> looks<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.459> icons<00:02:34.840> updated<00:02:35.840> if

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
it it looks like that icons updated if

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.080 
it it looks like that icons updated if
I'm<00:02:36.379> not<00:02:36.560> wrong<00:02:36.829> I've<00:02:37.340> seen<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.790> a<00:02:37.879> little

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
I'm not wrong I've seen in a little

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.000 
I'm not wrong I've seen in a little
while<00:02:38.239> so<00:02:38.269> I'm<00:02:38.510> not<00:02:38.629> positive<00:02:38.870> but<00:02:39.230> anyway

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
while so I'm not positive but anyway

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.410 
while so I'm not positive but anyway
that's<00:02:40.220> just<00:02:40.280> another<00:02:40.670> minor<00:02:40.970> change<00:02:41.269> but

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
that's just another minor change but

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.030 
that's just another minor change but
that's<00:02:41.540> about<00:02:41.690> it<00:02:41.750> like<00:02:42.049> I<00:02:42.230> said<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.799> don't

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
that's about it like I said I don't

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.369 
that's about it like I said I don't
really<00:02:43.340> want<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:43.549> redo<00:02:44.480> an<00:02:44.629> entire<00:02:44.959> android

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
easy very simple that's one of the

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.670 
easy very simple that's one of the
neatest<00:02:59.359> things<00:02:59.480> I<00:02:59.840> honestly<00:03:00.319> I<00:03:00.379> wish<00:03:00.530> they

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
neatest things I honestly I wish they

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.500 
neatest things I honestly I wish they
would<00:03:00.769> implement<00:03:01.159> that<00:03:01.459> into<00:03:01.760> stock<00:03:02.000> Android

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
would implement that into stock Android

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.000 
would implement that into stock Android
but<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.079> said<00:03:03.290> check<00:03:03.319> out<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.799> full

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
but like I said check out that full
