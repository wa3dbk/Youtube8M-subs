00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.980
 the real bump of the state on solar energy if you do not have to offer 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.050
 radio programs explain estrada 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.860
 the prayer for that simply was a homage to villa for Javier Velásquez 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.540
 stability because really never with the operator logroño January 1 and I 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.880
 it looked impressive 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.039
 let's start a very important thing what happens today with life to see if the 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:21.970
 place images 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.030
 because it has been 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.870
 and we've used the juve the bobbin well I think the guy we're not going to lower it 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.529
 most important fund 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.429
 that life is preserved 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.350
 today since he has played villa 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.540
 is to go today he has taken it from the left band where I think he lowers his 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.360
 performance dell has played for me pon left a predator in its natural site 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.490
 of center forward is played is not going to prosper this happened about 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.760
 in the minute 4 of match 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.489
 but I wanted to use this image for fundamentally 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.780
 justify villa support performance 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.770
 there will be expansion 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.800
 and the Inca move of orientation 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.990
 villa tries int does not intervene but that is moving the predator again 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.290
 sora natural which happened in the minute I think that 19 action we're going to see 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.520
 villa as it resolves with a turn it looks for its profile uses the left leg as 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.980
 resource and well we are talking moved from home and here not 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.320
 is moving to villa for me determinant because we are seeing a 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.290
 which commented very well the 'wolf' carrasco 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.270
 observe how to download game as a passer there are two pass lines two 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.330
 elements that burst of second line and the element that was 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.220
 fundamentally as a reference is used to link a play that 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 in the end it was decisive action we are going to finish 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.950
 Villa plays well the rebound and iniesta meekly to the network we continue with the tel 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.820
 the great orion make the count that we lose again is even allowed 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.280
 portray a repressor board here we are seeing another play of life 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.430
 passion let's see how to start the play 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.810
 comes and here another genius observe again how it comes from the back 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.620
 that is the cave of the gods this path in the rope that make it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.470
 only those chosen to play inverted and this is done by the 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.770
 great villa and this good move for vihuela best of the game that no 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.570
 ended in action goal let's see how it ends 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.880
 g what each hand to hand is a decision that could have been decisive 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.320
 although he lives and finally we go to another paola these a special mention of a 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.620
 great to observe a large minogue and a single minogue 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.340
 come the stick in what I think that came out have amazed him to close by 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.989
 favor 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.869
 from about two or three 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:29.409
 four elements I should not be paid to do but it is revealing action 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.549
 let's see how it ends with this genius 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.670
 and he thought that this was not the best tribute to an automotive triumph 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.529
 authentically successful I promoted my foolish hands to that thorny that you will pass to 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.829
 xabi alonso of the rose that I wear well I'm going to record the villa won beasley 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.569
 had been savior gabarró of zero I want to talk about villains yes but we 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.949
 They said no, but it is open and today is a sad day
