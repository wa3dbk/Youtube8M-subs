and<00:07:08.130> don't<00:07:08.340> forget<00:07:08.640> to<00:07:08.790> cast<00:07:09.000> between<00:07:09.660> the

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
structure and the shoreline one trick is

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:15.050 
structure and the shoreline one trick is
to<00:07:12.450> turn<00:07:12.780> 180<00:07:13.740> degrees<00:07:13.890> and<00:07:14.640> fish<00:07:14.850> the

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
to turn 180 degrees and fish the

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.140 
to turn 180 degrees and fish the
structure<00:07:15.510> again<00:07:15.660> from<00:07:16.170> the<00:07:16.290> other<00:07:16.470> direction

structure again from the other direction
doing<00:07:18.150> so<00:07:18.390> can<00:07:18.630> mean<00:07:18.810> the<00:07:18.840> difference<00:07:19.320> between

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:19.410 
doing so can mean the difference between

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:24.580 
doing so can mean the difference between
