00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.469
 I would like to ask for a minute of attention. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 Do you know me? You know how much 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.849
 I struggled to get here more 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.279
 this was only possible because I had a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.830
 chance and an opportunity in my life 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 just like me thousands of children 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.519
 dream about being someone 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.650
 the soccer player a lawyer a 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.769
 doctor or even a trapeze artist. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.769
 circus 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.480
 unfortunately there are thousands of 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.570
 children in brazil who do not even have 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.210
 access to basic rights by making 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.489
 thus vulnerable and often not 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.870
 having access even to a glass of water 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.820
 clean to drink 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.670
 That's why I'm here today to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.950
