00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.290 

all<00:00:18.130> right<00:00:18.310> so<00:00:18.460> I'm<00:00:18.550> getting<00:00:18.789> ready<00:00:19.000> to<00:00:19.119> build

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
all right so I'm getting ready to build

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.540 
all right so I'm getting ready to build
the<00:00:19.449> lid<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:19.960> the<00:00:20.560> first<00:00:20.740> thing<00:00:20.890> I<00:00:20.980> did<00:00:21.039> was<00:00:21.400> I

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
the lid and the first thing I did was I

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.540 
the lid and the first thing I did was I
just<00:00:21.579> ripped<00:00:22.269> to<00:00:22.720> two<00:00:23.230> pieces<00:00:23.470> of<00:00:23.650> one<00:00:23.980> by<00:00:24.189> here

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
just ripped to two pieces of one by here

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.050 
just ripped to two pieces of one by here
it's<00:00:24.789> 1<00:00:25.210> by<00:00:25.390> 3<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:25.989> then<00:00:26.590> 36<00:00:27.250> inches<00:00:27.730> and<00:00:27.789> put

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
it's 1 by 3 and then 36 inches and put

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.359 
it's 1 by 3 and then 36 inches and put
them<00:00:28.180> in<00:00:28.300> between<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.779> sides<00:00:29.020> and<00:00:29.439> that<00:00:29.890> forms

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
them in between the sides and that forms

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.000 
them in between the sides and that forms
a<00:00:30.550> rectangle<00:00:30.910> the<00:00:31.419> top<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.899> our<00:00:32.320> lid<00:00:32.829> is<00:00:32.980> going

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
a rectangle the top and our lid is going

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.520 
a rectangle the top and our lid is going
to<00:00:33.309> sit<00:00:33.550> right<00:00:34.180> on<00:00:34.239> top<00:00:34.390> of<00:00:34.839> that<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.260> lid<00:00:35.410> will

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
to sit right on top of that the lid will

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.530 
to sit right on top of that the lid will
be<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.710> same<00:00:35.890> dimension<00:00:36.100> so<00:00:36.670> I've<00:00:37.120> got<00:00:37.390> the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
be the same dimension so I've got the

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.600 
be the same dimension so I've got the
Gables<00:00:37.960> one<00:00:38.920> here<00:00:39.339> and<00:00:39.850> one<00:00:40.690> here

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
Gables one here and one here

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.399 
Gables one here and one here
and<00:00:42.610> what<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:42.970> did<00:00:43.210> was<00:00:43.480> kind<00:00:44.170> of<00:00:44.260> just

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
and what I did was kind of just

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.470 
and what I did was kind of just
determined<00:00:44.829> a<00:00:44.890> pitch<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.280> looked<00:00:45.339> right<00:00:46.030> for

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
determined a pitch that looked right for

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.240 
determined a pitch that looked right for
the<00:00:46.720> dimensions<00:00:47.199> of<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:47.350> box<00:00:47.530> and<00:00:47.920> to<00:00:48.070> me<00:00:48.220> that

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
the dimensions of the box and to me that

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
the dimensions of the box and to me that
came<00:00:48.610> up<00:00:48.729> to<00:00:48.820> be<00:00:48.939> 2<00:00:49.449> inches<00:00:49.809> here<00:00:50.229> and<00:00:50.699> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
came up to be 2 inches here and I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.640 
came up to be 2 inches here and I
believe<00:00:52.960> this<00:00:53.290> is<00:00:53.619> what<00:00:54.430> was<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:54.820> 8<00:00:55.659> or<00:00:55.989> so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:56.650 
believe this is what was that 8 or so

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.100 
believe this is what was that 8 or so
yeah<00:00:57.040> I<00:00:57.159> think<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.339> was<00:00:57.400> 8<00:00:57.580> so<00:00:58.299> I've<00:00:58.720> got<00:00:58.960> these

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
yeah I think it was 8 so I've got these

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.780 
yeah I think it was 8 so I've got these
all<00:00:59.290> sanded<00:00:59.769> and<00:00:59.949> now<00:01:00.159> we're<00:01:00.339> getting<00:01:00.460> ready

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
all sanded and now we're getting ready

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:08.310 
all sanded and now we're getting ready
to<00:01:02.040> build<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.879> lid<00:01:04.229> or<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.470> roof<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.200> we're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
to build the lid or the roof so we're

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:35.660 
to build the lid or the roof so we're
going<00:01:08.409> to<00:01:08.500> put<00:01:08.650> our<00:01:08.939> bridge<00:01:09.939> piece<00:01:10.330> on

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.250 

so<00:01:36.670> I've<00:01:36.790> got<00:01:36.940> the<00:01:37.060> gables<00:01:37.450> and<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.080> Ridge

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
so I've got the gables and the Ridge

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.130 
so I've got the gables and the Ridge
everything<00:01:38.710> put<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:40.600> what<00:01:40.780> I'm<00:01:40.869> kind<00:01:41.020> of

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
everything put in and what I'm kind of

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.380 
everything put in and what I'm kind of
thinking<00:01:41.229> was<00:01:41.680> is<00:01:41.979> that<00:01:42.009> I'll<00:01:42.369> maybe<00:01:42.729> get<00:01:42.970> some

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
thinking was is that I'll maybe get some

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.109 
thinking was is that I'll maybe get some
hinges<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.050> I'll<00:01:44.710> have<00:01:44.920> this<00:01:45.070> hinge<00:01:45.400> open<00:01:45.909> and

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:46.119 
hinges and I'll have this hinge open and

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:49.380 
hinges and I'll have this hinge open and
then<00:01:46.810> be<00:01:47.050> retained<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.800> some<00:01:48.640> chains<00:01:49.000> or

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
then be retained with some chains or

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.870 
then be retained with some chains or
something<00:01:49.810> they're<00:01:50.280> limited<00:01:51.280> to<00:01:51.430> limit<00:01:51.729> that

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
something they're limited to limit that

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.609 
something they're limited to limit that
rate<00:01:52.150> that<00:01:52.390> so<00:01:52.570> does<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.810> flip<00:01:53.050> over<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.470> tear

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
rate that so does it flip over and tear

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.210 
rate that so does it flip over and tear
off<00:01:53.830> so<00:01:54.759> uh<00:01:55.740> sticking<00:01:56.740> with<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:56.979> theme<00:01:57.009> of

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
off so uh sticking with the theme of

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.310 
off so uh sticking with the theme of
using<00:01:57.789> what<00:01:57.910> I've<00:01:58.060> got<00:01:58.270> I've<00:01:58.930> got<00:01:59.110> some

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320

using what I've got I've got some
leftover<00:01:59.920> tongue<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:00.940> groove<00:02:01.119> pine<00:02:01.300> that<00:02:02.259> we

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
leftover tongue and groove pine that we

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.940 
leftover tongue and groove pine that we
use<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.830> remodel<00:02:03.399> and<00:02:04.560> I've<00:02:05.560> ripped<00:02:05.770> these

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
use for a remodel and I've ripped these

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.540 
use for a remodel and I've ripped these
down<00:02:06.250> to<00:02:06.550> it<00:02:06.729> overall<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.479> about<00:02:07.810> 12<00:02:08.170> inches

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
down to it overall with about 12 inches

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.920 
down to it overall with about 12 inches
by<00:02:09.550> 36<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.690> I'm<00:02:11.230> going<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.500> put<00:02:11.680> these<00:02:11.830> on<00:02:12.070> and

then<00:02:13.930> we'll<00:02:14.019> have<00:02:14.110> to<00:02:14.200> figure<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.500> what<00:02:14.620> we're

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
then we'll have to figure out what we're

00:02:14.709 --> 00:05:08.580 
then we'll have to figure out what we're
going<00:02:14.830> to<00:02:14.890> use<00:02:15.790> on<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.000> top<00:02:16.180> for<00:02:16.390> ripping

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:19.230 

a<00:05:16.620> few<00:05:17.620> years<00:05:17.770> ago<00:05:17.890> we<00:05:18.280> spent<00:05:18.820> some<00:05:18.970> time<00:05:19.030> in

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
a few years ago we spent some time in

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.780 
a few years ago we spent some time in
Hanford<00:05:19.810> Germany<00:05:20.380> and<00:05:20.950> one<00:05:21.160> thing<00:05:21.340> that<00:05:21.370> I<00:05:21.550> was

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
Hanford Germany and one thing that I was

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.550 
Hanford Germany and one thing that I was
really<00:05:21.820> impressed<00:05:22.720> with<00:05:22.960> was<00:05:23.410> the

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
really impressed with was the

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.140 
really impressed with was the
architecture<00:05:24.250> and<00:05:24.460> some<00:05:24.850> of<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.030> old

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
architecture and some of the old

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.430 
architecture and some of the old
cathedrals<00:05:25.780> had<00:05:26.050> leaded<00:05:27.390> roofs<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:28.930> I<00:05:29.230> just

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
cathedrals had leaded roofs and I just

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.810 
cathedrals had leaded roofs and I just
thought<00:05:29.590> they<00:05:29.770> were<00:05:29.800> gorgeous<00:05:30.190> and<00:05:30.610> I<00:05:30.670> always

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
thought they were gorgeous and I always

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.450 
thought they were gorgeous and I always
wanted<00:05:31.360> one<00:05:31.540> and<00:05:32.050> I<00:05:32.230> never<00:05:32.560> probably<00:05:33.310> never

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
wanted one and I never probably never

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.340 
wanted one and I never probably never
won't<00:05:33.730> get<00:05:33.940> one<00:05:34.120> at<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.300> big<00:05:34.450> house<00:05:34.660> but<00:05:34.990> I

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
won't get one at a big house but I

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.870 
won't get one at a big house but I
thought<00:05:35.770> I'd<00:05:35.920> play<00:05:36.100> around<00:05:36.400> with<00:05:36.610> it<00:05:36.790> a<00:05:36.820> little

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
thought I'd play around with it a little

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.970

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.810 
it's it's difficult I haven't really had
anyone<00:05:44.470> to<00:05:44.650> show<00:05:44.830> me<00:05:44.980> how<00:05:45.070> to<00:05:45.130> do<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.520> and<00:05:45.670> I

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
kind of just made it up as I as I go and

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.290 
kind of just made it up as I as I go and
I'm<00:05:48.010> sure<00:05:48.220> I'm<00:05:48.370> doing<00:05:48.640> it<00:05:48.760> wrong<00:05:48.940> and<00:05:49.000> I<00:05:49.240> don't

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
I'm sure I'm doing it wrong and I don't

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.840 
I'm sure I'm doing it wrong and I don't
have<00:05:49.690> the<00:05:49.810> right<00:05:49.960> tools<00:05:50.320> but<00:05:50.620> it<00:05:51.400> is<00:05:51.550> a<00:05:51.580> bee

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:51.850 
have the right tools but it is a bee

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.690

house<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.440> it's<00:05:53.440> on<00:05:53.650> there<00:05:53.860> so<00:05:54.100> the<00:05:54.310> welds<00:05:54.610> are

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:54.700

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.570 
house and it's on there so the welds are
a<00:05:54.730> little<00:05:54.850> bit<00:05:55.060> rough<00:05:55.090> on<00:05:55.510> down<00:05:55.720> the<00:05:55.930> gable<00:05:56.260> but

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
a little bit rough on down the gable but

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
a little bit rough on down the gable but
overall<00:05:57.630> I<00:05:58.630> think<00:05:59.530> it<00:05:59.800> looks<00:05:59.980> cool<00:06:00.360> so<00:06:01.360> I<00:06:01.390> hope
