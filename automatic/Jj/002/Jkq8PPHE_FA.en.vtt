00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
change it back to the right because we

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.350 
change it back to the right because we

you can change the number of fingers so

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.979 
you can change the number of fingers so
if<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.789> choose<00:00:57.030> two<00:00:57.270> fingers<00:00:57.629> which<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
if you choose two fingers which is

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.170 
if you choose two fingers which is
probably<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.590> best<00:00:58.739> option<00:00:58.949> any<00:00:59.430> option<00:00:59.879> more

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
probably the best option any option more

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.819 
probably the best option any option more
than<00:01:00.359> one<00:01:00.539> finger<00:01:00.899> is<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.230> best<00:01:01.410> option

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
than one finger is the best option

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.529 
than one finger is the best option
because<00:01:01.980> sometimes<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.000> accidentally

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
because sometimes you can accidentally

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.539 
because sometimes you can accidentally
swipe<00:01:03.899> your<00:01:04.049> pages<00:01:04.559> or<00:01:04.769> swipe<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.220> spotlight

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
or something like that so you want to

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.380 
or something like that so you want to
choose<00:01:07.890> more<00:01:08.189> than<00:01:08.250> one<00:01:08.400> finger<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.240> not

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
choose more than one finger so it's not

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
choose more than one finger so it's not
standard<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.470> we<00:01:10.530> choose<00:01:10.830> three<00:01:11.159> fingers

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
standard so if we choose three fingers

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.160 
standard so if we choose three fingers
right<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.000> we<00:01:12.119> can<00:01:12.270> go<00:01:12.420> ahead<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.630> swipe

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.609 
so one two three it lets you choose
multiple<00:01:32.460> ones<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:33.930> go<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.200> into<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
multiple ones so if you go back into the

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.170 
multiple ones so if you go back into the
settings<00:01:34.950> right<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.579> change<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
settings right here you can change the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.300 
settings right here you can change the
sensitivity<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.560> haven't<00:01:37.950> seen<00:01:38.130> any

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
sensitivity which I haven't seen any

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.850 
sensitivity which I haven't seen any
change<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.200> set<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.590> low

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
change with so even if I set it to low

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.550 
change with so even if I set it to low
medium<00:01:41.159> high<00:01:41.369> any<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.270> those<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.780> haven't<00:01:43.380> seen

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
medium high any of those I haven't seen

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.530 
medium high any of those I haven't seen
a<00:01:43.619> difference<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.280> any<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> them<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.090> i<00:01:45.299> don't

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
a difference with any of them so i don't

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.660 
a difference with any of them so i don't
know<00:01:45.689> if<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:45.990> working<00:01:46.320> currently<00:01:46.829> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
know if that's working currently but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.460 
know if that's working currently but
then<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.090> also<00:01:48.240> disable<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:49.049> keyboard

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
then you can also disable the keyboard

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.990 
then you can also disable the keyboard
so<00:01:49.680> if<00:01:49.770> you're<00:01:49.890> swiping<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> left<00:01:50.610> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
so if you're swiping to the left and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
so if you're swiping to the left and
spotlights<00:01:51.540> open<00:01:51.930> or<00:01:52.049> something<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
spotlights open or something like that

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
spotlights open or something like that
it<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.549> drop<00:01:54.090> down<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> keyboard

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it will actually drop down the keyboard

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.389 
it will actually drop down the keyboard
so<00:01:55.290> it<00:01:55.409> doesn't<00:01:55.770> get<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.040> way<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.369> your
