 the alcohol that produced and its brand 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.640
 was a pledge of quality a big test to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.140
 jack morning tipped his distillery 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.939
 wants to open his safe for

 get something inside except

 that they are mistaken for combinations of which

 times unsuccessfully at that which could 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.250
 wait for his arriving nephew since 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 he knows the right combination 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.090
 but no when one is a man of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 the jack span daniel's good no one has 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.309
 no time 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.320
 of Jacques stroke gets angry loses 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.570
 patience and kick a balance in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.010
 the chest and he kicks 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.399
 so much that he breaks the big 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 toe 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.360
 the wound will get infected and jack go 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.329
 to die in 1911 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.649
 five years after this famous verse the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.570
 trunk in question is always visible 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.640
 distillery and tourists can 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.989
 to take a picture with the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.909
 geraldine coy who pretends to give 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.200
 a kick to the safe is 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.780
 funny because someone is really 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.580
 dead like that we know hair and I tell you 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.260
 not according to legend jack would have 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.659
 asked shortly before dying 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.460
 a last drink the prohibition is in 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.259
 force at the time the notice of death of 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.150
 jack will present him only as a 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.439
 farmer and horse breeder we go 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.080
 not at all talked about his career in 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.909
 the alcohol he was buried near 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.040
 the distillery and its grave is surrounded 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.150
 of two iron chairs it would seem that 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.070
 things are there to welcome the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.650
 jack mistresses who has never been 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.299
 married and the history of the safe as to 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.829
 it was recently taken over by the 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.420
 mark on the occasion of the release of a 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.979
 collector's box with 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.259
 bottles in safes 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.180
 miniature here you know all 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.780
 the story 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.100
 personally I can not help but 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.229
 to think of the funeral men 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.619
 who had to take care of the body is when 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.579
 even the superclass to be able to say yes 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.579
 I put in beer jack daniels 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.190
 I promise you that the next videos 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.790
 will be at least as deadly then 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.790
 have a good back
