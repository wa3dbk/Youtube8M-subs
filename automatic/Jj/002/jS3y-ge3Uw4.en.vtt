00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.489
 good question 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.369
 so far it's loud again 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.369
 this is the life 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.230
 and at home there are three children my wife also says many children 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.809
 not far is 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.609
 also very much like games 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:40.609
 and we love to play with dolls 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.100
 and on the other hand also with cuddly toys and today's game is just 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.149
 to play that 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.190
 where will be offered to make you healthy again 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.859
 on a bike ride 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.620
 she had accident around Doll 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.810
 Indeed 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.580
 no Hamm raised at 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.490
 that was very bad yes 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.790
 and she then bumped into the stupidest son Dolge's head 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.450
 that not only we have already wondered 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.320
 Misha Meyer had 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.950
 but on the one hand, on the other hand, ours is very well protected now 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.760
 in the head in Chile but on the other hand that can also be a problem 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.550
 No, in that then the blood can not escape to the outside 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.260
 I do not know many of us in that when you see some blood but in 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.690
 the case would be better 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.230
 the blood can not penetrate to the outside and pushes that in here 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.890
 next to the semi-final 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.380
 and that can be very dangerous I've tried with 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.570
 to perform an operation on our children »again 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.590
 It would make a little peace here 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.790
 The jargon is called Neuro Shiro 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.840
 and then we have how to do that because if it opens at the end of it 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.510
 To let out blood 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.550
 I do not like Frederik that they are not that bad 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.179
 sometimes the association 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 how do you see that we opened 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.089
 4 I hope that the motto is bad out of curiosity or 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.629
 That's what happens in the hospital and she's here 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.429
 Interestingly, I hid there, though 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.579
 Now you can dive here more Munich you can usually do that 

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.240
 not easy to take out 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.369
 because then the connection to 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:32.680
 from the rest of the body 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.680
 Way is also the blood flow would stop working 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.319
 and I also brought you a little movie with one of those 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.649
 were examined 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:46.719
 that's right here but we can do that right now 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.819
 look 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.869
 you can see here it starts with one 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.169
 on the opposite side now the catch 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.119
 Bone on 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.119
 and that's that they will see here in a year and that 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.679
 formally further forward 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.109
 and since 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.499
 you can see what come over to you who might be with me 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:11.329
 help 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:13.499
 what else can you see there? 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.499
 For example, you can see the eye 

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:19.679
 Half to where is the eye 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:21.539
 Börner there it is 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.539
 so there is noble 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:28.819
 and then background here again 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.069
 the little one here is 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.689
 Small hers 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.619
 then continue normally 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.729
 for seekers once again reported we are right in the middle there 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.929
 the nose again 

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:45.519
 and now, on the other hand, he also has my car coming in the wrong place 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.239
 it is 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.239
 and now it's going to be back and that's the way it goes on 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.239
