00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
not many chords let me start on that

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.010 
not many chords let me start on that
first<00:01:27.250> line<00:01:27.520> notice<00:01:28.450> break<00:01:28.659> bread<00:01:28.869> together

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
first line notice break bread together

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.680 
first line notice break bread together
on<00:01:29.380> these<00:01:29.590> we're<00:01:30.340> running<00:01:30.610> down<00:01:30.789> first<00:01:31.479> of<00:01:31.630> all

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
on these we're running down first of all

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.020 
on these we're running down first of all
from<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.960> D<00:01:32.200> chord<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:33.159> the<00:01:33.280> B<00:01:33.399> minor<00:01:33.640> seventh

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
from the D chord to the B minor seventh

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.309 
from the D chord to the B minor seventh
and<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.920> we<00:01:36.100> start<00:01:36.399> with<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.899> dee-nice<00:01:37.899> there<00:01:38.200> on

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
and so we start with a dee-nice there on

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.180 
and so we start with a dee-nice there on
our<00:01:38.440> thumbs<00:01:38.710> we<00:01:39.700> want<00:01:39.880> to<00:01:39.970> get<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.420> B<00:01:41.200> in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
our thumbs we want to get to the B in

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.880 
our thumbs we want to get to the B in
the<00:01:42.369> bass<00:01:42.550> that's<00:01:43.390> from<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.750> fourth<00:01:44.619> string

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
the bass that's from the fourth string

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.480 
the bass that's from the fourth string
open<00:01:45.039> ignoring<00:01:45.759> the<00:01:45.850> capo<00:01:46.210> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.770> be<00:01:48.220> there

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
open ignoring the capo to the be there

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.480 
open ignoring the capo to the be there
on<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.450> second<00:01:49.840> fret<00:01:50.020> because<00:01:50.679> the<00:01:50.950> capo<00:01:51.310> is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
on the second fret because the capo is

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.260 
on the second fret because the capo is
actually<00:01:52.090> C<00:01:52.539> sharp<00:01:52.979> on<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.729> second<00:01:55.119> fret

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
actually C sharp on the second fret

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.710 
actually C sharp on the second fret
there<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:55.780> we<00:01:55.929> can<00:01:56.049> run<00:01:56.229> down

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.130 

scale<00:01:59.500> of<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.860> D<00:02:00.820> C<00:02:01.450> sharp<00:02:03.480> focus<00:02:04.480> reopen<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
scale of the D C sharp focus reopen and

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.760 
scale of the D C sharp focus reopen and
then<00:02:05.800> fifth<00:02:06.490> string<00:02:06.730> of<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.030> fourth<00:02:07.330> fret<00:02:07.770> and

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
then fifth string of the fourth fret and

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.040 
then fifth string of the fourth fret and
then<00:02:09.040> history<00:02:09.760> of<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.910> second<00:02:10.270> fret<00:02:12.930> so<00:02:13.930> we

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
then history of the second fret so we

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.800 
then history of the second fret so we
play<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.290> D<00:02:14.560> chord<00:02:14.800> and<00:02:15.580> actually<00:02:15.940> often<00:02:16.330> don't

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
play a D chord and actually often don't

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.560 
play a D chord and actually often don't
put<00:02:17.050> my<00:02:17.220> index<00:02:18.220> finger<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:18.820> she<00:02:19.180> that's<00:02:19.330> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
put my index finger on she that's the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.940 
put my index finger on she that's the
top<00:02:19.930> string<00:02:20.260> ring<00:02:21.250> there<00:02:21.490> and<00:02:22.560> later<00:02:23.560> daddy

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
top string ring there and later daddy

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:31.740 
top string ring there and later daddy
too<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.320> get<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:30.150> C<00:02:31.150> sharp<00:02:31.180> in<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.720> base

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
too so you get this C sharp in the base

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:40.550 
too so you get this C sharp in the base
and<00:02:32.230> then<00:02:32.740> go<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:32.980> the<00:02:33.160> B<00:02:33.250> myself<00:02:38.610> together<00:02:39.610> and

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
and then go to the B myself together and

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.490 
and then go to the B myself together and
the<00:02:41.560> next<00:02:41.830> chord<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.160> an<00:02:42.340> a7<00:02:43.240> so<00:02:43.570> you<00:02:43.630> can<00:02:43.810> again

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the next chord is an a7 so you can again

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:51.780 
the next chord is an a7 so you can again
in<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.860> bass<00:02:45.040> now<00:02:45.430> go<00:02:45.640> from<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:50.790> bread

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
in the bass now go from that the bread
