00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.960
 hi to all his back seats we get 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.259
 found for a little point gameplay 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.250
 strategic sion we term 2025 a fashion 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.470
 game and a map 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.760
 I cried once I believe is the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.960
 game mode I never have a few points 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.220
 strategic because I do not play it 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.779
 what ever simply 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.160
 but it was my first part of 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.840
 back from the weekend on holidays where 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 I did not do I did not play the 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.740
 weekend and I went back on the support 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.910
 dw with silent laser sight and 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.500
 I had strict domain scores in 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 does it's the basic strict scores 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.160
 I have not been able to exchange and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.630
 the forgotten ones the exchange is followed the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.910
 funny lightning and the drag and fire 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.640
 so I'll do a little good scores 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.649
 following leaves build that I had and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 all that all the work to that 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.680
 it's at level 9 3 when I started 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.420
 the part and it's my practice since one 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.590
 weekend so those earlier rather 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.570
 not bad but it's not that 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.309
 which I spoke to you if I go to you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 talk about a trick of a lot of people from 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.510
 wonder how is it 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 camouflage diamond on rifles at 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.489
 pump 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.000
 so I'll tell you how the 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.010
 unlock and start the most simply 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 to unlock it so there are some 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.869
 tips that are going to be obvious 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.390
 it's January to say yes yes what 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.580
 the more he says that we know the media that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.229
 are my new on the game on this 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.340
 new call of duty and an accent 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.080
 new on call of duty so they 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.509
 may not know the packaging I 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.680
 wanted to give my advice is what 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.960
 I thought they were the simplest 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.060
 to unlock the camouflage before so 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.350
 for what they did I dare you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.180
 see on the screen to unlock the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.900
 crazy camouflage you have to unlock everything 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.880
 all camouflages for all 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.110
 pump guns so to unlock all 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.430
 the camouflets not in any case me 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 do it in gold basically because for 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.490
 unlock camouflage as standard 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.649
 you have to unlock all the camouflage 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.869
 so to unlock does the snub in 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.290
 quarters in diamonds so 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.869
 I lose mx2 in diamonds must 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.000
 unlock all the camouflages for them 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.270
 four shotguns that we have for 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.040
 unlock the four the camouflage 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.110
 in gold for a shotgun this is the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.409
 same thing that we 4 we need everything 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.180
 first make 250 one shoot like you 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.820
 can see it there we unlock the the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.610
 cryptex camouflage they do a trick 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.540
 like that to unlock then after 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.250
 to have made the 250 one shoot with the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.220
 shotgun what to do is 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 you have to unblock what to do 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.640
 not in gold is not necessarily 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.959
 obliged to do it in order but I 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.160
 will tell you in at 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.560
 camouflets what is enough one has to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.830
 first get 30 get 30 medals from 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.550
 revenge with the surrender then get 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.760
 30 50 elimination without accessories 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:45.970
 then got 50 science elimination to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:49.000
 all equipped then got five 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:52.810
 double murder medals with tears and 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.190
 then unlocked opted to get 10 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.250
 bloodthirsty medals which is that a 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 Strictly rising without them with tears 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.860
 quite simply 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.290
 after doing all this normally you 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.150
 should unlock the gold camouflage for 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.950
 the question afterwards to make 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.420
 250 points all 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.790
 personally I advise you 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.680
 to go on a game mode with which 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.459
 you are comfortable to do the most 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.049
 it possible 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.510
 so for me these guys therese 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.140
 domination after each and every one his 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.670
 preferences 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 then to do the 50 he's with 50 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.200
 that he with 100 to all and without accessories 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.730
 what I'm doing is that I'm doing a 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.440
 class as you will see this on 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.540
 the screen without all the accessories 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.489
 like that all one if I do a 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.019
 kit meaning to all and without exception it 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.209
 account for the two big names 50 which 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.580
 I unlock and 2000 cool to make 50 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.230
 kits without dax30 that they go away all 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.260
 as I said in my previous 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.810
 how to unlock diamond camouflage 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.250
 then after five years 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.450
 that he personally that's what 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.380
 I use I do that first 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.000
 fifty that they go away all and 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.829
 without accessories because doing this 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.480
 I can do at the same time 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:57.070
 revenge medals doubles the 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.280
 Medals the double murder and the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.210
 bloodthirsty medals so for the 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.690
 medals 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.190
 revenge what I advise is 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.650
 to go in match then trimmed in matter 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.750
 not the needs mixed general it's a 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.400
 little simpler for me finally for me 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.570
 and for everyone I think to do 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.800
 medals revenge because if someone 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.060
 we kill you go in the same two 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.130
 yes you usually killed you this 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.450
 pony around him and makes you kill 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.100
 I already did maybe fifteen 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.260
 medals meanwhile a part of 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:27.190
 general scrum so much advanced simple 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:29.110
 then for the medals for the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.910
 bloodthirsty medals that are inscribed 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.270
 strict of 5 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:35.710
 must unblock must unlock 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.600
 unblocked funds already full of medals 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.460
 this double murder first the 5000 is 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.530
 doubly that's pretty simple just 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.820
 kill give a little advice too that 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.750
 you may not know if you 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.790
 make worried for example with a 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.710
 grenade or with any weapon 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.050
 any thing and you kill 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.530
 the second who will kill you before five 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.450
 seconds 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.800
 a second is that with your soul that 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.020
 will count in double murder of which you 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.580
 can for example kill someone at 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.930
 heart then killed another with your rifle 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.980
 to pump it will make a medal this double 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.500
 murder or your shotgun 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.940
 which is rather simpler to 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.440
 to finally get to know better I find 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.530
 then the bloodthirsty medal 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.640
 do 5 a strict of 5 with guns 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:11.230
 with the bank net is 

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.570
 knowingly with japan if you do 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.310
 a kill with a grenade for example 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:16.030
 go you did three docks with the 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.740
 your shotgun 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.170
 you will have to do 2 which is still in 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:22.540
 the more I think I'm not sure to have 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.620
 the medal with nothing even though the 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.880
 medals are winning in either she 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.980
 not count because you have soul and 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.210
 seminars before the 5 keys 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.620
 with your weapon because you did 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.940
 a kill with your grenades 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.610
 I do not if you understand what I'm saying 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.540
 but also something you do not know 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.030
 maybe not it is that if you do 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.500
 a strict of 10 with with larissa you 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.600
 has two bloodthirsty medals actually 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.190
 which is rather to know better to know 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.580
 now let's move on to the 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.380
 phase of weapons makes it best for 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.750
 weapons because as you know it takes 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:52.960
 do they go do 250 one shoot so 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:56.440
 there you say yes japan beats the 870 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.570
 08 77 and s and which one I'm trying rather 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.730
 super simple then as you go on the 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.180
 see there now for rifles to 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.910
 pump 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.020
 except psg I recommend a little trick 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.090
 a little trick 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.520
 you will see there comparing when I 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.560
 shoot in ten years all the balls they 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.599
 go very well in one place 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.039
 and when I shoot without aiming at ballets 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.240
 go a little bit anywhere small 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:17.979
 balls they go a little anywhere 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.259
 so it does less damage if we aim 

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:22.360
 like that it will do less damage than the 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.039
 little balls they are less affected 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:25.360
 have not all touched so it's not going 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.590
 go kill or to make one shot 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.699
 with the leash twelve months I find that 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.470
 we do not need to be wrong he 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.610
 just aim a little bit then 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:32.889
 after a while you will have them 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:36.039
 will not have everything every island you will not have 

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:38.680
 not a one shot but you will rather 

00:06:36.039 --> 00:06:39.639
 often one shoot if you aim to 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.409
 Please a little advice it freezes 

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:43.770
 account these currencies and then for this 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:47.919
 last harnes to it is relou and boring 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:50.560
 who is there m1100 something I am 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:52.900
 not too sure eh ben for that it takes for 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.250
 do the 250 one shoot you have to go in 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.590
 in 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.789
 what is the name of hardcore because 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.229
 otherwise it's impossible almost impossible 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.759
 end of the game it's possible but it's
