00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
buried from the new map pack and this is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.830 
buried from the new map pack and this is
one<00:00:21.770> of<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.189> coolest<00:00:22.669> glitches<00:00:23.270> now<00:00:23.419> this<00:00:23.689> is

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
one of the coolest glitches now this is

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.999 
one of the coolest glitches now this is
just<00:00:24.020> like<00:00:24.110> a<00:00:24.169> little<00:00:24.259> bit<00:00:24.439> of<00:00:24.500> an<00:00:24.560> intro<00:00:24.860> as

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
just like a little bit of an intro as

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.439 
just like a little bit of an intro as
you<00:00:25.099> can<00:00:25.220> see<00:00:25.460> there<00:00:25.759> when<00:00:25.970> he<00:00:26.029> jumped<00:00:26.300> up<00:00:26.360> in

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
you can see there when he jumped up in

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:28.929 
you can see there when he jumped up in
that<00:00:26.570> platform<00:00:26.750> he<00:00:27.470> actually<00:00:28.160> broke<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.759> and

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
that platform he actually broke it and

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.990 
that platform he actually broke it and
it<00:00:29.090> fell<00:00:29.390> down<00:00:29.419> and<00:00:29.930> he<00:00:30.219> didn't<00:00:31.219> die<00:00:31.460> but<00:00:31.790> like

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
it fell down and he didn't die but like

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.850 
it fell down and he didn't die but like
you<00:00:32.149> know<00:00:32.270> he<00:00:32.450> was<00:00:32.629> not<00:00:32.780> having<00:00:33.110> fun<00:00:33.469> falling

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
you know he was not having fun falling

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.049 
you know he was not having fun falling
down<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> giant<00:00:34.340> pit<00:00:34.489> but<00:00:34.700> as<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:34.910> can<00:00:35.000> see

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
down a giant pit but as you can see

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.750 
down a giant pit but as you can see
there<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:35.750> guy<00:00:36.410> disappeared<00:00:36.980> and<00:00:37.160> now<00:00:37.700> you

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
there that guy disappeared and now you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.639 
there that guy disappeared and now you
can<00:00:38.059> get<00:00:38.180> up<00:00:38.360> there<00:00:38.539> without<00:00:38.840> an<00:00:39.140> issue<00:00:39.260> so

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:39.649 
can get up there without an issue so

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:41.229 
can get up there without an issue so
that's<00:00:39.800> just<00:00:39.980> like<00:00:40.070> a<00:00:40.190> quick<00:00:40.430> brief<00:00:40.789> intro<00:00:41.180> on

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
that's just like a quick brief intro on

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:42.400 
that's just like a quick brief intro on
what's<00:00:41.420> good<00:00:41.539> this<00:00:41.690> is<00:00:41.840> going<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.020> be<00:00:42.170> but

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
what's good this is going to be but

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.600 
what's good this is going to be but
basically<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:42.950> glitch<00:00:43.160> will<00:00:43.340> allow<00:00:43.460> you<00:00:43.520> to

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
basically this glitch will allow you to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.090 
basically this glitch will allow you to
get<00:00:43.699> kind<00:00:43.909> of<00:00:43.940> like<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:44.210> sky<00:00:44.719> base<00:00:44.960> as<00:00:45.199> well<00:00:45.890> as

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:46.100 
get kind of like a sky base as well as

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.939 
get kind of like a sky base as well as
an<00:00:46.249> LSAT<00:00:46.789> with<00:00:47.149> unlimited<00:00:47.480> ammo<00:00:47.929> so<00:00:48.230> it's<00:00:48.769> a

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
an LSAT with unlimited ammo so it's a

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.739 
an LSAT with unlimited ammo so it's a
really<00:00:49.249> really<00:00:49.339> good<00:00:49.850> glitch<00:00:50.239> that<00:00:50.539> will

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
really really good glitch that will

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.479 
really really good glitch that will
allow<00:00:50.989> you<00:00:51.050> to<00:00:51.170> be<00:00:51.289> able<00:00:51.350> to<00:00:51.530> create<00:00:52.249> a<00:00:52.309> barrier

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
allow you to be able to create a barrier

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.979 
allow you to be able to create a barrier
glitch<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:53.030> zombies<00:00:53.329> can't<00:00:53.510> get<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.749> you<00:00:53.839> as

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
glitch to zombies can't get to you as

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.669 
glitch to zombies can't get to you as
well<00:00:54.679> as<00:00:55.010> to<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:55.370> able<00:00:55.460> to<00:00:55.609> avoid<00:00:55.999> um<00:00:56.679> just

00:00:57.669 --> 00:00:57.679 
well as to be able to avoid um just

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.829 
well as to be able to avoid um just
dying<00:00:58.129> if<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.429> need<00:00:58.819> to<00:00:59.030> so<00:00:59.300> this<00:00:59.449> clip<00:00:59.600> this

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
dying if you need to so this clip this

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:01.419 
dying if you need to so this clip this
glitch<00:01:00.079> will<00:01:00.350> work<00:01:00.589> in<00:01:00.769> a<00:01:00.829> private<00:01:01.249> or<00:01:01.399> a

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
glitch will work in a private or a

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:04.360 
glitch will work in a private or a
public<00:01:01.489> match<00:01:01.940> and<00:01:02.800> pretty<00:01:03.800> much<00:01:03.889> anyone<00:01:04.220> can

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
public match and pretty much anyone can

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.250 
public match and pretty much anyone can
do<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.940> the<00:01:04.970> only<00:01:05.390> difference<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.960> that<00:01:06.110> in

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
do it the the only difference is that in

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.170 
do it the the only difference is that in
a<00:01:06.320> public<00:01:06.680> match<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.400> person<00:01:07.760> who<00:01:07.850> needs<00:01:07.970> to

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
a public match the person who needs to

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.090 
a public match the person who needs to
leave<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.479> game<00:01:08.659> for<00:01:08.870> this<00:01:08.960> to<00:01:09.110> work<00:01:09.350> cannot

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
leave the game for this to work cannot

leave the game for this to work cannot
rejoin<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:10.760> if<00:01:10.850> you<00:01:10.909> know<00:01:11.000> public<00:01:11.180> match<00:01:11.450> it's

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
rejoin so if you know public match it's

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.060 
rejoin so if you know public match it's
not<00:01:11.810> as<00:01:11.960> easy<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.229> rejoin<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.799> need<00:01:13.010> a

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
not as easy to rejoin you need a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.320 
not as easy to rejoin you need a
teammate<00:01:13.430> who's<00:01:13.580> willing<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.850> abandon<00:01:14.120> the

basically<00:01:37.040> as<00:01:37.250> you<00:01:37.580> hit<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.120> button<00:01:38.390> to<00:01:38.450> climb

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
basically as you hit the button to climb

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.660 
basically as you hit the button to climb
whether<00:01:39.140> on<00:01:39.320> your<00:01:39.440> xbox<00:01:39.650> or<00:01:40.010> ps3<00:01:40.190> whatever

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
whether on your xbox or ps3 whatever

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.750 
whether on your xbox or ps3 whatever
maybe<00:01:40.880> quit<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.780> game<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.280> then<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.610> can

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
maybe quit the game and then you can

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.760 
maybe quit the game and then you can
rejoin<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.540> that<00:01:44.630> platform<00:01:44.870> won't<00:01:45.410> break

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
rejoin and that platform won't break

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.620 
rejoin and that platform won't break
you'll<00:01:46.040> do<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.250> jump<00:01:46.550> up<00:01:46.670> there<00:01:46.820> hang<00:01:47.300> out<00:01:47.450> up

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
you'll do the jump up there hang out up

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.630 
you'll do the jump up there hang out up
there<00:01:47.780> and<00:01:48.080> get<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.590> LSAT<00:01:48.980> your<00:01:49.190> teammates<00:01:49.490> to

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
there and get the LSAT your teammates to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.070 
there and get the LSAT your teammates to
have<00:01:49.730> unlimited<00:01:49.910> ammo<00:01:50.360> for<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.660> and<00:01:50.900> basically

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
have unlimited ammo for it and basically

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.530 
have unlimited ammo for it and basically
you<00:01:51.830> can<00:01:51.860> chill<00:01:52.220> out<00:01:52.250> with<00:01:52.580> them<00:01:52.850> and<00:01:53.030> just

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
you can chill out with them and just

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.750 
you can chill out with them and just
shoot<00:01:53.720> zombies<00:01:53.750> until<00:01:54.620> Kingdom<00:01:54.950> Come<00:01:55.130> because

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
shoot zombies until Kingdom Come because

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.370 
shoot zombies until Kingdom Come because
this<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:56.330> just<00:01:56.510> like<00:01:56.630> such<00:01:56.780> a<00:01:56.810> cool<00:01:56.990> glitch<00:01:57.200> you

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
this is just like such a cool glitch you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.410 
this is just like such a cool glitch you
cannot<00:01:57.800> be<00:01:57.980> killed<00:01:58.190> by<00:01:58.340> zombies<00:01:58.730> up<00:01:58.850> here<00:01:59.060> you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
cannot be killed by zombies up here you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.730 
cannot be killed by zombies up here you
can<00:01:59.540> take<00:01:59.660> breaks<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.110> can<00:02:00.230> also<00:02:00.350> jump<00:02:00.590> down

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
can take breaks you can also jump down

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.990 
can take breaks you can also jump down
and<00:02:00.860> get<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.010> power-ups<00:02:01.430> in<00:02:01.580> between<00:02:01.790> rounds

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
and get the power-ups in between rounds

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.120 
and get the power-ups in between rounds
because<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.110> such<00:02:03.260> an<00:02:03.380> easy<00:02:03.530> thing<00:02:03.830> to<00:02:03.890> get

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
because it's such an easy thing to get

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.420 
because it's such an easy thing to get
up<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.460> down<00:02:04.580> out<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:06.350> that's<00:02:06.860> about<00:02:07.250> it

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
up and down out of so that's about it

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.859 
up and down out of so that's about it
for<00:02:07.580> this<00:02:07.670> glitch<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.450> really

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
for this glitch it's really

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.440 
for this glitch it's really
straightforward<00:02:09.310> it's<00:02:10.310> but<00:02:10.580> it's<00:02:10.700> also<00:02:10.970> one

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
straightforward it's but it's also one

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.699 
straightforward it's but it's also one
of<00:02:11.510> the<00:02:11.599> most<00:02:11.750> useful<00:02:11.959> glitches<00:02:12.440> I've<00:02:12.560> ever

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
of the most useful glitches I've ever

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.410 
of the most useful glitches I've ever
seen<00:02:12.980> it's<00:02:13.459> a<00:02:13.550> really<00:02:13.790> neat<00:02:13.909> glitch<00:02:14.120> as<00:02:14.330> you

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
seen it's a really neat glitch as you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.380 
seen it's a really neat glitch as you
can<00:02:14.540> see<00:02:14.659> now<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.760> Andrew<00:02:16.760> spawning<00:02:17.120> back

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
can see now this is Andrew spawning back

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.000 
can see now this is Andrew spawning back
in<00:02:17.599> his<00:02:17.720> way<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:17.930> spawn<00:02:18.230> back<00:02:18.409> in<00:02:18.590> after<00:02:18.920> you

in his way to spawn back in after you

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.140 
in his way to spawn back in after you
quit<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.250> game<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.550> this<00:02:19.610> is<00:02:19.730> just<00:02:19.880> kind<00:02:20.000> of

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
quit the game so this is just kind of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.090 
quit the game so this is just kind of
showing<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.600> even<00:02:21.350> if<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.710> are<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> person

showing that even if you are the person
who<00:02:22.310> had<00:02:22.400> to<00:02:22.490> leave<00:02:22.640> you<00:02:22.850> can<00:02:22.910> easily<00:02:23.360> get<00:02:23.480> back

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
who had to leave you can easily get back

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.580 
who had to leave you can easily get back
into<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.110> game<00:02:24.260> jump<00:02:24.740> up<00:02:24.920> into<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.130> air

can<00:02:30.690> be<00:02:30.810> done<00:02:30.930> public<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.560> said<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.069> more

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640
