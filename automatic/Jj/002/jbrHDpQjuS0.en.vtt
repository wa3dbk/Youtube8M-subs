this is one of the forms and you have
you<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> certain<00:00:25.289> amount<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.650> rock<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> a

you have a certain amount of rock and a
certain<00:00:26.640> amount<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.910> twists<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.599> I'll<00:00:27.660> cover

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
certain amount of twists and I'll cover

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.109 
certain amount of twists and I'll cover
that<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> later<00:00:28.500> video<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.279> what<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> twist

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that in a later video but what the twist

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.120 
that in a later video but what the twist
is<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.840> difference<00:00:31.199> between<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.769> angle

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is is the difference between the angle

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.459 
is is the difference between the angle
sharper<00:00:32.940> angle<00:00:33.300> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.480> front<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
sharper angle of the front and the

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.770 
sharper angle of the front and the
flatter<00:00:34.710> angle<00:00:34.950> or<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
flatter angle or the back and so the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.459 
flatter angle or the back and so the
place<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> position<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:38.010> forms<00:00:38.690> is<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:40.050> come

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
place to position these forms is to come

place<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:45.329> would<00:01:45.960> try<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.259> just

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
place this and so we would try and just

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.530 
place this and so we would try and just
get<00:01:46.649> as<00:01:46.740> much<00:01:46.890> bar<00:01:47.220> surface<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:47.880> possible<00:01:48.360> my

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
get as much bar surface as possible my

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.560 
get as much bar surface as possible my
concern<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> here<00:01:51.329> has

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
concern is that and so this one here has

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
concern is that and so this one here has
a<00:01:51.600> little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:52.079> too<00:01:52.649> sharp<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.159> an<00:01:53.250> angle

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
a little bit too sharp of an angle

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
a little bit too sharp of an angle
because<00:01:53.640> we're<00:01:53.909> losing<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.420> lot<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.960> right

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
because we're losing a lot of this right

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.310 
because we're losing a lot of this right
up<00:01:55.470> in<00:01:55.619> here<00:01:55.979> okay<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.329> we're<00:01:57.659> coming<00:01:57.899> back<00:01:58.079> in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
up in here okay and we're coming back in

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
up in here okay and we're coming back in
here<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> back<00:01:59.100> end<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.520> fitting<00:01:59.790> pretty

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
here and this back end is fitting pretty

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.609 
here and this back end is fitting pretty
good<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.329> we're<00:02:00.479> losing<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.930> little<00:02:01.140> bit<00:02:01.409> if

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
good but we're losing a little bit if

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.230 
good but we're losing a little bit if
you<00:02:01.829> were<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.070> see<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.369> you're<00:02:02.759> losing<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
you were to see it you're losing a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.789 
you were to see it you're losing a
little<00:02:03.360> bit<00:02:03.570> here<00:02:03.869> through<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> middle<00:02:04.560> just

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
little bit here through the middle just

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.910 
little bit here through the middle just
on<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.399> bar<00:02:05.689> okay<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.079> isn't<00:02:07.320> performed

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
on this bar okay so this isn't performed

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400 
on this bar okay so this isn't performed
and<00:02:08.459> I've<00:02:08.640> simplified<00:02:09.239> this<00:02:09.690> I've<00:02:09.929> only<00:02:10.050> got<00:02:10.379> a

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
and I've simplified this I've only got a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.650 
and I've simplified this I've only got a
few<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:10.950> forms<00:02:11.340> now

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
few of the forms now

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.630 
few of the forms now
hey<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.440> is<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.830> here's<00:02:14.070> another<00:02:14.370> one

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
hey this is right here's another one

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.210 
hey this is right here's another one
that's<00:02:14.760> got<00:02:15.000> a<00:02:15.030> little<00:02:15.210> less<00:02:15.600> rock<00:02:16.530> in<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.950> but

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
that's got a little less rock in it but

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.820 
that's got a little less rock in it but
if<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.550> you<00:02:18.210> start<00:02:18.480> looking<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.080> bring<00:02:19.680> his

there okay now and start looking at it
see<00:02:24.000> you're<00:02:24.150> starting<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> bridge<00:02:24.750> back<00:02:25.140> in

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
see you're starting to bridge back in

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.780 
see you're starting to bridge back in
here<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.650> little<00:02:25.980> bit<00:02:26.130> if<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.370> come<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:26.730> look

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
here a little bit if you come and look

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.690 
here a little bit if you come and look
down<00:02:27.150> under<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.900> you're<00:02:28.410> bridging<00:02:28.710> okay<00:02:29.640> so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
down under here you're bridging okay so

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.850 
down under here you're bridging okay so
this<00:02:30.120> one<00:02:30.330> fits<00:02:30.600> good<00:02:30.900> pretty<00:02:31.200> decently<00:02:31.680> in

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
this one fits good pretty decently in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.350 
this one fits good pretty decently in
the<00:02:31.980> front<00:02:32.220> end<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.610> got<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.790> little<00:02:33.060> bit

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
the front end but it's got a little bit

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.620 
the front end but it's got a little bit
too<00:02:34.110> flat<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.920> bar<00:02:35.160> in<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.700> okay<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.480> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
too flat of a bar in it okay but it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.730 
too flat of a bar in it okay but it
would<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> considered<00:02:37.590> considered<00:02:38.370> form<00:02:39.740> it

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
would be a considered considered form it

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.920 
would be a considered considered form it
comes<00:02:41.010> down<00:02:41.460> to<00:02:41.520> it<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.450> we're<00:02:42.600> going<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.750> take

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
comes down to it now we're going to take

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.010 
comes down to it now we're going to take
this<00:02:43.140> one<00:02:43.380> here<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.660> is<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.870> little

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
this one here this one here is a little

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.590 
this one here this one here is a little
bit<00:02:46.470> too<00:02:46.770> wide<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.640> angles<00:02:48.210> are<00:02:48.360> fitting

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
bit too wide the angles are fitting

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.910 
bit too wide the angles are fitting
pretty<00:02:48.720> good<00:02:48.990> we're<00:02:49.170> losing<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.560> little<00:02:49.770> bit

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
pretty good we're losing a little bit

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620 
pretty good we're losing a little bit
more<00:02:50.250> of<00:02:50.370> this<00:02:50.520> back<00:02:50.820> here<00:02:51.120> than<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.420> would<00:02:51.600> like

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
more of this back here than I would like

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.690 
more of this back here than I would like
we're<00:02:52.230> losing<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.740> a<00:02:52.770> belt<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.130> here

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
we're losing to a belt right here

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.130 
we're losing to a belt right here
I've<00:02:54.060> got<00:02:54.210> enough<00:02:54.390> rock<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
I've got enough rock in it and

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.570 
I've got enough rock in it and
everything<00:02:55.410> but<00:02:55.440> it's<00:02:55.770> too<00:02:55.980> wide<00:02:56.250> we're

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
everything but it's too wide we're

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.000 
everything but it's too wide we're
falling<00:02:56.970> out<00:02:57.210> of<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.570> pocket<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:58.650> should<00:02:58.890> be

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
falling out of that pocket it should be

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.820 
falling out of that pocket it should be
sitting<00:02:59.370> right<00:02:59.550> here<00:02:59.810> instead<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.870> down<00:03:01.320> here

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
sitting right here instead of down here

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.160 
sitting right here instead of down here
okay<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.490> it's<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.880> little<00:03:02.910> bit<00:03:03.210> too<00:03:03.450> wide<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:04.080> a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
okay so it's a little bit too wide of a

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.860 
okay so it's a little bit too wide of a
form<00:03:04.580> okay<00:03:05.580> so<00:03:05.610> now<00:03:06.090> we're<00:03:06.330> going<00:03:06.450> to<00:03:06.510> come<00:03:06.720> to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
form okay so now we're going to come to

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.770 
form okay so now we're going to come to
the<00:03:06.990> next<00:03:07.200> one<00:03:08.270> and<00:03:09.270> then<00:03:09.420> this<00:03:09.540> one<00:03:09.750> right

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
here we set in here and our angles are

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.030 
here we set in here and our angles are
all<00:03:12.660> matching<00:03:13.200> pretty<00:03:13.440> good<00:03:13.710> we're<00:03:14.010> making

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
we want a little bit off of off back in

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.510 
we want a little bit off of off back in
we<00:03:21.450> don't<00:03:21.660> want<00:03:21.900> him<00:03:22.050> we<00:03:22.980> don't<00:03:23.160> want<00:03:23.340> it<00:03:23.370> up

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
we don't want him we don't want it up

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.180 
we don't want him we don't want it up
here<00:03:23.550> like<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.330> but<00:03:24.570> we<00:03:24.930> do<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.410> little<00:03:25.830> bit<00:03:26.040> up

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
here like this but we do a little bit up

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.500 
here like this but we do a little bit up
like<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:26.610> not<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.030> hurt<00:03:27.210> anything

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
like that's not going to hurt anything

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.030 
like that's not going to hurt anything
because<00:03:27.990> when<00:03:28.140> you<00:03:28.230> put<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.500> down<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.950> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
because when you put it down and the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.830 
because when you put it down and the
horse<00:03:29.250> goes<00:03:29.490> through<00:03:29.760> a<00:03:29.820> ditch<00:03:30.150> we<00:03:30.450> don't<00:03:30.660> want

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
horse goes through a ditch we don't want

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.800 
horse goes through a ditch we don't want
the<00:03:30.960> back<00:03:31.170> end<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.620> this<00:03:31.770> digging<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.400> line

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
the back end of this digging in the line

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.000 
the back end of this digging in the line
there<00:03:33.810> again<00:03:34.110> right<00:03:34.350> here's<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.740> place<00:03:34.980> to

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
there again right here's the place to

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.100 
there again right here's the place to
position<00:03:35.700> it<00:03:35.820> just<00:03:35.850> like<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.420> cup<00:03:36.720> it

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
position it just like that cup it

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.750 
position it just like that cup it
set<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.620> over<00:03:37.740> there<00:03:37.980> like<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
set it over there like that and the

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.610 
set it over there like that and the
angles<00:03:39.210> are<00:03:39.390> all<00:03:39.510> matching<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> big

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
angles are all matching that's the big

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.310 
angles are all matching that's the big
thing<00:03:40.650> I'm<00:03:41.010> after<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.490> the<00:03:41.640> angles<00:03:42.210> so<00:03:43.110> now

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
thing I'm after is the angles so now

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.800 
thing I'm after is the angles so now
when<00:03:43.590> it<00:03:43.710> comes<00:03:43.920> time<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.340> photograph<00:03:45.120> this

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
when it comes time to photograph this

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.080 
when it comes time to photograph this
form<00:03:46.170> we<00:03:46.680> want<00:03:46.890> to<00:03:46.980> come<00:03:47.190> at<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.490> 45<00:03:48.060> degree

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
form we want to come at a 45 degree

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.270 
form we want to come at a 45 degree
angle<00:03:48.960> and<00:03:49.080> take<00:03:49.320> your<00:03:49.530> pictures<00:03:49.920> like<00:03:50.130> this

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
angle and take your pictures like this

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.380 
angle and take your pictures like this
so<00:03:50.460> I<00:03:50.520> can<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:51.060> that<00:03:51.360> the<00:03:51.930> angles<00:03:52.470> match<00:03:53.360> okay

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so I can see that the angles match okay

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.420 
so I can see that the angles match okay
that's<00:03:54.960> from<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.290> front<00:03:55.560> end<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.070> can<00:03:56.280> do

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
that's from the front end and you can do

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.430 
that's from the front end and you can do
it<00:03:56.490> both<00:03:56.610> sides<00:03:56.910> if<00:03:57.120> you<00:03:57.150> want<00:03:57.480> one<00:03:57.780> sides<00:03:58.140> all

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
it both sides if you want one sides all

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.200 
it both sides if you want one sides all
it's<00:03:58.650> really<00:03:58.950> necessary<00:03:59.520> because<00:03:59.760> you<00:04:00.000> only

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
it's really necessary because you only

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.820 
it's really necessary because you only
you're<00:04:00.480> gonna<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.840> identical<00:04:01.500> thing<00:04:01.680> on

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
you're gonna have the identical thing on

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.890 
you're gonna have the identical thing on
the<00:04:01.920> other<00:04:01.950> side<00:04:02.160> unless<00:04:03.150> the<00:04:03.330> horse<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.720> off

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
the other side unless the horse is off

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.510 
the other side unless the horse is off
and<00:04:04.110> then<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.350> have<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.650> pad<00:04:05.070> or<00:04:05.370> something

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
and then you have to pad or something

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.550 
and then you have to pad or something
accordingly<00:04:06.210> okay<00:04:06.540> now<00:04:07.140> you're<00:04:07.380> going<00:04:07.470> to

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
accordingly okay now you're going to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.980 
accordingly okay now you're going to
come<00:04:07.800> over<00:04:07.830> to<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> side<00:04:08.670> here<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.390> you're

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
come over to the side here and you're

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.110 
come over to the side here and you're
going<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.140> take<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.410> picture<00:04:10.740> right<00:04:11.100> in<00:04:11.130> here<00:04:11.730> to

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
going to take a picture right in here to

going to take a picture right in here to
make<00:04:12.330> sure<00:04:12.360> that<00:04:12.960> we<00:04:13.110> got<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.290> good<00:04:13.440> bar<00:04:13.710> contact

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
make sure that we got a good bar contact

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.460 
make sure that we got a good bar contact
through<00:04:14.610> here<00:04:14.940> there<00:04:15.750> again<00:04:16.020> here's<00:04:16.320> your

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470

through here there again here's your
stirrup<00:04:16.830> slot<00:04:17.160> right<00:04:17.370> in<00:04:17.609> here<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:17.910> I<00:04:17.970> don't

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
stirrup slot right in here and I don't

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.849 
stirrup slot right in here and I don't
worry<00:04:18.390> about<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.750> this<00:04:18.870> one<00:04:19.080> particular<00:04:19.470> ones

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
worry about it this one particular ones

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.310 
worry about it this one particular ones
have<00:04:20.070> got<00:04:20.190> good<00:04:20.400> contact<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:21.989> got<00:04:22.140> good

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
have got good contact but you got good

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.040 
have got good contact but you got good
contact<00:04:22.919> from<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.160> side<00:04:23.540> okay<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:24.900> the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
contact from the side okay so that's the

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.480 
contact from the side okay so that's the
angle<00:04:25.320> you<00:04:25.470> want<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.710> take<00:04:25.890> that

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
angle you want to take that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.010 
angle you want to take that
then<00:04:26.910> we're<00:04:27.090> going<00:04:27.180> to<00:04:27.240> come<00:04:27.509> around<00:04:27.630> here<00:04:27.990> to

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
then we're going to come around here to

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.770 
then we're going to come around here to
the<00:04:28.229> back<00:04:28.530> end<00:04:28.889> and<00:04:29.430> we<00:04:29.580> want<00:04:29.759> an<00:04:29.849> angle<00:04:30.240> at<00:04:30.720> a

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
the back end and we want an angle at a

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.320 
the back end and we want an angle at a
45<00:04:31.440> degree<00:04:31.680> angle<00:04:31.889> from<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.610> back<00:04:32.789> end<00:04:33.090> so<00:04:33.300> I

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
45 degree angle from the back end so I

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.770 
45 degree angle from the back end so I
can<00:04:33.419> see<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.229> angles<00:04:34.710> through<00:04:35.039> here<00:04:35.490> are

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
can see that the angles through here are

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.890 
can see that the angles through here are
matching<00:04:36.860> okay<00:04:37.910> there<00:04:38.910> again<00:04:39.180> not<00:04:39.419> worrying

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
matching okay there again not worrying

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.870 
matching okay there again not worrying
about<00:04:40.050> whether<00:04:40.410> or<00:04:40.620> not<00:04:40.740> this<00:04:40.949> is<00:04:41.130> contacting

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
about whether or not this is contacting

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.300 
about whether or not this is contacting
the<00:04:42.000> spine<00:04:42.330> because<00:04:42.569> the<00:04:42.960> finish<00:04:43.259> saddle<00:04:43.680> this

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
the spine because the finish saddle this

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.249 
the spine because the finish saddle this
these<00:04:44.669> forms<00:04:45.030> are<00:04:45.120> not<00:04:45.300> representative<00:04:46.139> of

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
these forms are not representative of

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:49.070 
these forms are not representative of
that<00:04:46.860> also<00:04:47.460> this<00:04:47.940> very<00:04:48.210> front<00:04:48.630> end<00:04:48.810> if<00:04:48.990> you

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
that also this very front end if you

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.659 
that also this very front end if you
look<00:04:49.289> here<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.680> see<00:04:49.710> that<00:04:50.039> this<00:04:50.160> is<00:04:50.370> a<00:04:50.400> little

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
look here you see that this is a little

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.270 
look here you see that this is a little
tight<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.599> finished<00:04:52.080> form<00:04:52.410> are<00:04:52.830> the<00:04:52.949> finished

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
tree these forms don't represent that so

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.589 
tree these forms don't represent that so
if<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.370> digs<00:04:56.610> a<00:04:56.729> little<00:04:56.970> bit<00:04:57.090> here<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.479> the

front end like this right here I don't

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.129 
front end like this right here I don't
worry<00:04:59.520> about<00:04:59.639> that<00:05:00.000> because<00:05:00.210> I<00:05:00.449> modify<00:05:01.080> the

worry about that because I modify the
front<00:05:01.530> end<00:05:01.710> when<00:05:02.569> we<00:05:03.569> build<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.900> tree<00:05:04.080> and

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
front end when we build the tree and

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.800 
front end when we build the tree and
I'll<00:05:04.319> show<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.560> on<00:05:04.740> a<00:05:04.889> tree<00:05:05.280> in<00:05:05.849> here<00:05:06.419> just<00:05:06.690> a

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
I'll show you on a tree in here just a

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.210 
I'll show you on a tree in here just a
second<00:05:07.229> I'll<00:05:07.349> show<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.620> a<00:05:07.740> tree<00:05:08.009> that's

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
second I'll show you a tree that's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.640 
second I'll show you a tree that's
modified<00:05:08.849> and<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.150> can<00:05:09.330> see<00:05:09.599> what<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.620> does

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
modified and you can see what it does

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.120 
modified and you can see what it does
differently<00:05:11.400> now<00:05:12.180> we<00:05:12.240> got<00:05:12.479> this<00:05:12.659> fit<00:05:13.139> okay<00:05:13.979> let
