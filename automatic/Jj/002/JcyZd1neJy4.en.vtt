00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:09.930
 the campus festival presents the 99th 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:12.180
 38 young men in suspenders and one 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.200
 energetic frontwoman it sounds 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.700
 now a bit like one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.519
 bachelor party with the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.539
 But it is not chippendales at all 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:21.359
 you could actually say that is 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.800
 a band that really rock right 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.929
 you could probably say that or play 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.609
 direction rock'n'roll has potential 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.230
 and who is behind the 8000 carriers and 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.880
 the one energetic front woman 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.990
 hide that, they tell you now 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.990
 [Music] 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:43.090
 we are still very easy to get 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:44.879
 in fact, they make up three 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.000
 four years together a bit loose 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 and yes 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.980
 [Music] 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.440
 we actually do it in rhythm and 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.140
 blues not only rock but rather 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:19.900
 rocking like you used to and sooner or later and 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:21.130
 a lot of ballack we'll do that 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.500
 audience today with our show 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.890
 convince not only with music but 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.350
 also with the animation lux so dance 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:41.749
 I think it will be in any case 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:41.749
 [Music] 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.740
 it comes at least on the stage 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.720
 hello hello and you have a nice one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.040
 basket here we do that here now 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.330
 Third time man is really always 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.880
 curious what the bands and bring 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.280
 have to be there already sticker 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.890
 Inside of you are very different the boys 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.710
 always very diligent and distribute everywhere 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.990
 where you come from or on twitter too 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.660
 Clearly we have a memorial flyer 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.420
 for our record release party also for 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 brought you yes and this for you 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.900
 that could be here in mittweida though 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.910
 Partly year at the university too over 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.110
 a cool sticker we can 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.239
 actually distribute a few 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.920
 I would say if they are the same 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.780
 I play around and throw some 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.370
 sticker and this swam why 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.980
 is doing a bus sponge 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.140
 That's a little gag me 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.500
 personally considered because we have 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.840
 in our first music video a bus too 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.650
 you can see and recognize youtube 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.330
 all see 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.650
 This bus is also something special 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.269
 piece for us said this sponge 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.670
 seen and thought you must have him 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.900
 but he does not own such a thing 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.730
 he has to wash no he is totally good 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 just the bus of ours 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.620
 music video viva has also accompanied and 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.390
 we have this as a small gift 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.820
