00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello and welcome to my 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.680
 very first tutorial 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.469
 I noticed many do not know 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.280
 how to make a tender of the room 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:18.810
 German plays there so here at the 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:21.330
 her so I use only as dam on 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 conficker that on settings that one 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.900
 can not select German here the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.750
 problem-many had the problem 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.029
 myself a few months ago as well 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.859
 That's why I thought it was real 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.930
 many areas do not know how to do that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.110
 I'm doing a sore quick tutorials 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.940
 I just like that for a long time 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.620
 you can see i hope for example 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.309
 any room is best a sell 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.690
 because they are mostly English 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:49.760
 well and faster 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.220
 touchscreen so everything stands here 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.870
 English is of course stupid and so 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.880
 you have to play it now so you have to 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.040
 German finally the times 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.130
 quickly then you go to config then 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.540
 do you go to firmware settings and then 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.160
 you just go down there and down here 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.800
 can you adjust it german yes 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.800
 Ok then you can test again 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 and you can see that it touches here 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.920
 the screen is already on 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.170
 German simply I hope so 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.500
 could help a two people of you 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.479

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.259

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.509

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.040
