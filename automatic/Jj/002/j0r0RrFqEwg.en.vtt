00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.230
 Practicing gentle activities is advised during pregnancy if they do not present 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:19.180
 no risk. Soft Gymnastics, Walking, Swimming, Yoga, Stretching, some associations offer 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.060
 Special sessions pregnant women. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.490
 I come here because my gynecologist advised me to come, she told me it would be beneficial 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.939
 for different points during my pregnancy. At the level of everything that is technical 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.800
 relaxation, breathing, etc ... it is true that it is framed by professionals 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.600
 so it gives little tips that are important to prepare for childbirth 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.039
 and during pregnancy. 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.140
 Currently I am 7 months pregnant, and I started water aerobics at the very beginning 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.660
 3 months. The benefits of water aerobics is that you work your breath, in preparation 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:08.020
 at delivery, with expiration, we relax, relax, stretch, and then 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.480
 it's also a pleasure to come here, to see the other moms, to create links, we 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.080
 tell how many months we are, when do we give birth, if it's a girl 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.600
 or a boy, it continues to create a social bond. 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.120
 I'm 5 months pregnant and it's been 2 months since I went pre-natal swimming, 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.010
 I started really early, and because my back was hurting at the beginning of my pregnancy, 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.430
 I immediately felt a benefit, so it was very nice for me, and then 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.190
 it's true that I'm used to playing sports in clubs, but as we 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.650
 advance in her pregnancy, we are less and less inclined to be able to do courses, 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.420
 jump, etc., so the number of possible sports is limited, so there it concerns a 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.450
 small sport activity so it's not very dynamic, but it allows you to relax, 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.930
 so to erase the back pains, actually, and then to muscle the parts of the body that 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.460
 may be less accustomed to muscle, which is less aware, like the perineum 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.480
 for example, which is rather very important for pregnancy and childbirth and the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.150
 pre-delivery, so I'm happy to do these classes, I come twice 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.270
 week and for the moment I come as soon as I can because it is really very pleasant.
