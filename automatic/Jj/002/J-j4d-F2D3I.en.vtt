00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:07.180 
great function is footstep extraction
you<00:04:03.210> can<00:04:03.390> turn<00:04:03.630> it<00:04:03.690> on<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:05.280> priests

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
you can turn it on and the priests

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.980 
you can turn it on and the priests
increase<00:04:08.190> the<00:04:08.460> extraction<00:04:09.240> tolerance<00:04:09.720> to

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
increase the extraction tolerance to

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:20.830 
increase the extraction tolerance to
about<00:04:10.260> point<00:04:10.620> five<00:04:11.130> point<00:04:15.470> one<00:04:17.480> and<00:04:18.480> hit<00:04:18.930> okay

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
about point five point one and hit okay

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.930 
about point five point one and hit okay
you<00:04:21.840> can<00:04:21.989> see<00:04:22.520> it<00:04:23.520> says<00:04:23.970> this<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.780> some<00:04:24.990> error

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
you can see it says this and some error

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.720 
you can see it says this and some error
so<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.000> can<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.880> let's<00:04:30.090> repeat<00:04:31.070> but<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.490> time

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
so you can so let's repeat but this time

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.540 
so you can so let's repeat but this time
increase<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.510> tolerance<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:34.290> about<00:04:35.240> 15<00:04:37.550> turn

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
increase the tolerance to about 15 turn

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:44.360 
increase the tolerance to about 15 turn
on<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.290> skype<00:04:40.290> expression<00:04:41.070> again<00:04:42.560> okay<00:04:43.560> so

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
on the skype expression again okay so

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.870 
on the skype expression again okay so
this<00:04:44.520> time<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:46.380> full<00:04:46.650> step<00:04:46.980> extraction<00:04:47.670> is

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
this time the full step extraction is

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.780 
this time the full step extraction is
working<00:04:48.660> but<00:04:49.080> it<00:04:49.230> all<00:04:49.350> good

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.040 

so<00:04:53.360> now<00:04:53.510> we<00:04:53.570> have<00:04:53.720> an<00:04:54.020> hour<00:04:54.670> by<00:04:55.670> that<00:04:56.050> work

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
so now we have an hour by that work

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.380 
so now we have an hour by that work
running<00:04:57.800> and<00:04:58.010> now<00:04:59.290> and<00:05:00.290> I'll<00:05:00.590> have<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.390> footstep

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
running and now and I'll have a footstep

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:09.880 
running and now and I'll have a footstep
to<00:05:02.630> pour<00:05:02.930> em<00:05:02.990> with<00:05:05.170> there's<00:05:06.170> a<00:05:08.230> so<00:05:09.230> now<00:05:09.650> we<00:05:09.710> are

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
to pour em with there's a so now we are

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:12.370 
to pour em with there's a so now we are
welcome<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.610> modify<00:05:11.060> this<00:05:11.120> foot<00:05:11.600> stepping<00:05:11.900> to

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
welcome to modify this foot stepping to

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.850 
welcome to modify this foot stepping to
nollie<00:05:12.620> footstep<00:05:13.610> mode<00:05:13.930> and<00:05:14.930> as<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.680> can<00:05:15.830> see

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
nollie footstep mode and as you can see

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
nollie footstep mode and as you can see
it<00:05:16.040> is<00:05:16.160> a<00:05:16.190> problem<00:05:17.650> so<00:05:18.820> again<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:20.210> either<00:05:21.880> move

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
it is a problem so again I either move

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:36.320 
it is a problem so again I either move
it<00:05:23.060> down<00:05:26.290> just<00:05:27.290> delete<00:05:27.740> it

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.469 

so<00:05:36.900> now<00:05:37.050> I<00:05:37.080> briefs<00:05:37.379> the<00:05:37.650> lad<00:05:37.949> those<00:05:38.639> three<00:05:39.120> foot

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:39.479 
so now I briefs the lad those three foot

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:42.939 
so now I briefs the lad those three foot
step<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:40.110> use<00:05:40.710> this<00:05:40.919> band<00:05:41.550> function<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.389> been

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:42.949 
step and use this band function to been

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.250 
step and use this band function to been
an<00:05:43.949> hour

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.460 

see<00:05:48.980> top<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.750> then<00:05:50.750> our<00:05:51.080> for<00:05:51.530> step<00:05:51.800> two<00:05:52.180> solid

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
see top you then our for step two solid

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:03.719 
see top you then our for step two solid
turn<00:05:54.470> right<00:05:57.910> ok

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:10.189 

now<00:06:04.330> we<00:06:04.389> can't<00:06:04.749> know<00:06:06.360> so<00:06:07.360> now<00:06:07.539> we<00:06:08.439> turn<00:06:08.740> our

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
now we can't know so now we turn our

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:39.679 
now we can't know so now we turn our
running

00:06:39.679 --> 00:06:39.689 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:47.649 

as<00:06:40.619> you<00:06:40.799> can<00:06:40.949> see<00:06:41.099> so<00:06:41.279> only<00:06:42.349> sound<00:06:43.349> a<00:06:43.529> footstep

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:51.949 

look<00:06:48.659> down<00:06:49.110> looking<00:06:49.709> very<00:06:50.099> good<00:06:50.369> so<00:06:51.149> you<00:06:51.809> have

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:51.959 
look down looking very good so you have

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:54.109 
look down looking very good so you have
to<00:06:52.110> pull<00:06:52.319> it<00:06:52.409> around<00:06:52.559> with<00:06:52.979> this<00:06:53.219> band

00:06:54.109 --> 00:06:54.119 
to pull it around with this band

00:06:54.119 --> 00:07:01.759 
to pull it around with this band
function<00:06:55.099> may<00:06:56.099> be<00:06:58.519> like<00:06:59.519> so<00:06:59.839> so<00:07:00.839> this<00:07:01.019> tutorial

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:01.769 
function may be like so so this tutorial

00:07:01.769 --> 00:07:07.269 
function may be like so so this tutorial
show<00:07:02.759> you<00:07:02.839> how<00:07:03.839> to<00:07:03.899> convert<00:07:04.589> one<00:07:04.860> single

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:07.279 
show you how to convert one single

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:12.769 
show you how to convert one single
Ronnie's<00:07:08.279> I<00:07:08.459> go<00:07:08.519> to<00:07:09.229> run<00:07:10.229> into<00:07:10.679> turn<00:07:11.779> motion

00:07:12.769 --> 00:07:12.779 
Ronnie's I go to run into turn motion

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:14.329 
Ronnie's I go to run into turn motion
fun<00:07:13.050> thank<00:07:13.469> you<00:07:13.589> for<00:07:13.769> watching<00:07:14.069> this<00:07:14.129> video
