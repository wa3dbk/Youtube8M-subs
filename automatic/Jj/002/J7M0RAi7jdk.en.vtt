00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.810

 Then I will boil spaghetti 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.260
 Let's go into boiling water first 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.460

 I will raise it early in the dark, because I can see it 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:22.570
 Adjust the fire so that it doesn't run out and leave it in a small pot while boiling constantly 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:25.020
