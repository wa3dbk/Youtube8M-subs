minutes<00:02:01.520> let's<00:02:02.120> throw<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.660> some<00:02:02.900> whip<00:02:03.080> protein

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
minutes let's throw in some whip protein

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.320 
minutes let's throw in some whip protein
let's<00:02:04.130> throw<00:02:04.340> in<00:02:04.460> some<00:02:04.610> cards<00:02:04.880> in<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.060> form<00:02:05.270> of

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
let's throw in some cards in the form of

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.420 
let's throw in some cards in the form of
banana<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:06.290> really<00:02:06.560> fuel<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:07.010> recovery

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
banana to really fuel that recovery
