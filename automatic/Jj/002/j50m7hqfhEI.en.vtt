brush<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> just<00:01:30.630> always<00:01:30.750> found<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> bit

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
brush I just always found it be a bit

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.490 
brush I just always found it be a bit
nicer<00:01:32.280> doing<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.049> then<00:01:34.049> depending<00:01:34.350> on

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
nicer doing them and then depending on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
nicer doing them and then depending on
what<00:01:34.619> I'm<00:01:34.740> doing<00:01:34.770> on<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.549> higher

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
what I'm doing on this on higher

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.469 
what I'm doing on this on higher
resolution<00:01:36.900> stages<00:01:37.320> own<00:01:37.500> change<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.040> Alpha

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
resolution stages own change the Alpha

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.210 
resolution stages own change the Alpha
in<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.600> case<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.110> alpha<00:01:40.770> six<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.100> usual<00:01:41.720> so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
in this case it's alpha six as usual so

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.380 
in this case it's alpha six as usual so
yeah<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.280> know<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:44.640> what's<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.210> my

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
even there and they also enhance the the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.980 
even there and they also enhance the the
idea<00:02:02.759> I<00:02:03.000> have<00:02:03.270> befallen<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.380> skin<00:02:04.619> and

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
idea I have befallen of the the skin and

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
idea I have befallen of the the skin and
so<00:02:06.990> I'm<00:02:07.140> wrapping<00:02:07.469> around<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.829> school<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so I'm wrapping around this school and

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040 
so I'm wrapping around this school and
business<00:02:08.910> school<00:02:09.360> hanging<00:02:09.629> out<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.959> stuff

business school hanging out and stuff

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.320 
business school hanging out and stuff
like<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.349> so

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
like that so

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.630 
like that so
over<00:02:12.510> there<00:02:12.720> refining<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.010> eye<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.190> got<00:02:14.550> like

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
over there refining the eye is got like

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.170 
over there refining the eye is got like
a<00:02:14.730> closed<00:02:15.060> solve<00:02:15.600> really<00:02:16.410> angled<00:02:16.920> eye<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
a closed solve really angled eye on the

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.700 
a closed solve really angled eye on the
concert<00:02:18.510> sing<00:02:18.660> so<00:02:18.870> I'm<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.110> adding<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.500> there

concert sing so I'm just adding in there
it's<00:02:20.190> added<00:02:20.520> stitching<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.030> their<00:02:21.570> own<00:02:21.780> book

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
it's added stitching in their own book

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.620 
it's added stitching in their own book
you<00:02:22.920> should<00:02:23.640> make<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.940> feel<00:02:24.090> amorous<00:02:24.420> on

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
you should make it a feel amorous on

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.610 
you should make it a feel amorous on
tighter<00:02:25.290> around<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.390> so<00:02:27.390> bone<00:02:27.960> areas<00:02:28.470> where

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
tighter around the so bone areas where

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.750 
tighter around the so bone areas where
you<00:02:28.650> can<00:02:28.710> see<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.100> gone<00:02:31.340> again<00:02:32.340> across<00:02:32.580> his

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
you can see it's gone again across his

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
you can see it's gone again across his
teeth<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.180> well<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.570> want<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.080> try<00:02:34.260> get<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> lot<00:02:34.650> of

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
teeth as well I want to try get a lot of

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.110 
teeth as well I want to try get a lot of
to<00:02:34.800> keep<00:02:34.890> showing<00:02:35.160> through<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.700> people<00:02:35.880> could

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
to keep showing through so people could

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.170 
to keep showing through so people could
relate<00:02:36.240> to<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.690> is<00:02:37.070> on<00:02:38.870> let's<00:02:39.870> finish<00:02:40.050> it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
relate to what it is on let's finish it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.630 
relate to what it is on let's finish it
just<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.420> ahead<00:02:42.570> I<00:02:43.070> think<00:02:44.070> there's<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> point<00:02:44.430> as

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
just go ahead I think there's a point as

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.970 
just go ahead I think there's a point as
well<00:02:44.760> why<00:02:45.230> playing<00:02:46.230> on<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.500> size<00:02:46.740> of<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
well why playing on this size of the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.250 
well why playing on this size of the
school<00:02:47.250> zone<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.330> I<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.660> left<00:02:49.020> it<00:02:49.140> for

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
school zone I think I just left it for

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.930 
school zone I think I just left it for
now<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.590> coat<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.280> know<00:02:50.400> do<00:02:50.610> anything

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
now just coat on you know do anything

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.680 
now just coat on you know do anything
else<00:02:51.170> can<00:02:52.170> I<00:02:52.200> get<00:02:52.380> like<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.560> nice<00:02:52.830> of<00:02:53.690> overall

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
else can I get like a nice of overall

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.570 
else can I get like a nice of overall
kind<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.640> there<00:02:56.640> you<00:02:56.850> go<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.800> making<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> I

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
kind of there you go just making the I

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.530 
kind of there you go just making the I
thought<00:02:59.730> would<00:02:59.790> be<00:02:59.850> cool<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.209> have<00:03:00.300> more<00:03:00.510> of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
thought would be cool to have more of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.790 
thought would be cool to have more of
the<00:03:00.690> school<00:03:00.930> there's<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> bullet<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.440> top<00:03:01.709> of

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
the school there's a bullet on top of

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.570 
the school there's a bullet on top of
the<00:03:01.860> head<00:03:01.980> just<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.310> make<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.459> more

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
the head just to make it more

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.190 
the head just to make it more
interesting<00:03:02.790> instead<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.570> having<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> survive

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
interesting instead of having to survive

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
interesting instead of having to survive
sort<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.620> balls<00:03:04.860> keen<00:03:05.310> on<00:03:05.400> his<00:03:05.490> head<00:03:05.670> but<00:03:06.420> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
sort of balls keen on his head but the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.910 
sort of balls keen on his head but the
concept<00:03:06.900> art<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.140> just<00:03:07.290> have<00:03:07.410> hair<00:03:07.680> as<00:03:07.890> well

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
concept art you just have hair as well

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.140 
concept art you just have hair as well
so<00:03:08.280> I'm<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.459> be<00:03:08.550> doing<00:03:08.670> some<00:03:08.820> hair<00:03:09.530> later<00:03:10.530> on

so I'm gonna be doing some hair later on
during<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.270> texturing<00:03:12.690> phase<00:03:12.990> so<00:03:13.650> yeah

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
during the texturing phase so yeah

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.320 
during the texturing phase so yeah
actually<00:03:14.040> it<00:03:14.310> looks<00:03:14.490> more<00:03:14.670> sort<00:03:14.970> of<00:03:15.000> gruesome

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
actually it looks more sort of gruesome

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.250 
actually it looks more sort of gruesome
do<00:03:16.140> that<00:03:16.290> detail<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.769> top<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.130> also<00:03:18.080> did<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.110> bit

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
do that detail on top is also did a bit

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.199 
do that detail on top is also did a bit
up<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:20.510> then<00:03:21.510> I<00:03:21.600> just<00:03:21.660> do<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.670> yeah<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.000> Sun

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
up and then I just do the yeah the Sun

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.410 
up and then I just do the yeah the Sun
need<00:03:24.780> more<00:03:25.019> human<00:03:25.440> I'm<00:03:25.790> just<00:03:26.790> trying<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.120> find

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
need more human I'm just trying to find

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.640 
need more human I'm just trying to find
out<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.690> little<00:03:27.810> bit<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.290> think<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.560> probably

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
out a little bit but I think I probably

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.430 
out a little bit but I think I probably
need<00:03:28.890> to<00:03:28.920> go<00:03:29.130> over<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.459> bit<00:03:29.670> more<00:03:30.120> mini<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.170> I

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
need to go over a bit more mini and I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.080 
need to go over a bit more mini and I
just<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.800> don't<00:03:32.100> think<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.519> was<00:03:32.700> quite

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
just I don't think it was quite

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.440 
just I don't think it was quite
convincing<00:03:33.680> at<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.769> end<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.070> video<00:03:35.450> but

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
convincing at the end of this video but

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.960 
convincing at the end of this video but
I<00:03:36.480> also<00:03:36.930> had<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.230> split<00:03:37.440> our<00:03:37.650> hands<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.400> all

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
I also had to split our hands so all

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.810 
I also had to split our hands so all
should<00:03:39.239> i<00:03:39.330> do<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.630> in<00:03:39.690> that<00:03:39.840> part<00:03:40.200> i<00:03:40.640> think<00:03:41.640> most

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
should i do it in that part i think most

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.520 
should i do it in that part i think most
of<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.000> muscle<00:03:42.269> groups<00:03:42.450> in<00:03:42.630> there<00:03:42.930> but<00:03:43.260> I<00:03:43.290> just

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
of the muscle groups in there but I just

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.600 
of the muscle groups in there but I just
smooth<00:03:44.010> em<00:03:44.070> look<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.310> bit<00:03:44.459> dodgy<00:03:46.519> in<00:03:47.519> the

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
smooth em look a bit dodgy in the

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.490 
smooth em look a bit dodgy in the
forearms<00:03:48.120> looking<00:03:48.420> pretty<00:03:48.930> decent<00:03:49.320> in

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
forearms looking pretty decent in

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.040 
forearms looking pretty decent in
certain<00:03:50.040> areas<00:03:50.160> but<00:03:50.580> this<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.420> certain<00:03:51.750> parts

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
certain areas but this is certain parts

song

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
song

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.680 
song
I<00:04:25.800> got<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:26.950> soft<00:04:27.250> stuck<00:04:27.490> on<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.700> spin<00:04:27.970> so

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
I got really soft stuck on the spin so

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.120 
I got really soft stuck on the spin so
I'm<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> get<00:04:29.200> some<00:04:29.350> reference<00:04:29.770> on<00:04:29.920> there

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
I'm have to get some reference on there

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.720 
I'm have to get some reference on there
so<00:04:30.370> as<00:04:30.610> I<00:04:30.910> couldn't<00:04:31.570> figure<00:04:31.780> it<00:04:31.900> out<00:04:32.020> on<00:04:32.350> I

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
so as I couldn't figure it out on I

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.450 
so as I couldn't figure it out on I
think<00:04:33.730> what<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.000> ended<00:04:34.270> up<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.420> looks<00:04:34.780> ok<00:04:35.230> but

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
think what I ended up with looks ok but

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.910 
think what I ended up with looks ok but
I<00:04:36.460> think<00:04:37.090> when<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.240> actually<00:04:37.410> borrow<00:04:38.410> his<00:04:38.680> arm

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
I think when I actually borrow his arm

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.560 
I think when I actually borrow his arm
down<00:04:39.130> the<00:04:39.610> line<00:04:39.880> might<00:04:40.150> look<00:04:40.240> a<00:04:40.300> bit<00:04:40.360> dodgy

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
down the line might look a bit dodgy

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.890 
down the line might look a bit dodgy
zones<00:04:41.080> know<00:04:41.320> play<00:04:41.770> around<00:04:41.800> with<00:04:42.160> that<00:04:42.660> and<00:04:43.660> add

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
zones know play around with that and add

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.620 
zones know play around with that and add
an<00:04:44.080> in<00:04:44.200> he's<00:04:44.740> got<00:04:44.920> like<00:04:45.040> a<00:04:45.120> some<00:04:46.120> sort<00:04:46.270> of<00:04:46.360> small
