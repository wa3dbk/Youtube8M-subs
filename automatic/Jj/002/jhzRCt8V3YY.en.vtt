00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.560
 and other YouTube and swim through 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.460
 new to start the video of the mode of 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.970
 meteorites I think so 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.400
 you do not subscribe to my channel but dead 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.960
 is with you this is not the only one I wanted 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 tell them 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.820
 and good this mod 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:29.279
 cool cool a lot cool a lot 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.710
 because they see adds meteorites already almost 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.470
 creative 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.340
 see 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.820
 and add an armor that is made with 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.820
 these meteorites 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.070
 the helmet look at it 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:53.560
 cool a lot and more is magnetic the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.020
 creative personal prize we prefer 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.920
 we explained that I did not prepare anything 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.679
 improvising 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.629
 and these eyes can be made so that 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:05.350
 meteorites fall but they too 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.350
 they fall alone 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.310
 in the weight 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.040
 Add 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.040
 it can not be cut there and magnetic 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.320
 it is magnetic 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.120
 it was magnetic to the other one 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.340
 can do two with different good 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.870
 indicated the media publications 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.870
 I'll throw one comes well 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:52.310
 and in that it brings some spatial data of 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.200
 I come back and I remember that you can take and 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.200
 good blood for the credits 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:01.510
 if they hear background noise now 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.360
 you see that he opens a good key they are 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.790
 showering good 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.679
 I remind you of these meteorites too 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.810
 they can fall alone until they can even 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.810
 fall on top of your house for that 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.670
 to avoid them I think they have to 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.280
 create 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.310
 a certain structure 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.310
 I do not know will be the one so that they do not fall 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.470
 I dont know 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.470
 but the other 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.880
 hey 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:53.500
 until a chest arrives 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.770
 such a similar diet 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.570
 and is that they record material other than 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.910
 this there are different meteorites 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.220
 different crimes of halo 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.640
 that can fall at any time of the day 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.170
 they can even fall 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.170
 only reality 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.980
 and take it away 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.360
 but it is that a bird had fallen this 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.630
 with this I'm not sure very well what is 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.780
 what is done but 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.420
 cool a lot this is the other meteor 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.340
 that you can fall this I do not know I think that 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.060
 it's because of it and the lion does 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.060
 and one 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.819
 I do not have insurance what is it that can be 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.870
 do with that 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.989
 I do not know and it's this material is the red 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:56.200
 these games can also be built 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.200
 you can not download the kraft or 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.890
