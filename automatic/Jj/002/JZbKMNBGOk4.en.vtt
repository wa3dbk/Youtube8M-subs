00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.250 
like I love that show I've seen all the
different<00:00:17.000> episodes<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.240> Dragon<00:00:18.750> Ball<00:00:19.230> Dragon

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
different episodes of Dragon Ball Dragon

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.849 
different episodes of Dragon Ball Dragon
Ball<00:00:19.920> Z<00:00:20.130> Dragon<00:00:20.609> Ball<00:00:20.730> GT<00:00:20.939> all<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.260> so

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
Ball Z Dragon Ball GT all of them so

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.929 
Ball Z Dragon Ball GT all of them so
anyway<00:00:23.570> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.840> what<00:00:25.830> I've<00:00:25.949> got<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.340> Goku<00:00:26.699> so

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
anyway this is what I've got for Goku so

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.290 
anyway this is what I've got for Goku so
far<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.449> think<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.410> can<00:00:28.619> do<00:00:28.800> better<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:29.730> you'll

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
far I think I can do better so you'll

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.690 
far I think I can do better so you'll
probably<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.900> this<00:00:31.320> change<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.099> time<00:00:32.369> I'm

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
probably see this change in time I'm

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.420 
probably see this change in time I'm
also<00:00:33.980> working<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.280> getting<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:36.000> hair<00:00:36.960> piece

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
also working on getting a hair piece

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.319 
also working on getting a hair piece
that<00:00:38.430> looks<00:00:38.670> good

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that looks good

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.619 
that looks good
painted<00:00:40.110> yellow<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.460> can<00:00:41.760> create<00:00:42.270> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
painted yellow so that I can create a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.130 
painted yellow so that I can create a
Super<00:00:43.410> Saiyan<00:00:43.440> version<00:00:44.510> but<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> what

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Super Saiyan version but this is what

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
Super Saiyan version but this is what
I've<00:00:46.230> got<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.440> far<00:00:46.730> so<00:00:47.730> tell<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.090> what<00:00:48.239> you<00:00:48.329> guys

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
I've got so far so tell me what you guys

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.610 
I've got so far so tell me what you guys
think<00:00:48.590> and<00:00:49.640> I<00:00:50.640> know<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.059> eyes<00:00:51.360> are<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.289> filled

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
think and I know the eyes are not filled

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.670 
think and I know the eyes are not filled
in<00:00:52.910> but<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.840> tried<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.410> with<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
in but I actually I tried it with the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.680 
in but I actually I tried it with the
eyes<00:00:55.800> filled<00:00:56.219> in<00:00:56.370> white<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.539> actually

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
eyes filled in white and I actually

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
eyes filled in white and I actually
think<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.500> turned<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.920> looking

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
think that this turned out looking

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.500 
think that this turned out looking
better<00:00:59.430> so<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.539> why<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.719> kept<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:02.510> there's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
better so that's why I kept this there's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.250 
better so that's why I kept this there's
the<00:01:03.750> front<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.610> even<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.820> added<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> little<00:01:06.840> symbol

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
the front I even I added a little symbol

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.070 
the front I even I added a little symbol
there<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:10.100> then<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.360> made<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.390> symbol<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
there and then I made the symbol on the

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
there and then I made the symbol on the
back<00:01:13.260> also<00:01:13.560> I<00:01:16.640> think<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.729> turned<00:01:17.970> out<00:01:18.060> pretty

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
back also I think it turned out pretty

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
back also I think it turned out pretty
good<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:20.009> like<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.250> said<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.030> do<00:01:21.150> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
good but like I said I think I can do a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.990 
good but like I said I think I can do a
little<00:01:21.450> bit<00:01:21.600> better<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:22.159> think<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.520> colors

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
little bit better I think the colors

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.260 
little bit better I think the colors
just<00:01:24.090> slightly<00:01:24.780> different<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.700> torso

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
just slightly different on the the torso

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.219 
just slightly different on the the torso
pieces<00:01:27.860> then<00:01:28.860> what<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.549> actual<00:01:29.850> torso<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> so

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
pieces then what the actual torso is so

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.880 
pieces then what the actual torso is so
I'm<00:01:31.350> probably<00:01:31.530> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.920> try<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.280> redo<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
I'm probably going to try and redo that

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.990 
I'm probably going to try and redo that
but<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.130> happy<00:01:35.670> with<00:01:35.700> it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
but I'm happy with it

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.440 
but I'm happy with it
so<00:01:36.360> far<00:01:37.009> but<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> will<00:01:38.310> definitely<00:01:38.820> be<00:01:38.970> doing<00:01:39.329> an
