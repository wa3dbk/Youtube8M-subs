 tell me honestly now just some kind of boom 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:26.609
 in blue but it is of course very 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:31.289
 ok now we would have 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.370
 gradient here on the one hand we put 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.530
 17 anyway respectively 2 which number 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.060
 blue 129 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.280
 yellow 182 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.280
 that's just a thin layer of light 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.489
 Chinese painting brush 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 feathering 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.040
 brush blows off 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 tassel in buckwheat our landmarks 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.260
 Aule is easy 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.650
 click the same all then grow like 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.650
 times 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:14.240
 dry brush will give distribution no no 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.830
 surely can you can use 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:25.280
 acetone free liquid 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:29.230
 first make yolks with pink let's 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.230
 from this side is alive and that we already 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:49.470
 46 which we used necessarily 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.119
 a thin layer so that it is on the sides on 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.960
 someone you while you 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.500
 shade to drip out of pink 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.500
 with red 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.210
 same thing 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.950
 182 what is the previous use 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.930
 anti dark on color on this more than that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.640
 we shade the color the third color between 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:35.790
 costing more like iron on pulling on 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:39.120
 light or connected and so and so again 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.190
 on the second layer with the same everywhere 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.550
 you need some saturation you need 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.550
 the color was so famous 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 only thin 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.520
 we again washed the brush 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.970
 that we have a previous designer not 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.970
 sit 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:14.620
 it doesn't work here anymore 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.989
 a color emerges on that blue 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.940
 You see it here in the middle between the yellow 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.290
 between the blue one among them he will 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.650
 remove only bromide and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:27.540
 and the period of yellow a little on the spot not 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.540
 always it turns out like a Chinese painting 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.250
 can we take tour accounting 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.310
 already do two suns 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:55.329
 that on this nails turned out that we 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.329
 more warm than ass 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.430
 electoral commission and hear 2 minutes

 the third slot went below 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.630
 page 1 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.880
 dream 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.750
 and 4 mouse 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.440
 even 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.240
 q 44 cm 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.240
 because of course what 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.430
 Yes, if you can subtly calmly and more 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.680
 hear my blot brush 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:03.110
 we are definitely not just a printer and immediately 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.110
 draw and blot sofia brush 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.230
 more victims 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.910

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.690
 why the owners 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.690
 ended not get 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.450
 will be restrained booth lamp on 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.450
 temporarily 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:38.350
 overlap principle then he sort of 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.130
 slightly smooth our transition not 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.130
 completely 

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.319
 but
