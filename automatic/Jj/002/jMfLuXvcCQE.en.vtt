probably been my most used

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.780 
probably been my most used
over<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.430> last<00:02:28.549> three<00:02:29.540> or<00:02:29.569> four<00:02:29.689> days<00:02:30.730> as<00:02:31.730> I

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
over the last three or four days as I

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.259 
over the last three or four days as I
pick<00:02:32.450> up<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.629> pave<00:02:32.810> low<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.819> call<00:02:34.819> that<00:02:35.030> bad

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
pick up the pave low and call that bad

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.830 
pick up the pave low and call that bad
boy<00:02:35.510> in<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.230> I<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.409> a<00:02:36.439> harrier<00:02:36.829> pavelow<00:02:37.840> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
boy in so I have a harrier pavelow the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.380 
boy in so I have a harrier pavelow the
reason<00:02:39.079> I<00:02:39.230> do<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.439> is<00:02:39.620> because<00:02:40.010> while<00:02:40.790> people

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
reason I do that is because while people

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.600 
reason I do that is because while people
are<00:02:41.450> shooting<00:02:41.659> down<00:02:41.989> one<00:02:42.349> of<00:02:42.500> them<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:43.579> other

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
are shooting down one of them the other

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.110 
are shooting down one of them the other
one<00:02:43.909> can<00:02:44.090> pick<00:02:44.239> them<00:02:44.360> off<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.430> i<00:02:46.720> find<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.900> just

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
one can pick them off and i find it just

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.039 
one can pick them off and i find it just
easier<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.150> get<00:02:50.329> kills<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.720> way<00:02:50.870> i<00:02:50.900> suppose

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
easier to get kills that way i suppose

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.170 
easier to get kills that way i suppose
but<00:02:52.959> unfortunately<00:02:53.959> for<00:02:54.140> me<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.970> enemy<00:02:55.970> team

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
but unfortunately for me the enemy team

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.199 
but unfortunately for me the enemy team
decided<00:02:56.599> to<00:02:56.720> shoot<00:02:56.870> down<00:02:56.989> my<00:02:57.170> pelo<00:02:57.500> first<00:02:57.829> and

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
decided to shoot down my pelo first and

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.640 
decided to shoot down my pelo first and
