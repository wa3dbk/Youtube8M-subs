live in the pond outside with these guys

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:17.809 
live in the pond outside with these guys
but<00:03:16.260> again<00:03:16.590> pretty<00:03:17.250> soon<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.579> going<00:03:17.669> to<00:03:17.760> get

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
but again pretty soon it's going to get

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.580 
but again pretty soon it's going to get
too<00:03:17.970> cold<00:03:18.209> out<00:03:18.359> here<00:03:18.599> now<00:03:18.900> these<00:03:19.349> kind<00:03:19.560> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
too cold out here now these kind of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.589 
too cold out here now these kind of
turtles<00:03:19.859> can<00:03:20.069> live<00:03:20.280> year-round<00:03:20.430> but<00:03:21.209> our<00:03:21.359> pond

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
turtles can live year-round but our pond

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.119 
turtles can live year-round but our pond
is<00:03:21.720> not<00:03:21.840> deep<00:03:22.019> enough<00:03:22.109> to<00:03:22.349> do<00:03:22.470> that<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:23.010> these

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
is not deep enough to do that so these

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.129 
is not deep enough to do that so these
turtles<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.699> go<00:03:23.790> inside<00:03:23.970> at<00:03:24.599> some<00:03:24.930> point

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
turtles have to go inside at some point

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.300 
turtles have to go inside at some point
in<00:03:25.199> time<00:03:25.229> and<00:03:25.650> again<00:03:25.799> we're<00:03:25.979> going<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.159> need<00:03:26.220> to

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
in time and again we're going to need to

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.449 
in time and again we're going to need to
play<00:03:26.459> water<00:03:26.699> area<00:03:27.109> now<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.500> reason<00:03:28.769> we<00:03:29.220> keep

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
