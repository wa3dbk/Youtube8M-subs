hazard<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.460> also<00:01:53.729> very<00:01:53.820> good<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.299> he<00:01:54.420> was

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
hazard was also very good but he was

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.300 
hazard was also very good but he was
just<00:01:54.750> involved<00:01:54.990> everywhere<00:01:55.530> he<00:01:55.560> had<00:01:55.979> many

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
just involved everywhere he had many

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
just involved everywhere he had many
opportunities<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:56.969> score<00:01:57.090> more<00:01:57.390> than<00:01:57.450> once<00:01:57.750> he

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
opportunities to score more than once he

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.719 
opportunities to score more than once he
should<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.860> scored<00:01:59.040> more<00:01:59.159> than<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.490> goal

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
should have scored more than one goal

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.090 
should have scored more than one goal
but<00:02:00.000> hey<00:02:00.659> at<00:02:00.899> least<00:02:00.960> he<00:02:01.290> scored<00:02:01.590> one<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.979> he

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
but hey at least he scored one that he

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.249 
but hey at least he scored one that he
was<00:02:02.130> involved<00:02:02.520> so<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.420> square<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:03.869> knotted

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
was involved so the square was knotted

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.540 
was involved so the square was knotted
up<00:02:04.500> 11<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:06.350> Ramirez<00:02:07.350> later<00:02:07.799> on<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> half<00:02:08.399> I

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
up 11 and Ramirez later on and a half I

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.010 
up 11 and Ramirez later on and a half I
think<00:02:08.729> midway<00:02:09.090> through<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.300> second<00:02:09.660> half<00:02:09.810> was

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
think midway through the second half was

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
think midway through the second half was
sent<00:02:10.289> off<00:02:10.440> he<00:02:10.649> had<00:02:10.739> two<00:02:10.920> yellow<00:02:11.129> cards<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
sent off he had two yellow cards I

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580 
sent off he had two yellow cards I
missed<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.599> first<00:02:12.840> yellow<00:02:13.050> card

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
missed the first yellow card

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.960 
missed the first yellow card
be<00:02:13.680> honest<00:02:13.920> if<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.040> got<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.430> second<00:02:14.849> was

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
be honest if you got the second was

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.729 
be honest if you got the second was
definitely<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.569> yellow<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.379> should<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.650> been

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
definitely a yellow it should have been

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.619 
definitely a yellow it should have been
probably<00:02:17.099> all<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.430> against<00:02:17.700> go<00:02:17.910> to<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.180> hard

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
probably all right against go to a hard

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.160 
probably all right against go to a hard
tackle<00:02:19.280> right<00:02:20.280> into<00:02:20.550> his<00:02:20.670> leg<00:02:20.910> studied<00:02:21.780> him<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
tackle right into his leg studied him I

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.690 
tackle right into his leg studied him I
believe<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.190> it<00:02:23.310> was<00:02:23.400> but<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.610> was

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
believe that's what it was but it was

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
believe that's what it was but it was
really<00:02:23.940> hard<00:02:24.150> hit<00:02:24.330> into<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.720> leg<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.410> he

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
really hard hit into the leg you know he

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.790 
really hard hit into the leg you know he
just<00:02:26.129> stepped<00:02:26.400> on<00:02:26.610> and<00:02:27.200> he<00:02:28.200> got<00:02:28.379> sent<00:02:28.650> off

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
just stepped on and he got sent off

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.039 
just stepped on and he got sent off
marina<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.489> obviously<00:02:29.849> upset<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.840> it<00:02:30.959> was

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
marina was obviously upset but it was

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.900 
marina was obviously upset but it was
definitely<00:02:31.260> sending<00:02:32.069> off<00:02:32.280> with<00:02:32.459> two<00:02:32.580> yellows

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
definitely sending off with two yellows

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.250 
definitely sending off with two yellows
it<00:02:33.239> could<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.540> been<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.660> straight<00:02:33.959> red<00:02:34.110> as

it could have been a straight red as

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.330 
it could have been a straight red as
well<00:02:34.440> pretty<00:02:35.069> nasty<00:02:35.610> tackle<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.480> um

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.820 
foreign penalties and there the way for
Super<00:04:47.430> Cup<00:04:47.580> champions<00:04:47.940> of<00:04:48.030> Europe<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:48.830> another

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
Super Cup champions of Europe so another

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.790 
Super Cup champions of Europe so another
trophy<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.370> add<00:04:50.520> for<00:04:50.820> them<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.750> think<00:04:52.500> it's<00:04:52.650> the

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
trophy to add for them I think it's the

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.439 
trophy to add for them I think it's the
first<00:04:53.040> for<00:04:53.250> Guardiola<00:04:53.669> time<00:04:53.910> not<00:04:54.030> mistaken

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
first for Guardiola time not mistaken

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.900 
first for Guardiola time not mistaken
because<00:04:54.570> they<00:04:54.810> lost<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.169> Dortmund<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.910> few

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
because they lost the Dortmund a few

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.960 
because they lost the Dortmund a few
weeks<00:04:57.120> ago<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:58.020> hey<00:04:58.979> he<00:04:59.190> got<00:04:59.370> his<00:04:59.490> first<00:04:59.669> as<00:04:59.940> the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
weeks ago so hey he got his first as the

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.029 
weeks ago so hey he got his first as the
Bayern<00:05:00.389> manager<00:05:01.350> they<00:05:01.560> pulled<00:05:01.800> off<00:05:01.889> the

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
Bayern manager they pulled off the

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.219 
Bayern manager they pulled off the

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
victory it's all credit to them you can

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.240

tell<00:05:04.410> they're<00:05:04.500> going<00:05:04.680> to<00:05:04.740> score<00:05:04.919> goal<00:05:05.130> with

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
tell they're going to score goal with

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.820 
tell they're going to score goal with
all<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.490> pressure<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:07.260> just<00:05:07.440> happened

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
all that pressure and it just happened

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.770 
all that pressure and it just happened
that<00:05:08.010> way<00:05:08.160> so<00:05:08.370> Byron<00:05:08.850> are<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.270> champions

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780
