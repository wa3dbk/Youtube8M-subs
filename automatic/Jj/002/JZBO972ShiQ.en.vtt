00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
of water and that's another thing make

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.450 
of water and that's another thing make
sure<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.809> do<00:00:57.989> water<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.379> sometimes<00:00:59.219> in

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
sure that you do water them sometimes in

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.279 
sure that you do water them sometimes in
the<00:00:59.550> summer<00:00:59.789> because<00:01:00.390> I've<00:01:00.660> had<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> lot<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
the summer because I've had a lot of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170 
the summer because I've had a lot of
them<00:01:01.500> survive<00:01:01.949> without<00:01:02.309> any<00:01:02.520> water<00:01:02.760> at<00:01:03.000> all

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
them survive without any water at all

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.210 
them survive without any water at all
but<00:01:03.899> when<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> water<00:01:04.379> them<00:01:04.650> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.949> summer

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
but when you water them in the summer

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.039 
but when you water them in the summer
especially<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:06.030> planted<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.510> new<00:01:06.720> plant

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
especially if you planted a new plant

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.859 
especially if you planted a new plant
it'll<00:01:08.010> survive<00:01:08.400> much<00:01:08.760> better<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.600> will<00:01:09.689> be

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it'll survive much better and it will be

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.230 
it'll survive much better and it will be
much<00:01:10.080> more<00:01:10.380> lush<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.979> green<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.970> make<00:01:12.210> sure

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
much more lush and green so make sure

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
much more lush and green so make sure
that<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.869> never<00:01:13.080> let<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> dry<00:01:13.710> out<00:01:13.740> too<00:01:14.340> much

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that you never let it dry out too much

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.690 
that you never let it dry out too much
and<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.930> will<00:01:16.080> get<00:01:16.290> lanky<00:01:16.710> over<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> years<00:01:17.340> too

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and it will get lanky over the years too

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.240 
and it will get lanky over the years too
so<00:01:18.150> every<00:01:18.600> fall<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> like<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.380> prune<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.799> back

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
so every fall I like to prune it back

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.370 
so every fall I like to prune it back
I've<00:01:20.369> already<00:01:20.820> pruned<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.479> one<00:01:21.750> back<00:01:21.990> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
I've already pruned this one back and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.560 
I've already pruned this one back and
the<00:01:22.799> trick<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.400> prune<00:01:23.700> lilacs<00:01:24.240> never

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
the trick when you prune lilacs never

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
the trick when you prune lilacs never
prune<00:01:24.869> them<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.320> than<00:01:25.560> one-third<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
prune them more than one-third of the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.719 
prune them more than one-third of the
plant<00:01:26.580> down<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.750> even<00:01:28.560> if<00:01:28.710> it's<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> couple

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
plant down so even if it's over a couple

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.240 
plant down so even if it's over a couple
years<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:30.990> lanky<00:01:31.409> make<00:01:31.920> sure<00:01:32.100> and

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
years if it's really lanky make sure and

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.130 
years if it's really lanky make sure and
only<00:01:32.400> cut<00:01:32.610> 1/3<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.240> at<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.540> time<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
only cut 1/3 down at a time then the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
only cut 1/3 down at a time then the
next<00:01:34.290> year<00:01:34.590> another<00:01:34.829> third<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.000> way

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
next year another third and that way

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
next year another third and that way
it'll<00:01:36.329> grow<00:01:36.540> very<00:01:36.930> even<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:38.100> even

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
it'll grow very even and you can even

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
it'll grow very even and you can even
take<00:01:38.640> older<00:01:39.150> plants<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.840> make<00:01:40.470> new<00:01:40.680> plants

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
take older plants and make new plants

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.219 
take older plants and make new plants
out<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.119> they're<00:01:42.270> very<00:01:42.509> easy<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
out of them so they're very easy and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
out of them so they're very easy and
they<00:01:43.649> will<00:01:43.890> grow<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.520> suckers<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.630> these

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
they will grow little suckers so these

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.050 
they will grow little suckers so these
are<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.530> starts<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.399> come<00:01:47.610> off<00:01:47.790> at<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
are little starts that come off at the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.080 
are little starts that come off at the
bottom<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.659> these<00:01:49.290> will<00:01:49.560> make<00:01:49.770> new<00:01:50.009> plants<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
bottom and these will make new plants so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.090 
bottom and these will make new plants so
an<00:01:51.240> easy<00:01:51.450> way<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.750> divide<00:01:52.200> them<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.890> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
an easy way to divide them is to just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.149 
an easy way to divide them is to just
cut<00:01:53.369> down<00:01:53.640> as<00:01:53.970> far<00:01:54.630> as<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.560> get<00:01:56.040> as

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
cut down as far as you can and get as

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
cut down as far as you can and get as
much<00:01:56.399> root<00:01:56.790> off<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> sucker<00:01:57.689> as<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.110> can

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
much root off of that sucker as you can

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.709 
much root off of that sucker as you can
and<00:01:58.710> dig<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.369> up<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.060> start<00:02:00.329> another

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
and dig it up and you can start another

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.139 
and dig it up and you can start another
plant<00:02:01.140> very<00:02:01.350> easily<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:02.009> way<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.670> lilacs

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
plant very easily that way so lilacs

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.999 
plant very easily that way so lilacs
don't<00:02:03.420> ask<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.810> lot<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> they<00:02:04.740> just<00:02:04.770> want

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009
