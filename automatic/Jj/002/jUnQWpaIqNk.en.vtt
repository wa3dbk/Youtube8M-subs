working<00:00:19.740> on<00:00:19.860> the<00:00:19.950> open<00:00:20.279> hip<00:00:20.430> pushes<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
working on the open hip pushes and this

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.150 
working on the open hip pushes and this
time<00:00:22.080> we're<00:00:22.230> gonna<00:00:22.290> add<00:00:22.500> in<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.890> little

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
time we're gonna add in a little

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
time we're gonna add in a little
defensive<00:00:23.640> element<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.240> so<00:00:24.779> we're<00:00:24.869> gonna

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
defensive element to it so we're gonna

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.769 
defensive element to it so we're gonna
actually<00:00:25.110> push<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:26.029> we<00:00:27.029> stop<00:00:27.270> it<00:00:27.420> alright

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
actually push out as we stop it alright

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.750 
actually push out as we stop it alright
we're<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.020> to<00:00:28.110> go<00:00:28.230> pass<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.770> puck<00:00:28.950> we're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
we're going to go pass the puck we're

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.600 
we're going to go pass the puck we're
gonna<00:00:29.850> get<00:00:30.030> a<00:00:30.090> good<00:00:30.300> toll<00:00:30.600> push<00:00:30.870> backwards

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
gonna get a good toll push backwards

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.090 
gonna get a good toll push backwards
glide<00:00:32.610> back<00:00:32.910> on<00:00:33.120> our<00:00:33.239> left<00:00:33.680> pivot<00:00:34.680> forward

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
glide back on our left pivot forward

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.950 
glide back on our left pivot forward
here<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.910> again<00:00:36.900> push<00:00:37.890> backward<00:00:38.430> out<00:00:38.580> so<00:00:39.000> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
here and again push backward out so in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
here and again push backward out so in
this<00:00:40.260> particular<00:00:40.800> instance<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.580> last<00:00:41.850> time

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
this particular instance like last time

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.329 
this particular instance like last time
in<00:00:42.720> the<00:00:43.110> last<00:00:43.140> drill<00:00:43.559> we<00:00:43.680> did<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.010> worked<00:00:44.159> on

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
in the last drill we did we worked on

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.910 
in the last drill we did we worked on
opening<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.820> hips<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.239> again<00:00:46.230> focused<00:00:46.800> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
opening the hips up again focused on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.969 
opening the hips up again focused on
center<00:00:47.190> gravity<00:00:47.489> full<00:00:48.330> extension<00:00:48.979> proper

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:49.979 
center gravity full extension proper

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.399 
center gravity full extension proper
drive<00:00:50.190> on<00:00:50.400> every<00:00:50.640> stride<00:00:50.970> on<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:52.050> we're<00:00:52.260> also

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
drive on every stride on this we're also

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:53.899 
drive on every stride on this we're also
working<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> same<00:00:53.250> parts<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.790> we're

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
working on the same parts but we're

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.670 
working on the same parts but we're
working<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.019> much<00:00:55.199> more<00:00:55.379> defense

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
working on them in a much more defense

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.299 
working on them in a much more defense
development<00:00:56.269> we're<00:00:57.269> working<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.960> again<00:00:58.860> now

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
development we're working here again now

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.860 
development we're working here again now
that<00:00:59.519> we've<00:00:59.640> we've<00:00:59.909> made<00:01:00.150> our<00:01:00.330> stop<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> this

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that we've we've made our stop in this

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
that we've we've made our stop in this
case<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.229> need<00:01:01.409> to<00:01:01.500> accelerate<00:01:01.860> backwards<00:01:02.519> so

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
case we need to accelerate backwards so

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.700 
case we need to accelerate backwards so
instead<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.940> opening<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:03.449> hips<00:01:03.659> like<00:01:04.440> we<00:01:04.559> did

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
instead of opening the hips like we did

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.649 
instead of opening the hips like we did
in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> last<00:01:05.040> drill<00:01:05.430> we're<00:01:06.270> gonna<00:01:06.390> actually

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
in the last drill we're gonna actually

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
in the last drill we're gonna actually
work<00:01:07.110> on<00:01:07.290> getting<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> toe<00:01:07.770> push<00:01:08.040> backwards<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
work on getting a toe push backwards so

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000 
work on getting a toe push backwards so
one<00:01:09.600> foot<00:01:09.900> our<00:01:10.140> toe<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.620> to<00:01:10.680> go<00:01:10.770> into<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
one foot our toe is going to go into the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.899 
one foot our toe is going to go into the
ice<00:01:11.240> slight<00:01:12.240> C<00:01:12.600> glide<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.740> our<00:01:13.830> laughs<00:01:14.100> now

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
ice slight C glide on to our laughs now

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.230 
ice slight C glide on to our laughs now
as<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.360> glide<00:01:15.690> onto<00:01:16.619> in<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.640> case<00:01:17.820> my<00:01:18.000> left

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
as we glide onto in this case my left

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.440 
as we glide onto in this case my left
leg<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:19.259> wanta<00:01:19.530> do<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.680> want<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.950> stay<00:01:20.159> low<00:01:20.450> we

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
leg we wanta do is want to stay low we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.230 
leg we wanta do is want to stay low we
want<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.780> pivot<00:01:22.259> around<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.969> want<00:01:24.149> to

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
want to pivot around and we want to

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.109 
want to pivot around and we want to
again<00:01:24.570> bring<00:01:24.930> our<00:01:25.079> glut<00:01:25.350> free<00:01:26.159> foot<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.060> in

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
again bring our glut free foot so in

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.240 
again bring our glut free foot so in
this<00:01:27.180> case<00:01:27.420> my<00:01:27.659> right<00:01:27.689> foot<00:01:28.259> underneath<00:01:28.560> my

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this case my right foot underneath my

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.609 
this case my right foot underneath my
center<00:01:29.609> of<00:01:29.640> gravity<00:01:29.840> get<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> full<00:01:31.140> extension

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
center of gravity get a full extension

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.200 
center of gravity get a full extension
forward<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:33.140> then<00:01:34.140> repeat<00:01:34.469> the<00:01:34.590> drill<00:01:34.740> so

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 
forward and then repeat the drill so

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.520 
forward and then repeat the drill so
works<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> lot<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.780> same<00:01:36.990> elements<00:01:37.469> but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
works on a lot of the same elements but

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.649 
works on a lot of the same elements but
again<00:01:37.799> adds<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.670> little<00:01:39.180> different

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
again adds a little a little different

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.630 
again adds a little a little different
dynamic<00:01:40.229> to<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.799> here's<00:01:41.219> what<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> drill

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
dynamic to it so here's what the drill

00:01:41.640 --> 00:02:03.710 
dynamic to it so here's what the drill
looks<00:01:41.850> like

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000 

so<00:02:04.720> again<00:02:04.930> some<00:02:05.140> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.290> keys<00:02:05.500> are<00:02:05.740> when<00:02:05.890> we

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
so again some of the keys are when we

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.620 
so again some of the keys are when we
drive<00:02:06.280> we<00:02:06.430> want<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.670> try<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:06.880> drive<00:02:07.180> our<00:02:07.360> arms

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
drive we want to try to drive our arms

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.449 
drive we want to try to drive our arms
in<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:08.320> direction<00:02:08.709> we're<00:02:08.830> pushing<00:02:09.160> so<00:02:09.280> if<00:02:09.369> I'm

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
in the direction we're pushing so if I'm

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.910 
in the direction we're pushing so if I'm
pushing<00:02:09.670> from<00:02:09.970> my<00:02:10.090> left<00:02:10.320> left<00:02:11.320> arm<00:02:11.560> extends

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
pushing from my left left arm extends

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.760 
pushing from my left left arm extends
forward<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> pivot<00:02:12.930> right<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.380> right<00:02:14.590> arm

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
forward on the pivot right the right arm

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.220 
forward on the pivot right the right arm
extends<00:02:15.130> forward<00:02:15.370> on<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.610> pivot<00:02:15.959> we<00:02:16.959> want<00:02:17.140> to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
extends forward on the pivot we want to

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.320 
extends forward on the pivot we want to
stay<00:02:17.410> low<00:02:17.620> through<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:17.980> entire<00:02:18.280> thing<00:02:18.610> we

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
stay low through the entire thing we
