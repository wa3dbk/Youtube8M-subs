disappointment it's actually a really

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.319 
disappointment it's actually a really
interesting<00:01:20.590> map<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.609> if<00:01:21.729> you<00:01:21.820> do<00:01:21.939> not<00:01:22.119> know

you will see later on the video if you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.520 
you will see later on the video if you
capture<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:25.060> point<00:01:25.329> there<00:01:25.689> is<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.810> random<00:01:26.259> card

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
capture the point there is a random card

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.200 
capture the point there is a random card

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.870 
but you know it's a good map and I
really<00:01:38.409> like<00:01:38.590> it<00:01:38.799> it's<00:01:38.979> not<00:01:39.159> just<00:01:39.399> a<00:01:39.460> reskin

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
really like it it's not just a reskin

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.069 
really like it it's not just a reskin
and<00:01:40.060> here<00:01:40.240> is<00:01:40.329> actually<00:01:40.659> where<00:01:40.749> we<00:01:40.840> kill

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
and here is actually where we kill

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.349 
and here is actually where we kill
marasmus<00:01:41.649> also<00:01:42.399> on<00:01:42.520> this<00:01:42.549> map<00:01:42.819> our<00:01:43.060> crit

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:43.359 
marasmus also on this map our crit

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.090 
marasmus also on this map our crit

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
pumpkins if you actually run over these

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.679 
pumpkins if you actually run over these
little<00:01:45.280> pumpkin<00:01:45.579> things<00:01:45.789> you<00:01:45.939> get<00:01:46.030> 3.5

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
little pumpkin things you get 3.5

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.200

crits and fighting marasmus this makes

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:52.620 
crits and fighting marasmus this makes
it<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.460> much<00:01:51.640> easier<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:52.090> kill<00:01:52.210> him<00:01:52.329> for<00:01:52.479> some
