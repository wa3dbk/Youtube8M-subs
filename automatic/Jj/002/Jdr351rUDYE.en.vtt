the pence it'll work equally well with
the<00:02:16.560> belt<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.150> was<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.360> holder<00:02:18.629> horse

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
the belt so that was the holder horse

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.680 
the belt so that was the holder horse
hvk<00:02:20.099> there<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:20.940> other<00:02:21.150> one<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.450> is

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
hvk there now the other one they do is

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.890 
hvk there now the other one they do is
their<00:02:21.870> heavy<00:02:22.019> duty<00:02:22.080> knife<00:02:22.500> mm-hmm<00:02:23.750> which<00:02:24.750> is

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
their heavy duty knife mm-hmm which is

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.720 
their heavy duty knife mm-hmm which is
this<00:02:25.019> one<00:02:25.230> here

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
this one here

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.890 
this one here
so<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:27.000> one<00:02:27.209> is<00:02:28.310> dimensionally<00:02:29.900> very

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
so this one is dimensionally very

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.690 
so this one is dimensionally very
similar<00:02:31.880> and<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.190> say<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.519> about<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
similar and that's to say it's about a

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.259 
similar and that's to say it's about a
three<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.060> half<00:02:36.239> inch<00:02:36.450> blade<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:38.269> overall

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
three and a half inch blade and overall

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.370 
three and a half inch blade and overall
length<00:02:39.480> actually<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.930> one<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.110> eight<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
length actually this one is eight and

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.259 
length actually this one is eight and
three-quarter<00:02:40.860> inches<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:42.000> other<00:02:42.150> one

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
three-quarter inches and the other one

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.539 
three-quarter inches and the other one
was<00:02:42.390> eight<00:02:42.540> inches

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
was eight inches

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.289 
was eight inches
I'll<00:02:44.549> show<00:02:44.940> you<00:02:45.000> them<00:02:45.150> together<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.790> you

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
I'll show you them together there so you

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.740 
I'll show you them together there so you
can<00:02:48.480> see<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:52.819> I'm<00:02:53.819> putting<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:54.180> fake<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.360> job<00:02:54.660> in

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
can see and I'm putting a fake a job in

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.140 
can see and I'm putting a fake a job in
that<00:02:54.840> area

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
that area

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.699 
that area
so<00:02:57.150> one<00:02:57.540> heavy-duty<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.680> is<00:03:00.440> slightly<00:03:01.440> heavy

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
the design was for in Europe mostly in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.059 
the design was for in Europe mostly in
Scandinavia<00:03:36.750> there<00:03:37.230> are<00:03:37.350> these<00:03:37.709> knives<00:03:37.920> have

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
Scandinavia there are these knives have

Scandinavia there are these knives have
cared<00:03:38.250> lot<00:03:38.370> by<00:03:38.489> tradesmen<00:03:38.880> I've<00:03:39.120> used<00:03:39.299> as<00:03:39.420> a

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
cared lot by tradesmen I've used as a

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.090 
cared lot by tradesmen I've used as a
universal<00:03:40.049> tool<00:03:40.290> so<00:03:40.620> they're<00:03:40.769> very<00:03:40.950> often

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
universal tool so they're very often

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.340 
universal tool so they're very often
used<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.430> punching<00:03:42.329> and<00:03:42.480> prying<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:43.079> well<00:03:43.260> as

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
used for punching and prying as well as

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.210 
used for punching and prying as well as
you<00:03:43.590> know<00:03:43.739> cutting<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.530> they<00:03:46.530> did<00:03:46.709> tests<00:03:47.100> and

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you know cutting and they did tests and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.250 
you know cutting and they did tests and
they<00:03:47.280> found<00:03:47.310> that<00:03:47.639> this<00:03:47.819> this<00:03:48.260> secondary

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
they found that this this secondary

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.180 
they found that this this secondary
bevel<00:03:49.500> it's<00:03:50.160> double<00:03:50.489> bell<00:03:51.380> actually<00:03:52.380> for

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
bevel it's double bell actually for

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.430 
bevel it's double bell actually for
those<00:03:53.280> kind<00:03:53.609> of<00:03:53.670> tasks<00:03:54.150> gave<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> more<00:03:55.139> durable

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
those kind of tasks gave a more durable

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.849 
those kind of tasks gave a more durable
edge<00:03:56.030> so<00:03:57.030> that's<00:03:57.239> why<00:03:57.359> they<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.540> it<00:03:57.690> so<00:03:58.680> this<00:03:58.799> is

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
edge so that's why they do it so this is

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.250 
edge so that's why they do it so this is
a<00:03:58.980> fantastic<00:03:59.400> knife<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.959> know<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.139> any

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
a fantastic knife you know in any

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.800 
a fantastic knife you know in any
situation<00:04:02.010> really<00:04:02.190> outstanding<00:04:02.849> and<00:04:03.359> you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
situation really outstanding and you

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.220 
situation really outstanding and you
could<00:04:03.930> always<00:04:05.450> you<00:04:06.450> could<00:04:06.569> always<00:04:06.690> a<00:04:06.840> make<00:04:07.109> it

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
could always you could always a make it

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:08.780

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
into a single bevel pretty easily if it

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.640 
into a single bevel pretty easily if it
was<00:04:08.970> your<00:04:09.090> choice<00:04:09.329> but<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.049> know<00:04:10.230> so<00:04:10.410> it<00:04:10.530> comes
