00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.060 
let's talk about some web design trends
so<00:00:09.719> in<00:00:10.019> this<00:00:10.230> video<00:00:10.469> we're<00:00:10.769> gonna<00:00:10.860> be<00:00:10.980> talking

so in this video we're gonna be talking
about<00:00:11.929> graphical<00:00:13.340> representation<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:15.089> if<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
about graphical representation so if you

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.050 
about graphical representation so if you
remember<00:00:16.680> last<00:00:17.039> year<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.670> even<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> year

before that in 2013 a lot of a lot of

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.779 
before that in 2013 a lot of a lot of
websites<00:00:24.000> started<00:00:24.689> using<00:00:25.080> more<00:00:25.410> graphics<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
websites started using more graphics and

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.120 
websites started using more graphics and
that<00:00:27.060> was<00:00:27.300> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.660> part<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:28.019> part<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.859> flat

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
that was kind of part of part of flat

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.250 
that was kind of part of part of flat
design<00:00:29.519> as<00:00:29.760> flat<00:00:30.029> design<00:00:30.330> got<00:00:30.539> bigger<00:00:30.779> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
design as flat design got bigger we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.740 
design as flat design got bigger we
started<00:00:31.590> using<00:00:31.769> more<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.750> photoshop

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
started using more and more photoshop

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.410 
started using more and more photoshop
created<00:00:34.260> graphics<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:35.070> represent<00:00:36.059> what<00:00:36.300> we

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
created graphics to represent what we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.880 
created graphics to represent what we
were<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> message<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.410> were<00:00:37.530> trying<00:00:37.800> to

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
do an excellent job of a graphical

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.319 
do an excellent job of a graphical
representation

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
representation

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.260 
representation
the<00:00:48.780> first<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.500> outtie<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:51.059> car

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
the first one is outtie of a car

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.310 
the first one is outtie of a car
manufacturer<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.469> their<00:00:52.620> car<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> Audi<00:00:53.399> TT

manufacturer for their car the Audi TT

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
manufacturer for their car the Audi TT
if<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.530> would<00:00:55.649> work<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.280> would<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:56.670> excellent

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
if it would work that would be excellent

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.560 
if it would work that would be excellent
but<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.320> they've<00:00:58.469> done<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.949> they<00:00:59.820> have<00:00:59.850> come

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
aspects of it out for example whatever I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.260 
aspects of it out for example whatever I
just<00:01:16.979> clicked<00:01:17.520> on<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.670> really<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.090> no<00:01:18.240> idea

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
just clicked on I really have no idea

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.380 
just clicked on I really have no idea
but<00:01:19.310> they<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.520> really<00:01:20.700> good<00:01:20.880> job<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
but they do a really good job of

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.359 
but they do a really good job of
graphically<00:01:22.049> representing<00:01:22.680> their<00:01:22.860> car<00:01:23.100> what

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
graphically representing their car what

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
graphically representing their car what
their<00:01:23.520> car<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.790> about<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.240> different<00:01:24.330> aspects

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
their car is about in different aspects

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.859 
their car is about in different aspects
of<00:01:25.080> their<00:01:25.259> car<00:01:25.470> also<00:01:26.009> note<00:01:26.580> another<00:01:27.270> web

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
of their car also note another web

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.240 
of their car also note another web
design<00:01:28.170> trend<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.530> they're<00:01:28.680> using<00:01:28.890> here

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
design trend that they're using here

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
design trend that they're using here
which<00:01:29.430> we're<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> talk<00:01:30.000> about<00:01:30.030> in<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
which we're going to talk about in a

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.499 
which we're going to talk about in a
later<00:01:31.020> video<00:01:31.259> during<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> series<00:01:32.100> is

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
later video during this series is

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.030 
later video during this series is
background<00:01:33.509> video<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.409> instead<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.860> just

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
background video so instead of just

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.280 
background video so instead of just
using<00:01:35.220> big<00:01:35.520> pictures<00:01:35.970> which<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.570> picture

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
using big pictures which a picture

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.780 
using big pictures which a picture
speaks<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.650> thousand<00:01:38.009> words<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.340> definitely

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
speaks a thousand words it definitely

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.499 
speaks a thousand words it definitely
does<00:01:38.970> but<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.840> instead<00:01:40.140> use<00:01:40.740> video<00:01:41.400> they<00:01:42.360> use

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
does but they instead use video they use

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.090 
does but they instead use video they use
pictures<00:01:42.840> too<00:01:42.990> but<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.290> incorporate<00:01:43.799> video

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
pictures too but they incorporate video

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.850 
pictures too but they incorporate video
a<00:01:44.159> lot<00:01:44.369> into<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:44.850> they're<00:01:45.030> trying<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> do

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
a lot into what they're trying to do

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.679 
a lot into what they're trying to do
this<00:01:46.860> isn't<00:01:47.070> exactly<00:01:47.220> working<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:48.509> way<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
this isn't exactly working the way I

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.380 
this isn't exactly working the way I
hoped<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.259> let's<00:01:49.979> move<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:50.970> next<00:01:51.270> one

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
hoped so let's move on to the next one

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.920 
hoped so let's move on to the next one
so<00:01:51.740> these<00:01:52.740> guys<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.310> they<00:01:54.149> create<00:01:54.509> online

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so these guys here they create online

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.260 
so these guys here they create online
