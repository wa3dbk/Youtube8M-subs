00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 very well the introduction of the song 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.280
 has a guitar score that we're going to 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.320
 see below is quite simple 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.010
 the first note is on the 7th fret 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.010
 the third rope 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.940
 then he touches the rope two open air 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.720
 and then from that same string frets three 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.720
 and four 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.340
 and so they pushed from 3 to 4 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.750
 then up there 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510
 and 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.750
 then continue with the second door to 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.070
 air again 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:32.780
 and then to fret 4 of the second queue and 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.780
 then between this 5 with a road also 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.650
 then up there 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.159
 do not 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.299
 and 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.299
 then up there 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.460
 then up there 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.250
 and then still paying trust in 3d the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 first rope 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 and fret 2 of the first string 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.810
 then fret 3 of the second string 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.400
 t 1 repeat the fret 1 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.490
 the 3rd repeats the fret 0 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.150
 fret two of the third string 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.560
 try two of the fourth and drag after 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.560
 of five of the fourth 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.700
 then all that section to low 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.700
 speed 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 and 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.200
 the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.200
 the 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 ah 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.030
 ah 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.560
 do not 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.130
 do not 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.130
 no no 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.900
 touch the speed the introduction sounds 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.900
 in that way 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.689
 i 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.689
 and 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.810
 and 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.810
 ah 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.550
 good for your troops and the refrains 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.190
 of the song are pretty simple 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.780
 they also only have capo perhaps 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.790
 beginner guitarist works this 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.320
 complicate them a bit more 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.500
 are four strings first the agreement of 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.500
 Sun 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.570
 then he remembered if greater 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.159
 we continue remembering my minor 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:12.470
 and then the agreed point 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.480
 and what make the mind jump the note 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:21.860
 most serious of the chord and the error of 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:23.390
 concrete in this way access for all 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.610
 the chords during his troops and the 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:29.120
 refrains 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.449
 then played slowly it would sound like this 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.449
 way 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.550
 at speed it sounds only a little 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.140
 faster since the song is not 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.140
 too fast from stafford 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.889
 the song then continues with a small 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.510
 guitar slide in which we do not 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:33.639
 let's put in since we need a 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.100
 special implement we are simply going to 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:37.240
 touch the base of it that is very 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.490
 similar to what we just touched 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.560
 only that you touch twice as much 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.040
 speed is to say each hard chord 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.720
 only a compass played slowly 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.720
 it would sound like this 

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:18.080
 the song also has in addition has a 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:21.710
 bridge where you use another chord and 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.500
 we have used uses a greater re this 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.790
 font is played in black by chords very 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:31.000
 very easy 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.000
 it sounds slowly in this way I release sun 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.169
 the speed would be
