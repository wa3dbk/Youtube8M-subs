00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:06.209 
here now how did these charge up these
actually<00:06:04.149> use<00:06:04.299> the<00:06:04.479> same<00:06:04.689> cable<00:06:05.469> as<00:06:05.619> your<00:06:05.829> ps3

00:06:06.209 --> 00:06:06.219 
actually use the same cable as your ps3

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:08.339 
actually use the same cable as your ps3
controller<00:06:06.939> so<00:06:07.119> you<00:06:07.179> just<00:06:07.329> plug<00:06:07.479> these<00:06:07.659> in<00:06:07.869> or

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
controller so you just plug these in or

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:09.809 
controller so you just plug these in or
you<00:06:08.499> could<00:06:08.619> get<00:06:08.739> something<00:06:09.009> like<00:06:09.159> a<00:06:09.309> charging

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
you could get something like a charging

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.429 
you could get something like a charging
station<00:06:10.059> what<00:06:10.509> you<00:06:10.629> guys<00:06:10.749> will<00:06:10.959> see<00:06:11.139> in<00:06:11.319> the

00:06:11.429 --> 00:06:11.439 
station what you guys will see in the

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:15.119 
station what you guys will see in the
next<00:06:11.589> video<00:06:12.779> but<00:06:13.779> over<00:06:13.959> here<00:06:14.139> you<00:06:14.199> got<00:06:14.499> the<00:06:14.679> l1

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
next video but over here you got the l1

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.369 
next video but over here you got the l1
l2<00:06:15.399> so<00:06:15.969> basically<00:06:16.359> depending<00:06:16.899> on<00:06:17.019> how<00:06:17.319> you

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:17.379 
l2 so basically depending on how you

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:19.109 
l2 so basically depending on how you
play<00:06:17.679> it<00:06:17.829> you<00:06:17.949> could<00:06:18.129> play<00:06:18.279> it<00:06:18.429> like<00:06:18.459> this<00:06:18.609> or

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:19.119 
play it you could play it like this or

00:06:19.119 --> 00:06:20.969 
play it you could play it like this or
for<00:06:19.809> me<00:06:19.959> it<00:06:20.199> would<00:06:20.289> be<00:06:20.349> more<00:06:20.589> something<00:06:20.859> like

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
for me it would be more something like

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:22.709 
for me it would be more something like
this<00:06:21.309> because<00:06:21.819> I'm<00:06:21.999> right-handed

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
this because I'm right-handed

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.689
