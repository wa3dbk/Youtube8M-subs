00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
a gray fill and a stroke I'll just use

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
a gray fill and a stroke I'll just use
black<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.969> make<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.210> easier<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.070> I'll<00:00:44.070> go

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
ahead and if I hold shift it locks it

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560 
ahead and if I hold shift it locks it
into<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:47.070> perfect<00:00:47.579> circle<00:00:48.059> if<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.239> don't<00:00:48.420> hold

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
into a perfect circle if I don't hold

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.850 
into a perfect circle if I don't hold
shift<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.320> anything<00:00:50.510> all<00:00:51.510> right<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.140> I

shift it can be anything all right and I

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
shift it can be anything all right and I
pick<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> shape<00:00:53.520> like<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.760> but<00:00:54.270> what<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.480> want

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690

to do is I want to choose my fill bucket
and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.449> pick<00:00:57.690> like<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.899> top<00:00:58.199> corner<00:00:58.940> okay<00:00:59.940> and

and then pick like a top corner okay and

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
and then pick like a top corner okay and
it<00:01:00.149> kind<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> gives<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> almost<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.230> little<00:01:01.559> bit

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649

more<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> 3d<00:01:02.280> effect<00:01:02.579> obviously<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.570> a

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
more of a 3d effect obviously not a

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
more of a 3d effect obviously not a
whole<00:01:03.840> lot<00:01:04.019> more<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:05.339> want<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.580> do<00:01:05.700> now

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
is copy so we can just do edit copy and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.870 
is copy so we can just do edit copy and
then<00:01:10.979> edit<00:01:11.460> paste<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:16.080> doesn't<00:01:16.409> really

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
then edit paste and it doesn't really

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.260 
then edit paste and it doesn't really
look<00:01:17.880> very<00:01:18.180> impressive<00:01:18.710> if<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.520> scale

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
look very impressive if I was to scale

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.760 
look very impressive if I was to scale
this<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.930> bit<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.500> I'm<00:01:22.619> just

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770

this a little bit and here I'm just
gonna<00:01:22.890> do<00:01:23.100> free<00:01:23.340> transform<00:01:23.850> but<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.119> gonna

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
gonna do free transform but I'm gonna

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.789 
gonna do free transform but I'm gonna
make<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> just<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> little<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:25.170> smaller<00:01:25.560> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799

again<00:01:26.009> I'm<00:01:26.100> gonna<00:01:26.189> hold<00:01:26.340> shift<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.759> make<00:01:26.880> sure

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
again I'm gonna hold shift to make sure

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.740 
again I'm gonna hold shift to make sure
it's<00:01:27.270> perfect<00:01:28.229> circle<00:01:29.329> alright<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.509> I'm

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
it's perfect circle alright and I'm

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.679 
it's perfect circle alright and I'm
gonna<00:01:30.869> go<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.200> my<00:01:31.619> fill<00:01:31.979> bucket<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:33.600> I'm

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
gonna go with my fill bucket and I'm

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.190 
gonna go with my fill bucket and I'm
gonna<00:01:33.810> fill<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.259> complete<00:01:34.650> opposite<00:01:35.189> edge

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
gonna fill the complete opposite edge

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.380 
gonna fill the complete opposite edge
alright<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.729> then<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.850> going<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.060> use<00:01:39.150> my

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
alright and then I'm going to use my

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.840 
alright and then I'm going to use my
select<00:01:39.840> tool<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.320> move<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.159> somewhere<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
select tool and move this somewhere in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.910 
select tool and move this somewhere in
the<00:01:41.970> center<00:01:42.439> alright<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.530> what<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.740> does

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the center alright now what that does

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380 
the center alright now what that does
you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.490> see<00:01:44.640> is<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.149> use<00:01:45.270> my

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
you can see is it I'm going to use my

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.149 
you can see is it I'm going to use my
arrow<00:01:45.540> tools<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.049> bit<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.740> makes<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
arrow tools a little bit it makes it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.050 
arrow tools a little bit it makes it
almost<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.700> like<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:48.030> concave<00:01:48.750> shape<00:01:50.060> now

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
almost look like a concave shape now

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.440 
almost look like a concave shape now
what's<00:01:51.509> cool<00:01:51.720> is<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.259> paste<00:01:52.590> again<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
what's cool is if I paste again and

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.620 
what's cool is if I paste again and
scale<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> free<00:01:56.040> transform

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
scale this or do a free transform

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.370 
scale this or do a free transform
depending<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.689> which<00:01:57.810> version<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.200> flash

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
depending on which version of flash

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.160 
depending on which version of flash
you're<00:01:58.619> using<00:01:58.909> make<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.090> even<00:02:00.329> smaller<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you're using make it even smaller and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.260 
you're using make it even smaller and
then<00:02:02.600> fill<00:02:03.600> it<00:02:03.719> with<00:02:03.869> something<00:02:05.149> maybe<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
then fill it with something maybe a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.589 
then fill it with something maybe a
different<00:02:06.689> color<00:02:06.930> like<00:02:07.229> green<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.860> example

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
different color like green for example

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.570 
different color like green for example
I'm<00:02:09.599> gonna<00:02:09.840> drag<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.349> up<00:02:10.560> toward<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> top<00:02:11.280> in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I'm gonna drag this up toward the top in

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.370 
I'm gonna drag this up toward the top in
the<00:02:12.300> middle

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
the middle

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.150 
the middle
and<00:02:13.520> now<00:02:14.520> with<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.810> three<00:02:16.110> different<00:02:16.320> shapes

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
and now with the three different shapes

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.150 
and now with the three different shapes
together<00:02:17.880> it<00:02:18.630> gives<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.020> this<00:02:19.140> impression<00:02:19.770> of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
together it gives it this impression of

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.910 
together it gives it this impression of
a<00:02:20.340> 3d<00:02:20.790> glass<00:02:21.120> shape<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:22.110> we<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.380> even<00:02:22.530> add<00:02:22.710> on

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
a 3d glass shape now we can even add on

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.300 
a 3d glass shape now we can even add on
to<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.250> by<00:02:23.580> choosing<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.720> paint<00:02:25.650> brush<00:02:25.920> and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
to this by choosing a paint brush and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.440 
to this by choosing a paint brush and
then<00:02:27.030> maybe<00:02:27.330> as<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.870> color<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.560> white<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.450> a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
then maybe as a color of white and a

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.300 
then maybe as a color of white and a
brush<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.050> made<00:02:31.230> me<00:02:31.320> look<00:02:31.470> something<00:02:31.980> I

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
brush that made me look something I

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.340 
brush that made me look something I
don't<00:02:32.730> know<00:02:32.820> like<00:02:32.970> this<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.510> where<00:02:34.110> there's<00:02:34.290> a

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
don't know like this and where there's a

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.110 
don't know like this and where there's a
bright<00:02:34.620> spot<00:02:34.890> you<00:02:35.190> know<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.520> put<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:35.910> little

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
bright spot you know just put a little

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.770 
bright spot you know just put a little
shine<00:02:36.390> on<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:37.310> okay<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.760> now<00:02:38.970> that's<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.360> basic

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
shine on it okay so now that's a basic

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.950 
shine on it okay so now that's a basic
round<00:02:40.610> button<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.120> cool<00:02:42.330> thing<00:02:42.510> about<00:02:42.600> this

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
round button the cool thing about this

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.650 
round button the cool thing about this
is<00:02:43.230> if<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.190> decide<00:02:44.490> we<00:02:44.520> want<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.880> scale<00:02:45.300> at<00:02:45.510> all

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
is if we decide we want to scale at all

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.920 
is if we decide we want to scale at all
as<00:02:45.840> one<00:02:46.020> piece<00:02:46.910> let<00:02:47.910> me<00:02:48.000> go<00:02:48.150> ahead<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.540> free

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
as one piece let me go ahead and free

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.870 
as one piece let me go ahead and free
transform<00:02:49.440> I'm<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.010> used<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.400> scale<00:02:50.700> from

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
transform I'm so used to the scale from

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.310 
transform I'm so used to the scale from
the<00:02:51.060> earlier<00:02:51.330> versions<00:02:51.980> we<00:02:52.980> can<00:02:53.130> do<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.490> and

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
the earlier versions we can do this and

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.940 
the earlier versions we can do this and
make<00:02:55.320> these<00:02:55.950> nice<00:02:56.130> little<00:02:56.430> glass<00:02:56.580> buttons<00:02:57.090> and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
make these nice little glass buttons and

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.200 
make these nice little glass buttons and
the<00:02:58.950> other<00:02:59.100> thing<00:02:59.310> that's<00:02:59.460> nice<00:02:59.610> about<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.090> is

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
the other thing that's nice about it is

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.440 
the other thing that's nice about it is
if<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:00.660> select<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.410> middle<00:03:01.710> piece<00:03:01.980> and

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
if you select this middle piece and

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.820 
if you select this middle piece and
change<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.690> fill<00:03:03.900> color<00:03:03.930> instead<00:03:04.530> of<00:03:04.620> green

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
change the fill color instead of green

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
change the fill color instead of green
maybe<00:03:05.040> say<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.550> red<00:03:06.110> and<00:03:07.460> then<00:03:08.460> go<00:03:08.640> back<00:03:08.820> to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
maybe say to a red and then go back to

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.070 
maybe say to a red and then go back to
scene<00:03:09.470> you've<00:03:10.470> got<00:03:10.710> a<00:03:10.740> red<00:03:11.130> button<00:03:11.370> so<00:03:12.080> they're

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
scene you've got a red button so they're

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840 
scene you've got a red button so they're
really<00:03:13.350> easy<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.650> do<00:03:13.890> so<00:03:14.520> I'm<00:03:14.580> going<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.790> go

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
really easy to do so I'm going to go

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.040 
really easy to do so I'm going to go
ahead<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.090> do<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.240> same<00:03:15.510> thing<00:03:15.750> here<00:03:15.900> with

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
ahead and do the same thing here with

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.870 
ahead and do the same thing here with
the<00:03:16.170> rectangle<00:03:16.800> if<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.420> draw<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.590> box<00:03:20.280> and

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
the rectangle if I was to draw a box and

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.750 
the rectangle if I was to draw a box and
I'm<00:03:21.240> gonna<00:03:21.390> go<00:03:21.540> ahead<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.720> do<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:22.400> gray<00:03:23.400> fill

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
I'm gonna go ahead and do a a gray fill

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.040 
I'm gonna go ahead and do a a gray fill
and<00:03:24.230> again<00:03:25.230> I'll<00:03:25.410> I'll<00:03:25.590> pick<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.100> corner<00:03:27.050> it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
and again I'll I'll pick one corner it

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.210 
and again I'll I'll pick one corner it
doesn't<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.410> matter<00:03:28.620> which<00:03:28.800> corner<00:03:29.070> I

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
doesn't really matter which corner I

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.360 
doesn't really matter which corner I
usually<00:03:29.460> do<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.700> top<00:03:29.940> left<00:03:30.210> corner<00:03:30.480> to<00:03:30.600> start

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
usually do the top left corner to start

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.260 
usually do the top left corner to start
copy<00:03:32.370> paste<00:03:33.650> free<00:03:34.650> transform<00:03:35.220> and<00:03:35.670> drop<00:03:35.940> down

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
copy paste free transform and drop down

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:41.570 
copy paste free transform and drop down
a<00:03:36.330> little<00:03:36.570> bit<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:36.810> size<00:03:39.620> all<00:03:40.620> right<00:03:40.890> and<00:03:41.190> I

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
a little bit in size all right and I

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.570 
a little bit in size all right and I
might<00:03:41.760> even<00:03:42.620> let's<00:03:43.620> see<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.280> that's

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
might even let's see here I think that's

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.370 
might even let's see here I think that's
probably<00:03:44.790> gonna<00:03:45.030> work<00:03:46.310> and<00:03:47.600> then<00:03:48.600> do<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.080> fill

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
probably gonna work and then do my fill

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.140 
probably gonna work and then do my fill
again<00:03:49.860> and<00:03:50.370> at<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.610> opposite<00:03:51.090> end<00:03:53.000> you<00:03:54.000> see

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
again and at the opposite end you see

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.480 
again and at the opposite end you see
it's<00:03:54.300> kind<00:03:54.450> of<00:03:54.570> gives<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:54.930> concave

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:55.490 
it's kind of gives that little concave

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.380 
it's kind of gives that little concave
button<00:03:56.490> like<00:03:56.670> almost<00:03:56.910> like<00:03:57.030> a<00:03:57.120> keyboard

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
button like almost like a keyboard

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.710 
button like almost like a keyboard
button<00:03:57.980> look<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.280> then<00:03:59.850> I'll<00:03:59.970> paste<00:04:00.480> again

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
button look and then I'll paste again

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.850 
button look and then I'll paste again
and<00:04:01.250> right<00:04:02.250> click<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:02.820> free<00:04:03.090> transform<00:04:03.860> make

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 
and right click and free transform make

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.990 
and right click and free transform make
it<00:04:04.980> even<00:04:05.190> smaller<00:04:07.340> put<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.460> right<00:04:08.580> back<00:04:08.760> in

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
it even smaller put it right back in

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.170 
it even smaller put it right back in
here<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.330> middle<00:04:09.450> and<00:04:10.760> you<00:04:11.760> get<00:04:11.940> almost

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
here in the middle and you get almost

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.130 
here in the middle and you get almost
like<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.800> television<00:04:13.800> screen<00:04:14.310> effect<00:04:15.140> all

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
like a television screen effect all

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.830 
like a television screen effect all
right<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:17.250> works<00:04:17.760> great<00:04:17.970> because<00:04:18.239> now<00:04:18.600> if

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
right so that works great because now if

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.349 
right so that works great because now if
on<00:04:19.080> say<00:04:19.530> another<00:04:19.739> layer<00:04:20.010> we<00:04:20.730> wanted<00:04:21.060> to<00:04:21.180> add

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
on say another layer we wanted to add

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.300 
on say another layer we wanted to add
you<00:04:22.260> know<00:04:22.380> some<00:04:23.270> some

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
you know some some

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.560 
you know some some
text<00:04:29.350> okay<00:04:30.520> you<00:04:31.520> can<00:04:31.669> have<00:04:31.790> text<00:04:32.240> up<00:04:32.360> here<00:04:32.389> on

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
text okay you can have text up here on

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.770 
text okay you can have text up here on
your<00:04:32.690> screen<00:04:33.100> and<00:04:34.100> it<00:04:35.060> basically<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.600> gives

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
your screen and it basically just gives

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.550 
your screen and it basically just gives
you<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.700> artificial<00:04:37.700> 3d<00:04:38.210> look<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:39.050> it's<00:04:39.470> a

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
you this artificial 3d look and it's a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.040 
you this artificial 3d look and it's a
simple<00:04:39.919> effect<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:41.030> other<00:04:41.180> thing<00:04:41.419> is<00:04:41.660> if<00:04:41.990> we

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
simple effect the other thing is if we

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.920 
simple effect the other thing is if we
were<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.820> take<00:04:43.820> something<00:04:44.120> like<00:04:44.270> this<00:04:44.630> shape

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
were to take something like this shape

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.629 
were to take something like this shape
and<00:04:46.690> we<00:04:47.690> want<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.050> go<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.200> gradient<00:04:48.620> fill<00:04:49.040> like<00:04:49.610> a

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
and we want to go a gradient fill like a

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.550 
and we want to go a gradient fill like a
cross<00:04:50.350> like<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.790> we<00:04:52.790> can<00:04:52.940> put<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:54.260> white

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
cross like that we can put the white

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.409 
cross like that we can put the white
shine<00:04:54.980> in<00:04:55.370> one<00:04:55.639> area<00:04:55.910> add<00:04:56.389> another<00:04:58.330> color<00:04:59.330> here

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
shine in one area add another color here

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.500 
shine in one area add another color here
and<00:04:59.750> make<00:04:59.900> it<00:05:00.080> say<00:05:00.650> black<00:05:03.040> and<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.880> get<00:05:05.180> kind<00:05:05.450> of

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
and make it say black and to get kind of

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.900 
and make it say black and to get kind of
a<00:05:05.600> cylinder<00:05:06.530> effect<00:05:07.040> and<00:05:07.340> if<00:05:07.460> you<00:05:07.550> don't<00:05:07.729> want

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
a cylinder effect and if you don't want

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.000 
a cylinder effect and if you don't want
to<00:05:08.120> have<00:05:08.389> it<00:05:08.570> that<00:05:08.600> dark<00:05:09.229> you<00:05:09.500> can<00:05:09.650> kind<00:05:09.830> of<00:05:09.860> do

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
to have it that dark you can kind of do

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:15.219 
to have it that dark you can kind of do
it<00:05:10.160> more<00:05:10.760> like<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:10.970> and<00:05:13.900> then<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:14.990> can<00:05:15.139> even

it more like that and then you can even

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:17.890 
it more like that and then you can even
take<00:05:15.470> your<00:05:15.500> edges<00:05:16.040> of<00:05:16.160> your<00:05:16.340> cylinder<00:05:16.910> pull

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
take your edges of your cylinder pull

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:27.400 
take your edges of your cylinder pull
them<00:05:18.110> down<00:05:22.810> draw<00:05:23.810> a<00:05:23.840> line<00:05:25.780> from<00:05:26.780> there<00:05:27.139> to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
them down draw a line from there to

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.260 
them down draw a line from there to
there<00:05:30.190> drag<00:05:31.190> it<00:05:31.460> up<00:05:31.700> whoops

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.120 

drag<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.450> up<00:05:35.690> and<00:05:38.020> do<00:05:39.020> a<00:05:39.050> similar<00:05:39.410> fill<00:05:39.800> on<00:05:40.039> the

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
drag it up and do a similar fill on the

00:05:40.130 --> 00:06:05.220 
drag it up and do a similar fill on the
inside

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.290
