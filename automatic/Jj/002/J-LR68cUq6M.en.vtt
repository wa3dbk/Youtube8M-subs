ever-present<00:04:08.100> guy<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:08.940> could<00:04:09.060> always

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
ever-present guy that you could always

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.960 
ever-present guy that you could always
walk<00:04:09.299> up<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.720> and<00:04:09.900> get<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.260> comment<00:04:10.500> from<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.790> I

walk up to and get a comment from and I

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.979 
walk up to and get a comment from and I
think<00:04:12.269> not<00:04:13.049> only<00:04:13.079> max<00:04:14.299> situation<00:04:15.299> but<00:04:15.780> then

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
think not only max situation but then

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.990 
think not only max situation but then
followed<00:04:16.410> by<00:04:16.440> Craig<00:04:16.859> Lanza<00:04:17.340> Peter<00:04:17.609> Brock<00:04:17.850> had

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
followed by Craig Lanza Peter Brock had

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.610 
followed by Craig Lanza Peter Brock had
a<00:04:18.030> lot<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> time<00:04:18.510> for<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.229> think<00:04:19.289> these

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
a lot of time for it and I think these

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.500 
a lot of time for it and I think these
are<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.859> two<00:04:20.010> guys<00:04:20.220> Craig<00:04:20.549> lands<00:04:20.880> and<00:04:21.060> Max<00:04:21.269> go

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
are the two guys Craig lands and Max go

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.590 
are the two guys Craig lands and Max go
through<00:04:21.720> Brock<00:04:21.989> saw<00:04:22.260> as<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.880> next<00:04:24.180> division

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600
