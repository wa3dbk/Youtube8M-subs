experience<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.440> both<00:00:13.650> capture<00:00:14.160> cards<00:00:15.529> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
experience with both capture cards the

experience with both capture cards the
way<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.949> identify<00:00:17.820> which<00:00:18.029> capture<00:00:18.420> card<00:00:18.480> you

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
way that identify which capture card you

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.540 
way that identify which capture card you
have<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.460> the<00:00:20.460> easiest<00:00:20.490> way<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.480> by<00:00:22.220> the<00:00:23.220> well

the easiest way to be honest is my way
to<00:00:26.369> say<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> easycap<00:00:27.119> how<00:00:27.480> it<00:00:27.930> looks<00:00:28.439> this<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
to say the easycap how it looks this is

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.100 
to say the easycap how it looks this is
the<00:00:29.789> easycap<00:00:30.269> d<00:00:30.539> 660<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.570> coloring

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
the easycap d 660 because the coloring

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.240 
the easycap d 660 because the coloring
of<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.890> words<00:00:35.219> are<00:00:36.059> silver<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.739> one<00:00:38.010> on

prompt<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.140> had<00:01:13.500> with<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.799> d6<00:01:14.340> 60<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:16.229> audio

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
prompt that had with the d6 60 the audio

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.190 
prompt that had with the d6 60 the audio
is<00:01:16.740> very<00:01:17.070> terrible<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.909> had<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.630> go

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is very terrible I had to be like go

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.740 
is very terrible I had to be like go
through<00:01:19.439> some<00:01:19.590> trouble<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.630> the

sound better and also if you open them

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.969 
sound better and also if you open them
this<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> B<00:01:26.490> 660<00:01:27.450> I'll<00:01:27.900> go<00:01:28.380> Bo<00:01:28.560> defeated

this is the B 660 I'll go Bo defeated
chips<00:01:29.310> but<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.000> difference

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
chips but you can see the difference

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.090 
chips but you can see the difference
between<00:01:31.229> both<00:01:31.829> capture<00:01:32.340> cards<00:01:33.439> this<00:01:34.439> uses<00:01:35.070> a

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
between both capture cards this uses a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.210 
between both capture cards this uses a
cheap<00:01:35.840> name<00:01:36.840> brand<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:38.000> but<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.329> cheap<00:01:40.220> chip

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
cheap name brand of but a cheap chip

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.580 
cheap name brand of but a cheap chip
which<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:42.090> know<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.329> quality<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.899> lost<00:01:43.259> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
which you know the quality is lost and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.149 
which you know the quality is lost and
they<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.009> have<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.670> great<00:01:45.560> audio<00:01:46.560> chip<00:01:46.920> which

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
they don't have a great audio chip which

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.240 
they don't have a great audio chip which
makes<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.759> sound<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.180> crappy<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.100> the

d6 60 now there's d6 60 plus have been
in<00:01:56.909> PDA<00:01:57.840> chip<00:01:58.200> when<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.560> which<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.280> use<00:01:59.520> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
in PDA chip when they which they use it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.170 
in PDA chip when they which they use it
on<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.570> dazzle<00:02:01.229> and<00:02:01.610> they<00:02:02.610> also<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.149> a

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
on on the dazzle and they also have a

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.590 
on on the dazzle and they also have a
better<00:02:03.630> chip<00:02:04.049> for<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:04.890> audio<00:02:05.430> which<00:02:05.759> sounds

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
better chip for the audio which sounds

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.380 
better chip for the audio which sounds
amazing<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.710> I'm<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.190> do<00:02:08.340> some<00:02:08.700> tests

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
amazing and I'm going to do some tests

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.820 
amazing and I'm going to do some tests
for<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.780> compare<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.410> also<00:02:10.679> have<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
a video on my channel here where you see

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.420 
a video on my channel here where you see
the<00:02:16.330> quality<00:02:16.690> in<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> audio<00:02:17.590> quality<00:02:17.770> of<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
the quality in the audio quality of the

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.160 
the quality in the audio quality of the
D<00:02:18.730> 660<00:02:19.480> and<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.650> D<00:02:20.800> 60<00:02:21.460> plus<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:22.170> won't

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
D 660 and this is the D 60 plus I won't

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.890 
D 660 and this is the D 60 plus I won't
maybe<00:02:23.770> we'd<00:02:24.130> be<00:02:24.400> able<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.580> see<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.880> but<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.660> is

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
maybe we'd be able to see it but this is

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.170 
maybe we'd be able to see it but this is
an<00:02:26.050> imperial<00:02:26.890> chip<00:02:27.340> let<00:02:28.210> me<00:02:28.300> see

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
an imperial chip let me see

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.130 
an imperial chip let me see
yeah<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.300> won't<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.540> able<00:02:31.630> to<00:02:31.720> read<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.050> but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
yeah you won't be able to read it but

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.840 
yeah you won't be able to read it but
right<00:02:32.230> here<00:02:32.560> that's<00:02:32.800> the<00:02:32.980> impeded<00:02:33.370> chip<00:02:33.610> and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
right here that's the impeded chip and

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.530 
right here that's the impeded chip and
this<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.750> upgraded<00:02:35.500> audio<00:02:36.190> chip<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.120> think

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
this is the upgraded audio chip I think

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.780 
this is the upgraded audio chip I think
that<00:02:37.690> may<00:02:37.840> be<00:02:37.870> a<00:02:38.020> part<00:02:38.350> of<00:02:38.440> it<00:02:38.560> also<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:39.760> know

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
that may be a part of it also you know

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.480 
that may be a part of it also you know
the<00:02:40.300> circuit<00:02:40.690> board<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:40.990> green<00:02:41.340> they<00:02:42.340> have

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
the circuit board is green they have

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.260 
the circuit board is green they have
more<00:02:42.790> components<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> back<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.730> I<00:02:45.730> mean

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
more components on the back and I mean

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.720 
more components on the back and I mean
overall<00:02:46.690> if<00:02:47.500> you<00:02:47.710> compare<00:02:48.100> this<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> my<00:02:48.520> easy

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
overall if you compare this to my easy

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.580 
overall if you compare this to my easy
cap<00:02:50.550> 140<00:02:51.550> Pro<00:02:51.970> this<00:02:52.570> might<00:02:52.900> look<00:02:53.110> actually<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
cap 140 Pro this might look actually a

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.260 
cap 140 Pro this might look actually a
little<00:02:53.800> bit<00:02:53.890> better<00:02:54.160> I'm<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.610> a<00:02:54.640> high<00:02:54.850> percent

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
little bit better I'm on a high percent

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.480 
little bit better I'm on a high percent
sure<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.990> could<00:02:56.140> judge<00:02:56.410> I<00:02:56.680> have<00:02:56.830> all<00:02:57.040> my<00:02:57.070> older

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
sure you could judge I have all my older

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.390 
sure you could judge I have all my older
video<00:02:57.820> or<00:02:58.150> older<00:02:58.660> videos<00:02:58.930> before<00:02:59.350> this<00:02:59.770> with

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
video or older videos before this with

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.860 
video or older videos before this with
my<00:03:00.660> d6<00:03:01.750> my<00:03:02.200> easy<00:03:02.440> cap<00:03:02.709> 148<00:03:03.700> pro<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.300> I'm<00:03:04.690> gonna

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
my d6 my easy cap 148 pro and I'm gonna

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.330 
my d6 my easy cap 148 pro and I'm gonna
do<00:03:05.020> a<00:03:05.050> test<00:03:05.350> for<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.650> can<00:03:05.770> see<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.130> compare

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
do a test for you can see and compare

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.810 
do a test for you can see and compare
which<00:03:07.090> one's<00:03:07.300> better<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.840> mean<00:03:08.290> if<00:03:08.860> you<00:03:09.160> if<00:03:09.550> you

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
which one's better I mean if you if you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.000 
which one's better I mean if you if you
don't<00:03:09.970> have<00:03:10.120> a<00:03:10.150> major<00:03:10.540> YouTube<00:03:11.440> channel<00:03:11.920> and
