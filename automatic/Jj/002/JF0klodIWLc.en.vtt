we always do get a shot from out here a

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.910 
we always do get a shot from out here a
little<00:04:32.060> deflection<00:04:32.750> screen<00:04:33.110> shot<00:04:33.350> on<00:04:33.380> net<00:04:33.680> and

little deflection screen shot on net and

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:56.420 
little deflection screen shot on net and
we'll<00:04:34.280> hustle<00:04:34.670> out<00:04:34.790> looks<00:04:35.540> like<00:04:35.720> this

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.080 

something<00:04:57.430> that<00:04:57.520> we're<00:04:57.640> all<00:04:57.790> really<00:04:58.000> excited

about to be able to bring to some of our

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.070 
about to be able to bring to some of our
featured<00:05:00.460> camps<00:05:00.880> and<00:05:01.030> specific<00:05:01.570> cities<00:05:01.900> is

featured camps and specific cities is
the<00:05:03.070> technology<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.000> see<00:05:04.150> behind<00:05:04.330> us

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
the technology that you see behind us

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.800 
the technology that you see behind us
here<00:05:04.800> with<00:05:05.800> this<00:05:05.950> technology<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:07.270> gives<00:05:07.480> us<00:05:07.660> an

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
here with this technology it gives us an

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.050 
here with this technology it gives us an
added<00:05:08.380> feature<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.770> not<00:05:09.040> only<00:05:09.310> competition<00:05:09.790> in

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
added feature of not only competition in

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.060 
added feature of not only competition in
each<00:05:10.210> drill<00:05:10.540> but<00:05:11.050> a<00:05:11.080> little<00:05:11.350> bit<00:05:11.470> more<00:05:11.620> fun<00:05:11.860> for

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070
