 Indians are happy in the acid test

 if the acid test fails they say that 

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:35.319
 it really remains to see what motivation is the most important 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.380
 the approval the following 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 you for money you die offers this life 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.850
 you can die because of trying to get money in a chaos to try 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.080
 of getting the money left behind has bothered 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.470
 for the intellectual part the second level 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.840

 summer they carry weapons comforsa norm then 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:10.390
 even when we said that perfection the world 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.380
 that the motivation - applied that transcendent however it is clear that 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.040
 there are no examples of sand to have life if not for the transcendent 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.380
 brain theme 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.560
 that maybe I'm going to leave to adapt the intermediate 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.990
 ensign creative spirit answer it you have in relation to how to employ 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.470
 well the motivations filis and motivation in a different we can 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 it hurts our children or not to think about it and when we return 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.259

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.259
 we will be with you brad pitt

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.239
 welcome again 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.539
 per cent we continue now with a chair 

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:50.429
 and I repeat the question 

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.589
 percent between moss have well employ the motivations 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.129
 if we motivate at a different level 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.729
 We could be hurting our children 

00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.179
 some example 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:02.019
 exactly we have to take care 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.019
 very well the motivation sometimes face the dads 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.479
 we give them material things when the boys do they behave well they do well 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:11.459
 homework 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.779
 They are obedient at home by elena of the bathroom 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:17.919
 and that motivation does not correspond because it is not of the same level 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:19.849
 so 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.339
 let's give him gifts we reward those that affectionately with kisses 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:28.739
 let's buy them what we want but because we want them because they are our 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.419
 children 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.479
 not attached to a material action 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.879
 because that is not what leads the person to grow and do more and more 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.909
 people 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.829
 I remember a copy of 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:42.379
 in the school that we have in Argentina from a family that justly 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.799
 had proposed to motivate their children in January the transcendent and had three 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.809
 small children and also wished the whole family 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:54.260
 make a calendar and write down each one's birthdays on the calendar 

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.739
 of the family members the bloodhounds the uncles the cousins 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:03.139
 then the previous week some birthdays everyone got together and 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:09.039
 cards were prepared cards a little bar the youngest and that was offered 

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.309
 there birthday the next week 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:15.859
 and the kids quiniela poceada experience the joy of giving 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.220
 the satisfaction of a job well done that does not need any reward 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.900
 because the prize is this in the same action in that satisfaction that is 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:26.919
 feel 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.370
 you do not need to add extra motivation to be na 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.520
 i mayerlin 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.909
 they say that marketing 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:38.539
 is the art of motivating how effectively 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.189
 then explain some marketing techniques 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.129
 useful to motivate our children 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:47.050
 and yes it is important to learn 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.620
 by the way sometimes people say I still do not know anything about the seller because in 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.250
 that the Panameñistas data that we are constantly selling 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.760
 of ourselves any proposal that we have then that same 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:01.389
 phrase without being clear that it is selling oranges 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.449
 sending the ministry was little of me it is clear how little you have will be for 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.449
 sell better the return back 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.300
 percent then how many we learn from some simple techniques that in 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.409
 marketing to sell our ideas better 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.150
 percent the first thing we have to do that is 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.870
 be able to be in a position to talk about being taken care of, really get the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.770
 attention of the li li that we want west propose a plan a change with a 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:27.639
 improvement 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.719
 is that we get attention because we must achieve the interest of ee 

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:36.610
 how are we going to awaken zero interest by talking about the things that you 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.059
 they can benefit 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.889
 citi city in a change of attitude for example 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:45.210
 the next step would be to convince you that we are proposing local is good 

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:50.339
 if we convince that it is good, it is that he will be better, we make him known in 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:54.639
 the advantages to the benefits that it will obtain and the disadvantages and it does not have it 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.930
 put and you're already getting excited 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.069
 the next step is already percent and you make the decision 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.180
 I want to do it 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.050
 but here we have to be very convinced that the son / even take 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.349
 the decision the time that chiba to access in exchange 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.749
 because if it is not better to wait and give him time to tell him we have already talked 

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:19.129
 of what you think of my proposal, think about it, we're still talking about it 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.869
 because if he answers us at that moment 

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:26.719
 it's a setback in which the motivation plan that we bring 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.310
 it is expected that the stash and loans can be improved a little 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:32.880
 morning or last, think about it 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.689
 what I propose is good 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.199
 percent here also per hundred 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.840
 this gives time nor cup 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.900
 think it but also to the father to see where more door and win more 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.659
 forces for motivation said 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:46.669
 very well 

00:06:46.669 --> 00:06:48.099
 done percent 

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:51.009
 we all sell the antennas 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:54.830
 what we should get and through these% and techniques that 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.820
 are you commenting is 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.639
 the disc also assumes 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.669
 what you are not saying as if it were your own 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:02.460
 and that in the end he finishes 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.460
 proposing the holders of clear ideas meant is the goal of 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.240
 of motivation 

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.330
 that is, the son 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.200
 asómate what you are proposing larraz who makes it his 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:18.589
 the one that was not constantly tried you have to say the things in which if 

00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:20.469
 you tell them you explain them 

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:22.279
 that you teach them 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.589
 and from there 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:24.669
 are yours 

00:07:24.669 --> 00:07:28.479
 we already know what he wants and then see until 1 I say from experience they know 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:30.149
 own theo five children 

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.839
 and you realize that many times

 old 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:35.449
