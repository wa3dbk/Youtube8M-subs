a well undetected mutis meters are going

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.500 
a well undetected mutis meters are going
to<00:00:29.070> be<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.250> good<00:00:29.519> against<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.269> rates

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
to be very good against the the rates

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.060 
to be very good against the the rates
meters<00:00:31.349> are<00:00:31.439> pretty<00:00:31.619> good<00:00:31.740> against<00:00:31.890> rays

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
meters are pretty good against rays

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.319 
meters are pretty good against rays
especially<00:00:32.520> if<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.640> can<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.030> scourge

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
especially if you can get some scourge

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.200 
especially if you can get some scourge
involved<00:00:33.809> as<00:00:33.930> well<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.980> there<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:36.000> so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
involved as well so there is that so

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.400 
involved as well so there is that so
he's<00:00:36.360> kind<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.660> still<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.170> he's

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
he's kind of still in it because he's

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.250 
he's kind of still in it because he's
hoping<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.920> he<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.100> come<00:00:38.309> back<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:39.260> kill

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
hoping that he can come back and kill

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.690 
hoping that he can come back and kill
off<00:00:40.379> those<00:00:40.590> rates<00:00:40.829> he's<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.610> been

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
off those rates he's really been

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.389 
off those rates he's really been
focusing<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> raids<00:00:42.719> too<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.309> not
