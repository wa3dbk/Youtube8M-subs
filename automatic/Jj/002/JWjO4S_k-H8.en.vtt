00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
so it's a lot better for us and then

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.390

once<00:02:10.810> we<00:02:10.959> pick<00:02:11.140> up<00:02:11.170> survivors<00:02:11.620> it's<00:02:12.010> obviously

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
once we pick up survivors it's obviously

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.979
