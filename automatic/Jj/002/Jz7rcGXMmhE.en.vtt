00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:41.020 
now he does something different than I

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.630 
now he does something different than I
usually<00:03:41.260> would<00:03:41.560> I<00:03:41.800> would<00:03:42.130> use<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.430> truck

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
usually would I would use the truck

and just reuse the red car over and that
works<00:03:49.600> perfectly<00:03:49.810> fine<00:03:50.200> too<00:03:51.720> either<00:03:52.720> way

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
works perfectly fine too either way

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.160 
works perfectly fine too either way
works<00:03:53.280> but<00:03:54.280> yeah<00:03:54.610> he<00:03:55.360> goes<00:03:55.570> ahead<00:03:55.690> and<00:03:55.930> goes

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
works but yeah he goes ahead and goes

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:04.940 
works but yeah he goes ahead and goes
out<00:03:56.410> this<00:03:56.650> door<00:03:56.950> right<00:03:57.400> here<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:03.420> yes<00:04:04.420> then

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
out this door right here and yes then

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.490 
out this door right here and yes then
goes<00:04:05.950> outside<00:04:06.190> visa<00:04:06.700> door<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.810> maintenance

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
goes outside visa door the maintenance

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.260 
goes outside visa door the maintenance
tunnels<00:04:08.890> fits<00:04:09.130> as<00:04:09.280> many<00:04:09.490> as<00:04:09.670> you<00:04:09.820> can<00:04:12.210> hits<00:04:13.210> a

wall<00:04:13.420> because<00:04:13.660> he's<00:04:13.780> looking<00:04:14.050> at<00:04:14.140> his

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
wall because he's looking at his

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.970 
wall because he's looking at his
computer<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.840> then<00:04:16.930> drives<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.500> the<00:04:17.530> red<00:04:17.739> car

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.190 
computer and then drives to the red car
and<00:04:18.580> gets<00:04:19.060> out<00:04:19.239> after<00:04:19.600> he<00:04:19.720> bounces<00:04:20.049> off<00:04:20.170> the

and gets out after he bounces off the

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.280 
and gets out after he bounces off the
wall<00:04:24.240> he<00:04:25.240> goes<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.540> red<00:04:25.660> car<00:04:25.870> hitting<00:04:26.170> as

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
wall he goes in the red car hitting as

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.080 
wall he goes in the red car hitting as
many<00:04:26.320> as<00:04:26.740> he<00:04:26.890> possibly<00:04:27.130> can<00:04:27.550> he<00:04:27.730> goes<00:04:27.850> back

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
many as he possibly can he goes back

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.790 
many as he possibly can he goes back
into<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.660> tunnels<00:04:32.850> go

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
into the tunnels go

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.149 
into the tunnels go
look<00:04:35.400> at<00:04:35.490> ask<00:04:35.669> computer<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.060> think<00:04:36.919> so<00:04:37.919> you<00:04:37.979> hit

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
look at ask computer I think so you hit

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.330 
look at ask computer I think so you hit
as<00:04:38.280> many<00:04:38.400> as<00:04:38.580> you<00:04:38.669> can<00:04:38.789> can<00:04:39.090> as<00:04:39.270> he<00:04:39.330> goes<00:04:39.479> in<00:04:39.690> and

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
as many as you can can as he goes in and

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.719 
as many as you can can as he goes in and
then<00:04:41.340> he<00:04:41.490> just<00:04:41.520> repeats<00:04:42.000> this<00:04:42.150> process<00:04:43.729> we

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:44.729 
then he just repeats this process we

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:46.850 
then he just repeats this process we
rinse<00:04:44.879> and<00:04:45.030> repeat<00:04:45.120> until<00:04:45.360> you<00:04:45.720> have<00:04:45.870> 53,000

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
rinse and repeat until you have 53,000

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.570 
rinse and repeat until you have 53,000
my<00:04:47.159> was<00:04:47.340> it<00:04:48.440> 593<00:04:49.440> or<00:04:49.770> something<00:04:49.979> like<00:04:50.039> that<00:04:50.129> I'm

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
my was it 593 or something like that I'm

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.180 
my was it 593 or something like that I'm
probably<00:04:51.389> wrong<00:04:51.720> but<00:04:51.949> something<00:04:52.949> like<00:04:52.979> that

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
probably wrong but something like that

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.869 
probably wrong but something like that
once<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.520> get<00:04:53.639> that<00:04:53.729> many<00:04:54.289> you<00:04:55.289> can<00:04:55.759> go<00:04:56.759> ahead

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
once you get that many you can go ahead

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.839 
once you get that many you can go ahead
