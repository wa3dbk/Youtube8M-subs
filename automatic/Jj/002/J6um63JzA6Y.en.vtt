is we take one of our cups and the X at
the<00:02:01.750> bottom<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:03.040> we<00:02:03.159> just<00:02:03.400> push<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.270> light

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the bottom and we just push the light

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.130 
the bottom and we just push the light
right<00:02:05.890> through<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.820> bottom<00:02:07.270> and<00:02:07.450> then<00:02:07.990> give

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
right through the bottom and then give

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.619 
right through the bottom and then give
it<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.289> tug<00:02:08.530> back<00:02:08.909> so<00:02:09.909> that<00:02:10.060> it<00:02:10.179> doesn't<00:02:10.479> come

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
it a tug back so that it doesn't come

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.960 
it a tug back so that it doesn't come
back<00:02:10.840> through<00:02:11.319> we<00:02:11.980> ran<00:02:12.250> out<00:02:12.519> of<00:02:12.549> white<00:02:13.360> light

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
back through we ran out of white light

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.520 
back through we ran out of white light
so<00:02:15.970> we<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.299> to<00:02:16.480> use<00:02:16.599> color<00:02:16.900> ones<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.409> it's

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
so we have to use color ones and it's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.210 
so we have to use color ones and it's
driving<00:02:18.069> me<00:02:18.220> bonkers<00:02:18.610> because<00:02:19.379> if<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.769> keep<00:02:21.010> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
driving me bonkers because if I keep the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.089 
driving me bonkers because if I keep the
cup<00:02:21.430> colors<00:02:21.909> in<00:02:22.239> order<00:02:22.659> they<00:02:23.650> don't<00:02:23.860> match<00:02:24.069> up

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
cup colors in order they don't match up

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.820 
cup colors in order they don't match up
with<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.670> colored<00:02:25.000> light<00:02:25.239> but<00:02:26.200> I<00:02:26.230> guess<00:02:26.620> my

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
with the colored light but I guess my

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.009 
with the colored light but I guess my
OCD<00:02:27.280> is<00:02:27.459> showing<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.269> we'll<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:28.659> have<00:02:28.870> to

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
OCD is showing and we'll just have to
