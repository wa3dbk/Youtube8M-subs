00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
I'm optimally eating you know not the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
I'm optimally eating you know not the
best<00:01:50.159> stuff<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.210> often<00:01:52.140> high<00:01:52.590> protein<00:01:53.040> I

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
best stuff but it's often high protein I

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
best stuff but it's often high protein I
eat<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.369> lot<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:54.000> lot<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.420> meat<00:01:54.720> doesn't<00:01:55.470> mean

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
eat a lot of lot of meat doesn't mean

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.950

still<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.290> lot<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.500> protein<00:01:58.950> that's<00:01:59.189> what<00:01:59.399> helps

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
still a lot of protein that's what helps

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.050 
still a lot of protein that's what helps
a<00:01:59.939> lot<00:02:00.090> for<00:02:00.630> me<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> gain<00:02:01.079> weight<00:02:01.469> and<00:02:01.880> as<00:02:02.880> well

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
a lot for me to gain weight and as well

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.430 
a lot for me to gain weight and as well
as<00:02:03.090> training

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
as training

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.050 
as training
I<00:02:04.500> never<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.580> same<00:02:06.830> routine<00:02:07.830> I'm<00:02:08.790> always

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
I never have the same routine I'm always

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500 
I never have the same routine I'm always
switching<00:02:09.690> it<00:02:09.930> up<00:02:10.050> you<00:02:10.680> know<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:11.880> isolation

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
switching it up you know with isolation

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.250 
switching it up you know with isolation
movements<00:02:12.870> with<00:02:13.350> compound<00:02:13.920> movements<00:02:15.260> with

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
movements with compound movements with

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.670 
movements with compound movements with
time<00:02:16.590> in<00:02:16.890> there<00:02:17.100> which<00:02:17.340> sets<00:02:18.410> but<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:19.560> just

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
time in there which sets but I'm just

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.140 
time in there which sets but I'm just
going<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.890> tell<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> average<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.970> what<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
going to tell you the average of what I

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.130 
going to tell you the average of what I
do<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.750> try<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.130> anywhere<00:02:23.580> from<00:02:23.970> 20<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.630> 30

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
do I try to get anywhere from 20 to 30

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.610 
do I try to get anywhere from 20 to 30
sets<00:02:25.440> per<00:02:25.770> muscle<00:02:26.040> group<00:02:26.520> as<00:02:26.960> well<00:02:27.960> as<00:02:28.350> getting

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
sets per muscle group as well as getting

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.000 
sets per muscle group as well as getting
you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.070> five<00:02:29.730> about<00:02:30.630> five<00:02:30.930> sets<00:02:31.290> of<00:02:31.530> really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
you know five about five sets of really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.130 
you know five about five sets of really
heavy<00:02:32.310> weight<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.240> know<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.600> three<00:02:33.900> four

heavy weight you know like three four

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190 
heavy weight you know like three four
reps<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.770> each<00:02:35.550> of<00:02:36.060> those<00:02:36.240> muscle<00:02:36.750> groups<00:02:36.780> so

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
reps of each of those muscle groups so

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.500 
reps of each of those muscle groups so
say<00:02:37.380> I'm<00:02:37.500> training<00:02:37.920> chest<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:39.210> know<00:02:39.270> I'm

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
of that muscle because you're doing you

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.330 
of that muscle because you're doing you
know<00:03:02.270> different<00:03:03.270> rep<00:03:03.780> ranges<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.650> you're

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
know different rep ranges and you're

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
know different rep ranges and you're
putting<00:03:05.550> more<00:03:05.820> attention<00:03:06.240> on<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> muscle

which in the long run you're getting all

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.360 
which in the long run you're getting all
the<00:03:10.050> different<00:03:10.380> types<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.680> training<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.160> one

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the different types of training in one

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.510 
the different types of training in one
if<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:12.150> just<00:03:12.360> do<00:03:12.510> different<00:03:12.959> rep<00:03:13.230> ranges<00:03:13.680> have

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
if you just do different rep ranges have

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.210 
if you just do different rep ranges have
ranges<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.300> mean<00:03:15.510> different<00:03:16.320> reps<00:03:16.620> higher

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
ranges I mean different reps higher

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.070 
ranges I mean different reps higher
weight<00:03:17.550> different<00:03:18.060> way<00:03:18.180> stuff<00:03:18.870> like<00:03:19.020> that

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
weight different way stuff like that

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.050 
weight different way stuff like that
it's<00:03:19.440> just<00:03:19.709> really<00:03:19.950> mixed<00:03:20.459> in<00:03:20.550> and<00:03:20.670> up<00:03:20.820> and

it's just really mixed in and up and

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.729 
it's just really mixed in and up and
confusing<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.810> muscles<00:03:22.200> what's<00:03:22.470> going<00:03:22.680> to

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
confusing the muscles what's going to

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.790 
confusing the muscles what's going to
make<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.040> grow<00:03:23.630> I've<00:03:24.630> noticed<00:03:25.080> doing<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.560> same

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
make it grow I've noticed doing the same

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.000 
make it grow I've noticed doing the same
bicep<00:03:26.760> routine<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.989> I<00:03:28.080> would<00:03:28.290> get<00:03:28.500> sore<00:03:28.739> as

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
bicep routine that I would get sore as

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.449 
bicep routine that I would get sore as
well<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.150> triceps<00:03:30.690> it's<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.260> mixing<00:03:32.250> it<00:03:32.310> up

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
well as triceps it's just mixing it up

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.229 
well as triceps it's just mixing it up
you'll<00:03:33.360> notice<00:03:33.680> that<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:35.370> does<00:03:35.519> help<00:03:35.760> mixing

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
you'll notice that it does help mixing

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.620 
you'll notice that it does help mixing
it<00:03:36.330> up<00:03:36.450> really<00:03:36.720> does<00:03:36.989> help<00:03:37.730> um<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.209> yeah<00:03:39.390> the
