game<00:01:33.840> they<00:01:34.049> kind<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> thing<00:01:34.979> they

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
game they kind of do a thing they

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
game they kind of do a thing they
introduce<00:01:35.909> new<00:01:36.180> systems<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.140> feel<00:01:37.380> like

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
introduce new systems but I feel like

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.980 
introduce new systems but I feel like
it's<00:01:37.740> gotten<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.390> like<00:01:39.390> everyone's<00:01:39.780> gotten

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it's gotten to like everyone's gotten

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
it's gotten to like everyone's gotten
used<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.380> system<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> pic<00:01:41.220> tensest

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
used to this system of the pic tensest

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.760 
used to this system of the pic tensest
and<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.850> feel<00:01:42.119> like<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.450> kind<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.810> innovation

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
and I feel like it's kind of innovation

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
and I feel like it's kind of innovation
instead<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.579> kind<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.939> change<00:01:45.270> so<00:01:45.659> everyone

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
instead of kind of a change so everyone

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.420 
instead of kind of a change so everyone
kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.380> sees<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.710> as<00:01:46.829> an<00:01:46.950> improvement<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
kind of sees that as an improvement to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.010 
kind of sees that as an improvement to
the<00:01:47.640> best<00:01:47.909> I'll<00:01:48.090> rather<00:01:48.390> than<00:01:48.509> just<00:01:48.689> something

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the best I'll rather than just something

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.810 
the best I'll rather than just something
different<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.310> would<00:01:50.430> seem<00:01:50.549> kind<00:01:50.790> of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
different and it would seem kind of

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.850 
different and it would seem kind of
weird<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.270> go<00:01:51.509> back<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> normal<00:01:52.470> kind<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
weird to go back to the normal kind of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.609 
weird to go back to the normal kind of
old<00:01:53.159> create<00:01:53.579> class<00:01:53.790> system<00:01:54.210> of<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.960> easily

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.740 
weapon so I really do like the Creator
class<00:02:16.830> system<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.850> has<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.630> of

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
class system I think it has some kind of

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.290 
class system I think it has some kind of
problems<00:02:19.320> how<00:02:19.620> am<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.250> don't<00:02:20.970> think<00:02:21.180> it's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
problems how am I don't think it's

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.570 
problems how am I don't think it's
really<00:02:22.200> make<00:02:22.320> sense<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.740> be<00:02:22.830> honest<00:02:23.070> how

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
really make sense to be honest how

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.340 
really make sense to be honest how
something<00:02:24.030> like<00:02:24.120> an<00:02:24.300> assault<00:02:24.570> rifle<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:25.200> be

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
something like an assault rifle can be

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.560 
something like an assault rifle can be
equal<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:26.070> like<00:02:26.250> a<00:02:26.280> flash<00:02:26.700> bang<00:02:26.730> or<00:02:27.150> something

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
equal to like a flash bang or something

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.270 
equal to like a flash bang or something
and<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.320> they're<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.250> same

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
and I think they're really the same

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.310 
and I think they're really the same
thing<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.030> they're<00:02:30.630> nevertheless<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.170> pic

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
thing but they're nevertheless the pic

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.050 
thing but they're nevertheless the pic

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
didn't want anything like that so they

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.100 
didn't want anything like that so they
went<00:03:47.579> back<00:03:47.700> to<00:03:47.850> their<00:03:48.000> old<00:03:48.269> original<00:03:48.570> version

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.770 
used to I wonder if coogi ghost will
completely<00:03:59.730> ignore<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.269> go<00:04:00.420> back<00:04:00.600> to<00:04:00.750> a

completely ignore it and go back to a

different system maybe they'll change

different system maybe they'll change
the<00:04:02.970> system<00:04:03.299> altogether<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.049> have<00:04:04.200> their<00:04:04.380> own

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
the system altogether and have their own

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.530 
the system altogether and have their own
spin<00:04:04.829> on<00:04:04.860> things<00:04:05.220> because<00:04:05.549> we<00:04:05.880> have<00:04:06.060> seen<00:04:06.299> some

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
spin on things because we have seen some

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.539 
spin on things because we have seen some
slight<00:04:06.780> leaks<00:04:07.140> of<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.680> master<00:04:08.160> plan<00:04:08.220> menus

slight leaks of the master plan menus
and<00:04:08.959> or<00:04:09.959> maybe<00:04:10.290> they<00:04:10.709> will<00:04:10.890> actually<00:04:11.100> use<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
and or maybe they will actually use the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
pick 10 system because as I say it's a

pick 10 system because as I say it's a

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
there and simply because ease and having

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.590 
there and simply because ease and having
to<00:04:48.220> go<00:04:48.430> through<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.760> unlock<00:04:49.060> everything<00:04:49.300> over

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600

over<00:04:49.780> again<00:04:49.870> but<00:04:50.530> it<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.770> really<00:04:51.220> feel<00:04:51.460> that<00:04:51.490> Cod

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
over again but it I really feel that Cod

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.790 
over again but it I really feel that Cod
needs<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.660> step<00:04:52.840> up<00:04:52.900> their<00:04:53.170> game<00:04:53.200> and<00:04:53.710> they

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
needs to step up their game and they

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.470 
needs to step up their game and they
need<00:04:53.950> to<00:04:54.100> really<00:04:54.670> really<00:04:54.910> give<00:04:55.150> some<00:04:55.300> good

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
need to really really give some good

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.720 
need to really really give some good
rewards<00:04:56.050> for<00:04:56.440> prestiging<00:04:57.010> I<00:04:57.100> normally<00:04:57.550> always

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
rewards for prestiging I normally always

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.990 
rewards for prestiging I normally always
go<00:04:58.120> like<00:04:58.840> 10<00:04:59.050> 15<00:04:59.260> 15<00:04:59.860> 20th<00:05:00.370> whatever<00:05:00.670> the<00:05:00.850> max

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
go like 10 15 15 20th whatever the max

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.510 
go like 10 15 15 20th whatever the max
prestiges<00:05:01.630> in<00:05:01.780> every<00:05:02.380> cod<00:05:02.650> and<00:05:02.920> I'll<00:05:03.280> do<00:05:03.430> that

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
prestiges in every cod and I'll do that

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.920 
prestiges in every cod and I'll do that
simply<00:05:03.850> because<00:05:04.000> it's<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.270> bit<00:05:04.390> boring<00:05:04.420> just

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
simply because it's a bit boring just

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.960 
simply because it's a bit boring just
staying<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:05.440> not<00:05:05.560> unlocking<00:05:06.010> things<00:05:06.250> but<00:05:06.940> it

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
staying and not unlocking things but it

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.000 
staying and not unlocking things but it
would<00:05:07.630> be<00:05:07.660> nice<00:05:07.900> to<00:05:08.050> see<00:05:08.170> something<00:05:08.380> rewarded

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
would be nice to see something rewarded

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.100 
would be nice to see something rewarded
