00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
days today and couldn't make it 200 but

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.050 
days today and couldn't make it 200 but
disappointing<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.890> thought<00:00:23.610> I<00:00:23.670> bought<00:00:23.939> it

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
disappointing but I thought I bought it

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.150 
disappointing but I thought I bought it
well<00:00:24.240> understood<00:00:25.200> nos<00:00:25.560> going<00:00:25.800> against<00:00:26.040> the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
well understood nos going against the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.190 
well understood nos going against the
number<00:00:26.340> one<00:00:26.369> team<00:00:26.520> on<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.570> attack<00:00:27.840> they<00:00:28.020> have

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
number one team on the attack they have

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.019 
number one team on the attack they have
and<00:00:28.500> considering<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> wicked<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.789> wicked

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
and considering the wicked the wicked

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.960 
and considering the wicked the wicked
was<00:00:30.180> not<00:00:30.360> a<00:00:30.900> flat<00:00:31.500> bag<00:00:31.770> so<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.099> was<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> two<00:00:32.730> page

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
was not a flat bag so it was a two page

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.030 
was not a flat bag so it was a two page
slow<00:00:33.180> wicked<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.900> very<00:00:34.080> difficult<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
slow wicked so it is very difficult to

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.460 
slow wicked so it is very difficult to
score<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.580> so<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:35.850> thought<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.720> that<00:00:37.080> it<00:00:37.320> but

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:37.470 
score and so I thought that that it but

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.810 
score and so I thought that that it but
I<00:00:39.140> thought<00:00:40.140> before<00:00:40.860> coming<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.430> store<00:00:41.790> I

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
I thought before coming to this store I

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.580 
I thought before coming to this store I
was<00:00:42.150> seeing<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.690> videos<00:00:43.019> as<00:00:43.170> I<00:00:43.320> told<00:00:43.470> before

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
reversed thing always been going in the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.349 
reversed thing always been going in the
morning<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.729> wanted<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.090> play<00:01:27.329> a

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
morning so we just wanted to play a

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.660 
morning so we just wanted to play a
little<00:01:27.509> bit<00:01:27.750> carefully<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.740> unfortunately

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
little bit carefully but unfortunately

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.219 
little bit carefully but unfortunately
we<00:01:29.729> couldn't

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.040 

you<00:01:32.710> know<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:34.090> thought<00:01:35.080> this<00:01:35.409> match<00:01:35.680> was<00:01:35.979> like

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
you know I thought this match was like

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.420 
you know I thought this match was like
particularly<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.380> batsman<00:01:38.740> who<00:01:38.830> is<00:01:38.920> good<00:01:39.159> and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
particularly the batsman who is good and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.730 
particularly the batsman who is good and
should<00:01:39.909> have<00:01:40.060> made<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.510> bigger<00:01:40.840> because<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
should have made it bigger because the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:42.960 
should have made it bigger because the
wicket<00:01:41.979> is<00:01:42.070> not<00:01:42.190> that<00:01:42.340> easy<00:01:42.550> for<00:01:42.670> the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
wicket is not that easy for the

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:44.910 
wicket is not that easy for the
newcomers<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.479> come<00:01:43.780> and<00:01:43.930> score<00:01:44.170> with<00:01:44.740> Dale

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
newcomers to come and score with Dale

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.980 
newcomers to come and score with Dale
Steyn<00:01:45.130> bowling<00:01:45.430> in<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.700> way<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:46.600> fashion

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
Steyn bowling in that way that fashion

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.510 
Steyn bowling in that way that fashion
so<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.500> thought<00:01:47.770> we<00:01:48.310> did<00:01:48.460> well<00:01:48.490> to<00:01:48.880> get<00:01:49.000> 3<00:01:49.210> 334

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
so I thought we did well to get 3 334

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.649 
so I thought we did well to get 3 334
hopefully<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.729> now<00:01:51.910> pull<00:01:52.300> it<00:01:52.360> up

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.210 

obviously<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:55.720> was<00:01:55.840> shocking<00:01:56.200> because<00:01:56.290> you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
obviously it was shocking because you

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.070 
obviously it was shocking because you
know<00:01:57.340> in<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.210> span<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.420> three<00:01:58.690> months<00:01:58.720> like

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
know in the span of three months like

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.080 
know in the span of three months like
two<00:01:59.229> legends<00:01:59.560> have<00:01:59.710> been<00:01:59.740> now<00:02:00.070> retired<00:02:00.820> from

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
two legends have been now retired from

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.899 
two legends have been now retired from
from<00:02:01.600> this<00:02:01.780> sport<00:02:02.020> so<00:02:02.350> jock<00:02:03.159> has<00:02:03.369> obviously

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
from this sport so jock has obviously

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.969 
from this sport so jock has obviously
