00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 hi to all the oil here today 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:13.469
 company of the enemy of dami 0 1 vi 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.740
 I want to show this trick for nss 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.880
 to have abbot starbucks as you see me 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 now I have 5,000 starbucks started the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.140
 career 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.390
 today ten years ago 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:34.250
 in practice the trick consists we go into 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:38.280
 life casino horse racing and we find 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 horses we focus on a typical house 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.050
 jolly bristow and then we remember who 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.090
 wins 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.739
 guys I've done this already and already 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.629
 I already know I will win minds boy but now I 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 I want to show you how it works then 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:01:00.480
 puts it well done and now we will focus on strength 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.039
 trust that the one who wins will throw away 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.619
 always on one by one at random vi 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.619
 always remember trust three times 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 the first time however the trick does not 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.090
 that is, the first series of three works 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.710
 when the game started it doesn't work 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:29.009
 so then just make it gloomy and win 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:32.189
 play write 3 when you do the first three e 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.560
 the trick is to exit the game 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 and so when you come back you will always have 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.479
 that is the same horses will repeat themselves 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:46.770
 in the series of three a tip this 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.619
 trick works only for android and like 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.070
 I said before the first series of three non 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.259
 so you have to do the first series 3 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.899
 exit the game re-enter do the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:02.909
 that series of three other series e 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:07.290
 remember who wins so exits e 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:10.200
 bet the 50 ie those who live on 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.290
 winner on the three winners 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.129
 and so you will get lots of 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:23.750
 of starbucks me in monia 5,252 but on a 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:28.340
 other to understand all the goods and resources 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:36.000
 then I will now cut the application 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:38.010
 we enter and do things like viruses 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.950
 for the phone game type thriller 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:46.730
 those things there a sure trick comes out 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.970
 always mess 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.940
 as you can see put me on point 50 because 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.910
 already only wins and obviously 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.860
 they will win this again until when 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.239
 you want you can buy a lot of 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.430
 cans to improve portability e 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:08.670
 and do all the workouts for 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:13.560
