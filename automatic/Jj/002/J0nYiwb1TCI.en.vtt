things<00:02:27.880> have<00:02:28.060> changed<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.510> lot<00:02:28.720> around<00:02:28.989> this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
things have changed a lot around this

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:35.699 
things have changed a lot around this
area<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:33.060> lifetime<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.420> build<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.620> only

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
area a lifetime to build but it only

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.759 
area a lifetime to build but it only
takes<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.130> moment<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.550> destroy<00:02:37.000> you<00:02:37.750> know<00:02:37.930> human

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
takes a moment to destroy you know human

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.620 
takes a moment to destroy you know human
beings<00:02:39.040> really<00:02:39.220> are<00:02:39.430> masters<00:02:39.970> of<00:02:40.000> destruction

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
beings really are masters of destruction

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.030 
beings really are masters of destruction
everything<00:02:43.630> we<00:02:43.750> do<00:02:43.959> has<00:02:44.200> some<00:02:44.410> effect<00:02:44.769> on<00:02:44.890> the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
everything we do has some effect on the

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.430 
everything we do has some effect on the
environment<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:48.269> ultimately<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.600> ends<00:02:50.380> up

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
environment and ultimately that ends up

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.170 
environment and ultimately that ends up
affecting<00:02:50.590> human<00:02:51.310> society<00:02:51.940> as<00:02:52.060> well

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.949 

that's<00:02:57.140> very<00:02:57.290> true<00:03:01.150> there<00:03:02.150> should<00:03:02.420> be<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.599> small

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
that's very true there should be a small

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.229 
that's very true there should be a small
in<00:03:03.140> past<00:03:03.469> this<00:03:03.680> swamp<00:03:04.010> but<00:03:04.549> once<00:03:04.730> we<00:03:04.909> make<00:03:05.090> it

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
in past this swamp but once we make it

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.179 
in past this swamp but once we make it
there<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.989> rest<00:03:06.230> of<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.439> way<00:03:06.590> shouldn't<00:03:07.040> be<00:03:07.159> a

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:07.189 
there the rest of the way shouldn't be a

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:11.530 
there the rest of the way shouldn't be a
problem<00:03:09.700> we'll<00:03:10.700> need<00:03:10.939> to<00:03:11.090> be<00:03:11.209> up<00:03:11.329> early

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
problem we'll need to be up early

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.750 
problem we'll need to be up early
tomorrow
