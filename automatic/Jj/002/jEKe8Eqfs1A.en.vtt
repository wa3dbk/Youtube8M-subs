to go all the way back down to make way

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.430 
to go all the way back down to make way
so<00:00:50.250> he<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.760> end<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.120> being<00:00:51.600> transported<00:00:52.110> back

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so he can end up being transported back

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
so he can end up being transported back
to<00:00:52.500> earth<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.760> fast<00:00:54.390> forward<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.690> little<00:00:54.809> bit

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
to earth so fast forward a little bit

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.979 
to earth so fast forward a little bit
too<00:00:55.379> yeah<00:00:56.250> Jack<00:00:56.579> those<00:00:56.760> above<00:00:56.969> those<00:00:57.180> fast

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
too yeah Jack those above those fast

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.889 
too yeah Jack those above those fast
forward<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.300> go<00:01:00.300> cruise<00:01:00.480> arrival

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
forward all the way to go cruise arrival

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
forward all the way to go cruise arrival
on<00:01:01.050> earth<00:01:01.079> after<00:01:01.770> defeating<00:01:02.070> frieza<00:01:02.430> in

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
on earth after defeating frieza in

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.719 
on earth after defeating frieza in
napping<00:01:03.210> namak<00:01:03.690> blew<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:04.019> okay<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.619> he<00:01:05.519> talks

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
napping namak blew up okay so he talks

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.940 
napping namak blew up okay so he talks
about<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.299> instant<00:01:06.750> transmission<00:01:07.110> he<00:01:07.740> talks

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
about the instant transmission he talks

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.170 
about the instant transmission he talks
about<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> technique<00:01:08.460> he<00:01:08.610> learned<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:08.909> yard

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
about the technique he learned on yard

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.260 
about the technique he learned on yard
tread<00:01:09.450> upon<00:01:10.100> namak<00:01:11.100> blowing<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.729> he<00:01:12.090> learned

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
tread upon namak blowing up he learned

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
tread upon namak blowing up he learned
this<00:01:12.390> technique<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.930> he<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.080> able<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.320> create

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this technique and he was able to create

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.310 
this technique and he was able to create
like<00:01:13.920> travel<00:01:14.880> great<00:01:15.390> distances<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.930> light

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
like travel great distances like light

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
like travel great distances like light
speed<00:01:16.619> ascent<00:01:16.770> beyond<00:01:17.159> light<00:01:17.490> speed<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
speed ascent beyond light speed as it

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.210 
speed ascent beyond light speed as it
were<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:19.170> concern<00:01:19.590> that<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
were the concern that I have with this

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.890 
were the concern that I have with this
is<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.610> later<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.850> King<00:01:21.240> Kai<00:01:21.390> says<00:01:21.659> oh

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
is because later on King Kai says oh

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.539 
is because later on King Kai says oh
yeah<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.590> instant<00:01:22.860> transmission<00:01:23.100> that's<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
yeah the instant transmission that's a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.679 
yeah the instant transmission that's a
handy<00:01:23.759> little<00:01:23.790> technique<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.420> could<00:01:24.600> have

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
handy little technique I could have

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
handy little technique I could have
taught<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:25.049> Goku<00:01:25.500> but<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> didn't<00:01:26.070> ask

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
taught you that Goku but you didn't ask

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.160 
taught you that Goku but you didn't ask
well<00:01:26.580> poor<00:01:27.270> she's<00:01:27.420> not<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:27.750> ask<00:01:27.869> he

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
well poor she's not going to ask he

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
well poor she's not going to ask he
doesn't<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:29.070> know<00:01:29.189> exactly<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.420> is

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
doesn't know you know exactly what it is

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
doesn't know you know exactly what it is
that<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:31.020> needs<00:01:31.229> to<00:01:31.290> ask<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.710> terms<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:32.040> like

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that he needs to ask in terms of like

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.740 
that he needs to ask in terms of like
hey<00:01:32.340> do<00:01:32.400> you<00:01:32.549> know<00:01:32.700> any<00:01:32.880> techniques<00:01:33.000> i<00:01:33.420> can<00:01:33.570> get

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
hey do you know any techniques i can get

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.569 
hey do you know any techniques i can get
me<00:01:33.869> from<00:01:34.140> one<00:01:34.650> point<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> another<00:01:35.040> across<00:01:35.369> the
