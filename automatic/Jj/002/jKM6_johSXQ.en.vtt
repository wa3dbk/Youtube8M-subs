00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:09.380
 both children pay attention to all 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.679
 together we go from station where where 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.610
 taught please to guess mystery 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.880
 diviner 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:22.520
 I know I get bored you can not see the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.220
 moon but on one side maybe we can 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.990
 see the sky is cloudy and Martians 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.990
 aliens and the fliers 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.040
 you will love this episode the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:43.200
 situation and amazing inclusion of salma 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 in the observatory in the eclipses and 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.059
 from these monitors connected to 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.269
 telescope children can be observed 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.170
 astronomical phenomena such as for example 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.170
 the eclipses 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.030
 I teach you can look through the telescope 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.720
 do not samba that telescope is 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.800
 exclusively for scientific use 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:12.229
 good kids here the tour ends 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.229
 follow me all together do not double one 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.069
 ah 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.930
 r 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.960
 I expected 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.940
 that I always take in the missions more 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.560
 easy monkeys and dogs are 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.360
 much braver at the time of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.910
 face the unknown 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.720
 by chance tighten the red button 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.720
 of the telescope 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.239
 let's see a negative eclipse I'm a 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.260
 astronaut monkey I'm not a day of sightseeing 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.260
 spatial child 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.840
 damn 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.840
 I'm so weak 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.900
 the moment in which a celestial body 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.090
 blocks the light allows another body 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.550
 celestial and if the bodies are from another 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 Celestial color means object of origin 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.720
 natural space or planet or satellite 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.880
 the sun or comet and so on when one is 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.020
 for the light emitted by the other that is 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.550
 called eclipse ready let's go back and 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:07.210
 I get it 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.310
 let's open one the planets rotate 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.460
 on its same axis as if they were a 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.920
 spinning and at the same time the planets 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.390
 of the solar system revolve around the 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:24.130
 sun these movements are called rotation 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.680
 and translation well sometimes in between 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.130
 movement happens that light is blocked 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.860
 between them for a few moments 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.580
 that is called the eclipse for example 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.580
 now 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.280
 the earth shades the moon 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.880
 this is a total lunar eclipse makes you 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.030
 shadow to the moon and the eclipse of the sun 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.940
 How is it 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.360
 the solar eclipse when the moon 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.620
 interpose between the sun and the earth and 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.620
 the sun darkened 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:06.340
 now it's as if the moon made him 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.159
 shadow to the earth like this is affirmative 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.620
 little by little you are evolving 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:14.709
 maybe one day I'll be cute and such 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.690
 After about eight million years can 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:21.639
 convert from astronaut little friend 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:26.010
 what do you think if we are going to know the 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:26.010
 most fabulous planet in the solar system 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.289
 and that we can not repeat 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.919
 someone has to put limits to 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:43.919
 these children 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.960
 Y
