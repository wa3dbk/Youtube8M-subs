today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.690 
today I'm going to show you how to
revive<00:00:04.950> an<00:00:05.310> old<00:00:06.470> 700<00:00:07.470> milliamp<00:00:08.150> NiCad<00:00:09.150> battery

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
revive an old 700 milliamp NiCad battery

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.970 
revive an old 700 milliamp NiCad battery
first<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:11.969> we're<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.330> do<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.860> put<00:00:13.860> it

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
first what we're going to do is put it

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:26.380 
first what we're going to do is put it
in<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.160> charger<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.599> what<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.870> does

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.670 

and<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.480> can<00:00:27.660> see<00:00:27.930> doesn't<00:00:28.859> want<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.279> charge

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
and you can see doesn't want to charge

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:45.189 
and you can see doesn't want to charge
let's<00:00:31.680> try<00:00:31.949> once<00:00:32.189> more

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.849 

there<00:00:45.890> we<00:00:46.010> can<00:00:46.190> see<00:00:46.399> it<00:00:46.760> splashing<00:00:47.859> the

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
there we can see it splashing the

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:52.660 
there we can see it splashing the
charger<00:00:49.309> will<00:00:49.460> not<00:00:49.579> accept<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:50.510> battery<00:00:51.670> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
charger will not accept the battery the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.660 
charger will not accept the battery the
batteries<00:00:53.379> beating<00:00:54.379> an<00:00:54.500> appliance<00:00:54.859> for<00:00:55.640> a

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
batteries beating an appliance for a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.450 
batteries beating an appliance for a
very<00:00:55.879> long<00:00:56.089> time<00:00:57.129> now<00:00:58.159> to<00:00:58.519> read<00:01:00.460> father's

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
very long time now to read father's

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.139 
very long time now to read father's
battery<00:01:03.220> we're<00:01:04.220> going<00:01:04.399> to<00:01:04.519> just<00:01:04.699> give<00:01:04.879> it<00:01:04.909> a

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
battery we're going to just give it a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.550 
battery we're going to just give it a
little<00:01:05.509> boost<00:01:07.720> next<00:01:08.720> we<00:01:08.810> take<00:01:08.960> our<00:01:09.170> battery

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
little boost next we take our battery

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.690 
little boost next we take our battery
and<00:01:10.039> we<00:01:10.220> insert<00:01:10.490> it<00:01:10.640> into<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.030> holder<00:01:11.210> now

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.820 

that<00:01:16.700> our<00:01:16.850> batteries<00:01:17.179> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.450> holder<00:01:17.830> we're

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that our batteries in the holder we're

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.260 
that our batteries in the holder we're
going<00:01:19.009> to<00:01:19.159> connect<00:01:19.490> it<00:01:19.610> to<00:01:19.729> our<00:01:19.759> variable

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to connect it to our variable

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.639 
going to connect it to our variable
power<00:01:20.450> supply<00:01:22.240> but<00:01:23.240> yeah<00:01:23.659> I<00:01:23.690> have<00:01:23.990> my<00:01:24.170> variable

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
power supply but yeah I have my variable

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.260 
power supply but yeah I have my variable
power<00:01:24.830> supply<00:01:25.420> homemade<00:01:26.890> you<00:01:27.890> can<00:01:28.069> pull<00:01:28.310> 24

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
power supply homemade you can pull 24

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.340 
power supply homemade you can pull 24
amps<00:01:29.600> at<00:01:30.110> 24<00:01:30.649> volts<00:01:31.039> about<00:01:31.759> 3<00:01:32.030> amps<00:01:32.330> so<00:01:33.229> what

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
amps at 24 volts about 3 amps so what

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.580 
amps at 24 volts about 3 amps so what
I'm<00:01:33.409> going<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:33.709> do<00:01:33.920> to<00:01:34.610> set<00:01:34.819> it<00:01:34.970> to<00:01:35.179> 3<00:01:35.560> volts

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.730 

as<00:01:43.460> you<00:01:43.579> can<00:01:43.759> see<00:01:44.000> it's<00:01:44.960> been<00:01:45.109> say<00:01:45.320> two<00:01:45.380> three

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
as you can see it's been say two three

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.389 
as you can see it's been say two three
volts<00:01:46.750> now<00:01:47.750> three<00:01:47.960> volts<00:01:48.350> is<00:01:49.009> a<00:01:49.070> little<00:01:49.310> bit

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
volts now three volts is a little bit

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.779 
volts now three volts is a little bit
more<00:01:49.579> than<00:01:50.090> a<00:01:50.210> 1.2<00:01:50.719> volt<00:01:51.140> battery<00:01:51.560> but<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.640> is

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
more than a 1.2 volt battery but this is

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.039 
more than a 1.2 volt battery but this is
how<00:01:52.909> we<00:01:52.939> revive<00:01:53.420> an<00:01:53.899> old<00:01:54.380> NiCad<00:01:54.859> battery<00:01:56.049> we

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
how we revive an old NiCad battery we

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.429 
how we revive an old NiCad battery we
then<00:01:57.200> take<00:01:57.409> our<00:01:57.560> battery<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:59.020> we<00:02:00.020> connect<00:02:00.319> it

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:00.439 
then take our battery and we connect it

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:33.250 
then take our battery and we connect it
to<00:02:00.590> our<00:02:00.709> power<00:02:00.920> supply

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.089 

and<00:02:33.830> as<00:02:33.920> we<00:02:34.069> can<00:02:34.250> hear<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:35.180> fan

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.089 

on<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:39.269> variable<00:02:39.659> power<00:02:39.810> supply<00:02:39.870> has<00:02:40.590> slowed

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
on the variable power supply has slowed

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.559 
on the variable power supply has slowed
down<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.810> means<00:02:43.079> is<00:02:43.650> pulling<00:02:44.609> maximum

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
down that means is pulling maximum

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.039 
down that means is pulling maximum
voltage<00:02:46.370> maximum<00:02:47.370> amperage<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.870> possibly

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
voltage maximum amperage as it possibly

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.020 
voltage maximum amperage as it possibly
can<00:02:49.500> through<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.370> battery<00:02:52.250> now<00:02:53.250> all<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.790> have

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
can through the battery now all I have

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.050 
can through the battery now all I have
to<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.329> is<00:02:54.989> leave<00:02:55.260> our<00:02:55.439> battery<00:02:55.799> for<00:02:56.609> about<00:02:56.819> two

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
to do is leave our battery for about two

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.420 
to do is leave our battery for about two
hours<00:02:58.849> with<00:02:59.849> an<00:02:59.970> over<00:03:00.599> voltage<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:02.159> huge

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
hours with an over voltage and a huge

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.550 
hours with an over voltage and a huge
amount<00:03:02.549> of<00:03:02.760> amperage<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.959> battery<00:03:04.319> should

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
amount of amperage the battery should

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.990 
amount of amperage the battery should
get<00:03:05.459> warm<00:03:05.790> or<00:03:06.450> at<00:03:06.540> least<00:03:06.750> pretty<00:03:07.349> hot<00:03:08.000> two

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
get warm or at least pretty hot two

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.099 
get warm or at least pretty hot two
hours<00:03:09.359> would<00:03:09.989> be<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.290> best<00:03:10.500> thing<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.989> be

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
hours would be the best thing just be

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:18.530 
hours would be the best thing just be
careful<00:03:16.530> when<00:03:16.980> doing<00:03:17.220> this<00:03:17.519> leaving<00:03:18.480> your

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
careful when doing this leaving your

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.710 
careful when doing this leaving your
battery<00:03:18.900> and<00:03:19.379> this<00:03:20.340> kind<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.669> amperage<00:03:21.060> with

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
battery and this kind of amperage with

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.690 
battery and this kind of amperage with
this<00:03:21.840> kind<00:03:22.049> of<00:03:22.109> voltage<00:03:22.290> could<00:03:23.280> cause<00:03:23.549> it<00:03:23.669> to

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
this kind of voltage could cause it to

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.399 
this kind of voltage could cause it to
explode<00:03:24.180> or<00:03:24.689> leak<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.769> deucer<00:03:26.159> H<00:03:26.430> own<00:03:26.730> risk

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:27.409 
explode or leak so deucer H own risk

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:30.379 
explode or leak so deucer H own risk
right<00:03:28.409> our<00:03:28.739> battery<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.069> being<00:03:29.250> charged<00:03:29.790> it's

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
right our battery is being charged it's

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:33.470 
right our battery is being charged it's
pretty<00:03:30.720> hot<00:03:30.959> as<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:31.769> can<00:03:31.799> feel<00:03:32.159> well<00:03:33.090> at<00:03:33.329> least

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
pretty hot as you can feel well at least

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.629 
pretty hot as you can feel well at least
I<00:03:33.720> can<00:03:33.900> feel<00:03:34.109> this<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.250> pretty<00:03:35.459> hot

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
I can feel this this is pretty hot

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:41.030 
I can feel this this is pretty hot
battery<00:03:36.000> I'll<00:03:36.510> put<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:36.930> down<00:03:39.650> we're<00:03:40.650> now<00:03:40.769> going

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
battery I'll put it down we're now going

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.219 
battery I'll put it down we're now going
to<00:03:41.129> put<00:03:41.220> it<00:03:41.430> in<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.669> charger<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.840> best<00:03:43.019> thing

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:43.229 
to put it in the charger the best thing

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:44.839 
to put it in the charger the best thing
to<00:03:43.260> do<00:03:43.500> is<00:03:43.919> to<00:03:44.069> let<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.250> cool<00:03:44.459> down<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.699> little

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849
