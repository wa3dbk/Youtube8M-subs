 This time, I will introduce the Gacha ze that Pokemon 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:11.610
 It is in the case that can obtain Pokemon Toretta 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:15.330
 It is very colorful because the capsule itself is the next monster ball

 A total of 8 types with one 200 yen 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:25.580
 It took a total of 16 times when it was turned until the monster ball came out 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.520
 Since So I think that you see the line-up but do not know and do not try to open the capsules 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.570
 Any one 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.650
 You can open it 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.650
 The capsule is packed so as not to open like this 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:46.270
 I will open one soon 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:48.640

 Then I will try to open it, and not really where to do, but if I open it with Paka Sakura 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.800
 It is a sponge and it is a very serious case- 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:08.869
 During 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:10.470
