00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.929
 also a buttonhole the length is 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.630
 no witchcraft and we start with it 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.549
 after two matches in the middle of perl 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.130
 pattern after two stitches had to perl 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.160
 an edge mesh a mesh right one 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:28.080
 mesh left 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:30.750
 Now we turn and knit 4 1 in perl 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:36.750
 pattern and edge mesh as a left 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:39.960
 one right one quick and again 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.440
 turn back only three stitches 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:50.730
 strict imperial pattern mesh 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:56.520
 right left and walls again 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.800
 apply per pattern left right edge 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:07.729
 mesh and once again edge mesh 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:13.820
 right left so we have four 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.820
 knitted only over these three stitches 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.369
 and always that perl must keep it 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.220
 So that means we have the here now 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.320
 first part of the button four rows 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.590
 knitted we have to string these four 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.689
 also knit the remaining piece 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.220
 we last left here from left to right 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.159
 knitted on the right there we changed 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:40.280
 So we have to turn right again 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.659
 starting back knit four rows 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.210
 according to the pattern i cut that 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
 paths from the small piece from then on 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.979
 we no longer need it we have to 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.940
 then later lent and set equal 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:57.979
 continued with the thread on the bigger rose 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.800
 piece and here again the pattern 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.929
 according to 4 1 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:08.799
 just like the little strip 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:15.980
 So that's just always the beginning 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:18.830
 two purely perl pattern and intervening in 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.310
 the case left stitch then 44 again 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.560
 mesh beads pattern tranche in the beginning 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.600
 again edge mesh four mesh perl 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.600
 then had to mesh right 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.750
 and turn back here 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:44.579
 before you come to this short particle 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:50.209
 come and once again a row and 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.209
 a second trip also stretch here 4 1 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.000
 I'll put it that way now 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.319
 quicker the pattern 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.250
 knit accordingly 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.590
 where i have a one two mistake here 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.840
 I then showed in another 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.569
 video again make mistakes 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.569
 can easily correct 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.540
 so and if we now end this piece 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.819
 I am correct then one more 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.590
 knit you wrong so we did 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.079
 match now if the same 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.349
 number of purely then we stretch now 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.849
 just keep going over the short one 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.090
 piece and then we have one again 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.620
 complete series and then afterwards 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.620
 knit as usual 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.960
 So just knit over it 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.870
 complete now back again that perl pattern 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.210
 note and now completely normal in 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.360
 complete rows again 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.360
 work 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.120
 at the beginning and the end of each four 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.720
 mesh beads had to be next to the edge 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.000
 mesh 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.430
 and in between smooth right so 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.150
 back left mesh front 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.150
 right stitches 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.900
 So I strictly then a bit 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.900
 about it 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.830
 now you have to show 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.220
 and here we have a magnificent one 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.380
 longitudinal buttonhole 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.780
 So you see that is not 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.120
 difficult also here you can do it afterwards 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:44.000
 that knob hole with a same color 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.000
 But sewing around is not necessary 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.900
 and from such exercises in 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.260
 different colors you could to 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.720
 For example, a pretty pillow cave 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:58.050
 do and you can also one 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.330
 play with the buttons and the little bit 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.070
 buttonholes you could corner such 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.510
 with button button button holes 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.510
 attach to each other
