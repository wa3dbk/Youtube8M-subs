oh wait
well<00:01:23.380> this<00:01:23.560> is<00:01:23.590> still<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> prototype<00:01:24.159> right

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
well this is still a prototype right

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
well this is still a prototype right
still<00:01:25.060> working<00:01:25.510> in<00:01:25.600> progress<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.430> and<00:01:27.729> not<00:01:28.150> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
still working in progress so and not the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.670 
still working in progress so and not the
actual<00:01:29.470> hardware<00:01:30.130> here<00:01:30.280> with<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:31.530> get<00:01:32.530> the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
actual hardware here with the get the

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.210 
actual hardware here with the get the
freescale<00:01:34.560> freescale<00:01:35.560> processor<00:01:36.070> right

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
freescale freescale processor right

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.060 
freescale freescale processor right
there<00:01:36.460> a<00:01:36.640> does<00:01:37.299> support<00:01:37.659> 3g<00:01:38.049> to<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:38.770> see<00:01:38.979> if

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
there a does support 3g to and see if

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.260 
there a does support 3g to and see if
there<00:01:39.220> is<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.840> 3g<00:01:42.630> port<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.320> microsd<00:01:45.009> so<00:01:45.909> it's<00:01:46.060> a

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
there is a 3g port and microsd so it's a

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.660 
there is a 3g port and microsd so it's a
quite<00:01:46.840> impressive<00:01:47.320> who<00:01:48.070> knows<00:01:48.280> maybe<00:01:48.490> we'll

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
quite impressive who knows maybe we'll

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.580 
quite impressive who knows maybe we'll
have<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:49.000> at<00:01:49.180> mp4<00:01:49.450> nation<00:01:49.930> at<00:01:50.049> some<00:01:50.259> given

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
have this at mp4 nation at some given

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.160 
have this at mp4 nation at some given
time<00:01:50.979> but<00:01:51.940> i<00:01:51.970> will<00:01:52.390> definitely<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.810> keeping<00:01:52.930> an

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
time but i will definitely be keeping an

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.609 
time but i will definitely be keeping an
eye<00:01:53.290> on<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:54.119> this<00:01:55.119> little<00:01:55.330> device<00:01:55.619> alright

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 
eye on this this little device alright

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.990 
eye on this this little device alright
we're<00:01:57.009> going<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.280> check<00:01:57.460> out<00:01:57.550> other<00:01:57.729> stuff

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
we're going to check out other stuff

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.499 
we're going to check out other stuff
around<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.619> expo<00:01:59.619> and<00:02:00.240> show<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:01.300> more

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
around the expo and show you more

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.740 
around the expo and show you more
interesting<00:02:01.869> gadgets<00:02:02.259> thanks
