ground<00:00:17.760> texture<00:00:19.580> this<00:00:20.580> one<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.090> by<00:00:21.920> zipper<00:00:22.920> and

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
ground texture this one is by zipper and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:32.990 
ground texture this one is by zipper and
it's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.970> version<00:00:27.740> 1.5<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.890> version<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.610> that

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
it's a version 1.5 the version one that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.520 
it's a version 1.5 the version one that
he<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:34.500> he<00:00:34.730> put<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:36.000> not<00:00:36.329> long<00:00:36.719> back

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
he that he put out not long back

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.080 
he that he put out not long back
he's<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:38.670> changed<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.780> new<00:00:39.989> color<00:00:40.790> color<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
he's now changed a new color color the

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.049 
he's now changed a new color color the
soil<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:43.800> textured<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.610> riches<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:46.039> the

soil the textured of riches and the

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.660 
soil the textured of riches and the
cultivating<00:00:48.059> distance<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.100> I'll<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
cultivating distance so what I'll do is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.360 
cultivating distance so what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.449> show<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.050> what<00:00:52.199> Hagin<00:00:53.010> state

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
I'll actually show you what Hagin state

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.380 
I'll actually show you what Hagin state
used<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.239> look<00:00:54.420> like<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:55.230> then<00:00:55.850> we're<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
used to look like and then we're go and

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.569 
used to look like and then we're go and
take<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.379> what<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.890> new<00:00:59.070> one<00:00:59.370> looks

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
take a look at what the new one looks

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:11.090 
take a look at what the new one looks
like<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> this<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.059> old<00:01:03.270> style<00:01:03.830> plowing

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.050 

and<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.120> the<00:01:12.630> old-style<00:01:13.050> cloud<00:01:14.030> with<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
and this is the old-style cloud with a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.510 
and this is the old-style cloud with a
spray<00:01:15.740> fertilizer<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.130> top<00:01:17.780> as<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> see

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
spray fertilizer on top as you can see

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.600 
spray fertilizer on top as you can see
not<00:01:20.520> teaching<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.330> suck<00:01:21.570> eggs<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.200> this

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
not teaching you to suck eggs but this

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:35.230 
not teaching you to suck eggs but this
darker<00:01:26.810> here's<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:27.960> cultivated<00:01:28.800> on<00:01:30.320> sprayed

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.690 

this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:37.130> with<00:01:38.130> crop<00:01:38.580> on<00:01:38.880> that's<00:01:39.810> been<00:01:40.050> caught

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
this is with crop on that's been caught

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.510 
this is with crop on that's been caught
you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.910> just<00:01:42.150> see<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.450> stubble<00:01:43.520> obviously

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you can just see the stubble obviously

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.749 
you can just see the stubble obviously
with<00:01:44.759> crop<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.890> see<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.310> texture

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
with crop so you can see the texture

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.890 
with crop so you can see the texture
underneath

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:56.900 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.260 

and<00:01:57.470> again<00:01:58.480> cultivated<00:01:59.480> non<00:01:59.750> sprayed<00:02:01.060> this<00:02:02.060> is

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
and again cultivated non sprayed this is

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:11.190 
and again cultivated non sprayed this is
but<00:02:02.510> potato<00:02:03.350> ridges

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.940 

come<00:02:11.770> sprayed<00:02:12.250> this<00:02:12.940> is<00:02:13.349> sprayed<00:02:14.349> potato

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
come sprayed this is sprayed potato

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.589 
come sprayed this is sprayed potato
ridges

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:27.820 

this<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.549> seeded<00:02:21.959> sprayed

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:37.630 

this<00:02:28.460> is<00:02:28.670> seeded<00:02:29.240> unsprayed

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.230 

and<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.630> is<00:02:39.040> cultivated<00:02:40.040> sprayed<00:02:43.060> so<00:02:44.060> there

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
and this is cultivated sprayed so there

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.380 
and this is cultivated sprayed so there
you<00:02:44.480> go<00:02:44.630> that's<00:02:44.930> what<00:02:45.170> egg<00:02:45.740> instead<00:02:46.390> started

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
you go that's what egg instead started

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.970 
you go that's what egg instead started
out<00:02:47.600> like<00:02:48.340> with<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.140> texture<00:02:51.140> packs<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.770> the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
out like with the texture packs on the

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.290 
out like with the texture packs on the
actual<00:02:52.400> ground<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:55.480> if<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.720> fancy<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.290> change

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
actual ground so if you fancy a change

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.180 
actual ground so if you fancy a change
and<00:02:59.300> you've<00:02:59.600> got<00:02:59.810> mod<00:03:00.140> map<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.740> you<00:03:00.860> want<00:03:01.040> to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
and you've got mod map that you want to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.740 
and you've got mod map that you want to
change<00:03:01.460> because<00:03:02.830> be<00:03:03.830> very<00:03:04.160> careful<00:03:05.090> in

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
change because be very careful in

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.230 
change because be very careful in
changing<00:03:06.470> your<00:03:06.500> original<00:03:07.250> map<00:03:07.520> because<00:03:08.030> if

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
changing your original map because if

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.010 
changing your original map because if
you<00:03:08.390> muck<00:03:08.600> it<00:03:08.810> up<00:03:08.990> it<00:03:09.620> will<00:03:09.800> mock<00:03:10.040> your<00:03:10.280> game<00:03:10.459> up

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
you muck it up it will mock your game up

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.390 
you muck it up it will mock your game up
totally<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.260> you<00:03:12.410> probably<00:03:12.920> won't<00:03:13.130> be<00:03:13.310> able

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
totally and you probably won't be able

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.540 
totally and you probably won't be able
to<00:03:13.550> play<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.230> or<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.440> won't<00:03:15.620> play<00:03:15.860> multiplayer

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
to play it or it won't play multiplayer

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.979 
to play it or it won't play multiplayer
so<00:03:17.180> just<00:03:17.570> be<00:03:17.930> very<00:03:17.959> wary<00:03:18.680> about<00:03:19.780> changing<00:03:20.780> your

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
so just be very wary about changing your

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.229 
so just be very wary about changing your
actual<00:03:21.410> main<00:03:21.770> game<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:25.340> you<00:03:25.489> download<00:03:26.000> the

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
actual main game but you download the

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.500 
actual main game but you download the
mod<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:27.860> basically<00:03:28.450> changed<00:03:29.450> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
mod and you basically changed the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.420 
mod and you basically changed the
foliage<00:03:31.360> layering<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.510> mod<00:03:32.720> map<00:03:33.130> and<00:03:34.130> this

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
foliage layering the mod map and this

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.760 
foliage layering the mod map and this
order<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.970> to<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:35.420> really<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.110> if<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.470> if

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
order is to it really so if you if

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.220 
order is to it really so if you if
you've<00:03:37.040> got<00:03:37.220> a<00:03:37.250> mod<00:03:37.520> map<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.870> want<00:03:39.080> to

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you've got a mod map that you want to

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.039 
you've got a mod map that you want to
change<00:03:39.500> texture<00:03:40.310> on<00:03:42.310> I'll<00:03:43.310> say<00:03:44.000> try<00:03:44.450> on<00:03:44.840> that

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
change texture on I'll say try on that

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.850 
change texture on I'll say try on that
first<00:03:45.940> right<00:03:46.940> okay<00:03:47.600> what<00:03:47.810> we<00:03:47.989> do<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.410> we<00:03:48.560> pause

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
first right okay what we do is we pause

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.400 
first right okay what we do is we pause
it<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.280> we<00:03:49.400> go<00:03:49.610> over<00:03:49.790> and<00:03:50.120> wherever<00:03:50.810> look<00:03:51.260> at

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
it and we go over and wherever look at

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
it and we go over and wherever look at
the<00:03:51.530> new<00:03:51.739> texturing

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.080 

there<00:03:57.030> we<00:03:57.269> are<00:03:57.299> back<00:03:57.680> with<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.040> new<00:03:59.599> textures

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
there we are back with the new textures

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.160 
there we are back with the new textures
here<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.209> can<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.870> new<00:04:04.019> plow<00:04:04.409> texture<00:04:06.170> on

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
here you can see the new plow texture on

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:14.869 
here you can see the new plow texture on
awesome<00:04:07.769> chunky<00:04:10.640> slightly<00:04:11.640> darker<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:14.640> is

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
awesome chunky slightly darker this is

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.060 
awesome chunky slightly darker this is
the<00:04:15.060> plow<00:04:15.299> texture<00:04:16.109> without<00:04:16.320> spray<00:04:19.070> don't

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
the plow texture without spray don't

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
the plow texture without spray don't
look<00:04:20.280> too<00:04:20.489> bad<00:04:20.519> actually<00:04:22.729> it's<00:04:23.729> more<00:04:24.030> like

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
look too bad actually it's more like

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.620 
look too bad actually it's more like
real<00:04:24.720> flower<00:04:25.169> field<00:04:28.520> here<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.729> can<00:04:29.970> see<00:04:30.240> the

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
real flower field here you can see the

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.000 
real flower field here you can see the
plow<00:04:30.960> texture<00:04:33.139> has<00:04:34.139> been<00:04:34.470> sprayed

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:47.990 

just<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.160> slight<00:04:38.460> Darkman<00:04:42.680> over<00:04:43.680> here<00:04:44.000> is<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
just a slight Darkman over here is the

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.200 
just a slight Darkman over here is the
cultivated<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:49.710> that's<00:04:50.250> changed<00:04:50.910> quite<00:04:51.150> a

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
cultivated and that's changed quite a

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.360 
cultivated and that's changed quite a
lot

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
lot

00:04:52.370 --> 00:05:00.530 
lot
from<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.900> original

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.990 

this<00:05:03.410> more<00:05:04.410> like<00:05:04.680> you've<00:05:04.980> probably<00:05:05.250> find<00:05:05.670> in<00:05:05.910> a

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
this more like you've probably find in a

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.980 
this more like you've probably find in a
field<00:05:06.300> now<00:05:07.850> far<00:05:08.850> from<00:05:09.090> die<00:05:09.330> attract<00:05:09.780> probably

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
field now far from die attract probably

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:20.510 
field now far from die attract probably
here<00:05:12.990> it<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.380> with<00:05:14.060> stubble<00:05:15.060> crop<00:05:15.570> on<00:05:15.840> it<00:05:19.520> and

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
here it is with stubble crop on it and

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:28.830 
here it is with stubble crop on it and
obviously<00:05:20.730> with<00:05:21.360> a<00:05:21.630> full<00:05:22.350> grown<00:05:22.770> crop<00:05:23.340> on<00:05:23.580> it

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:36.200 

we<00:05:29.380> just<00:05:29.680> walk<00:05:29.920> over<00:05:30.220> another<00:05:30.850> lot

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:43.059 

is<00:05:36.800> cultivated<00:05:37.800> again<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:39.810> is<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.319> potato

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:43.069 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:48.559 

ridges<00:05:45.440> has<00:05:46.440> changed<00:05:47.039> quite<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.370> lot<00:05:47.639> as<00:05:48.090> well

00:05:48.559 --> 00:05:48.569 
ridges has changed quite a lot as well

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.550 
ridges has changed quite a lot as well
it's<00:05:48.840> more<00:05:49.669> like<00:05:50.669> the<00:05:51.030> machines<00:05:51.509> gone<00:05:51.990> over

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
it's more like the machines gone over

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:59.469 
it's more like the machines gone over
proper<00:05:54.050> made<00:05:55.050> wedges<00:05:56.120> rather<00:05:57.120> them<00:05:57.479> round

00:05:59.469 --> 00:05:59.479 
proper made wedges rather them round

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:07.719 
proper made wedges rather them round
that's<00:06:00.479> non<00:06:00.870> sprayed<00:06:04.370> this<00:06:05.370> is<00:06:05.639> sprayed

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
that's non sprayed this is sprayed

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.050 
that's non sprayed this is sprayed
slightly<00:06:08.729> darker<00:06:10.070> yeah<00:06:11.070> anything<00:06:11.370> there's

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
slightly darker yeah anything there's

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:18.499 
slightly darker yeah anything there's
not<00:06:12.419> a<00:06:12.690> lot<00:06:12.960> of<00:06:12.990> difference<00:06:13.680> in<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:17.550> color<00:06:18.000> so

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
not a lot of difference in the color so

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:23.990 
not a lot of difference in the color so
you<00:06:18.930> know<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:19.380> could<00:06:19.680> be<00:06:21.860> bit<00:06:22.860> dodgy<00:06:23.160> sometimes

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
you know it could be bit dodgy sometimes

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.409 
you know it could be bit dodgy sometimes
but<00:06:24.419> if<00:06:24.720> you'd<00:06:24.930> just<00:06:25.169> look<00:06:25.380> quickly<00:06:26.389> there<00:06:27.389> is

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 
but if you'd just look quickly there is

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:36.589 
but if you'd just look quickly there is
the<00:06:28.320> seeded<00:06:29.039> sprayed<00:06:33.380> so<00:06:34.639> rather<00:06:35.639> than<00:06:36.030> where

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:36.599 
the seeded sprayed so rather than where

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.649 
the seeded sprayed so rather than where
that's<00:06:36.900> the<00:06:37.020> cultivated<00:06:37.770> you<00:06:38.220> can<00:06:38.400> see<00:06:38.659> where

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:39.659 
that's the cultivated you can see where

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:42.499 
that's the cultivated you can see where
the<00:06:39.810> seed<00:06:40.050> has<00:06:40.289> made<00:06:40.560> the<00:06:40.770> ridge<00:06:41.009> marks<00:06:41.610> that's

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:42.509 
the seed has made the ridge marks that's

00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:44.560 
the seed has made the ridge marks that's
the<00:06:42.690> main<00:06:42.900> difference

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:44.570 
the main difference

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:52.260 
the main difference
this<00:06:45.570> is<00:06:45.780> seeded<00:06:47.270> unsprayed

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:59.839 

as<00:06:52.690> the<00:06:53.020> two<00:06:54.270> unsprayed<00:06:55.270> sprayed<00:06:56.910> and<00:06:57.910> this<00:06:58.210> is

00:06:59.839 --> 00:06:59.849 
as the two unsprayed sprayed and this is

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:07.530 
as the two unsprayed sprayed and this is
cultivated<00:07:00.849> sprayed

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:07.540 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:09.960 

now<00:07:08.050> you<00:07:08.260> can<00:07:08.410> see<00:07:08.650> the<00:07:08.890> tractors<00:07:09.520> smoking

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:09.970 
now you can see the tractors smoking

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.910 
now you can see the tractors smoking
about<00:07:10.090> in<00:07:10.480> the<00:07:10.570> background<00:07:11.140> getting<00:07:11.590> stuck

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:11.920 
about in the background getting stuck

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:17.480 
about in the background getting stuck
together<00:07:12.190> so<00:07:14.610> there<00:07:15.610> you<00:07:15.790> go<00:07:16.030> that's<00:07:16.480> dust

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.490 
together so there you go that's dust

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:25.620 
together so there you go that's dust
