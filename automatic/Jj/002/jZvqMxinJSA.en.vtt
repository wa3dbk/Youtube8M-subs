00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
marathon I would have got really annoyed

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.930

with it but i also find read them closer
together<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.510> would<00:03:33.690> have<00:03:33.780> enjoyed<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.050> more

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
together I would have enjoyed it more

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
together I would have enjoyed it more
because<00:03:34.770> there<00:03:35.220> was<00:03:35.310> a<00:03:35.370> lot<00:03:35.520> that<00:03:35.550> I<00:03:35.730> forgot

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
because there was a lot that I forgot

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.910 
because there was a lot that I forgot
from<00:03:36.150> fallen<00:03:36.570> and<00:03:36.810> torment<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.680> is<00:03:37.770> the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
from fallen and torment and think is the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.560 
from fallen and torment and think is the
second<00:03:38.250> one<00:03:38.370> there<00:03:39.090> was<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.240> lot<00:03:39.360> that<00:03:39.390> I

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
second one there was a lot that I

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.860 
second one there was a lot that I
forgotten<00:03:39.930> from<00:03:40.230> those<00:03:40.410> so<00:03:40.890> I<00:03:41.630> wish<00:03:42.630> I<00:03:42.750> would

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
forgotten from those so I wish I would

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.060 
forgotten from those so I wish I would
have<00:03:42.900> read<00:03:43.080> them<00:03:43.170> closer<00:03:43.440> together<00:03:43.709> but

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
have read them closer together but

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.440 
have read them closer together but
definitely<00:03:44.520> not<00:03:44.700> one<00:03:44.940> right<00:03:45.090> after<00:03:45.209> the<00:03:45.360> other

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
definitely not one right after the other

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.540 
definitely not one right after the other
but<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.440> will<00:03:46.590> say<00:03:46.709> this<00:03:46.830> is<00:03:47.010> also<00:03:47.160> my<00:03:47.340> favorite
