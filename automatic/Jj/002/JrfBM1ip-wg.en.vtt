00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
can expect and try to plan a bit I'd

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
about what the next person does my last

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.390 
about what the next person does my last
question<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.270> from<00:04:35.600> mark<00:04:36.130> have<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.220> ever

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
question is from mark have you ever

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.250 
question is from mark have you ever
adapted<00:04:37.880> old<00:04:38.060> lenses<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.540> your<00:04:38.660> digital<00:04:39.020> here

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
adapted old lenses to your digital here

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.110 
adapted old lenses to your digital here
my<00:04:39.590> digital<00:04:39.950> cameras<00:04:40.340> are<00:04:40.490> micro<00:04:40.850> four<00:04:41.090> thirds

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
my digital cameras are micro four thirds

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.450 
my digital cameras are micro four thirds
so<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.750> can<00:04:41.990> adapt<00:04:42.260> almost<00:04:42.680> anything<00:04:42.979> on<00:04:43.250> them

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
so I can adapt almost anything on them

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.250 
so I can adapt almost anything on them
