00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.490 
just went you and I'm like okay it costs
me<00:02:05.890> something<00:02:06.880> along<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.630> 5<00:02:07.930> times<00:02:08.200> something

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
me something along the 5 times something

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.320 
me something along the 5 times something
or<00:02:08.800> six<00:02:08.979> pounds<00:02:09.369> so<00:02:09.729> it's<00:02:09.910> more<00:02:10.119> than<00:02:10.270> I

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
or six pounds so it's more than I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.949 
or six pounds so it's more than I
usually<00:02:10.750> spend<00:02:10.959> on<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.200> shampoo<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:12.580> I<00:02:12.959> have

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
usually spend on a shampoo but I have

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.070 
usually spend on a shampoo but I have
had<00:02:14.560> this<00:02:14.740> three<00:02:15.070> months<00:02:15.340> now<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:15.900> it's<00:02:16.900> not

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
had this three months now and it's not

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.680 
had this three months now and it's not
right<00:02:17.500> now<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.790> know<00:02:18.940> sassing<00:02:19.360> me<00:02:19.390> more

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
right now and you know sassing me more

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.270 
right now and you know sassing me more
than<00:02:19.810> my<00:02:19.959> elbow<00:02:20.170> so<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.380> guess<00:02:20.560> it's<00:02:20.739> worth<00:02:20.950> it

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
than my elbow so I guess it's worth it

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.160 
than my elbow so I guess it's worth it
and<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:21.670> had<00:02:22.000> better<00:02:22.239> results<00:02:22.660> when<00:02:22.989> you

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and it's had better results when you

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.660 
and it's had better results when you
switch<00:02:23.440> to<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.800> from<00:02:24.070> your<00:02:24.220> normal<00:02:24.519> shampoo

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
switch to this from your normal shampoo

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.640 
switch to this from your normal shampoo
you'll<00:02:25.390> notice<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:25.840> your<00:02:25.959> hair<00:02:25.989> does<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> bit

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
still get the same results although I

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.430 
still get the same results although I
will<00:02:59.150> say<00:02:59.180> that<00:02:59.540> after<00:02:59.690> using<00:03:00.020> it's<00:03:00.290> like

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
will say that after using it's like

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.560 
will say that after using it's like
using<00:03:00.740> any<00:03:00.890> soap<00:03:01.190> your<00:03:01.610> hair<00:03:01.760> feels<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.120> bit<00:03:02.240> dry

and just in the shower and what I tend

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.170 
and just in the shower and what I tend
to<00:03:06.410> do<00:03:06.560> is<00:03:06.740> when<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> put<00:03:07.130> conditioner<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.820> brush

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
to do is when I put conditioner I brush

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.640 
to do is when I put conditioner I brush
it<00:03:08.209> out<00:03:08.480> because<00:03:10.000> obviously<00:03:11.320> if<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.500> don't

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
it out because obviously if you don't

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.320 
it out because obviously if you don't
brush<00:03:12.830> it<00:03:12.890> out<00:03:13.130> it's<00:03:13.520> a<00:03:14.470> it<00:03:15.470> gets<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.830> bit<00:03:15.950> nutty

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330
