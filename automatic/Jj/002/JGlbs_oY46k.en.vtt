00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.950
 michel means I create correctly 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.910
 good videos about it and stands 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.830

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.910
 you can subscribe me then 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.570
 he does not miss another video and then 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.100
 I would say 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 Let's just start today 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.399
 I'll introduce you a bmw x6 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.870
 this costs 31 90 +4 in cost and the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.550
 link to pause in the text under the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 Videoclip on it comes directly to Amazon 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 The link should not work 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.149
 you can do that in the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.050
 post comments 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.949
 and so looks the packaging of the car 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:08.150
 off and we will now 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:08.150
 unpack and that's what the car dealership looks like 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.969
 just as freshly polished, it shines very beautifully 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:05.170
 show chic car interior shortly 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:12.880
 He looks like that and then have 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:14.400
 still the seats behind new york and times 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 so a bit the back seat is 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:22.990
 but a little mirrored that 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:25.530
 slice the mincing antenna that will 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.450
 Just put it in here and then 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:33.970
 screwed down then you can the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.440
 do not take off switch here with 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.310
 forward or backward 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.550
 That's what you're doing and down here we have 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.640
 then the battery compartment and there comes 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.700
 a new blog in 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:51.190
 the underside of the car direction for 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.380
 the axle on off switch battery compartment 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.440
 Do you want to move forward? 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:00.930
 you best in sharp object and 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.570
 here are now five times batteries 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.570
 function forward times backwards 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:13.840
 drive and then we still have the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:16.110
 steering is still there and then here 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.110
 behind 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.870
 it is naturally clear 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.720
 losses 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.490
 Hello 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.490
 the other too 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.310
 O 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.050
 5 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.730
 now I have you the car sometimes 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.880
 presented 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.079
 I really liked this one 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.720
 is one of the very good ones 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.530
 Processing there is nothing to 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.330
 find fault 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.370
 Furthermore, at the precise and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:31.660
 crisp steering and that was right 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.400
 been on the move 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.010
 So he has really steam under the 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 hood and that's why the car show 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.280
 recommend 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.840
 the link to break stand was excel and 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.470

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.910
