adventure yet the undead shift in the
undead<00:03:53.569> shift<00:03:53.870> in<00:03:54.079> and<00:03:54.260> out<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.530> sight<00:03:54.919> so<00:03:55.730> when

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
undead shift in and out of sight so when

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.930 
undead shift in and out of sight so when
they<00:03:56.810> say<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.560> pretty<00:03:58.280> much<00:03:58.370> get<00:03:58.700> the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
they say this I pretty much get the

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.509 
they say this I pretty much get the
impression<00:03:59.419> of<00:03:59.780> kind<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.079> like<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.280> hunter<00:04:01.280> from

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
impression of kind of like a hunter from

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.870 
impression of kind of like a hunter from
left<00:04:01.700> 4<00:04:01.849> dead<00:04:01.880> 2<00:04:02.000> and<00:04:02.419> mixed<00:04:03.290> with<00:04:03.349> a<00:04:03.790> kind<00:04:04.790> of

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
left 4 dead 2 and mixed with a kind of

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.140 
left 4 dead 2 and mixed with a kind of
like<00:04:05.000> a<00:04:05.030> crawler<00:04:05.480> from<00:04:06.700> one<00:04:07.700> of<00:04:07.819> those<00:04:07.880> like

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
like a crawler from one of those like

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.539 
like a crawler from one of those like
really<00:04:08.510> crawlers<00:04:08.900> from<00:04:09.109> five<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.650> kino<00:04:10.040> those

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
really crawlers from five and kino those

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.670 
really crawlers from five and kino those
really<00:04:10.880> annoying<00:04:11.150> ones<00:04:11.419> one<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:12.169> I've<00:04:12.349> kind<00:04:12.620> of

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
really annoying ones one so I've kind of

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.220 
really annoying ones one so I've kind of
seen<00:04:12.739> that's<00:04:13.069> like<00:04:13.220> a<00:04:13.250> very<00:04:13.579> dark<00:04:14.030> and<00:04:14.329> dark

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
seen that's like a very dark and dark

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.130 
seen that's like a very dark and dark
purplish<00:04:15.769> maybe<00:04:16.220> on<00:04:16.659> because<00:04:17.659> it<00:04:17.810> says

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
purplish maybe on because it says

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.390 
purplish maybe on because it says
they're<00:04:18.469> waiting<00:04:18.769> for<00:04:18.890> the<00:04:18.979> perfect<00:04:19.130> moment

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
they're waiting for the perfect moment

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.149 
they're waiting for the perfect moment
to<00:04:19.700> strike<00:04:19.789> so<00:04:20.780> when<00:04:20.989> i<00:04:21.109> read<00:04:21.650> that<00:04:21.680> that

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
to strike so when i read that that

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.350 
to strike so when i read that that
pretty<00:04:22.370> much<00:04:22.580> instantly

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
pretty much instantly

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.170 
pretty much instantly
on<00:04:23.590> tells<00:04:24.590> me<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:25.280> they're<00:04:25.460> gonna<00:04:25.610> make<00:04:25.849> i

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
on tells me that they're gonna make i

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.629 
on tells me that they're gonna make i
should<00:04:27.110> say<00:04:27.289> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.770> but<00:04:27.979> my<00:04:28.129> theory<00:04:28.490> is

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
should say going to but my theory is

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.879 
should say going to but my theory is
that<00:04:28.759> um<00:04:29.210> they<00:04:29.930> will<00:04:30.110> probably<00:04:30.379> they're

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
that um they will probably they're

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.830 
that um they will probably they're
probably<00:04:31.099> trying<00:04:31.430> to<00:04:31.520> make<00:04:31.699> raped<00:04:32.330> raining<00:04:32.750> a

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
probably trying to make raped raining a

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.990 
probably trying to make raped raining a
little<00:04:32.960> bit<00:04:33.139> more<00:04:33.379> difficult<00:04:33.639> because<00:04:34.639> if

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
little bit more difficult because if

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.770 
little bit more difficult because if
they're<00:04:35.150> waiting<00:04:35.389> for<00:04:35.539> the<00:04:35.599> perfect

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
they're waiting for the perfect

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.469 
they're waiting for the perfect
opportunity<00:04:36.259> to<00:04:36.650> strike<00:04:36.740> i<00:04:37.310> think<00:04:38.120> if<00:04:38.300> there's

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
opportunity to strike i think if there's

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.080 
opportunity to strike i think if there's
a<00:04:38.539> horde<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.930> zombies<00:04:38.990> on<00:04:39.650> near<00:04:40.219> you<00:04:40.520> or<00:04:40.819> your

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
a horde of zombies on near you or your

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.499 
a horde of zombies on near you or your
partner's<00:04:41.509> i<00:04:41.750> think<00:04:42.469> these<00:04:42.590> things<00:04:42.650> will

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
partner's i think these things will

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.689 
partner's i think these things will
suddenly<00:04:44.509> come<00:04:44.750> out<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.379> i<00:04:45.710> pop<00:04:46.159> up<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:46.490> front

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
suddenly come out and i pop up in front

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.339 
suddenly come out and i pop up in front
of<00:04:46.759> you<00:04:46.879> and<00:04:47.120> I<00:04:47.389> don't<00:04:47.780> know<00:04:47.870> maybe<00:04:48.050> there'll

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
of you and I don't know maybe there'll

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.129 
of you and I don't know maybe there'll
be<00:04:48.379> some<00:04:48.770> sort<00:04:48.949> of<00:04:49.300> you<00:04:50.300> know<00:04:50.330> crazy<00:04:50.870> thing

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
be some sort of you know crazy thing

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.679 
be some sort of you know crazy thing
crazy<00:04:51.439> abilities<00:04:52.090> we'll<00:04:53.090> just<00:04:53.300> have<00:04:53.449> to<00:04:53.599> wait

00:04:53.679 --> 00:04:53.689 
crazy abilities we'll just have to wait

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.649 
crazy abilities we'll just have to wait
and<00:04:53.750> see<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:55.520> keep<00:04:55.939> reading<00:04:56.120> on<00:04:56.330> it<00:04:56.479> says

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
and see and I keep reading on it says

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.990 
and see and I keep reading on it says
undead<00:04:57.080> astronauts<00:04:57.680> usually<00:04:58.219> Shambo<00:04:58.729> toward

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
undead astronauts usually Shambo toward

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.480 
undead astronauts usually Shambo toward
their<00:04:59.150> next<00:04:59.479> meal<00:04:59.919> unaffected<00:05:00.919> by<00:05:01.219> the<00:05:01.279> base

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
their next meal unaffected by the base

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.540 
their next meal unaffected by the base
is<00:05:01.729> fluctuating<00:05:02.180> gravity<00:05:02.840> so<00:05:03.500> this<00:05:04.219> probably

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
is fluctuating gravity so this probably

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.219 
is fluctuating gravity so this probably
means<00:05:04.699> that<00:05:04.849> zombies<00:05:05.360> won't<00:05:05.569> be<00:05:05.689> affected<00:05:06.110> by

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
means that zombies won't be affected by

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:09.760 
means that zombies won't be affected by
gravity<00:05:06.289> um<00:05:07.900> but<00:05:08.900> then<00:05:09.050> again<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.379> doesn't<00:05:09.560> say

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
gravity um but then again it doesn't say

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.890 
gravity um but then again it doesn't say
zombies<00:05:10.250> it<00:05:10.370> says<00:05:10.550> undead<00:05:10.879> astronauts<00:05:11.419> but<00:05:11.689> I

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900 
zombies it says undead astronauts but I

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.379 
zombies it says undead astronauts but I
don't<00:05:12.860> know<00:05:12.949> because<00:05:13.219> I<00:05:13.340> could<00:05:13.520> see<00:05:13.759> zombies

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
don't know because I could see zombies

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.659 
don't know because I could see zombies
being<00:05:14.840> affected<00:05:15.379> by<00:05:15.409> gravity<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:16.219> could<00:05:16.430> kind

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
being affected by gravity I could kind

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.399 
being affected by gravity I could kind
of<00:05:16.849> see<00:05:17.569> something<00:05:17.930> like<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.110> being

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
of see something like that being

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.159 
of see something like that being
implemented<00:05:18.800> into<00:05:19.159> this<00:05:19.370> map<00:05:19.610> on<00:05:19.909> but<00:05:20.270> as<00:05:20.509> far

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
implemented into this map on but as far

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.429 
implemented into this map on but as far
as<00:05:21.229> it<00:05:21.560> says<00:05:21.800> here<00:05:21.830> it<00:05:22.310> says<00:05:22.340> they<00:05:22.729> won't<00:05:22.939> be<00:05:23.439> so

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439 
as it says here it says they won't be so

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.100 
as it says here it says they won't be so
on<00:05:24.819> that<00:05:25.819> probably<00:05:26.029> means<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.509> we<00:05:26.719> will<00:05:26.900> be

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
on that probably means that we will be

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.070 
on that probably means that we will be
and<00:05:27.379> that's<00:05:27.800> how<00:05:28.789> would<00:05:28.969> this<00:05:29.060> will<00:05:29.270> work<00:05:29.419> my

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
and that's how would this will work my

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.689 
and that's how would this will work my
three<00:05:30.379> is<00:05:30.529> it<00:05:30.680> probably<00:05:31.069> will<00:05:31.219> work<00:05:31.460> on

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
three is it probably will work on

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.180 
three is it probably will work on
something<00:05:32.000> with<00:05:32.319> turning<00:05:33.319> on<00:05:33.409> the<00:05:33.560> power<00:05:33.589> or

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
something with turning on the power or

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.119 
something with turning on the power or
maybe<00:05:34.460> it'll<00:05:34.669> be<00:05:34.699> like<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.969> boss<00:05:35.240> around<00:05:35.569> um<00:05:36.319> I

00:05:37.119 --> 00:05:37.129 
maybe it'll be like a boss around um I

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.409 
maybe it'll be like a boss around um I
don't<00:05:37.909> think<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.770> there's<00:05:39.770> probably<00:05:40.360> how<00:05:41.360> do

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
don't think that there's probably how do

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.629 
don't think that there's probably how do
I<00:05:41.479> say<00:05:41.750> this<00:05:41.779> there's<00:05:42.349> probably<00:05:42.680> you're<00:05:43.430> not

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
I say this there's probably you're not

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:45.640 
I say this there's probably you're not
ever<00:05:43.969> going<00:05:44.360> to<00:05:44.449> be<00:05:44.629> in<00:05:44.719> the<00:05:44.839> gravity<00:05:45.319> for<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
ever going to be in the gravity for the

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.140 
ever going to be in the gravity for the
entire<00:05:46.039> time<00:05:46.279> I<00:05:46.310> think<00:05:46.520> this<00:05:46.759> will<00:05:46.879> just<00:05:47.060> be

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
entire time I think this will just be

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.439 
entire time I think this will just be
like<00:05:47.389> a<00:05:48.339> something<00:05:49.339> that<00:05:49.490> happens<00:05:49.909> of<00:05:50.389> course

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
like a something that happens of course

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.570 
like a something that happens of course
maybe<00:05:50.960> it's<00:05:51.169> randomly<00:05:51.560> maybe<00:05:51.919> does<00:05:52.250> the<00:05:52.400> boss

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
maybe it's randomly maybe does the boss

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.610 
maybe it's randomly maybe does the boss
around<00:05:52.879> maybe<00:05:53.150> it's<00:05:53.449> with<00:05:53.990> something<00:05:54.349> turning

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
around maybe it's with something turning

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.490 
around maybe it's with something turning
on<00:05:54.740> the<00:05:54.830> power<00:05:54.860> but<00:05:55.250> left<00:05:55.939> the<00:05:56.029> weight<00:05:56.210> out<00:05:56.500> so

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
on the power but left the weight out so

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.079 
on the power but left the weight out so
in<00:05:57.740> the<00:05:57.889> new<00:05:58.039> weapons<00:05:58.400> here<00:05:58.580> it<00:05:58.669> says<00:05:58.819> arm

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.089 
in the new weapons here it says arm

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:00.850 
in the new weapons here it says arm
yourself<00:05:59.479> with<00:05:59.539> a<00:05:59.750> space-age<00:06:00.289> arsenal<00:06:00.830> of

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
yourself with a space-age arsenal of

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.950 
yourself with a space-age arsenal of
epic<00:06:01.219> proportions<00:06:01.879> including<00:06:02.419> the<00:06:02.539> wave<00:06:02.719> gun

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
epic proportions including the wave gun

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.869 
epic proportions including the wave gun
capable<00:06:03.560> of<00:06:03.889> cooking<00:06:04.129> zombies<00:06:04.610> from<00:06:04.729> the

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
inside out so I kind of see this as like

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.339 
inside out so I kind of see this as like
a<00:06:07.490> wonder<00:06:07.969> waffle<00:06:08.089> thundergun<00:06:08.719> mix<00:06:08.990> kind<00:06:09.259> of

a wonder waffle thundergun mix kind of

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.429 
a wonder waffle thundergun mix kind of

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
like a green wave and it shoot them and

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.899 
like a green wave and it shoot them and
they<00:06:14.569> boil<00:06:14.930> up<00:06:15.169> and<00:06:15.379> burst<00:06:15.680> and<00:06:16.039> all<00:06:16.580> I<00:06:16.610> have<00:06:16.789> to

they boil up and burst and all I have to

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:21.610 
they boil up and burst and all I have to
hurry<00:06:17.060> up<00:06:17.210> here<00:06:17.419> so<00:06:18.199> on<00:06:18.469> and<00:06:19.779> it<00:06:20.779> says<00:06:21.110> as<00:06:21.409> well

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
hurry up here so on and it says as well

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.829 
hurry up here so on and it says as well

entanglement<00:06:33.349> I'm<00:06:33.709> not<00:06:34.039> too<00:06:34.219> sure<00:06:34.430> about<00:06:34.459> but

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:36.100 
entanglement I'm not too sure about but

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.270 
entanglement I'm not too sure about but
pretty<00:06:36.250> sure<00:06:36.490> it's<00:06:36.700> when<00:06:36.970> molecules<00:06:37.450> are<00:06:38.280> kind

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
pretty sure it's when molecules are kind

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.120 
pretty sure it's when molecules are kind
of<00:06:39.510> squished<00:06:40.510> together<00:06:40.660> and<00:06:41.110> they<00:06:41.230> share<00:06:41.920> the

of squished together and they share the
same<00:06:42.390> space<00:06:43.390> and<00:06:43.750> I<00:06:44.020> don't<00:06:44.260> think<00:06:44.380> that<00:06:44.440> can

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
same space and I don't think that can

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.510 
same space and I don't think that can
happen<00:06:44.710> so<00:06:45.640> maybe<00:06:45.820> it's<00:06:46.030> kind<00:06:46.240> of<00:06:46.360> like<00:06:46.540> a<00:06:46.600> um

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
happen so maybe it's kind of like a um

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:52.020 
happen so maybe it's kind of like a um
oh<00:06:49.200> it's<00:06:50.200> hard<00:06:50.380> to<00:06:50.470> explain<00:06:50.680> I<00:06:51.100> could<00:06:51.670> kind<00:06:51.850> of

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
oh it's hard to explain I could kind of

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.770 
oh it's hard to explain I could kind of
see<00:06:52.210> it<00:06:52.330> like<00:06:52.650> kind<00:06:53.650> of<00:06:53.800> am<00:06:53.890> i<00:06:53.980> crushing<00:06:54.310> them

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
see it like kind of am i crushing them

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.570 
see it like kind of am i crushing them
but<00:06:55.780> we'll<00:06:56.350> have<00:06:56.440> to<00:06:56.500> wait<00:06:56.620> and<00:06:56.770> see<00:06:56.920> i<00:06:57.040> don't

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
but we'll have to wait and see i don't

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.130 
but we'll have to wait and see i don't
know<00:06:57.640> if<00:06:57.700> that's<00:06:57.820> what<00:06:58.270> quantum<00:06:58.720> entanglement

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
know if that's what quantum entanglement

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:01.500 
know if that's what quantum entanglement
is<00:06:59.230> i<00:06:59.350> think<00:06:59.380> that's<00:06:59.800> what<00:06:59.950> it<00:07:00.040> is<00:07:00.070> but<00:07:00.340> I<00:07:00.640> guess

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:01.510 
is i think that's what it is but I guess

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:04.800 
is i think that's what it is but I guess
we'll<00:07:01.720> have<00:07:01.810> to<00:07:01.990> wait<00:07:02.020> and<00:07:02.380> see<00:07:02.700> so<00:07:03.700> um<00:07:04.000> that's

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
we'll have to wait and see so um that's

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.230 
we'll have to wait and see so um that's
a<00:07:05.140> pretty<00:07:05.980> much<00:07:06.220> all<00:07:06.520> there's<00:07:07.030> going<00:07:07.150> to<00:07:07.210> be

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
a pretty much all there's going to be

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.800 
a pretty much all there's going to be
new<00:07:07.510> perk<00:07:07.810> and<00:07:08.140> it's<00:07:08.740> I<00:07:09.330> honestly<00:07:10.330> can't<00:07:10.750> wait

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
new perk and it's I honestly can't wait

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.980 
new perk and it's I honestly can't wait
for<00:07:11.080> this<00:07:11.170> map<00:07:11.380> um<00:07:12.210> this<00:07:13.210> is<00:07:13.420> going<00:07:13.600> to<00:07:13.660> be<00:07:13.750> so

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
for this map um this is going to be so

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.100 
for this map um this is going to be so
fun<00:07:14.320> um<00:07:15.180> so<00:07:16.180> if<00:07:16.690> you're<00:07:16.840> not<00:07:16.960> already

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110

lots<00:07:20.350> of<00:07:20.530> you<00:07:20.590> probably<00:07:20.800> don't<00:07:21.070> know<00:07:21.160> this<00:07:21.220> but

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
lots of you probably don't know this but

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.630 
lots of you probably don't know this but
for<00:07:21.640> shangela<00:07:21.910> I<00:07:22.300> was<00:07:22.540> the<00:07:22.830> first<00:07:23.830> person<00:07:24.070> i

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:24.640 
for shangela I was the first person i

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.820 
for shangela I was the first person i
believe<00:07:25.330> i<00:07:25.480> was<00:07:25.600> the<00:07:25.660> first<00:07:25.900> person<00:07:26.110> if<00:07:26.410> not<00:07:26.620> i

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 
believe i was the first person if not i

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.380 
believe i was the first person if not i
was<00:07:26.950> probably<00:07:27.220> the<00:07:27.340> second<00:07:27.700> or<00:07:27.790> third<00:07:27.850> person

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:28.390 
was probably the second or third person

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:31.110 
was probably the second or third person
