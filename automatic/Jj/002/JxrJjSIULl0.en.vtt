well<00:03:07.079> I'm<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:08.540> my<00:03:09.540> first<00:03:09.780> thought<00:03:10.140> and<00:03:10.350> you

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
well I'm just my first thought and you

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.020 
well I'm just my first thought and you
know<00:03:10.680> I'm<00:03:10.950> getting<00:03:11.160> older<00:03:11.430> my<00:03:11.459> first<00:03:11.850> thought

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
know I'm getting older my first thought

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.370 
know I'm getting older my first thought
was<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.269> keep<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.630> guys<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.109> bench

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
was to keep the guys in the bench

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.250 
was to keep the guys in the bench
because<00:03:14.090> they<00:03:15.090> can<00:03:15.239> call<00:03:15.420> technical<00:03:15.900> foul<00:03:16.079> if

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
because they can call technical foul if

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
because they can call technical foul if
you<00:03:16.380> run<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.560> in<00:03:16.739> the<00:03:16.799> court<00:03:17.010> celebrating<00:03:17.579> and

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
you run out in the court celebrating and

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.460 
you run out in the court celebrating and
then<00:03:17.790> they<00:03:17.940> have<00:03:18.299> like<00:03:18.329> 2/10<00:03:19.019> of<00:03:19.049> a<00:03:19.140> second

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
then they have like 2/10 of a second

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.080
