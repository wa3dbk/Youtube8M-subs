 those who are playing there but it is part 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.159
 of guarantor of feeling 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.039
 regardless of that I respect 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.140
 a lot because that really has given him the 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.090
 debt to this generation of children and I'm 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.159
 seriously the defeat generation of children 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.749
 a group 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.280
 that you can identify that when 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.560
 they grow weeks to pay attention 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.420
 attention and it's a reality but less 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.049
 agreement of the sheet with the batteries and 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.739
 telecommunications the world of 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:17.599
 miguel pacheco we leave nothing of everything 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.780
 that but in this generation 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.030
 there is no there as a group that the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.220
 children could identify outside of 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:33.560
 from the United States here local not like that 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:35.810
 there were no guys with cirón azulón first 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.660
 the name of a swine store 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.660
 you imagine yourself growing with continuous 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.780
 and you say to you without looking 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.350
 this 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.350
 Chinese garbage 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.590
 the little girls is an extension of those 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.720
 very good groups and the songs are 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.920
 spectacular children love the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.930
 which you have to like 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.850
 children and I understand that we took the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.440
 parody we made a parody called 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.840
 pincha was pizza great presence of 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.270
 much attention and little changed the 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.510
 lyrics and the song the song comes out 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.430
 air is a bastard 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.530
 to the air we said it was discretion by 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.980
 a child today in the newspaper extra spokesperson 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.030
 comes out 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.319
 creator attention attention saying that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.610
 extremely upset with the parody and 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.590
 saying that the innocence of children 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.120
 you have to take care of it and what responsibility 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.000
 of everything 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.379
 and this grandfather with him but like 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.080
 a girl answers for your sake 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.490
 I say basically the same thing I say a 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.870
 thing 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.860
 for the return to Peru 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.860
 as a program for children 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.620
 although although there are children who listening 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.269
 in the car you have to be 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.170
 responsible and know if that is 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.060
 happening at that time is for children 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 and I said it inflection with the children 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.819
 when I say economic income 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.200
 It's just that what comes through 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.770
 this country people do things at 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.670
 backwards they are not a bastard light 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.670
 yellow and accelerates 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.840
 the yellow but do not be bastard here in 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.000
 this country told him the things that 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.190
 islands at home simply by bringing the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.900
 contrary this country is like this 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.250
 I say discretion with the kids there they go 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.540
 the bastards are looking for a bitch 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.680
 payment that also puts in front of the 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.090
 grave so that they listen to the goat 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.800
 a bastard song or pissed off 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.330
 so here the parents have a 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.000
 problem bastard is a reality of 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.010
 I'm going to say here they want to give you 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.080
 the responsibility the artists that they 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.060
 they give the responsibility to the singers and 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.010
 now see another an example for the 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.250
 orchards that punch example for more one 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.250
 two 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.530
 I example for the youth what the fuck 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.509
 the example of each child must be his dad 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:07.150
 they must be their parents do not want to come to 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.889
 say the artist or tell them athletes 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.889
 or tell the announcer whoever 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:16.439
 that you an example for below in your 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:19.529
 that using the example for each child should 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:22.380
 be his dad so he wants us to 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:25.170
 we give him that 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.730
 I do not tell you about the artists that 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.350
 fail or lie down of the athletes 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:33.900
 they do not constantly remind you of the 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.700
 prepared for each child his dad who 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.740
 he has every day by his side because he is 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.560
 which neither the child sees is what the child 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.440
 he wants to continue therefore you have to be 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.600
 the example for them not me 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.450
 no me and my program is not for adults 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.490
 the goal of the pelúa is not to see or not 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.889
 for children 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:57.410
 you saw why I'm not an example 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.410
 you have no retentive 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:05.740
 seriously the example of each child must 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.680
 be his father 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.129
 do not want to inherit from us that we 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.719
 they finished 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:14.839
 and when I say discretion with the 

00:06:11.719 --> 00:06:18.600
 children the bastard goes radio and hopes that 

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:21.860
 spend that moment is a reality 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.860
 from behind like crazy
