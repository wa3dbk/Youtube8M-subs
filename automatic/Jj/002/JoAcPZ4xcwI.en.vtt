00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Tena koutou katoa,

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.720
and welcome to Te Karere
in Whangarei.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.400
We're broadcasting live

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.600
from the most prestigious
youth event on the Maori calendar.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.040
The prize-giving has just begun,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.360
and we hope to update you on
the winners during the programme.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.120
More than 40 groups from
schools all around the country

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.120
have competed in the competition
over the past five days.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.400
The audience has been wowed
by the magnificent display

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.720
of haka, waiata and poi.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.800
We witnessed some more of that flair
and panache in today's competition,

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.760
as Rapaera Tawhai reports.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.480
This is a collaboration

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.760
of Maori language
immersion schools from Waitaha.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.600
In their challenge to
the Minister of Education,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.240
they encourage her to listen
to the needs of their schools.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.320
We did what we set out to
do. We did it well.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.400
From Waitaha to the Hutt Valley
with Te Hua o Tai Katorika,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.240
a collaboration of Catholic
schools from the Hutt Valley.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.400
This is a lament to the late
kapa haka matriarch, Pima Wehi.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.600
Over to the experts in the
art of poi in Otaki,

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840
Te Kapa o Otaki Te Rahui Kura.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.720
It was good.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.440
We've no voices left now,
but that's OK.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:32.080
Over to the west, with these Waikato
taniwha, Nga Taiatea Wharekura.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.440
We did what we had to do in terms
of haka, thanks to our hard work.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.480
I think we reached our pinnacle
today, and I'm happy with that.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.720
It seems there is
a lot to contend with.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.520
Rapaera Tawhai, Te Karere.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:10.320
Joining me now is one of the
competition judges, Rahui Papa.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.480
What's the standard
of performance been like amongst

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.240
the schools this year?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:22.040
Since its first concept in 2000,
the standard has improved each year.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.280
We've seen a lot of physical moves
improving the quality of the haka,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.080
poi and other items.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.160
Maori music in its essence
is the greatest achievement.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.520
Reflecting on the performances
this week, who stood out for you?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.160
Out for the 43 teams today,
I would say the 43 teams.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.120
I think I'll sit on the
fence for this one.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.240
Is that a judge's perspective?

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.400
Definitely.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.760
Sit on the fence?

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.440
Yes. I'll reserve my opinion
until the results are announced.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.080
So I'll keep my thoughts
to myself at this stage.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.680
So you're not going
to tell us who won?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.760
No, I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.720
Rahui Papa,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.880
thank you and the rest
of the judging panel for your

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.280
hard work over the last week.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.320
Peata, you can definitely feel
the anticipation in the air

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.560
as prize-giving gets underway.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.160
There's a lot at stake. The question
is will the current champions,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.160
Lytton High School from Gisborne,
hold onto the title?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:41.360
During our half-hour show,
we'll try to let you know who won.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.480
For now, back to you.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.480
Thank you, Scotty.
