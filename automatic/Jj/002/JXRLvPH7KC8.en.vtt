00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
delivered yesterday the fusion

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.260 
delivered yesterday the fusion
accelerator<00:01:09.729> electronic<00:01:10.729> device<00:01:10.999> I'm

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
accelerator electronic device I'm

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.209 
accelerator electronic device I'm
supposed<00:01:11.509> to<00:01:11.539> put<00:01:11.719> behind<00:01:11.869> my<00:01:12.139> neck<00:01:12.219> 30

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
supposed to put behind my neck 30

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.709 
supposed to put behind my neck 30
minutes<00:01:13.520> a<00:01:13.579> day<00:01:13.759> I<00:01:14.090> don't<00:01:14.359> know<00:01:14.479> how<00:01:14.659> many

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
minutes a day I don't know how many

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.539 
minutes a day I don't know how many
months<00:01:15.170> I'll<00:01:15.380> have<00:01:15.499> to<00:01:15.590> do<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.009> I<00:01:16.039> think<00:01:16.249> what

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
months I'll have to do so I think what

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.849 
months I'll have to do so I think what
they'll<00:01:16.670> probably<00:01:16.880> do<00:01:17.299> is<00:01:17.539> I<00:01:17.810> have<00:01:18.649> another

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:18.859 
they'll probably do is I have another

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:20.709 
they'll probably do is I have another
doctor's<00:01:19.579> appointment<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:19.939> three<00:01:20.450> months

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
doctor's appointment and three months

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.389 
doctor's appointment and three months
from<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.469> surgery<00:01:21.799> I'll<00:01:21.979> probably<00:01:22.130> get<00:01:22.340> an

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
from the surgery I'll probably get an

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:24.399 
from the surgery I'll probably get an
x-ray<00:01:22.999> and<00:01:23.119> see<00:01:23.179> how<00:01:23.359> the<00:01:23.420> fusion<00:01:23.749> is<00:01:23.899> going<00:01:24.229> I

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
x-ray and see how the fusion is going I

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.410 
x-ray and see how the fusion is going I
don't<00:01:25.100> know<00:01:25.219> if<00:01:25.399> I'll<00:01:25.520> be<00:01:25.549> done<00:01:25.819> then<00:01:26.060> if<00:01:26.240> not

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
don't know if I'll be done then if not

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.819 
don't know if I'll be done then if not
we'll<00:01:26.659> continue<00:01:26.869> probably<00:01:27.380> another<00:01:27.560> three

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
we'll continue probably another three

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.699 
we'll continue probably another three
months<00:01:27.979> and<00:01:28.219> take<00:01:28.340> another<00:01:28.549> x-ray<00:01:28.609> until<00:01:29.709> the

00:01:30.699 --> 00:01:30.709 
months and take another x-ray until the

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:31.870 
months and take another x-ray until the
proper<00:01:31.039> amount<00:01:31.189> of<00:01:31.219> fusion<00:01:31.520> has<00:01:31.609> been<00:01:31.729> done

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
proper amount of fusion has been done

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.510 
proper amount of fusion has been done
and<00:01:32.029> I'm<00:01:32.450> basically<00:01:32.899> solid<00:01:33.170> to<00:01:33.439> where<00:01:33.560> you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
and I'm basically solid to where you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.709 
and I'm basically solid to where you
know<00:01:34.639> it's<00:01:34.909> not<00:01:34.999> just<00:01:35.060> the<00:01:35.329> screws<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.630> the

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 
know it's not just the screws and the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.209 
know it's not just the screws and the
plate<00:01:35.869> holding<00:01:36.049> together<00:01:36.289> I'm<00:01:36.380> actually<00:01:36.529> my

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
plate holding together I'm actually my

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.800 
plate holding together I'm actually my
bones<00:01:37.549> are<00:01:37.850> holding<00:01:38.179> themselves<00:01:38.329> together

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
bones are holding themselves together

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.709 
bones are holding themselves together
with<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.139> fusion<00:01:39.909> I'm<00:01:40.909> very<00:01:41.119> very<00:01:41.299> happy<00:01:41.479> that

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:41.719 
with the fusion I'm very very happy that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:44.139

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.220 
cars I do not suggest that I think just
take<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> extra<00:03:01.390> time<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.629> sit<00:03:02.019> there<00:03:02.170> and

take the extra time and sit there and
just<00:03:02.349> let<00:03:02.470> people<00:03:02.590> go<00:03:02.829> because<00:03:03.540> it's<00:03:04.540> not

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
just let people go because it's not

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
worth trying to you know move too fast

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.080 
worth trying to you know move too fast
and<00:03:06.790> maybe<00:03:06.879> get<00:03:07.090> anything<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.569> hurt<00:03:09.000> but<00:03:10.000> I've

and maybe get anything to hurt but I've
taken<00:03:10.269> it<00:03:10.359> really<00:03:10.629> slow<00:03:11.069> as<00:03:12.069> far<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.579> well

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
taken it really slow as far as well

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.250 
taken it really slow as far as well
maybe<00:03:13.750> not<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.290> slow<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.900> I'm<00:03:16.959> gone<00:03:17.079> very

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
maybe not so slow I think I'm gone very

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.870 
maybe not so slow I think I'm gone very
well<00:03:17.319> with<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.739> physical<00:03:18.190> therapy<00:03:18.519> I'm<00:03:18.639> doing

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
well with the physical therapy I'm doing

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.599 
well with the physical therapy I'm doing
everything<00:03:19.120> that<00:03:19.359> doctor<00:03:19.630> said<00:03:19.870> to<00:03:19.989> do<00:03:20.609> you

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
everything that doctor said to do you

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:22.979 
everything that doctor said to do you
know<00:03:21.730> I<00:03:21.760> think<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> people<00:03:22.299> that<00:03:22.510> started<00:03:22.870> on

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
know I think the people that started on

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.409 
know I think the people that started on
the<00:03:23.079> plastic<00:03:23.500> non<00:03:24.250> moveable<00:03:24.819> neck<00:03:25.180> brace<00:03:25.389> for

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:25.419 
the plastic non moveable neck brace for

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:26.970 
the plastic non moveable neck brace for
a<00:03:25.690> week<00:03:25.840> or<00:03:26.019> two<00:03:26.139> and<00:03:26.260> then<00:03:26.380> start<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.590> PT

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
a week or two and then start the PT

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.150 
a week or two and then start the PT
after<00:03:27.190> that<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.930> don't<00:03:28.930> think<00:03:29.349> that<00:03:29.440> that<00:03:29.950> would

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
after that I don't think that that would

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.759 
after that I don't think that that would
have<00:03:30.280> been<00:03:30.400> for<00:03:30.579> me<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:32.530> know<00:03:32.620> would<00:03:32.739> have

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
have been for me you know would have

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.619 
have been for me you know would have
been<00:03:32.919> a<00:03:32.950> long<00:03:33.160> time<00:03:33.549> before<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:34.000> would<00:03:34.299> get<00:03:34.480> to

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:34.629 
been a long time before I would get to

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:36.300 
been a long time before I would get to
where<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.810> feel<00:03:35.049> like<00:03:35.230> I<00:03:35.440> do<00:03:35.560> now<00:03:35.919> which

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
where I feel like I do now which

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.569 
where I feel like I do now which
basically<00:03:36.879> I<00:03:37.060> feel<00:03:37.299> like<00:03:38.280> before<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.340> had<00:03:39.400> the

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
basically I feel like before I had the

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.220 
basically I feel like before I had the
surgery<00:03:39.760> except<00:03:40.329> I<00:03:40.389> don't<00:03:40.569> have<00:03:40.720> any<00:03:40.870> pain<00:03:41.079> at
