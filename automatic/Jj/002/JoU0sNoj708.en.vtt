 but 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.419
 photo 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:15.419
 but 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.039
 hello to all ugly guys first date with t yahoo 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.740

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.099
 videoanteprima 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.769
 the novelty then karaoke 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.269
 this is why we sincerely thank the developers of the equilibrium game 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:37.600
 stock football flies on applications 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.670
 preview 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.530
 and that I love you to show you take what has existed tapir terrine am cor in 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.700
 over the next few weeks 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.840
 then equilibrium comment in me centers suggests the title 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.440
 it's a game 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.920
 which is based on 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.340
 then on the use of the cerro I put to go h &amp; to interact with what i 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.100
 temples of this title 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 - coldiretti on everything 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.930
 clearly better after a shine 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.759
 in the world there will be 3 2 two straight lines 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.039
 central floors 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.280
 time-consuming, heavenly elements to be avoided 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.360
 etc. dates and this orange squares refer back instead that ita collect from 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.430
 collect for surfing points and go ahead% with the game 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.960
 the parts are clean as I love you too distinguished for tickets tunnels 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.649
 to come 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.469
 if I say that I select I will take our kusturica to those 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.520
 areas we will not be touched by which film itrendly excused heavenly 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 here we will find ourselves completely safe 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 however clearly described as such the game makes absolutely no media 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.140
 so let's go tint and press start 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.860
 and we see that there are these two cursors can be controlled 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.190
 with the use of turkey 4 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.430
 and you see goldsmith, it is fragmenti petrini creator the aifon to make people laugh and billy 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.500
 the bend to the video 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.650
 I touched this light blue triangle and then the game arrived linux 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.470
 index up with you and delays clean trains 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.340
 feet gather the largest possible number of small orange squares 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.669
 try again m too 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.839
 which I have to say that the game 

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.169
 really very very sensitive 

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.529
 in what i am 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.599
 why to 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.959
 the response to the commands and in my opinion can really be won 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.469
 difficult or impossible to play for example in the car by train or in any case where 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.459
 is not a stable plan 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.659
 you and concentrate and rt black abata these cursors perna control 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.229
 joe how do you say why 

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:50.129
 yes you can't 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.390
 hr really have a firm, firm control of ifold 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.139
 every minimum imperceptible movement of registered postures 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.509
 and therefore see you very soon indeed the first true why 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.799
 too many celestial triangles come in really many 

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:13.149
 just ne estrenem 1 in the move you will be my life 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:19.039
 there are still no continuous candy in the lives to spend 

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:22.259
 but minimotovr we will be unity quality 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:25.199
 the maximum ponzoni in short, it seems that he dies 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.659
 and should start again to try to reach a higher score 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.459
 high 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.440
 appreciates in my opinion is the soundtrack asks subtracted game cost 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
 discounted background music 

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:56.239
 pity there is no sound effect when collecting a small square 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.629
 heavenly afterwards when you touch like this case a trampoline hotel dino angioletti 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:01.320
 at your place 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.539
 or how many touches to the mill dinners 

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:06.669
 also collisions 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:11.659
 I do not highlight the latter I know. a graphic trick 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.420
 that he could certainly sell more 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 uuh obvious 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.189
 the fact of having made the mistake 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:24.229
 however as I said r. sonorous view of the salad very low back 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:25.289
 nice 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.279
 that we cannot know if e 

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:32.659
 in the semifinals the title will be there maybe you were this 

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:38.240
 Corinna magically maybe even other background songs hated environments of 

00:04:38.239 --> 00:04:39.879
 chris. Our 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.650
 certain color combinations 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.350
 game surely eh looks like this at first glance really a lot 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.909
 hard 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:51.089
 and it really takes a moment to succeed 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.389
 hand in it 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:56.389
 I think the idea is very pretty 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.839
 this maybe to be that freedom - for notary dogs I find that 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.370
 cinema tonight touches starting 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.949
 poetry you have to control these sudoku stores 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:12.120
 answer while I wait for one of his fans all 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.610
 it is not facebook assistant you are eyes on two different points 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.069
 therefore the difficulties really arise immediately 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.780
 for the rest as an act of provocation concept really - 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:30.919
 I hope if the ending 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.949
 this 4 remains the same if you don't have any small improvements 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.849
 and surely a great product will not come out 

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:39.300
 that 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:43.080
 we will be able to review its full version as soon as it arrives in the appstore 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.180
 saying this, I thank you for the exam as always, I invite you to
