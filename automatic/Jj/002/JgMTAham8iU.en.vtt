00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.170 

I<00:00:21.710> went<00:00:22.710> online<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.460> looking<00:00:23.670> for<00:00:23.820> some<00:00:23.939> six

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
I went online I was looking for some six

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060 
I went online I was looking for some six
volt<00:00:24.390> lightbulbs<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.140> both<00:00:25.289> wagon<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.859> ran

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
volt lightbulbs for the both wagon I ran

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
volt lightbulbs for the both wagon I ran
across<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.580> little<00:00:26.880> babes<00:00:27.060> these<00:00:27.480> are<00:00:27.720> LEDs

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
across these little babes these are LEDs

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.650 
across these little babes these are LEDs
six<00:00:29.039> volt<00:00:29.310> they're<00:00:30.150> kind<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> wicked

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
six volt they're kind of wicked

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.030 
six volt they're kind of wicked
expensive<00:00:31.170> but<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.439> thinking<00:00:31.590> well<00:00:31.920> they

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
expensive but I was thinking well they

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.580 
expensive but I was thinking well they
might<00:00:32.219> work<00:00:32.489> better<00:00:32.730> or<00:00:32.850> last<00:00:33.300> better<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.410> one

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
might work better or last better so one

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
might work better or last better so one
of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> things<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.010> noticed<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.910> said<00:00:36.239> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
of the things I noticed it said that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.869 
of the things I noticed it said that
they<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:37.559> less<00:00:37.890> power<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.579> thinking

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
they use less power and I'm thinking

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.389 
they use less power and I'm thinking
well<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> could<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.660> problem<00:00:40.129> if<00:00:41.129> you've

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
well that could be a problem if you've

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.190 
well that could be a problem if you've
got<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> flasher<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.360> activates<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
got a flasher that activates on the

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.799 
got a flasher that activates on the
amount<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> power<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.129> pulls<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.210> went

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
amount of power that it pulls so I went

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.889 
amount of power that it pulls so I went
ahead<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.170> put<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.920> back<00:00:47.670> here<00:00:48.059> looks

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
ahead and I put one in back here looks

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
ahead and I put one in back here looks
pretty<00:00:49.140> cool<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.649> don't<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.219> how<00:00:50.399> much

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
pretty cool I don't know how much

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.970 
pretty cool I don't know how much
different<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.000> would<00:00:51.059> look<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> lens<00:00:51.660> on

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
different it would look with the lens on

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.600 
different it would look with the lens on
then<00:00:52.980> find<00:00:53.250> out<00:00:53.430> right<00:00:53.579> quick

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
then find out right quick

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
then find out right quick
yeah<00:00:56.610> probably<00:00:57.059> can't<00:00:57.420> tell<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:57.629> much

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
yeah probably can't tell that much

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.869 
yeah probably can't tell that much
difference<00:00:59.359> but<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> problem<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.879> noticed

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
difference but the problem is I noticed

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
difference but the problem is I noticed
when<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.000> changed<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.989> flasher<00:01:04.500> kind

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
when I changed it that the flasher kind

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
when I changed it that the flasher kind
of<00:01:04.949> slowed<00:01:05.220> down<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.650> sure<00:01:07.680> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of slowed down well just to be sure I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
of slowed down well just to be sure I
went<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.460> front<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.930> still<00:01:10.140> got<00:01:10.350> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
went up front because I still got a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.340 
went up front because I still got a
regular<00:01:10.799> six<00:01:11.040> volt<00:01:11.280> bulb<00:01:11.460> up<00:01:11.760> here<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:13.110> I

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
regular six volt bulb up here and I

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.520 
regular six volt bulb up here and I
pulled<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.830> bulb<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.869> put<00:01:15.869> an<00:01:15.960> LED<00:01:16.380> in

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
pulled this bulb out and put an LED in

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:17.929 
pulled this bulb out and put an LED in
it<00:01:16.740> when<00:01:16.920> I<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.430> stopped<00:01:17.640> flashing

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
it when I did that it stopped flashing

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.770 
it when I did that it stopped flashing
altogether<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.570> telling<00:01:21.570> me<00:01:21.630> exactly

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
altogether so that is telling me exactly

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
altogether so that is telling me exactly
what<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.229> was<00:01:22.409> afraid<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.979> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.220> find

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
what I was afraid I was going to find

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.080 
what I was afraid I was going to find
out<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:23.970> these<00:01:24.210> bulbs<00:01:25.850> don't<00:01:26.850> pull

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
out is that these bulbs don't pull

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.859 
out is that these bulbs don't pull
enough<00:01:27.360> power<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.400> activate<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.869> flasher

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
enough power to activate that flasher

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.899 
enough power to activate that flasher
now<00:01:31.320> sure<00:01:31.530> what<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.710> mean<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.549> how<00:01:32.700> fast

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
now sure what I mean you see how fast

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.980 
now sure what I mean you see how fast
this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.360> flashing<00:01:33.920> take<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.840> and<00:01:36.840> I'll

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
this is flashing take it out and I'll

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.350 
this is flashing take it out and I'll
put<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.619> in<00:01:38.130> this<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.049> regular<00:01:40.049> bulb

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
put this one in this is the regular bulb

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.760 
put this one in this is the regular bulb
now<00:01:42.360> it's<00:01:42.540> flashing<00:01:42.810> faster

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
now it's flashing faster

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.039 
now it's flashing faster
the<00:01:44.460> reason<00:01:44.790> is<00:01:44.880> flashing<00:01:45.119> faster<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.750> because

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
the reason is flashing faster is because

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.609 
the reason is flashing faster is because
it's<00:01:46.200> pulling<00:01:46.500> more<00:01:46.649> energy<00:01:47.780> which<00:01:48.780> activates

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it's pulling more energy which activates

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
it's pulling more energy which activates
that<00:01:49.770> flasher<00:01:50.430> that's<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.030> makes<00:01:51.299> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
that flasher that's what that makes the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.940 
that flasher that's what that makes the
flash<00:01:51.630> of<00:01:51.810> work<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> amount<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:52.799> energy

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
flash of work is the amount of energy

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
flash of work is the amount of energy
that<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.340> takes<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.640> light<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.030> bulb<00:01:54.470> so<00:01:56.000> with

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that it takes to light the bulb so with

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.639 
that it takes to light the bulb so with
that's<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> don't<00:01:57.719> guess<00:01:58.259> I'm<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> be

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that's it I don't guess I'm going to be

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.560 
that's it I don't guess I'm going to be
using<00:01:58.950> these<00:01:59.280> LED<00:01:59.790> lights<00:02:00.030> for<00:02:00.210> certain

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
using these LED lights for certain

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.499 
using these LED lights for certain
signals<00:02:00.899> however<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.649> might<00:02:02.399> swap<00:02:02.759> these<00:02:03.030> brake

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
signals however I might swap these brake

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.990 
signals however I might swap these brake
lights<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:04.110> just<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.920> see<00:02:05.100> how<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.280> works<00:02:05.640> so

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
lights out just to see how that works so

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.580 
lights out just to see how that works so
what<00:02:06.930> I'll<00:02:07.049> do<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> Allah<00:02:09.110> I'll<00:02:10.110> set<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.440> guys

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
what I'll do is Allah I'll set you guys

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.250 
what I'll do is Allah I'll set you guys
back<00:02:10.860> up<00:02:10.890> here<00:02:11.390> I'll<00:02:12.390> turn<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.750> flasher

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
back up here I'll turn the flasher

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.140 
back up here I'll turn the flasher
mouse-click<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.830> stick<00:02:14.220> on<00:02:14.400> my<00:02:14.519> bottle<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
mouse-click a stick on my bottle the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.630 
mouse-click a stick on my bottle the
light<00:02:15.299> up<00:02:15.450> those<00:02:15.540> back<00:02:15.810> break<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.489> cup<00:02:17.489> and

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
light up those back break one cup and
