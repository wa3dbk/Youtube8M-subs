00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:04.870
 hello good afternoon everyone welcome 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.470
 to the stage the voice of the people edition 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.019
 boxing again no floyd money mayweather 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.669
 has left has left saying he is going to 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.810
 face what is frames the Chinese 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:19.270
 maidana in september of this year the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.420
 rematch that they had asked so much both 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.180
 in the media in there are positives and 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.610
 negative not positive thoughts and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.540
 negative thoughts of this one 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.270
 this fight the first one is a relief not 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.400
 because from the one of jose luis castle the 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.160
 equality does not give a rematch to anyone 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.630
 no one's from anyone and that fight 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.290
 true that was quite controversial 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:46.510
 with a castle that hit him hit him in 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.489
 the hip hit him 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.199
 in the bag hit him a little bit 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.570
 behind his back he hit him from behind 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.399
 the head made a fight like that 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.890
 had to have done Saúl Álvarez and the 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.129
 who tried to make Miguel angel cotto 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.010
 when he was with mayweather that is a 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.740
 boxer who gets very frustrated when he 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.890
 you use the already constantly on your face and 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.100
 applies expression expression without sin 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.870
 head like what the Chinese did 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:19.130
 maidana who had come from ex 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.270
 of being a boxer very much improved with 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.370
 García has been with the García with 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.830
 Roberto Garcia and with the great for Garcia 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.110
 what is it I think your father who is a 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:32.070
 spectacular coach the coach 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.420
 which was that fernando was the fierce 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.520
 Vargas tremendous boxer no and that of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.350
 truth has taught maidana to open 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 the door of what boxing is with him 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.850
 with the iab if we see a maidana and up 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.090
 for example with against mier kan yes it is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.719
 true that Amir Khan almost almost finished 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:59.170
 nucleated no yes it is true that 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:02:02.049
 in those previous fights to what it was to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.719
 what was the tour brawn that grows a 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.810
 incredible beating has done in brawn and the 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.789
 true that it was spectacular no no no 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.489
 would have with not opening the combinations of 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.800
 punches at speed or without speed 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.110
 with him and what happens is that he has been 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.379
 with roberto garcía the truth that you 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.069
 He has seen a Chinese Maidana much more 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.980
 much more 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.049
 thinking in April open all the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.690
 combinations of blows with him already then 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:33.090
 what was given pretty bad 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.190
 Ambiguity with was also very bad 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.430
 with miguel cotto is the flown is the 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.940
 flown not from right that launched 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.090
 that launched maidana that were 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.400
 quite the connector enough not to floyd 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.660
 and the truth is that it hurt him a lot 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.290
 there was controversy apparently with the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.709
 gloves 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.430
 it is said that no wadding the line vi 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.299
 who is the manager of floyd mayweather 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.660
 you know and espn 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:05.940
 this news that he was paid below 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.579
 of the table let's say 1.5 million 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.120
 dollars to what was the Chinese field 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.780
 maidana 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.480
 and Roberto García not 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.819
 by using gloves with which he left 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.550
 and not the ones I wanted with the ones I wanted 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.420
 leave with the Argentine flag 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.090
 I think that 102 so nothing too 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
 it's a controversial game in 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.060
 predictions for the fight 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.340
 no one gave him a fight so 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.040
 interesting not so entertaining let's say to 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.010
 mayweather since it may be that cotto or 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.190
 it may be that jose Luis castle even 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:44.730
 or reflect what happens is that in that 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.650
 fight joe cortez the referee the truth 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.570
 that every time I did week and pressure 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.420
 hand that was a tremendous bronzer of 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.340
 pressure did not separate them and that the truth 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.190
 is that he favored a lot very much 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.100
 to floyd or against oscar from the hole that the 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.890
 'wise to measure the short distance very well 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.680
 he pressed him and threw tremendous amount of 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.410
 hits to the oscar of the hole and it was a 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.660
 very close fight that could have gone 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.989
 for one side to another no but yes it is 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.830
 true that it seems to me that mayweather 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.900
 you have them the goods do not 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.459
 to adjust a little more to not 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.459
 stay so much in him 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.380
 against the ropes and whenever you feel 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:31.080
 the twin on the rope in one of the 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.319
 ropes rotate and pivot and 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.639
 do 12 and cover yourself a little bit more 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:37.860
 up to be a little better in 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.090
 physical condition and maidana what has 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.720
 what to do is exactly the same fight 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.210
 what happens that the fight does not read 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:48.170
 is the only style that Maidana has is 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:50.090
 a pretty unilateral push button that 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.010
 has only one address and only knows 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.050
 do one thing and that is to shoot punch 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.600
 and shit fucking everyone crazy 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.970
 those who place a fight like that was how he won 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.110
 to browne edition and tending by giving it a 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.770
 beating what happens is that it does not have 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.120
 comparison 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.980
 browne will floyd mayweather 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.980
 because because he 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.390
 he is a very smart boxer and loose 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.600
 does not then have any amount of 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.690
 resources can open with the initial 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.670
 hits with the with the right with the 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.700
 left can be with him with him already 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.220
 it may be moving to your left 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:27.320
 throwing the left hook can not 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.980
 be for lately we have also 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:35.210
 seen on Sunday and see how James did 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.970
 zone and that one gets does not get under 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.070
 gives a down upper and leaves on the side what 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:42.740
 that he did very well against getting 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.240
 per click what was james tony that 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.200
 they also want a genius not from the 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.420
 boxing 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.030
 but if I think it's going to be a fight 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:52.530
 pretty entertaining but I think it's going 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.930
 to be a victory much more clearly 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:58.200
 of your mobile because it will not be 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.670
 is not going to get into exchanges 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.040
 of unnecessary strokes I think it's going 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.290
 to stay from outside and box from 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.140
 outside and from the outside the truth is that at 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:10.140
 Chinese maidana you can be 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.600
 box well and no it's not a good boxer 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:15.990
 it's a farandole and that shoots a lot 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.060
 so nothing blows it deserves 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.770
 chinese maidana the truth I am very very 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.990
 happy for him and I hope he makes a 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.630
 piece of fight and that will stay very much 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.880
 money but my prediction is floyd 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.010
 mayweather by unanimous decision in 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.250
 September here in the box next to the 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.450
