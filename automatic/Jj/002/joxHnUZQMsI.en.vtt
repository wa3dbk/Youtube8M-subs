00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.870

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.000
 shriver is dedicated to football as well as 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.610
 we dedicate it to tell health each one of 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.219
 the present comment about his 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.800
 specialty but I'll see if I 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.470
 comment I say to go to the health issue 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.769
 specifically he must give several names 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.470
 flavonol epicatechin polyphenols al 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.439
 nitric oxide you but have to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.990
 is speaking all that sounds like 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.660
 hieroglyphics chemist because all that is 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.239
 in chocolate 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.150
 and they are not bad words they are great 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.739
 words because all these according to 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.760
 the investigations that my good 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.110
 friend professor caesar fraga of the 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.180
 university buenos aires faculty of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.980
 pharmacy and biochemistry the expert in 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.960
 antioxidants surely more important 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.730
 I know this about the world because I have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.800
 accompanied by a couple of congresses 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.570
 international and has been applauded by 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.170
 the things he says counts and those he knows 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:04.320
 so Professor César Fraga has just 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:13.229
 remember that you have to have this rich 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:15.780
 these substances is black and black 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.250
 the essential components of chocolate 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.250
 bitter after that the brand 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.760
 [Applause] 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.670
 chocolate made with cocoa beans 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.850
 selected from 45 places 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.170
 the Savior 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.869
 Honduras 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:49.140
 of foundation is a blind tasting and 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:53.369
 this line did not come to that chocolate 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.190
 bitter to 85% from 80 percent of 75 to 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.570
 70 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.330
 come with coffee beans or with 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:06.390
 almonds and there are different types is the 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.890
 you have all this substance there 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.619
 a company that calls the company's 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.480
 chocolate 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.260
 that remains here in palé tree of games 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.970
 bring the owner who tells us that there is 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.970
 several is impressive 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.260
 obviously, but it's worth understanding 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.709
 that these substances that you mentioned that 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.629
 they are in that type of chocolate 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.090
 dilate the arteries lower the pressure 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.560
 arterial and what Caesar has discovered 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.610
 Fraga is precisely the mechanism to 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.409
 through which these substances 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.760
 present in the chocolate lower the 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.220
 blood pressure why because 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.170
 stimulate inside the cells that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.150
 are in the arteries the release of 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.340
 a gas called nitric oxide that is 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.799
 vasodilator are of cali not just 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.599
 discover plates so chocolate 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.690
 have this declares you will say but 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:54.829
 doctor how much with that ask your 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.750
 doctor because it depends on your 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:03:02.890
 circumstances and also that one can not 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 recommend singer with a lot of fat 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.170
 do not insist with the doctor that 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.170
 fairly normal
