there<00:00:02.100> are<00:00:02.280> three<00:00:02.550> main<00:00:02.760> ways<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.000> Casper<00:00:03.659> if

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
there are three main ways to Casper if

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.660 
there are three main ways to Casper if
you<00:00:04.410> can<00:00:04.560> already<00:00:04.800> ArrayList<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.430> the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
you can already ArrayList and the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.160 
you can already ArrayList and the
easiest<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.180> learn<00:00:06.300> will<00:00:06.540> be<00:00:06.570> the<00:00:06.810> rail<00:00:06.990> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
easiest to learn will be the rail to

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.919 
easiest to learn will be the rail to
Casper<00:00:07.620> get<00:00:08.519> in<00:00:08.639> he'll<00:00:08.820> side<00:00:09.090> rail<00:00:09.330> stand<00:00:09.719> and

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
Casper get in he'll side rail stand and

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.350 
Casper get in he'll side rail stand and

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
board forward so you'll land over the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.010 
board forward so you'll land over the
tail<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> cradle<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> board<00:00:50.760> a

tail and it has to cradle the board a
flick<00:00:52.020> is<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> semicircle<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:53.219> flips<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
flick is a semicircle that flips the

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
flick is a semicircle that flips the
board<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.660> goes<00:00:54.840> down<00:00:55.199> under<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> catch

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
board then goes down under it to catch

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.650 
board then goes down under it to catch
the<00:00:56.579> Casper<00:01:01.609> the<00:01:02.609> last<00:01:02.850> way<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.090> Casper<00:01:03.539> is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the Casper the last way to Casper is

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
the Casper the last way to Casper is
very<00:01:03.870> similar<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> heel<00:01:04.739> side<00:01:04.980> rail<00:01:05.220> stand

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
very similar to a heel side rail stand

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.719 
very similar to a heel side rail stand
but<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> board<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.689> twice<00:01:07.200> as<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.610> sign<00:01:08.610> up

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but the board is twice as much sign up

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.730 
but the board is twice as much sign up
in<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> very<00:01:09.090> exaggerated<00:01:09.900> heel<00:01:10.200> side<00:01:10.470> rail

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
in a very exaggerated heel side rail

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.010 
in a very exaggerated heel side rail

toe on the heel side ready to pop down

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.179 
toe on the heel side ready to pop down
start<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.930> pop<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> heel<00:01:19.439> side<00:01:19.710> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> board

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
start to pop the heel side of the board

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.550 
start to pop the heel side of the board
downwards<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> same<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:22.110> push<00:01:22.380> it

forward so you will land balanced over

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.510 
forward so you will land balanced over
the<00:01:24.390> tail<00:01:24.600> by<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.560> time<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> board<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.400> at
