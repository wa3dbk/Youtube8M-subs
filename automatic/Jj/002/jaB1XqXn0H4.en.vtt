 hello everyone here we are again with 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.039
 a new video on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.669
 teach them how they can activate what is 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.169
 Private mode on the Samsung Galaxy S 5 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.419
 many times we lend our 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.550
 mobile device to a friend and we leave 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.480
 uncovered our files as 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 photo gallery as videos as music 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.540
 private thing we know that there are other 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.240
 applications aimed at that goal 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.130
 that hide photos but you have to 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.980
 install it from the playstation though 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.800
 samsung has thought about this option and has 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.290
 enabled an option that calls you in 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.200
 Private mode to hide that comes to 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.110
 which is part of the system to activate 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.390
 This private mode on the Samsung Galaxy S 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.580
 5 just give us to our bar 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.980
 notifications and we're going to go to our 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.619
 adjustments and within our settings 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.600
 let's go to what is the option of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.600
 customization and once we're in 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.479
 the customization screen the 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.539
 first option that says private mode 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.340
 we click on the icon and how can 

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:22.579
 see here the first screen we get 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.350
 to make the adjustments here says that 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.499
 we can use private mode in the 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.929
 gallery video music recorder and up 

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:31.680
 our file folder we are going to 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:34.560
 put next 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.050
 and let's start we can do it 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.630
 using a ping pattern using a 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.000
 password or through our fingerprint 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.340
 digital let's do it using a ping 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.950
 as an example but you can 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.560
 employ any cell phone option that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.820
 have seen on the screen we are going to put 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.619

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.170
 finish and we will confirm 2 3 4 and 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.830
 we analyze once you have done this 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.560
 we're just going to leave the screen 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.850
 and we're going to go to our gallery 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.940
