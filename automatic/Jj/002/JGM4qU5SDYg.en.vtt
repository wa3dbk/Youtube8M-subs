00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
game I really didn't expect that so to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.779 
game I really didn't expect that so to
get<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:56.160> shift<00:00:56.340> right<00:00:56.550> away<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
get into the first shift right away I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.270 
get into the first shift right away I
think<00:00:56.910> helped<00:00:57.329> end<00:00:58.170> up<00:00:58.379> taking<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> big<00:00:58.859> hit<00:00:58.890> so

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
difference to this the speed of the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.250 
difference to this the speed of the
players<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.909> like<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.540> like<00:01:12.900> I<00:01:12.990> said<00:01:13.170> the
