initial configuration is called JP

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.450 
initial configuration is called JP
manager<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.500> can<00:01:42.530> get<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.190> singleton<00:01:45.100> or<00:01:46.100> JP

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
manager you can get a singleton or JP

for you by the SDK so here we say game

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.600 
for you by the SDK so here we say game
state<00:02:59.330> launch<00:02:59.630> and<00:03:01.150> now<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.209> are<00:03:03.250> ready<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.400> go

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
state launch and now we are ready to go

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.289 
state launch and now we are ready to go
to<00:03:04.670> view<00:03:05.150> controller<00:03:05.540> here<00:03:06.970> let's<00:03:07.970> get<00:03:08.120> rid

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
to view controller here let's get rid

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.160 
to view controller here let's get rid
all<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.630> nonsense

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.330 

and<00:03:19.239> when<00:03:20.239> our<00:03:20.360> view<00:03:20.569> appears<00:03:20.930> well<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.220> this

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
and when our view appears well so this

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.110 
and when our view appears well so this
view<00:03:22.580> controller<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.090> our<00:03:23.209> theoretical<00:03:23.620> menu

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120 
view controller is our theoretical menu

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.600 
view controller is our theoretical menu
will<00:03:29.500> it's<00:03:30.500> not<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.800> to<00:03:30.890> be<00:03:30.980> much<00:03:31.190> right<00:03:31.459> now

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
will it's not going to be much right now

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.470 
will it's not going to be much right now
for<00:03:31.819> the<00:03:31.880> sample<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:34.760> can<00:03:34.910> build<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.270> in<00:03:35.390> a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
for the sample but we can build it in a

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.340 
for the sample but we can build it in a
way<00:03:35.630> that<00:03:36.069> it<00:03:37.069> could<00:03:37.220> handle<00:03:37.520> a<00:03:37.610> menu<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:39.230> let's

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
way that it could handle a menu so let's

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.620 
way that it could handle a menu so let's
implement<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:40.069> Jaypee<00:03:40.610> device<00:03:41.269> delegate<00:03:42.100> met

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
implement the Jaypee device delegate met

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.420 
implement the Jaypee device delegate met
device<00:03:44.630> delegate<00:03:45.170> protocol<00:03:45.590> and<00:03:45.860> the<00:03:45.920> JP

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
device delegate protocol and the JP

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:54.400 
device delegate protocol and the JP
manager<00:03:47.120> delegate<00:03:47.540> protocol<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.900> we<00:03:54.260> can

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
manager delegate protocol and we can

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.300 
manager delegate protocol and we can
implement<00:03:54.709> those<00:03:55.040> methods<00:03:56.890> first<00:03:57.890> with<00:03:58.130> joy

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
implement those methods first with joy

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:00.250 
implement those methods first with joy
pad<00:03:58.519> manager<00:03:58.970> will<00:03:59.150> implement<00:03:59.569> it<00:03:59.900> connect

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
pad manager will implement it connect

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:09.039 
pad manager will implement it connect
and<00:04:03.549> disconnect<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:07.970> in<00:04:08.299> the<00:04:08.390> body<00:04:08.600> of<00:04:08.750> these

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049 
and disconnect and in the body of these

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.350 
and disconnect and in the body of these
will<00:04:09.830> set<00:04:10.190> the<00:04:10.400> newly<00:04:10.670> connected<00:04:11.060> devices

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
will set the newly connected devices

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:27.930 
will set the newly connected devices
delegate<00:04:13.720> self<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:20.709> will<00:04:21.709> logout<00:04:22.340> for<00:04:23.030> now

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:38.020 

we've<00:04:28.940> connected<00:04:29.210> to<00:04:29.510> somebody

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:42.230 

okay<00:04:39.379> now<00:04:40.379> those<00:04:41.009> are<00:04:41.039> the<00:04:41.370> joypad<00:04:41.580> manager

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
okay now those are the joypad manager

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760 
okay now those are the joypad manager
delegate<00:04:42.750> methods<00:04:43.110> now<00:04:43.319> for<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.590> joypad

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
delegate methods now for the joypad

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.830 
delegate methods now for the joypad
device<00:04:44.280> delegate<00:04:44.669> methods<00:04:46.879> we<00:04:47.879> are<00:04:48.389> using<00:04:48.629> the

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
device delegate methods we are using the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.860 
device delegate methods we are using the
JP<00:04:49.169> navigation<00:04:49.800> layout<00:04:50.129> so<00:04:50.550> the<00:04:51.419> delegate

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
JP navigation layout so the delegate

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.869 
JP navigation layout so the delegate
method<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.289> we<00:04:52.409> implement<00:04:52.650> is<00:04:52.979> joypad

00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:53.879 
method that we implement is joypad

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.809 
method that we implement is joypad
device<00:04:54.210> didn't<00:04:54.689> navigate<00:04:55.400> and<00:04:56.400> we<00:04:56.490> can<00:04:56.610> take<00:04:56.789> a

00:04:56.809 --> 00:04:56.819 
device didn't navigate and we can take a

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.339 
device didn't navigate and we can take a
look<00:04:57.000> at<00:04:57.150> this<00:04:57.300> JP<00:04:57.810> nav<00:04:58.110> button<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.740> know<00:05:00.349> all

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
look at this JP nav button you know all

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.439 
look at this JP nav button you know all
the<00:05:01.590> constants<00:05:01.979> for<00:05:02.099> the<00:05:02.219> SDK<00:05:02.610> are<00:05:02.759> defined<00:05:03.150> in
