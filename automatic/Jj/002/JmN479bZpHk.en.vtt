00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.170
 Now we will cut the jacket with 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.850
 the hood which is in English manners 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.060
 youth call hoodie 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.880
 or a sweatshirt pattern I made 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.220
 Olhov's faith and they are already laid out on 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.800
 my site by the link you see 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.930
 on the screen for sewing the jacket i will 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.480
 use footer and crush 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:38.780
 with an ornament the stone doubles 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 bent on both sides more comfortable edge 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.300
 folding the fabric inside as 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.330
 near the edges there are often defects and their 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.239
 need to identify before cutting and see in his 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.970
 the process is important to distance 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.600
 from fold to hem it was the same everywhere 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.059
 and so here's one edge here scolded right 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.489
 fabric long ago the width of the shelf on the left 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:06.159
 the width of the back is first cut out 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 shelf and back 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.750
 seam allowances in this case 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.329
 add thinly on the neck and in her 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.460
 that kind of tricky hood will be downloaded 

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:17.710
 the end of which we will process the card 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.930
 bar 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.689
 the rest of the sections for the lines of the stroke patterns 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:30.550
 that is, with an actual allowance of 35 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:33.340
 millimeters then go over the hood 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.110
 as you can see I made two identical 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.510
 patterns one by one 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.970
 I will cut the wrong side and details 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.670
 hoods differently 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.210
 facial to decorate the hood will 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.480
 used for choking and you can take 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.580
 artificial up for example now 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.000
 consider a very simple technique 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.790
 modeling of the front part to stew 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.330
 we plan whether they poured the width of our 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.490
 finished finish 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:08.380
 I emphasize in the finished form that is, without 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.350
 seam allowances and cut the strip is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.170
 dagaz and since it is the same for us 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.360
 wide all over then cut and and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:22.060
 no need just measure the length of the part 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.650
 fragment of the face hood cut out with those 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.070
 same allowances that 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.370
 or seamy details plus stock allowance 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.960
 stitching crushing for in general everything 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.960
 allowances of one centimeter 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.890
 the second purl detail of the hood 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.370
 we cut out before folding sleep 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.160
 two widths and China as well as 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.020
 piled up for the back ie blood and 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.200
 must be strictly parallel and bend 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.480
 fabric and edge of the cutting table 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.120
 leaning on the bottom cut of the grinding edge 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.310
 one centimeter 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.290
 the rest of the connections are cutting in the strokes 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.270
 flew and 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.460
 completion cut by shear 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:12.770
 and only after that gives slice 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:16.460
 exact want pocket kangaroo 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:19.200
 patterns laid on the fold to and circled 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.200
 we put it again on another 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.650
 side of the entry line in the pocket and circle 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.920
 added again at start-up 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.850
 we still have a long piece of cloth with 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.150
 the middle 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.100
 cut we fold it across for 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.290
 sleeves 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:40.410
 cutting out my hands behind the stroke line 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.360
 note fold fabric show 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.830
 first cut in bend 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:53.400
 and then give the details a clear outline 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:56.030
 and so we cut a pocket with you 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.020
 back of the sleeves and details of the hood 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.230
 back and face 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.480
 at the same time the front part we once again 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.000
 modeled cutting 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.220
 finished and we can start sewing 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.790
 but of course if you put 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.660
 and with you was olkhovskaya faith 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.930
 tell me about your 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.930
 land see you soon
