and the nice thing about this conversion

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.769 
and the nice thing about this conversion
is<00:00:28.949> we<00:00:29.099> utilize<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.730> factory<00:00:30.240> gas<00:00:30.449> tank

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is we utilize the factory gas tank

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.020 
is we utilize the factory gas tank
location<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:31.830> removed<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:32.640> created<00:00:32.969> a

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
location we removed it and created a

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.970 
location we removed it and created a
custom<00:00:33.239> battery<00:00:33.600> box<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.260> actually<00:00:34.559> uses<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
custom battery box it actually uses the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920 
custom battery box it actually uses the
factory<00:00:35.460> bolt<00:00:35.640> locations<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> gas<00:00:36.570> tank

are well if you've never done an

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.149 
are well if you've never done an
electric<00:01:18.479> car<00:01:18.659> before<00:01:18.869> we<00:01:19.590> estimate<00:01:20.100> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
electric car before we estimate that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.370 
electric car before we estimate that
this<00:01:20.460> is<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.670> one<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.509> week<00:01:21.720> conversion

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this is a one to two week conversion

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070 
this is a one to two week conversion
with<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:22.770> kit<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> straight<00:01:23.820> drop<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.780> kit

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
with our kit it's a straight drop in kit

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.320 
with our kit it's a straight drop in kit
everything<00:01:25.650> bolts<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> there's<00:01:26.790> very

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

very<00:01:27.840> minimal<00:01:28.049> altercation<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> car<00:01:29.189> we

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
very minimal altercation to the car we

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.670 
very minimal altercation to the car we
really<00:01:29.820> like<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.150> see<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.290> here<00:01:31.470> we<00:01:31.560> are

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
you'll notice we really maintained a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.039 
you'll notice we really maintained a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
factory look we just have one gauge in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.030 
factory look we just have one gauge in
there<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.860> the

important details about the battery pack

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
important details about the battery pack
okay<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.740> we<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.100> our<00:01:47.189> rear<00:01:47.340> battery

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
okay so here we are at our rear battery

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.639 
okay so here we are at our rear battery
box<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.540> situated<00:01:48.990> right<00:01:49.110> behind<00:01:49.439> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
to feather the clutch when we roll away

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.750 
to feather the clutch when we roll away
it's<00:03:15.660> nice<00:03:15.870> thing<00:03:16.110> about<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.730> you<00:03:17.730> know

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
it's nice thing about this you know

it's nice thing about this you know
online<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.300> get<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.450> lot<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.630> questions<00:03:19.110> that

people<00:03:19.350> ask<00:03:19.590> about<00:03:19.800> transmissions<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.030> why

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
people ask about transmissions and why

prefer a car with a manual transmission
that<00:03:26.910> way<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.270> kind<00:03:27.510> of<00:03:27.570> adjust<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:28.050> gear

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
that way you can kind of adjust the gear

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.170 
that way you can kind of adjust the gear
to<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.920> speed<00:03:29.130> that<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.340> drive<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:30.090> the

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
to the speed that you drive and the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.370 
to the speed that you drive and the
amount<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:30.540> torque<00:03:30.750> that<00:03:30.900> you<00:03:31.020> need<00:03:31.170> at<00:03:31.290> the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
amount of torque that you need at the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.550 
amount of torque that you need at the
moment<00:03:32.180> generally<00:03:33.180> speaking<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:34.230> kind<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
moment generally speaking you kind of

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.170 
moment generally speaking you kind of
just<00:03:34.740> leave<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.130> in<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.460> or<00:03:35.640> two<00:03:35.670> gears

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
just leave it in one or two gears

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.370 
just leave it in one or two gears
usually<00:03:37.140> like<00:03:37.290> second<00:03:37.710> or<00:03:37.830> third<00:03:38.070> gear<00:03:39.380> you

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
usually like second or third gear you

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.750 
usually like second or third gear you
know<00:03:40.440> these<00:03:40.530> little<00:03:40.800> AC<00:03:40.920> motors<00:03:41.460> are<00:03:41.610> so

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
know these little AC motors are so

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430 
know these little AC motors are so
torquay<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.300> can<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.630> start<00:03:43.020> off<00:03:43.230> in

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
torquay you can actually start off in

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.830 
torquay you can actually start off in
third<00:03:43.740> gear<00:03:43.980> which<00:03:44.190> is<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.550> of<00:03:44.640> nice<00:03:44.840> that

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
third gear which is kind of nice that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.270 
third gear which is kind of nice that
way<00:03:45.990> you<00:03:46.080> don't<00:03:46.230> have<00:03:46.290> to<00:03:46.410> shift<00:03:46.740> you<00:03:47.130> don't

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
way you don't have to shift you don't

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.000

to<00:03:51.300> use<00:03:51.420> a<00:03:51.600> standard<00:03:51.959> transmission<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.950> they

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
to use a standard transmission and they

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.770 
to use a standard transmission and they
have<00:03:53.130> no<00:03:53.280> problem<00:03:53.459> driving<00:03:53.730> electric<00:03:54.270> car<00:03:54.480> so

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
have no problem driving electric car so
