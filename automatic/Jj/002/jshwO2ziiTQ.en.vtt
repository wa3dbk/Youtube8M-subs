lots<00:00:00.329> of<00:00:00.420> dice<00:00:00.630> but<00:00:01.110> could<00:00:01.380> we<00:00:01.500> say<00:00:01.680> simply

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
lots of dice but could we say simply

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.039 
lots of dice but could we say simply
that<00:00:02.449> silent<00:00:03.449> inflammation<00:00:05.540> which<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:06.569> really

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
that silent inflammation which is really

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.379 
that silent inflammation which is really
the<00:00:07.170> greatest<00:00:07.350> killer<00:00:07.680> actually<00:00:08.429> is<00:00:08.639> not

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the greatest killer actually is not

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.240 
the greatest killer actually is not
really<00:00:09.719> talked<00:00:09.960> about<00:00:10.200> as<00:00:10.349> far<00:00:10.380> as<00:00:10.650> actually

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
really talked about as far as actually

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.190 
really talked about as far as actually
the<00:00:11.730> consideration<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.630> weight<00:00:12.809> loss<00:00:13.019> is

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
the consideration of weight loss is

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.959 
the consideration of weight loss is
concerned<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.980> somebody<00:00:14.370> could<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.549> really

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
concerned so somebody could be really

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.410 
concerned so somebody could be really
exercising<00:00:15.900> plenty<00:00:16.740> eating<00:00:17.490> little<00:00:17.910> but

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
exercising plenty eating little but

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.820 
exercising plenty eating little but
being<00:00:18.720> fat<00:00:19.080> still<00:00:20.029> and<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.869> reason<00:00:22.230> for<00:00:22.500> their

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
being fat still and the reason for their

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.220 
being fat still and the reason for their
that<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.340> because<00:00:24.029> people<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.109> not

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that is because people have not

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.279 
that is because people have not
considered<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.859> importance<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.910> reducing

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
considered the importance of reducing

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.110 
considered the importance of reducing
cortisol<00:00:28.289> which<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.990> catabolic<00:00:30.990> hormone
