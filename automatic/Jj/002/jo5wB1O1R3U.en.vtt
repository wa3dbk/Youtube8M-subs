set<00:00:23.580> up<00:00:23.699> with<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.060> hydroponics<00:00:24.720> systems<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
set up with the hydroponics systems you

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.050 
set up with the hydroponics systems you
can<00:00:25.980> see<00:00:26.099> here<00:00:26.310> as<00:00:26.460> they're<00:00:26.609> drilling<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
can see here as they're drilling the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960 
can see here as they're drilling the
holes<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.750> system<00:00:28.170> will<00:00:28.320> be<00:00:28.500> containing<00:00:29.010> will

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
holes the system will be containing will

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.650 
holes the system will be containing will
basically<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.359> like<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> deep<00:00:31.170> water<00:00:31.349> culture<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
basically be like a deep water culture a

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.430 
basically be like a deep water culture a
hydroponic<00:00:33.660> system<00:00:33.690> will<00:00:34.170> be<00:00:34.260> growing

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
hydroponic system will be growing

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.840 
hydroponic system will be growing
straight<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> water

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
straight into the water

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
straight into the water
you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:36.719> all<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> tools<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.350> we're

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you can see all the tools that we're

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.410 
you can see all the tools that we're
using<00:00:37.829> as<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.520> setting<00:00:38.940> up<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
using as we are setting up the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.930 
using as we are setting up the
greenhouse<00:00:40.219> basically<00:00:41.219> making<00:00:41.520> sure<00:00:41.730> that

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
greenhouse basically making sure that

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
greenhouse basically making sure that
the<00:00:42.059> whole<00:00:42.239> thing<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.660> Square<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> level

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
the whole thing is Square and level

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.889

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
using little handy tools like this to

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.150 
using little handy tools like this to
make<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.860> distances<00:00:47.840> properly<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.620> skid

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
make the distances properly and a skid

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
make the distances properly and a skid
steer<00:00:50.430> loader<00:00:50.629> with<00:00:51.629> an<00:00:51.750> auger<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.469> to

steer loader with an auger on it to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.540 
steer loader with an auger on it to
drill<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.190> basic<00:00:53.579> holes<00:00:53.910> with<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.550> once

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
drill the basic holes with then once

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.599 
drill the basic holes with then once
they're<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.879> leveled<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.539> straight<00:00:58.430> then<00:00:59.430> we

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
they're all leveled and straight then we

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.000 
they're all leveled and straight then we
temp<00:00:59.910> pour<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.570> concrete<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> holes<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
temp pour some concrete in the holes to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.080 
temp pour some concrete in the holes to
make<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.550> both<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.449> basis<00:01:04.019> the<00:01:04.320> pole<00:01:04.559> basis

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
make the both the basis the pole basis

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
make the both the basis the pole basis
firmly<00:01:06.090> into<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> ground<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.229> here<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> can

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
firmly into the ground and here you can

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.500 
firmly into the ground and here you can
see<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.610> greenhouses<00:01:08.970> as<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
see one of the greenhouses as it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230 
see one of the greenhouses as it's
completely<00:01:10.140> setup<00:01:10.979> without<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.640> mesh<00:01:11.970> but

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
completely setup without the mesh but

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.469 
completely setup without the mesh but
the<00:01:12.420> structure<00:01:12.869> being<00:01:12.990> completed<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.479> this

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the structure being completed and this

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
the structure being completed and this
one<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.020> going<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> hydroponic

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
one here is going to be the hydroponic

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
one here is going to be the hydroponic
one<00:01:17.159> we've<00:01:17.909> put<00:01:18.270> some<00:01:18.420> soil<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.869> there<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> make

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
one we've put some soil in there to make

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.810 
one we've put some soil in there to make
sure<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:19.560> nice<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.799> level<00:01:20.130> so<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.640> put

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
sure it's nice and level so when we put

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.179 
sure it's nice and level so when we put
the<00:01:20.909> box<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.240> said<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> easy<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.900> work<00:01:22.049> with

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
the box I said it's easy to work with

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.990 
the box I said it's easy to work with
and<00:01:23.750> here<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:24.869> see<00:01:25.080> two<00:01:25.830> greenhouses<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and here you see two greenhouses and the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.999 
and here you see two greenhouses and the
third<00:01:27.210> one<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.290> back<00:01:28.470> there's<00:01:28.860> going<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
third one on the back there's going to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.280 
third one on the back there's going to
be<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> five<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.549> total<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.960> bit

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
be a five in total but this one is a bit

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.679 
be a five in total but this one is a bit
further<00:01:31.590> when<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.829> because<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.759> mash<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.329> up

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
further when the because the mash is up

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410 
further when the because the mash is up
it's<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.110> fine<00:01:34.829> mesh<00:01:35.130> it's<00:01:35.369> an<00:01:35.490> anti<00:01:35.939> insect

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
it's a fine mesh it's an anti insect

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.330 
it's a fine mesh it's an anti insect
mesh<00:01:36.600> keeping<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> insects<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> outside

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
mesh keeping the insects on the outside

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.280 
mesh keeping the insects on the outside
making<00:01:38.880> sure<00:01:39.119> they're<00:01:39.270> not<00:01:39.299> gobbling<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.049> our

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
making sure they're not gobbling up our
