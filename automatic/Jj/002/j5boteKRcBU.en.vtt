00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome from hamburg photos about here 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 on colored notebooks is using the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.010
 satellite 11 50 p we have the choice 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.650
 between red silver black and white 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.240
 plastic which of course is very nice 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.560
 At the price we really have 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.390
 a nice cup of tea with it 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.960
 you can also see chiclet keyboard 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.670
 then in accordance with the colors also with 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.769
 0 pat fits in wonderfully I can 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 Here you can almost relax 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.730
 not at all bend and really very 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 pleasant to write by the way 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.180
 a light lacquered surface has 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 The whole thing is called dirt you can get here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
 really easier between otherwise that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 is a matte surface for this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 mouse but wonderful because we have here 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.059
 really a lot of space for our finger on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.670
 and switch off here and skullcandy 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.170
 speaker right here under the screen 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.379
 chance to have a little bit there we have 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.750
 namely power network usb and once 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.340
 an optical drive at the front almost 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.870
 nothing but a jetty to readers here 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.550
 very important, of course, and a few 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.239
 status leds and on the other side 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:05.909
 then headphones connection usb 3.0 twice 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.990
 hdmi vga fan and kensington road where 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.220
 you move forward a bit further 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.229
 you can see how far we are 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 Display can fold backwards 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.299
 here is the maximum from the side the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.860
 colors of course no longer from the display 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 quite so nice but otherwise actually 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.920
 very fancy notebook i just got 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.630
 seen yes then from the outside knows now 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.520
 also from the outside again and on the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.060
 bottom one can then look like a battery 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.500
 Maybe it was exchange I was looking 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.970
 bit screwed off but also 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.619
 could trigger ours 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.240
 otherwise ram and hard drive 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.780
 really i just be him too 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.220
 exchange 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.650
 the home help screw but otherwise 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.540
 possibly also possible with the 2.2 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.400
 This is also easy with kilograms 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.119
 a d processor is available as 11 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.070
 50 d otherwise only satellite 50 could 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.090
 slide here the notebook see here 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.040
 has also turned on super 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 and I can do it even if he still wants to 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 just show the chamber part because we 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.470
 also have a webcam here with the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.670
 and dual rail speaker and a small one 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.439
 People who show us that the web can 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.149
 but synonymous s.and is the quality is hd 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.189
 I like it very much in any case 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.729
 here before toshiba that you thought of it 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.570
 have here what for the camera 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.479
 the satellite 11 5 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.350
 eg from the toshiba com people in 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.350
