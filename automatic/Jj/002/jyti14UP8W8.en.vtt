00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.520 

which<00:02:44.010> leaves<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.760> father<00:02:45.030> penguin<00:02:45.690> stuck<00:02:46.350> on

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
which leaves the father penguin stuck on

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.570 
which leaves the father penguin stuck on
the<00:02:46.680> ice<00:02:46.890> with<00:02:47.250> his<00:02:47.519> egg<00:02:48.830> now<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.400> most

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
the ice with his egg now the most

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.330 
the ice with his egg now the most
important<00:02:51.239> thing<00:02:51.269> about<00:02:51.750> egg<00:02:52.140> sitting<00:02:52.440> is<00:02:53.130> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
important thing about egg sitting is to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.229 
important thing about egg sitting is to
stop<00:02:53.580> here<00:02:53.819> actually<00:02:54.090> getting<00:02:54.630> cold<00:02:56.239> that

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
stop here actually getting cold that

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.600 
stop here actually getting cold that
means<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.989> has<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.320> be<00:02:58.440> kept<00:02:58.680> off<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.920> ice<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
means it has to be kept off the ice and

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.750 
means it has to be kept off the ice and
out<00:03:00.299> of<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.720> wind<00:03:00.959> and<00:03:01.290> what<00:03:02.160> better<00:03:02.489> way<00:03:02.730> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
out of the wind and what better way to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.930 
out of the wind and what better way to
do<00:03:03.060> that<00:03:03.269> than<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:03.989> rest<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.799> your<00:03:05.070> feet<00:03:05.340> and

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
do that than to rest it on your feet and

do that than to rest it on your feet and
tuck<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.540> right<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:07.079> under<00:03:07.620> your<00:03:07.739> tummy<00:03:08.720> which

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
tuck it right up under your tummy which

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.009 
tuck it right up under your tummy which
is<00:03:10.049> just<00:03:10.590> what<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.010> father<00:03:11.280> penguin<00:03:11.790> does<00:03:12.019> and

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
is just what the father penguin does and

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.680 
is just what the father penguin does and
that's<00:03:13.860> how<00:03:14.100> he'll<00:03:14.370> stay<00:03:14.610> for<00:03:14.970> two<00:03:15.239> whole

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
that's how he'll stay for two whole

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.500 
that's how he'll stay for two whole
months<00:03:16.190> until<00:03:17.190> his<00:03:17.519> egg<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.850> ready<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.150> hatch

with a tank on your feet for two whole
months<00:03:28.610> what's<00:03:29.610> more<00:03:29.850> there's<00:03:30.720> nothing<00:03:30.840> for

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
months what's more there's nothing for

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.920 
months what's more there's nothing for
the<00:03:31.290> father<00:03:31.530> penguin<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.130> eat<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.580> land<00:03:32.930> and

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
the father penguin to eat on land and

he can't go off to the sea to feed so

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.410 
he can't go off to the sea to feed so
that<00:03:39.750> means<00:03:39.960> two<00:03:40.680> whole<00:03:41.070> months<00:03:41.370> with<00:03:42.030> an<00:03:42.180> egg
