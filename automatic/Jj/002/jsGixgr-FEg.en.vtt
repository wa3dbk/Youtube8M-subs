00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.900
 Hello everyone, Kate, and today I 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.360
 I will show you how competently and effectively 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.270
 sharpen photoshop when 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.880
 handling back and go we have 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:34.260
 the original image is a duplicate 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:37.240
 control layer jay and go to the channels of charles 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.060
 this method of increasing the viscosity of the foundation 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.940
 to increase the sharpness per channel 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:49.180
 and so silk dye red channel 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.840
 contains information about skin color u and and 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.180
 invoice 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.620
 so our tasks here are not much 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.859
 increase if not to reveal 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.390
 any skin defects 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.420
 here our task will be to raise 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.600
 sharpen the contour at that is at the borders and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 increase contrast increase the volume of this i 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.600
 I will use the filter unsharp mask 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:16.020
 unsharp mask 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.049
 here we will pick up the destination which 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.270
 increase viscosity and contrast all 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.909
 image that is, do not forget to put 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.579
 tick preview is desirable to 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.280
 full or portrait without bringing it closer 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.899
 as close as possible to us 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.729
 for a start, the radius can be like you 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:39.280
 the contrast changes 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.520
 here we put quite a big one 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.960
 radius value 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.939
 so but I'm going for the sake of principle 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.350
 portrait 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.420
 about 50 pixels so go further in mode 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.549
 you should be small here because 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.549
 what's the video what's going on 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.900
 i'm a fool assignment 15 by sight she to me 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:09.810
 principle fit the services we do not touch then 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:12.170
 there is a rope to eyes before after to 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.720
 after varnish 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.620
 I like this result further 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.800
 choose green channel green channel 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.410
 we do not contain skin information 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 so we can safely increase the sharpness on 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 small parts he has what we have 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.700
 there were 20 flaws and skin texture 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.300
 here you can safely increase our 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.270
 scale 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.200
 also sharp and anger video filter 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.790
 excuse here we have a little reverse 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.680
 situations that is, we all want to increase 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.950
 sharpness and fine detail so we 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.820
 choose a rather small radius 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.920
 about a half pixel amal put 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.270
 big 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.020
 today rufina, that is, it has been here for centuries 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.740
 a ringing appears I chose about a hundred 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.810
 percent up 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.150
 I think normally just after that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.320
 is very well very well visible 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:11.090
 texture right hand eyes all small details 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:15.570
 come to we don't touch click ok 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.550
 click the channel and growls and to see 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:22.310
 our spring chickens are japanese 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:25.860
 and now we can compare yes after 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.870
 sharpness increased to but we can 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.350
 see also that we have changed a lot 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.450
 colors here we have very well seen on 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.660
 tissue that is so black with bluish 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.580
 tinged even I would say 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.030
 lush spilling up bright so green 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.980
 shade 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:47.130
 we don't need this so we will deliver 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.540
 our layer is luminosity mode 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:54.270
 why because luminosity mode is 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.740
 bright dream of all component pictures 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.570
 picture it does not contain information about 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:02.130
 only five waters are black and white 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:06.060
 therefore, as if all flower stalks are contained 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.860
 on the bottom layer of ourselves let's say so sharply 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.230
 increasing my grandchildren is contained in detail 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.760
 on the top layer and now we can 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:18.260
 see our result before after 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.260
 we can also bring it closer 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:29.430
 to better consider before after 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.860
 the difference is obvious honestly say that I am 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.210
 I use this method most often for 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.640
 sharpening 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.730
 either the whole portrait or some small 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.680
 parts that is, I apply a mask as well 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.500
 not a principle this is a prerequisite when 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.590
 saving for the internet that is before 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.780
 how to save for internet i 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.169
 did this action sharpen 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.470
 then it reduces the size of the image and 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:58.320
 we keep insta here impossible 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.330
 go too far but two things are not like 100 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.680
 percentage this layer will turn out to be 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.200
 too big so i still 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.100
 always reduce to 60 percent of mine 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.200
 default is 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.080
 the opacity of this layer and in principle 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.600
 all pretty altitudes we get the final 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.490
 the result if you liked this video 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.440
 put likes write comments 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.910
 subscribe for new videos 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.910
 thank you all bye bye
