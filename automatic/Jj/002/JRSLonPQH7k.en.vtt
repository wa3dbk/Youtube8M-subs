00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.799
 hello friends like this wing felipe of 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.630
 long week and I want to talk about 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.389
 a love story that is found in the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.700
 bible a very incredible story no 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.130
 it just shows the love of a man 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.890
 invent a woman but also love 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.450
 of God for Israel and the love of Jesus 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.140
 for us and this is talked about in 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.260
 the book of bones and if you have not read it 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:37.410
 it's a very incredible book because it turns out 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:41.280
 that israel was divided into two parts 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.829
 north and south and a part was worshiping 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.109
 at home and the other part were 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 worshiping idols and they were living in 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.570
 sin and they had totally forgotten 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.660
 of god then god commanded bone 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 to go and prophesy and preach to them about 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.100
 what would happen to Israel if they 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.089
 they did not start 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.360
 again worship the only god that is going 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.580
 It turns out that when you get there, God 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.549
 ordered him to marry a woman 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.360
 which is called gómez y gómez was a 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:18.280
 prostitute does not say it but because good 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.619
 Sometimes we do not understand the plan 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.830
 of god but good in the story is going 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.560
 to understand it turns out that he married her 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:32.229
 and they had three children but she never 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:36.729
 he wanted to work and follow what he or she 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.470
 he believed he was not faithful to him she continued with 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.789
 his life 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.990
 of prostitute and that bone was poor and he 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:48.450
 it was customary he was already used 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.540
 good that men give him good things 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.180
 jewelry 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.370
 the good things that he or she could not 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.110
 give 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.550
 and she fell into misery 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.320
 the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:07.310
 she fell into misery and had to be 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.460
 put as a slave and he went and knowing 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.510
 what kind of woman was and knowing that 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:21.000
 he had betrayed him he loved so much 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:25.230
 that he bought it back he only had 15 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 silver coins and I buy it and people 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.290
 he was very scared because despite what 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.590
 that she was and what he had done to her 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.120
 He showed so much love for her that he bought it 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.120
 with what little he had imagined that 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.330
 good they lived happy 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:49.440
 the bible says in chapter 3 that it 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:52.129
 he said then he said go to this woman 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:56.159
 just as god loves israel 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.470
 unconditionally imagine yourself and that 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:01.799
 plays a great impact on the people of 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.670
 israel when they saw even though she 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.540
 he was unfaithful 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 that is love and that's how Jesus 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.150
 Although people did not believe in him 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.080
 Although we have us section 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.000
 so much of the teachings of Jesus many 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.040
 they do not believe in god many do not believe 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.590
 Jesus Christ 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.959
 It is a pine tree and died on the cross for 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.260
 us and even though he did not buy us to 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.629
 us with 15 silver coins the 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.579
 sacrifice was something much bigger than 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:43.090
 it was the blood that he shed on the cross 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:47.590
 for us he loved us so much that he 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.769
 bought with his bone blood bought to 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.629
 gomez with what little I had because the 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:59.650
 loved it did not matter that he loved her and so 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:02.730
 Jesus loves us and that is the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.980
 true love of loving a person 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:08.829
 unconditionally and God loves us so much 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.400
 that the god his son to die in the 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:16.239
 cross for us that's a story of 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:20.480
 love friends read the book of bones 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.670
 and they will learn a very big lesson 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.330

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.960
