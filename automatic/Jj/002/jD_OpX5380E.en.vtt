00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.650
 questions in case someone likes this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.320
 kind of things and especially for her 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.359
 who nominated me to answer this the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.760
 first question is what kind of hair 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.349
 has that it's like that normal I do not know what 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.469
 hair type which products 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.510
 you use to keep it healthy this is 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.980
 in my video of the products that I use 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 for the hair then if you have not 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.210
 I invite you seen this happen 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.010
 video the favorite product line 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.469
 I think it's from the pantene brand of all 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 the line of pantene and the new one of arcade 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.489
 that I also show those products in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.170
 this video what is the hairstyle that most 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.170
 look loose loose 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.350
 how often do you cut the ends 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
 the truth is that I do not have a time 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.330
 defined to cut me the last time 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.460
 that I cut it had already been here in 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.400
 korea then I think I'm going to meet 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.400
 a year without cutting me nothing at all 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.360
 you have some home remedy for the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.610
 very dry hair and the only thing 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.980
 used in Mexico was oil from 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:29.250
 almonds since I use argan oil 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.100
 but something like avocado with that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
 I almost do not use any of that straight hair 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.840
 or curly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:39.810
 I love straight because it's like 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.520
 easier to accommodate but if not 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.620
 I also love it but when it is 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.510
 natural when it 's like you 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.880
 you make you look super ugly and I tell you 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.370
 because I already did it, it left me very ugly 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.980
 and I'm very sorry that I did it 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.030
 what hair color would you never choose 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.220
 I believe that the color green 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 green I think I would never paint it or 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:05.460
 also blonde blond super clear 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.940
 well, not because I'm brown 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.370
 then imagine how you would look at me 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.290
 what is your favorite dye brand the 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.810
 last I use here I will leave you 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.060
 the name because I already forgot but I 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.250
 loved it I have a lot of time and I think that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.920
 he still looks black and ricky too he 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.870
 I paint then I covered all the desire and 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.630
 still do not come out then like me 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.300
 really liked that dye which is your iron 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.520
 favorite smoother and why and the truth 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.740
 I do not have an iron or a smoothing 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.420
 the favorite I only have one remover 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.820
 shows them in a video and it's the only 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.770
 I use and I do not use it very often 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.650
 because as I am already growing a bit 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.480
 my hair every longer is going 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.160
 doing more straight then no longer what 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 I need a lot of what products 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.480
 I would recommend is for the hair yo 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.700
 I would recommend the argan oil that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.460
 I'm using that one really is very 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.410
 well and I think that they are all 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.480
 questions I hope you have found 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.620
