00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.840
 In today's technology I share an objective and walimex 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.740
 it is also a lens with an objective 8 millimeters 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.650
 Light intensity 3com a5 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.360
 So a relatively fast lens with a very short 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.120
 Focal length a so-called Fischbach 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.580
 on one side again Lutz stepped used 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.610
 tell me 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.090
 8 millimeters yes, the outlines recorded quite tons of tons 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.680
 what are they strong for 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.460
 the update delivers 2 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.290
 The numbers can have a lot of fun, but so have the myths been 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.880
 expected 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.820
 Older that the group of course you have a lot of fun 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.290
 Of course you can too 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.510
 and did not want to bring well with landscape scenes 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.549
 then possible 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.840
 no cancellations taken completely free 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.020
 Style and character characterize Red 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.810
 Musicians objectively 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.680
 We'll have a look, I've prepared something 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.740
 we have here once percent a series of pictures once the classic 50 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 Millimeter objective one has therefore only a very small section 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.930
 and that then the 18 millimeters which shows a bit more like you 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.140
 Grad was right there because the building works really well 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.890
 And as I said, this unique character is also unique on the stage 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.070
 do 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.870
 Min and again on Photoshop com and DigitalTV highlights are easy 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:58.570
 things 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.689
 the crisis so do not be ashamed you have only answers 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.350
 with this special look 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.370
 clearly it is deserved 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.619
 not for and around a few tricks 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.460
 yes I think we have 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.910
 We can see here ball again for us who can see each other here 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.229
 really interesting and outside 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.529
 Wennemer from the person Volker Thiele I imagine that that 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.099
 Objectively, this is because of its operation when I format it high 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.929
 take 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:29.399
 good for panoramic photography 

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:32.089
 That's where the strengths come from 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:36.579
 We also know quite great shots of Michael Fischer and Bettina m 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.899
 in the area 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:43.499
 from aerial photographs where everything is so distorted Japan also has these special ones 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.499
 Cinemas commander-in-chief Modern year made earlier 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:48.889
 to fly 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.889
 Of course that is making money with the zoom lens 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.339
 which one has on murder unique 

00:02:56.339 --> 00:02:59.579
 that's just the right keyword what you say movie 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.939
 that is also a very interesting look I am with the 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:03.079
 Camera itself 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.089
 Video wants to make movies that's all about the new cameras possible 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:09.089
 even a very good quality 

00:03:09.089 --> 00:03:11.669
 Percent it is a manual objective 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:15.939
 Jokes as well as exposure culturally 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.499
 but the presentation quality is actually very good and for someone 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:20.249
 the 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.739
 professional needs every day but says' okay i want 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.629
 I have fun with Mischa taking pictures 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:27.649
 certainly an objective with him 

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:29.979
 can have a lot of fun and in a very, very good way 

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:32.409
 cost-benefit ratio stands 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.889
 instead of the usual Landeshaus Bussmann life 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.649
 This was an extreme example 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:40.099
 I have one more 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:41.819
 Crew in the area 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.109
 the railway and warning and opening times the 5 6 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.709
 already gigantic 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.550
 and that means 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.339
 I had to go deep over the Ludwig and either work too inaccurately 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.339
 That's why I'm the investor, the aperture 8 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.539
 everything creates red / apa then the midfielder for defender Dante 

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:02.269
 would 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.820
 therefore are natural 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.269
 the manual focus are in question 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.669
 not so important if I have a winning car Fukushima 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:14.489
 or in the camera not always so the highest tours to the characters well 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.180
 because customers also mobile 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.389
 but that is still very comfortable okay 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.810
 It is an objective one must also know for cameras with aps-c-sensor 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.749
 we made some pictures here% 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:31.709
 12 with the fifth em-success format cameraman they quite definitely perfect 

00:04:31.709 --> 00:04:32.979
 not suitable 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:36.419
 As a makeshift remedy, I might be able to draw an excerpt from it 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.830
 a clear Petitessen small sensor is but there very good 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.979
 Results bring for me 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.389
 be in the beginning 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.530
 Merck have this one you can have them like you have here now 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.110
 the seven with the video feature is just great 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.060
 we have 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.029
 the pictures we made 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.300
 also we just showed him 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 to download on our server willingly 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:02.599
 Address for the download will be below 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.199
 in the picture 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.590
 and anyone can download these pictures and own ones 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.789
 Make impression of the quality of the lens
