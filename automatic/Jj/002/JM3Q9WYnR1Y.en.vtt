 a program that serves to give 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 a DVD 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.369
 with menus 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:14.389
 p 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.810
 is of 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.550
 good where the customers 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.519

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:28.759
 we accept 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:30.429
 efe 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.600
 this if the program 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.470
 I'm going to use it specifically to be a DVD with all the videos 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.470
 tutorials that I have hanging gelmini bloc 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.150
 always showed that he has gone eye p 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.420
 Not many 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.420
 great is what is a very high risk 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:55.179
 who did 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.430
 where the base titles that the option that the dvd has 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.370
 i the archives of the days 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.310
 it seems to me that it has no name does not offer 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.750
 the nation what 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.150
 the titled ones 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.650
 title 1 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.100
 and we're going to hoist it with properties I'm going to put this case videos 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.010
 min 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.040
 indicated by default the actions that the brand 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.630
 cd for what 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.660
 by the way when the end of the reproduction of this action 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.560
 it's good at least 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.880
 It may be that whoever is interested in a mike reproduce the following title 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.320
 when I finish this option 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.330
 or the last century 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.320
 or the previous title 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.460
 p played a guru a loop 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.490
 but well I'm going to make an effect that the one that interests me 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.080
 I agree 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.410
 and then I will add the lived 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.090
 for that reason the city 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.310
 already in umd 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.310
 directory 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.229
 efe are four limbo and enter one by one 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.349
 year of the second 

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.689
 In the third 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.799
 tell them that although 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:30.880
 do not 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.739
 whistles against 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.399
 that existed having put the termination specified 

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:41.929
 in this case with the dim 1 5º ginter in four punctuated percent and when 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:44.789
 the ing is monitored and directed in the menu 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.669
 percent and we will seem punctuated if you do not go to the sale at 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.619
 look like the fifth 1% 70 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:54.679
 well let's add another option 

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.639
 in this case 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.289
 finish 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:02.289
 ideas 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.839

 forest 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.989
 have in mind the lived experience 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:16.009
 on this screen we see the miners 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.710
 the reader takes occupying the default format the European the pal 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.450
 Meno's budget

 lift 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.500
 and I will choose the color that li hui 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.520
 always looking to the side 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.520
 in this color the pleasant tone 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.770
 i the event is framed in the background 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.770
 the one that I have also on the blog 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.199
 has a dot image png 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:09.659
 for certain what I can already started a 

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:11.129
 mp3 

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.050
 that sounds while on the menu 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.219
 until that 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.150
 click on a specific option 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.779
 ogier to leave 

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:23.300
 without sound 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.639
 I am going to choose this option 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.590
 then what the color 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.710
 of the selected titles I will leave blank but the color of the 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.710
 selected titles I will not change 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.809
 to a canvas 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.809
 well what the interest offers and the other 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:46.400
 in 4h important 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.629
 what we want 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.999
 make the dvd when wolf 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:53.240
 I'm afraid in the player 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.590
 this option that comes already by default also the one that interests me to show the 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.819
 dt the menu to bid the disk 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.960
 min may also be there you are interested in playing the first 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.939
 Title 

00:06:06.939 --> 00:06:10.300
 I suffered it but they have more 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.159
 by the way let's see how 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.159
 is the preview applying here 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.259
 goods that he 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:22.900
 the bad background image the both in title 

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:24.770
 and the option c 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:26.770
 these black shadows 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.770
 they will not appear because they are 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.020
 percent 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:34.099
 selected are batá 

00:06:34.099 --> 00:06:35.589
 it's transparent 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.379
 so it's not going to be like this really if it's not going to be a transparent shadow 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.419
 teams the title that is white will change when it goes down 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.710
 that the phone does not get you on the menu 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.069
 now the orange that we had put 

00:06:48.069 --> 00:06:49.360
 so that the 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.360
 min options within qinghai within the dwelling 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:56.369
 there is none left or in 2003 there was a lot of wind 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.159
 They do not look but they are there when 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.969
 psg trick this is a life a simple preview 

00:07:04.809 --> 00:07:07.330
 we accept 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.460
 percent 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.460
 and we are not simply left 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.139
 g 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:19.139
 to accept 

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:22.010
 give them forward and for what 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.310
 tipping 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.639
 the mayor 

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.849
 draft 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:28.259
 to an image urged 

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:29.680
 in the folder 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.680
 by default that puts the tereré that is mobile we can choose the one that arrived 

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.590
 marginal to exploit it 

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.399
 will generate unnim made pointed out that we can already agree with anyone 

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:46.949
 dvd recorder 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:47.960
 Tell him 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.449
 what 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:53.680
 with the brazier that the toaster program that brings by default ubuntu 

00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:57.309
 by the way we will do after percent 

00:07:58.199 --> 00:07:59.629
 do not 

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:03.009
 print on the dvd cover 

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:06.159
 and customize it even more 

00:08:06.159 --> 00:08:10.689
 I hope you liked and hurt them until soon 

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:14.489
 until the next end of 10 want
