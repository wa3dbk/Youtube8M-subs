00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:11.130
 hello guys and welcome to this 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.840
 second episode of how a pc is made 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.049
 in the previous episode we spoke 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 of the cpi and today we will talk about the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.060
 ram 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.550
 as usual, I will show you first 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.490
 let's say the functionality of the ram and in 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.310
 general how a ram works and then vi 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.349
 I will make various examples and the various ram that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 they exist on the market and I will direct you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 aquariums buy you to make you a good pc 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.880
 because ming or for video added or pc 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.410
 for multimedia use as I already had 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.370
 said in the previous episode 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.050
 the ram is a volatile memory that me 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.910
 allows you to store all those 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.039
 information that we don't need in 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.260
 time but they remain well in the background 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.149
 the moment he is using the PC 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 with for example the launch of many 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.559
 programs on one on the operating system 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.989
 if it keeps a program open for example 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.309
 and you have two more in the background 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.469
 the programs that are closed in 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.420
 background the memory in which they come 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.019
 stored this information is the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.570
 ram 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.369
 if you are pc gamers and finished i 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 games need to save 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.869
 information or statistics of the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.549
 game obviously in the ram and therefore 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.290
 we can say that if in the requirements 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.259
 minimums for example of battlefield 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 we have a minimum of 2 gigabytes of ram is 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.180
 a maximum of 4 gigabytes of ram 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.610
 obviously that memory advisable 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.040
 for that kind of game because the game 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.380
 requires a certain amount of information from 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.980
 remember besides the memory we have the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.140
 ram frequency this we say is a 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.440
 a more complicated topic because more 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.240
 the frequency is high of the ram and ram 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.830
 fast then with regard to the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.990
 ram frequencies are not much 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.070
 important in gaming but are important 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.740
 if thesis has obviously with pc 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.650
 very powerful it seems to me not too good 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.890
 put ram with low frequencies 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.050
 obviously there are normal rams in 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.810
 which for example the frequency is 1,300 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.170
 meters and and teramo obviously like the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.720
 pro series we say the needle 6 they have 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.410
 the dominator series that have frequency 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:17.020
 as high as 2,400 various numbers 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.480
 now the time has come to direct you 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.600
 on which ram to buy you or maybe make a 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.630
 upgrade an upgrade of your pc if it has 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.420
 little ram and address on which ram 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:32.020
 buy yourself obviously once 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.510
 there were ddr2 rams that are the go 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.210
 well old and now there is ram 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.460
 ddr3 maybe forward they will do as they have 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.840
 already done on video cards that weird 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:47.100
 dr5 maybe even x lam will make ram ddr 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.050
 food and everything changes and let's say socket 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.120
 housing that is in the motherboard 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.040
 obviously with a different name for 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.080
 to distinguish them from the previous one 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.200
 obviously I bought kingston 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.110
 hyperx two banks of 4gb then for a 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.430
 total of 8 gb at 1600 meters 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.170
 these were true advice 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.540
 I'll put the link in the description and vi 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.630
 I also recommend the core 6 vengeance rams 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.180
 two 4gb banks because 16 gigabytes on one 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.950
 system that does not need all 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.780
 this ram and therefore only serves a 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
 playing for example wouldn't make sense 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.700
 while guys are posting today it's over 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.320
 this brief explanation of the ram if there is 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.420
 liked it left a like there is not 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.720
 liked left a dislike commented 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.720
 such as 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.210
 and he writes about the colon house and therefore 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.960
 a greeting stack carically and see you 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.960
 the possible
