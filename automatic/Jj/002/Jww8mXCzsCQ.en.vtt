00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
you get the ohlins event-based

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.230 
you get the ohlins event-based
suspension<00:00:26.949> it<00:00:27.249> might<00:00:27.550> not<00:00:27.699> be<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.849> magic

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
carpet ride on the road but on track is

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.210 
carpet ride on the road but on track is
absolutely<00:00:31.929> phenomenal<00:00:32.050> because<00:00:32.950> it<00:00:33.100> feels

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
absolutely phenomenal because it feels

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.370 
absolutely phenomenal because it feels
natural<00:00:33.490> and<00:00:33.700> there's<00:00:33.880> no<00:00:34.000> loss<00:00:34.180> of<00:00:34.300> feel<00:00:34.540> you

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
natural and there's no loss of feel you

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.320 
natural and there's no loss of feel you
also<00:00:35.680> get<00:00:35.860> the<00:00:36.310> buttons<00:00:36.730> on<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.270> the

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
also get the buttons on the on the

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.810 
also get the buttons on the on the
left-hand<00:00:38.290> handlebar<00:00:38.680> lots<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.220> carbon<00:00:39.550> fiber

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
left-hand handlebar lots of carbon fiber

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.350 
left-hand handlebar lots of carbon fiber
you<00:00:40.690> also<00:00:41.440> get<00:00:41.770> an<00:00:42.070> olin<00:00:42.790> steering<00:00:43.150> damper

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
you also get an olin steering damper

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.810 
you also get an olin steering damper
which<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:43.600> also<00:00:43.780> semi-active<00:00:44.380> and<00:00:45.220> so<00:00:45.580> this

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:45.820 
which is also semi-active and so this

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.130 
which is also semi-active and so this
steering<00:00:46.240> damper<00:00:46.510> is<00:00:46.630> linked<00:00:46.870> in<00:00:46.930> with<00:00:46.990> a

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
steering damper is linked in with a

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.190 
steering damper is linked in with a
suspension<00:00:47.560> with<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.510> engine<00:00:49.510> controls<00:00:49.900> as

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
suspension with the engine controls as

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.630 
suspension with the engine controls as
well<00:00:50.730> what<00:00:51.730> you<00:00:51.820> also<00:00:52.000> get<00:00:52.330> is<00:00:52.510> the<00:00:52.990> option<00:00:53.260> to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
well what you also get is the option to

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.950 
well what you also get is the option to
fiddle<00:00:54.640> about<00:00:54.700> with<00:00:54.850> the<00:00:55.090> suspension<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:55.780> can

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
fiddle about with the suspension you can

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.650 
fiddle about with the suspension you can
also<00:00:56.110> change<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.860> stock<00:00:57.580> levels<00:00:58.000> of<00:00:58.240> the<00:00:58.390> anti

00:00:58.650 --> 00:00:58.660 
also change the stock levels of the anti

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.660 
also change the stock levels of the anti
wheelie<00:00:59.080> of<00:00:59.350> the<00:00:59.800> trash<00:01:00.040> control<00:01:00.430> and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
wheelie of the trash control and

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.820 
wheelie of the trash control and
absolutely<00:01:01.300> everything<00:01:01.750> we<00:01:02.350> initially<00:01:02.590> went

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
absolutely everything we initially went

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.350 
absolutely everything we initially went
out<00:01:02.920> on<00:01:03.040> sport<00:01:03.430> which<00:01:03.640> is<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.910> road<00:01:04.089> setting

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
out on sport which is the road setting

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.030 
out on sport which is the road setting
when<00:01:04.869> you<00:01:05.019> start<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.470> get<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.680> to<00:01:05.799> a<00:01:05.830> certain

speed on track the standard as set
limitations<00:01:09.749> mean<00:01:10.749> you<00:01:10.929> get<00:01:11.079> quite<00:01:11.259> a<00:01:11.289> lot

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
limitations mean you get quite a lot

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.410 
limitations mean you get quite a lot
squat<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:12.189> bounce<00:01:12.460> off<00:01:12.700> the<00:01:12.820> front<00:01:12.999> that's

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
squat and bounce off the front that's

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.969 
squat and bounce off the front that's
really<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:13.960> road<00:01:14.140> setting<00:01:14.350> now<00:01:14.560> you<00:01:14.619> can

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
really the road setting now you can

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.919 
really the road setting now you can
leave<00:01:15.249> it<00:01:15.280> in<00:01:15.460> sport<00:01:15.850> which<00:01:16.359> softens<00:01:16.659> the

leave it in sport which softens the

leave it in sport which softens the
power<00:01:17.140> slightly<00:01:17.619> if<00:01:17.679> you<00:01:17.799> like<00:01:17.979> go<00:01:18.189> into<00:01:18.429> the

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
power slightly if you like go into the

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
settings and harden it up but there's no

and<00:01:23.200> race<00:01:23.710> firms<00:01:24.039> everything<00:01:24.399> up<00:01:24.490> nicely<00:01:24.729> I

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
and race firms everything up nicely I

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.050 
and race firms everything up nicely I
found<00:01:25.390> in<00:01:25.659> race<00:01:26.020> mode<00:01:26.049> with<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.819> anti<00:01:27.819> wheelie

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
found in race mode with the anti wheelie

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.270 
found in race mode with the anti wheelie
on<00:01:28.329> one<00:01:28.840> or<00:01:29.079> two<00:01:29.109> the<00:01:29.619> traction<00:01:29.979> control<00:01:30.100> on

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
on one or two the traction control on

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.379 
on one or two the traction control on
two<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:32.039> go<00:01:33.039> into<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.429> suspension<00:01:33.939> and<00:01:34.119> just

00:01:34.379 --> 00:01:34.389 
two and go into the suspension and just

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:36.629 
two and go into the suspension and just
put<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.719> a<00:01:34.869> step<00:01:35.109> harder<00:01:35.649> it<00:01:36.069> was<00:01:36.189> absolutely

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639 
put it a step harder it was absolutely

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.730 
put it a step harder it was absolutely
perfect<00:01:36.850> compared<00:01:37.719> to<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.899> old<00:01:38.049> bike<00:01:38.319> the<00:01:38.590> new

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
perfect compared to the old bike the new

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.559 
perfect compared to the old bike the new
bike<00:01:38.920> was<00:01:39.130> taking<00:01:39.549> yards<00:01:40.119> out<00:01:40.299> of<00:01:40.450> it

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
bike was taking yards out of it

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:42.450 
bike was taking yards out of it
especially<00:01:40.780> with<00:01:41.319> the<00:01:41.439> with<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.069> electronic

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
especially with the with the electronic

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.889 
especially with the with the electronic
down<00:01:42.670> blocker<00:01:43.030> so<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.329> don't<00:01:43.539> need<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.749> use<00:01:43.869> a

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
down blocker so you don't need to use a

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:45.539 
down blocker so you don't need to use a
clutch<00:01:44.139> so<00:01:44.499> you<00:01:44.560> just<00:01:44.740> literally<00:01:45.009> concentrate

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
clutch so you just literally concentrate

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.129 
clutch so you just literally concentrate
on<00:01:45.670> breaking<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.329> getting<00:01:46.479> into<00:01:46.749> the<00:01:46.929> turn

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:47.139 
on breaking and getting into the turn

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:48.660 
on breaking and getting into the turn
the<00:01:47.530> anti<00:01:47.799> wheelie<00:01:48.039> really<00:01:48.280> help<00:01:48.429> support

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
the anti wheelie really help support
