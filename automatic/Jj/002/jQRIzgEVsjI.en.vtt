so<00:00:00.210> you<00:00:00.269> got<00:00:00.719> that<00:00:00.960> fancy<00:00:01.740> new<00:00:01.770> graphics<00:00:02.159> card

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so you got that fancy new graphics card

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.039 
so you got that fancy new graphics card
ah<00:00:03.560> so<00:00:04.560> nice<00:00:04.830> oh<00:00:05.190> but<00:00:05.819> wait<00:00:06.000> you<00:00:06.779> rubbed<00:00:06.990> your

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
ah so nice oh but wait you rubbed your

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.150 
ah so nice oh but wait you rubbed your
feet<00:00:07.259> on<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.410> carpet<00:00:07.620> you're<00:00:07.890> touching

position<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.670> it's<00:00:09.030> dead<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.480> you've<00:00:09.660> heard

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
position and it's dead so you've heard

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.320 
position and it's dead so you've heard
of<00:00:10.139> static<00:00:10.830> electricity<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.580> you<00:00:12.000> know<00:00:12.030> that

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
of static electricity and you know that

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.940

if<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.540> touch<00:00:12.780> someone<00:00:13.080> and<00:00:13.230> zap<00:00:13.620> at<00:00:13.799> this

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
if you touch someone and zap at this

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.820 
if you touch someone and zap at this
view<00:00:14.130> that's<00:00:14.610> bad<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.630> how<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.379> actually

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
view that's bad but how do you actually

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.670 
view that's bad but how do you actually
protect<00:00:17.340> delicate<00:00:18.240> fragile<00:00:18.810> electronic

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
