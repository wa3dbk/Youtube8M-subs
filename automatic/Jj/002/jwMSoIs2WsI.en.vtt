00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:02.559
 and 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.520
 hello you are welcomed by the workshop 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.820
 Jeff I will introduce you today to 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:27.390
 lathe wood dvr 1440 vs 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.570
 I ask to pay attention to it with 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:36.070
 variable variator machine 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:39.910
 revolutions machine revived 1440 vs weighs 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.370
 120 kg stationary in execution 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.190
 no legs feet and optional 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.440
 and lengthening also sold option 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.780
 such an unusual grade for 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.470
 lathe weighing 120 kilograms 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.330
 probably done in order to reduce 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.070
 let's start the cost of the tank 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.629
 let's go over a little technical 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.239
 machine characteristics 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.780
 since pay attention to jetta 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.690
 Braga and tour what kind of machine called 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 1440 14 this height machined parts 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:14.440
 over bed in inches 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.960
 14 inch is 350 on elements 40 is 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.510
 the length of the workpiece is also in 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.060
 inches it turns out a meter and 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.160
 setting an extension of 500 millimeters 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 we have the length of the workpiece 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:30.990
 impressive one and a half meters in standard 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.700
 complete set of the machine includes faceplate 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.770
 rear center rotating front 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.630
 flood 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.780
 the cleaning rod is so very interesting 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.670
 thing on this machine 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.790
 cantilever extension of the handpiece which 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.960
 helps to work outside the guides 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.830
 standardized with the whole new series 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.760
 jet machine 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.090
 M33 thread for three and a half cone 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.280
 front and back headstock 2 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.590
 front opening and tailstock 9 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.789
 millimeters power single phase 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.849
 1.3 kW synchronous motor 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:12.170
 revolutions smoothly change variator from 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.349
 350 to two and a half thousand 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.569
 which is quite enough in power and 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.790
 turnovers for most types of jobs and 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.670
 forehead turning and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.019
 fixed at 30 degrees what 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.500
 allows you to work outside the bed area 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:34.459
 so when turning 180 degrees 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:37.730
 In general, we go beyond the level of the bed I 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.470
 repeats and turns change smoothly 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.569
 low pinch is like previous 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.079
 models and smoothly that is we can 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.720
 set five 351 rpm and 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.349
 this property is righteous 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.670
 development of variable speed lathes 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.190
 making them competitive 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 chastotnika is traditional for jetta all 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.090
 handles and movements 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:05.180
 controls go smoothly 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:08.840
 fixing is convenient however how to train 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.209
 and this is the second position of the machine extension 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.209
 which allows you to handle and so on 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.700
 800 millimeters in diameter and we are 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.660
 magical properties and will use 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.819
 in our master class, well, that's enough 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.670
 probably talk let's get down to 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.670
 In this work , I prepared a billet 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.970
 Here is such an elegant little plate 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.120
 will become us especially work talking 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:43.269
 give up and share 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.269
 already 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.670
 and 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.560
 they 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.070
 Well what can I say first impressions 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.220
 from the machine 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.160
 most positive most 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.130
 captivates the smooth change 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.750
 Revs low noise 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:39.620
 vibration 0 heavy cast iron machine 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:41.880
 where they come from in general I advise 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.740
 told the first impression about it 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:49.440
 machine subscribe to our channel wait 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.630
 a master class is coming soon 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.000
 with this machine and the thing will be 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.300
 very interesting and unusual and I will go 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300
 I will have a bite
