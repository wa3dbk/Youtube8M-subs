just put the discrimination a little

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:43.830 
just put the discrimination a little

with<00:02:56.480> fresh<00:02:56.780> batteries<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.590> could<00:02:57.739> probably

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
with fresh batteries you could probably

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.430 
with fresh batteries you could probably
get<00:02:58.400> up<00:02:58.640> an<00:02:59.120> extra<00:02:59.569> inch<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.989> a<00:03:00.019> half

it<00:03:05.800> does<00:03:06.040> take<00:03:06.310> six<00:03:06.640> batteries<00:03:07.830> but<00:03:08.830> like<00:03:09.040> I

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
it does take six batteries but like I

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.570 
it does take six batteries but like I
said<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:10.080> lasts<00:03:11.080> for<00:03:11.500> a<00:03:11.530> long<00:03:11.770> time<00:03:12.130> haven't

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
said it lasts for a long time haven't

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.060 
said it lasts for a long time haven't
been<00:03:12.730> able<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:13.030> kill<00:03:13.390> a<00:03:13.450> set<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.870> batteries<00:03:14.070> for

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
been able to kill a set of batteries for

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.560 
been able to kill a set of batteries for
the<00:03:15.190> price<00:03:15.430> it's<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.880> lot<00:03:16.060> better<00:03:16.300> than<00:03:16.510> I

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
the price it's a lot better than I

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:22.770 
the price it's a lot better than I
thought<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:21.040> downside<00:03:21.550> is<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:22.150> just<00:03:22.540> so

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
thought the downside is it's just so

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.010 
thought the downside is it's just so
clumsy<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:24.370> over<00:03:24.700> tighten<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.300> and<00:03:25.600> it's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020 
clumsy you over tighten that and it's

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.040 
clumsy you over tighten that and it's
broken<00:03:26.530> for<00:03:26.830> sure<00:03:27.270> it's<00:03:28.270> put<00:03:28.510> together<00:03:28.660> with

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
broken for sure it's put together with

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.700 
broken for sure it's put together with
these<00:03:30.330> these<00:03:31.330> little<00:03:31.690> screws<00:03:32.020> you<00:03:32.440> got<00:03:32.590> to
