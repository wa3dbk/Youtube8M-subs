Ryan I have three kids that dance here
two<00:02:41.160> of<00:02:41.280> them<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.940> competition<00:02:42.300> team<00:02:42.510> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
two of them on the competition team and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.470 
two of them on the competition team and
one<00:02:43.080> in<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.590> little<00:02:43.830> tiny<00:02:44.010> tot<00:02:44.310> class<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.000> feel

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
one in the little tiny tot class I feel

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.170 
one in the little tiny tot class I feel
here<00:02:46.080> that<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.709> genuinely<00:02:47.010> care<00:02:47.400> about<00:02:47.820> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
here that they genuinely care about the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.970 
here that they genuinely care about the
well-being<00:02:48.360> of<00:02:48.660> your<00:02:48.720> kid<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.350> if<00:02:49.620> your<00:02:49.770> kid

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
well-being of your kid and if your kid

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.530 
well-being of your kid and if your kid
wants<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.550> a<00:02:50.580> little<00:02:50.820> bit<00:02:50.940> more<00:02:51.090> serious

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
wants to take a little bit more serious

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.320 
wants to take a little bit more serious
they<00:02:52.320> can<00:02:52.500> push<00:02:52.709> them<00:02:52.920> in<00:02:53.010> that<00:02:53.130> direction

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
they can push them in that direction

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.210 
they can push them in that direction
it's<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.540> important<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.050> me<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.590> who<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.830> hire

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it's so important to me that who I hire

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.460 
it's so important to me that who I hire
can<00:02:57.030> inspire<00:02:57.420> dancers<00:02:57.930> to<00:02:58.080> feel<00:02:58.260> good<00:02:58.350> about

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
can inspire dancers to feel good about

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.260 
can inspire dancers to feel good about
themselves<00:02:58.739> make<00:02:59.190> them<00:02:59.370> feel<00:02:59.550> confident<00:03:00.120> and

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
themselves make them feel confident and

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.630 
themselves make them feel confident and
so<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:01.140> think<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.770> we're<00:03:02.040> really<00:03:02.160> lucky<00:03:02.489> that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
so I think that we're really lucky that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.460 
so I think that we're really lucky that
we<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.300> lot<00:03:03.480> of<00:03:03.510> teachers<00:03:03.750> that<00:03:04.080> take<00:03:04.290> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
we have a lot of teachers that take that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.740 
we have a lot of teachers that take that
extra<00:03:04.800> time

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
extra time

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.420 
extra time
and<00:03:05.870> at<00:03:06.320> the<00:03:06.470> end<00:03:06.560> of<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.710> day<00:03:06.800> if<00:03:07.010> they<00:03:07.220> do<00:03:07.280> a

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
and at the end of the day if they do a

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.250 
and at the end of the day if they do a
great<00:03:07.640> job<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.420> teachers<00:03:08.780> are<00:03:08.930> there<00:03:09.110> and

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
great job and the teachers are there and

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:10.630 
great job and the teachers are there and
then<00:03:09.350> make<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.680> dancers<00:03:10.040> have<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> good<00:03:10.490> time

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
then make the dancers have a good time

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.280 
then make the dancers have a good time
then<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.120> dancers<00:03:11.420> are<00:03:11.600> going<00:03:11.720> to<00:03:11.780> enjoy<00:03:11.990> life

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
then the dancers are going to enjoy life

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:13.810 
then the dancers are going to enjoy life
and<00:03:12.590> then<00:03:12.740> they're<00:03:13.160> gonna<00:03:13.220> want<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.580> get<00:03:13.670> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
and then they're gonna want to get to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.670 
and then they're gonna want to get to
new<00:03:13.970> learning<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:14.930> I<00:03:14.990> think<00:03:15.110> that<00:03:15.410> probably

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
new learning so I think that probably

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.650 
new learning so I think that probably
the<00:03:16.040> biggest<00:03:16.250> thing<00:03:16.580> is<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:17.030> have<00:03:17.210> a<00:03:17.270> studio

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
the biggest thing is to have a studio

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.050 
the biggest thing is to have a studio
it's<00:03:18.410> not<00:03:18.620> about<00:03:18.980> the<00:03:19.250> name<00:03:19.430> but<00:03:19.730> it's<00:03:19.850> about

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
it's not about the name but it's about

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.610 
it's not about the name but it's about
how<00:03:20.360> they<00:03:20.600> teach<00:03:20.660> and<00:03:21.050> I<00:03:21.110> think<00:03:21.320> that<00:03:21.440> that's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
how they teach and I think that that's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.260 
how they teach and I think that that's
