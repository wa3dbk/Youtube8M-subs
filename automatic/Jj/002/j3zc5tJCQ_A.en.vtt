00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.179
 especially for you dear viewers we 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.670
 phytodesign rf was invited to the studio today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.049
 alexander melnikov alexander 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.729
 good afternoon good afternoon 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.029
 sounds of a handcrafted New Year's glass with 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.289
 champagne already 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.879
 somewhere far behind and today 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.970
 I would like to decorate so wonderful 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.810
 capacity that offers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.029
 use and I suggest this schedule 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.130
 a glass 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.839
 Plants and straight sailors have become 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.839
 meet no good 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.269
 what 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.710
 abundant 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.320
 calls the forest cactus 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.580
 What is good for phytodesign rf 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.070
 and the achievement is good because it is enough 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.130
 unpretentious 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.540
 but does not have an opera form 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.770
 and well decorated but glass ii 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.560
 vessels 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.980
 for this composition that except from this 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.650
 notice simple we need 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.080
 and we use sphagnum moss estimates 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.100
 can pass this plant while in 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.150
 mostly and then we use 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.730
 and ordinary forest green could 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.730
 if so litter dar plus a little 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.370
 now it is 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.660
 and 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.390
 almost all natural material 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.730
 getting down 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.600
 first thing we postpone ooo 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.930
 will save 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.640
 I saw Neumann home 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.570
 so that we can buy an ounce 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.929
 somehow call 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.390
 offer your option 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.290
 but I am Natalia the second to do such things 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.900
 which are natural 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.900
 large nature applies 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.800
 but use natural 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.890
 materials therefore 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.630
 in the spring would call some sort 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.399
 and in the middle of the composition is May 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.479
 but this day is a lot of a lot of spam 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.220
 he was somehow quite according to the company he 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.360
 will delay your home 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.030
 after such a plan 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.060
 Aids are always missed inside 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.060
 stand out 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.410
 but using all these facts 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.590
 that's because she's small 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.860
 it is quite a large amount 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
 fernandez 1 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:13.770
 invest 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.009
 top sphagnum moss 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:19.229
 which will delay the court 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:22.089
 for the basis of hastily plants 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:23.699
 now mm 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.189
 take to the immediate 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.189
 shvets 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.499
 take out 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.209
 Putin in which plants grow we 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 leave puts they break on march 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.089
 make up 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.119
 it turned out so 

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.509
 cap 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.919
 from the pawnshop yes the Monomakh's hat was not injured 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:55.229
 here and its further and postpone this 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.319
 composition percentage home weak 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.939
 it is in full 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.509
 then appearance earlier 

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:04.789
 which the mayor does not see 

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:06.729
 so in plants 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.179
 maybe ao 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:11.559
 technically it's good because it continues 

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:13.099
 workout 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.810
 generally with them and care for such a composition 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.579
 why reduce how many times you need 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:17.620
 will water 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.110
 I would say that this composition 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.599
 watered 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.060
 and such are my composition handwriting we created a and 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.929
 terms and conditions every two weeks 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.869
 and here about unity will need 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.519
 make it her sprayed 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.159
 having selected three days I watch composition with 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.259
 principle 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.199
 ready maybe 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:40.639
 now in winter or no story is 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.209
 this composition can be something else 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.509
 I will remind in order for the bouquet percentage 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.599
 time applied by seasons 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:48.559
 but in principle they are possible 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.449
 used eao add here 

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.199
 orchid spaces 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.139
 Well, you can do it carefully 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.549
 and does not hurt the plant itself and then 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.079
 reality compositions 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:03.900
 now that the zenith will turn into 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.900
 spring even summer 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.239
 dear viewers you just saw 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.689
 composition in glass which is made 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:15.189
 hands it is designer alexander cancellation 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:17.370
 whom and he continues to acquaint us with 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.310
 amazing things you can 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:20.870
 perform 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.100
 protective minutes but for this each 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.020
 right stuff right yes of course 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.199
 what will be called whose compositions 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.180
 we plant her ie orchid glass 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.599
 that's 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:33.840
 creatures 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.460
 in a blooming garden well the next composition 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.639
 blooming garden what is there for it will require a 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.389
 May used ahead of Moss in 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:42.580
 doubles 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.529
 but 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:45.479
 in the spring he could 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.610
 tree cows 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.650
 Danilko percent fraction of Kirov 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.759
 claydite 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.300
 and white crayfish 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.909
 in what sequence 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.540
 we will do this composition 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.490
 where do we start 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.439
 at the beginning of my career on the wall of ours 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.919
 our bases 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.919
 percent and put off around the perimeter 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.960
 and inside 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.889
 we stand for the small fraction 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.889
 claydite 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.570
 what's the problem 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.570
 second tier 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.789
 inside we fall asleep 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:41.769
 in the first composition was enough 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:44.489
 it is clear that moss goes well with 

00:05:44.489 --> 00:05:46.689
 Tokyo plants vigorously green 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.210
 but 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.240
 orchids 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.949
 how god fit 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.139
 substrate 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:56.139
 well he retains moisture 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.699
 a year extra well and a cozy one 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:01.819
 gives will bring in decorative 

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:05.119
 properties in this composition 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.249
 how tall should your mkhat be 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.669
 not 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.949
 the front goes ahead the wall but we 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.180
 use ghetto 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.389
 at 50 percent 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:16.369
 statue at times 

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.889
 that's because he's not even 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:19.939
 maybe you shouldn't stick 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:22.569
 separate parts then it will be possible to pour 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.569
 but if yes yes you can 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:35.610
 in particular, the possibilities are already 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.330
 it will be easier 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.220
 to create such a composition by two 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.039
 hands obviously you will not manage 

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.039
 need at least another third 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.349
 those so that you achieve full 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.819
 Siberia symmetry to 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:06:57.520
 exterior walls which rear equally 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.099
 beautiful art form composition 

00:06:59.099 --> 00:06:59.459
 can help
