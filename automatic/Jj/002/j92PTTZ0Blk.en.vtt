 I'm calling you right out 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.630

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:17.039

 childrens play the infinite river in 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.760
 Every round you try one of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.070
 Broker at his trip on the 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.860
 to help infinite river 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.890
 because they travel the infinite river 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:33.109
 along to find funny monsters 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 and take snapshots with them 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:38.489
 before you go on an adventure trip 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.989
 you have to go to the infinite river 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.079
 but a few small things 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.629
 prepare the brokers first 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.729
 on your boats the mark with the yellow 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.289
 cap also comes the yellow bread of the 

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:51.829
 mark with the blue cap on the blue 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.069
 boat and the brand with the red cap 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.559
 correctly puts on the red boat then 

00:00:56.069 --> 00:01:01.649
 her the brand in her messengers on her 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.780
 City fields on the infinite river at 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.620
 You can always find shore in these fields 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.840
 magician icon in the matching color 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:16.140
 then with her the cards and everyone 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.780
 player draws a card these cards 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.550
 Show your first goal of this 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.530
 For example, the player wants the blue one 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.840
 magician to frog bring but to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.220
 more 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.800
 now you can start playing and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.140
 The youngest player starts playing 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.110
 is always clockwise and who am 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.870
 train is trying the broker on his 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.510
 card to the monster on his card 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.730
 bring to 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:44.100
 try this card for example 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.159
 magician with blue hat to snake 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.130
 bring exactly between the two 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.040
 markings of the jetty with the 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.370
 snake symbol as you see there is 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.840
 So a jetty for the spider for 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:05.130
 Guess for the ghost the dragon 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.350
 toad and the snake but how moved 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 you now the magicians in their messengers altogether 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.099
 easy and to show you that 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 I can get some space 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.620
 and shove these cards here 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.890
 little away who is on the train takes the river 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.410
 and touch it on two sides and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.630
 then push him on the table and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.310
 It's best not to lift it up 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.069
 but press right on the table 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.099
 and you see, the magicians move like that 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.630
 Magically, not always 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.110
 Immediately in the right direction 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.880
 pretty damn so push so you 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.660
 the river always in the right 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.670
 directions until the market at the 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.310
 appropriate jetty arrived 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.069
 is and if you do not have space left 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.709
 on the table you have that 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.970
 raise the game board and back again 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.970
 place and then just go ahead 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.340
 Did you do it, you cover yours 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.040
 show up and show your fellow players 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.769
 that you are at the right landing stage 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.260
 you are then you take the card sets the 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.239
 open for you to draw a new card 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.700
 Take a look and then it is 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.590
 next player on the train 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.070
 Do you have such a cap with these? 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.010
 magician symbols then uncovered 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.109
 you all like to go back to yours 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.799
 City fields but really only if 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:34.109
 you reveal such a card but that is 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.630
 not quite everything yet as you realize 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:39.060
 you always move all brokers automatically 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.400
 on the infinite river while you 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.859
 trying to market their cap to the 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.230
 bring appropriate jetty we 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.290
 I just tried to try 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.829
 the red magician to the rats too 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.989
 bring 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.139
 the other players will fit in time 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.600
 Good for the magician on your card 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:59.940
 maybe the right one before 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.400
 Jetty reached as in ours 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.609
 example now because this calls 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.639
 Stop player and cover the card on there 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.950
 the red magician the jetty of the 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.139
 Dragon has reached the map he lays 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.870
 then as usual pulls off in front of you 

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:16.530
 new map and my train is so unfortunately 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.799
 over 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.680
 thank you so much i just say and who it is 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.220
 Be the first to create six cards 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.220
 store 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:33.550
 you win the infinite 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.100
 river is again a fast gelerntes 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.620
 and exciting children's game with magicians 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:40.660
 haunting and monstrous and if you are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.210
 still want to have a little more thrill 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.520
 then you just take the dice 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.780
 and always sets the active one 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.910
 player under time pressure 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.250
 He must then manage that 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:53.979
 Jetty to reach before one 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.199
 other players first one then a 2 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:05:00.310
 and finally another 3 rolled 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:02.260
 the infinite river has an exciting 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:04.479
 adventure ride on a magical 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.110
 flow for two to four small brands 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.150
 six years 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.169
 I wish you much fun playing 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.590
 until next time 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.590
 Europe
