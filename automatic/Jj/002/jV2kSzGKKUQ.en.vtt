00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.100 
don't sell this much so to let those
fears<00:02:33.550> go<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.570> simply<00:02:35.140> ask<00:02:35.530> in<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:37.240> good<00:02:37.570> way

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.710 

true<00:02:41.340> there<00:02:42.340> another<00:02:42.880> thing<00:02:43.000> makes<00:02:43.450> very

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
true there another thing makes very

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.880 
true there another thing makes very
powerful<00:02:44.230> light<00:02:44.500> EFT<00:02:45.280> or<00:02:45.390> NLP<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.050> how<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
powerful light EFT or NLP so how is the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.330 
powerful light EFT or NLP so how is the
sleeping<00:02:48.190> different<00:02:49.950> most<00:02:50.950> of<00:02:51.190> those

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
sleeping different most of those

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.370 
sleeping different most of those
techniques<00:02:51.790> they<00:02:52.090> require<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.200> be<00:02:53.230> very

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
techniques they require that we be very

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
techniques they require that we be very
very<00:02:54.100> specific<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.080> results<00:02:56.650> again<00:02:57.160> are

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
very specific so the results again are

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.870 
very specific so the results again are
very<00:02:57.760> very<00:02:58.090> specific<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:59.700> situations<00:03:00.700> or

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
very very specific to situations or

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.110 
very very specific to situations or
circumstances<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:02.440> point<00:03:02.980> it's<00:03:03.310> exactly<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
circumstances the point it's exactly the

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
circumstances the point it's exactly the
opposite<00:03:04.690> what<00:03:05.050> you're<00:03:05.230> doing<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.710> working<00:03:05.980> on

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
opposite what you're doing is working on

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.360 
opposite what you're doing is working on
a<00:03:06.430> very<00:03:06.670> general<00:03:07.360> Evan<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.920> effects<00:03:09.610> of

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
a very general Evan so the effects of

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.790 
a very general Evan so the effects of
generalizing<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.460> all<00:03:12.880> areas<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.510> your<00:03:13.660> life

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
generalizing to all areas of your life

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.070 
generalizing to all areas of your life
so<00:03:14.820> if<00:03:15.820> you're<00:03:16.000> working<00:03:16.210> on<00:03:16.390> stress<00:03:16.780> for

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
so if you're working on stress for

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.540 
so if you're working on stress for
example<00:03:17.620> rather<00:03:18.430> than<00:03:19.170> releasing<00:03:20.170> your<00:03:20.770> the

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
example rather than releasing your the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.720 
example rather than releasing your the
triggers<00:03:22.240> distress<00:03:22.810> in<00:03:23.020> a<00:03:23.110> certain<00:03:23.470> situation

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
triggers distress in a certain situation

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.240 
triggers distress in a certain situation
was<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.910> point<00:03:25.180> you're<00:03:25.480> releasing<00:03:26.080> stress<00:03:26.440> in

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
was the point you're releasing stress in

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.240 
was the point you're releasing stress in
every<00:03:27.580> situation

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
every situation

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.190 
every situation
