00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.490
 Hello friends after a period of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.040
 rest we are already back with much 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.660
 positive energy and totally renewed to 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 despite the relaxation our mind has not 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 stopped and in addition to the block now we have 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.820
 also page on facebook 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.439
 in it you can find not only 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.880
 recipes but also from 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.619
 crafts and we hope that in a 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.080
 future there are other beauty recipes and 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.270
 Health 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.340
 and now we go with what bind us and in 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.630
 this time we are going to give you our 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.910
 recipe to make delicious 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.650
 shrimps baked we have done 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.169
 gambones but with prawns remains 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.120
 equally good 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.579
 because we decided to make them like that 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.350
 because we love grilling but the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.300
 kitchen was filled with smoke and therefore 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.739
 we barely made them was a whole 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.329
 discovery try to make them at 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.399
 oven with the recipe that we are going to give you 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.070
 because in addition to how fast it is 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:49.899
 prepare them is comfortable clean the kitchen 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.390
 It does not fill with smoke and best of all 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.129
 is that they are really rich indeed 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.859
 we like them more so to the 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.530
 iron what ingredients do we need 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.390
 for seven or eight people it will take 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.239
 about thirty two prawns or 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.429
 prawns two lemons four teeth 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.369
 of large garlic in the photo you can see the 

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.649
 size of those we use 150 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.240
 milliliters of olive oil parsley 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.909
 chopped and fat salt 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.970
 we started squeezing the two lemons and 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.159
 We reserve the juice peel and wash the 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 garlic we put in the glass of the blender 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.409
 the juice of the lemons the peeled garlic 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.439
 and the 150 milliliters of olive oil 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.030
 and now we grind with the blender this 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.520
 mixture will be the one that helps us to 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.540
 season the shrimps 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.790
 we take advantage to turn on the oven and 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.470
 let it go preheating we activate 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.650
 both the lower and upper fire 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.690
 at 180 degrees centigrade now 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.970
 we have the shrimps or prawns in 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.250
 suitable for the oven if they are 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.810
 clay pots or better for the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.210
 amount that we are preparing in this 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.430
 occasion about 32 gambones we have 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.770
 needed a large clay pot and 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.110
 two small in the photo appreciate 'aces' 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.030
 better the size of them is 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.310
 important to place the shrimps in a 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.110
 they do not overlap each other so 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.050
 that you already know only one layer of prawns is 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.000
 per casserole once the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.489
 sprinkle with lemon oil mixture and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.200
 garlic that we had previously obtained 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.440
 and finally we put a little over 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.150
 of fat salt and chopped parsley and just 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.400
 we have to put them in the oven and wait 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.590
 between 20 and 30 minutes of cooking 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.689
 since for the amount of prawns it is 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.819
 that we have now we will fill two 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.620
 oven trays it is convenient that 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.360
 approximately halfway through the process 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.370
 cooking are exchanged so that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.900
 brown all equally do not forget 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.959
 manipulate the trays with gloves 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.519
 resistant to heat and as we know that 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.530
 They are made because apart from that 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.030
 will acquire a characteristic color the 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.129
 mixture with which we had sprayed the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.170
 gambones will change color and it will turn 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:53.860
 almost transparent due to the juice that 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.930
 they release the shrimps while they are baked 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.450
 and they are ready to serve them in the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.130
 table we hope you like them but both 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.380
 If so, if we do not appreciate 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.090

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.590

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.590
