00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:14.880 
all-electric vehicle to over 350 miles
in<00:01:11.740> case<00:01:12.159> of<00:01:12.369> emergencies<00:01:12.969> that<00:01:13.679> 1.4<00:01:14.679> liter

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
in case of emergencies that 1.4 liter

in case of emergencies that 1.4 liter
gas<00:01:15.189> engine<00:01:15.729> will<00:01:16.149> actually<00:01:16.840> drive<00:01:17.200> the

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
gas engine will actually drive the

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.069 
gas engine will actually drive the
wheels<00:01:18.070> so<00:01:18.700> it's<00:01:18.850> not<00:01:18.969> an<00:01:19.149> all-electric

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
wheels so it's not an all-electric

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.679 
wheels so it's not an all-electric
vehicle<00:01:20.499> but<00:01:21.009> most<00:01:21.249> the<00:01:21.310> time<00:01:21.399> it<00:01:21.640> is<00:01:21.759> the

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 
vehicle but most the time it is the

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.179 
vehicle but most the time it is the
driving<00:01:22.960> experience<00:01:23.170> in<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.619> Chevy<00:01:23.829> Volt<00:01:23.920> is

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:43.719 
got a low center of gravity so it

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:45.090 
got a low center of gravity so it
doesn't<00:01:43.990> have<00:01:44.079> very<00:01:44.170> much<00:01:44.319> body<00:01:44.619> lean<00:01:44.829> at<00:01:44.950> all

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.389 
mode the break in here well it's not so
great<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.350> that's<00:01:59.560> to<00:01:59.709> be<00:01:59.740> expected<00:01:59.859> because

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
great but that's to be expected because

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.639 
great but that's to be expected because
like<00:02:00.700> with<00:02:00.850> all<00:02:01.030> electric<00:02:01.899> vehicles<00:02:02.350> you've

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
like with all electric vehicles you've

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.080 
like with all electric vehicles you've
got<00:02:02.799> regenerative<00:02:03.429> brakes<00:02:03.700> that<00:02:03.819> is<00:02:03.999> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
got regenerative brakes that is the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.029 
got regenerative brakes that is the
energy<00:02:04.509> captured<00:02:04.959> by<00:02:05.079> the<00:02:05.139> brakes<00:02:05.469> is<00:02:05.679> then

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
energy captured by the brakes is then

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.100 
energy captured by the brakes is then
funneled<00:02:06.520> back<00:02:06.670> into<00:02:07.029> the<00:02:07.149> battery<00:02:07.509> but<00:02:08.050> the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
funneled back into the battery but the

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.670 
funneled back into the battery but the
response<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.950> well<00:02:09.420> brick<00:02:10.420> like<00:02:10.660> with<00:02:11.319> no

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
response is well brick like with no

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.610 
response is well brick like with no
feedback<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.880> sometimes<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.080> come<00:02:14.230> close<00:02:14.500> to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
feedback so sometimes you come close to

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.890 
feedback so sometimes you come close to
rear-ending<00:02:15.099> people<00:02:15.400> but<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.510> worth<00:02:16.689> it<00:02:16.840> to

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
rear-ending people but it's worth it to

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.300 
rear-ending people but it's worth it to

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
telemetric sand color displays well it's

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.509 
telemetric sand color displays well it's
just<00:03:36.040> downright<00:03:36.370> nerdy<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.920> Volt<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.280> cool

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
just downright nerdy so the Volt is cool

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.000 
just downright nerdy so the Volt is cool
but<00:03:40.180> is<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.420> better<00:03:40.540> than<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.840> competition

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
but is it better than the competition

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.289 
but is it better than the competition
well<00:03:42.010> that<00:03:42.190> sort<00:03:42.459> of<00:03:42.579> depends<00:03:42.910> on<00:03:42.970> who<00:03:43.150> you

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
well that sort of depends on who you

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.449 
well that sort of depends on who you
think<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.600> competition<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:44.829> it<00:03:45.340> an

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
think the competition is is it an

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.039 
think the competition is is it an
all-electric<00:03:45.970> vehicle<00:03:46.359> like<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.720> Nissan

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
all-electric vehicle like the Nissan

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.470 
all-electric vehicle like the Nissan
Leaf<00:03:47.220> well<00:03:48.220> I<00:03:48.430> think<00:03:48.579> it's<00:03:48.940> clearly<00:03:49.239> better

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
Leaf well I think it's clearly better

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.780 
Leaf well I think it's clearly better
from<00:03:49.989> both<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.500> standpoint<00:03:50.980> of<00:03:51.069> its<00:03:51.250> looks

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
from both the standpoint of its looks

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.729 
from both the standpoint of its looks
which<00:03:52.090> is<00:03:52.239> more<00:03:52.450> dad<00:03:52.780> friendly<00:03:52.810> and<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
which is more dad friendly and the

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:55.080 
which is more dad friendly and the
performance<00:03:54.280> because<00:03:54.639> of<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.850> range
