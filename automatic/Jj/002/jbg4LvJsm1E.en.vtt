00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
so yesterday I was going through the

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.160 
so yesterday I was going through the
foreign<00:00:02.610> pages<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.270> there<00:00:03.570> was<00:00:03.689> this<00:00:03.780> foreign

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
foreign pages and there was this foreign

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.860 
foreign pages and there was this foreign
page<00:00:04.380> talking<00:00:04.890> about<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.400> sarin<00:00:05.850> walks<00:00:06.089> now<00:00:06.839> I

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
page talking about the sarin walks now I

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.419 
page talking about the sarin walks now I
have<00:00:07.259> actually<00:00:07.589> been<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.950> sarin<00:00:08.250> box

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
have actually been to the sarin box

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.640 
have actually been to the sarin box
before<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:09.090> I<00:00:09.120> thought<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.570> I'll<00:00:10.080> go<00:00:10.349> there

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
before but I thought that I'll go there

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980 
before but I thought that I'll go there
and<00:00:10.920> actually<00:00:11.429> do<00:00:11.730> it<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.269> know<00:00:12.389> seriously

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
and actually do it you know seriously

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.039 
and actually do it you know seriously
because<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> am<00:00:13.799> 99<00:00:14.400> mining<00:00:14.759> already<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.360> there

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
because I am 99 mining already and there

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.420 
because I am 99 mining already and there
was<00:00:16.139> no<00:00:16.260> point<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.619> me<00:00:16.680> being<00:00:16.980> there

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
was no point for me being there

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.040 
was no point for me being there
I'll<00:00:17.760> just<00:00:18.060> going<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.300> leave<00:00:18.449> my<00:00:18.570> count<00:00:18.840> there

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
I'll just going to leave my count there

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.230 
I'll just going to leave my count there
to<00:00:19.350> go<00:00:19.470> away<00:00:19.560> from<00:00:19.800> keyboard<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> bit<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:21.029> what

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
to go away from keyboard a bit but what

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.179 
to go away from keyboard a bit but what
I<00:00:21.270> just<00:00:21.510> had<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.750> do<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.140> would<00:00:22.320> go<00:00:22.470> full<00:00:22.769> on<00:00:22.949> and

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
I just had to do I would go full on and

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
see how much experience I can actually

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.990 
see how much experience I can actually
gain<00:00:25.109> per<00:00:25.289> hour<00:00:25.439> because<00:00:26.189> what<00:00:26.490> this<00:00:26.609> foreign

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
gain per hour because what this foreign

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
gain per hour because what this foreign
page<00:00:27.180> was<00:00:27.359> doing<00:00:27.660> was<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.289> they<00:00:28.859> were

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
page was doing was that they were

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.040 
page was doing was that they were
posting<00:00:29.910> their<00:00:30.150> experience<00:00:30.570> rates<00:00:30.750> per<00:00:30.900> hour

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
posting their experience rates per hour

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.139 
posting their experience rates per hour
you<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.070> they<00:00:32.189> used<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.700> gain<00:00:33.000> that

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
you know what they used to gain that

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.720 
you know what they used to gain that
experience<00:00:33.300> or<00:00:34.050> what<00:00:34.950> kind<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.219> mining<00:00:35.579> level

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
experience or what kind of mining level

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.030 
experience or what kind of mining level
they<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.809> what<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.020> thought<00:00:37.260> I'll<00:00:37.500> do<00:00:37.800> is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
they have so what I thought I'll do is

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.740 
they have so what I thought I'll do is
I'll<00:00:38.670> test<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> out<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.300> myself

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I'll test it out for myself

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.350 
I'll test it out for myself
and<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.230> video<00:00:40.559> about<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.059> case<00:00:42.090> you

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
and make a video about it so in case you

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
and make a video about it so in case you
don't<00:00:42.450> know<00:00:42.570> sarin<00:00:43.410> Vox<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.370> away<00:00:44.700> from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
don't know sarin Vox is an away from

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
don't know sarin Vox is an away from
keyboard<00:00:45.149> way<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.309> gaining<00:00:47.309> mining

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
keyboard way of gaining mining

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.750 
keyboard way of gaining mining
experience<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.680> similar<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.100> ivy<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
experience it's very similar to ivy and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.470 
experience it's very similar to ivy and
it<00:00:51.300> requires<00:00:51.780> 89<00:00:52.559> mining<00:00:53.010> now<00:00:53.969> they<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.270> only

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
it requires 89 mining now they can only

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.619 
it requires 89 mining now they can only
be<00:00:54.629> found<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:55.230> 15s<00:00:55.860> which<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:57.030> self<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
be found in 15s which is the self of

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
be found in 15s which is the self of
prifddinas<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.620> where<00:00:59.250> we're<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.520> be

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
prifddinas and where we're going to be

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.529 
prifddinas and where we're going to be
mining<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.030> rocks

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
mining these rocks

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.290 
mining these rocks
the<00:01:01.320> only<00:01:01.620> good<00:01:01.949> thing<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.430> only<00:01:03.000> thing<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
the only good thing and only thing I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.960 
the only good thing and only thing I
like<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.899> they're<00:01:04.229> away<00:01:04.350> from<00:01:04.379> keyboard

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
like is that they're away from keyboard

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.510 
like is that they're away from keyboard
you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.000> mine<00:01:06.570> around<00:01:06.960> 70<00:01:07.560> times<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.369> or

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
you can mine around 70 times on the or

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.460 
you can mine around 70 times on the or
before<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.060> disappears<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
before it disappears and when it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.719 
before it disappears and when it
disappears<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.070> comes<00:01:11.280> back<00:01:11.430> almost

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
disappears it comes back almost

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.210 
disappears it comes back almost
immediately<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.260> only<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> come

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
immediately so you only have to come

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.910 
immediately so you only have to come
back<00:01:14.430> once<00:01:14.820> every<00:01:15.720> few<00:01:16.110> minutes<00:01:16.350> just<00:01:16.710> quickly

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
back once every few minutes just quickly

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.640 
back once every few minutes just quickly
click<00:01:17.250> again<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.210> pretty<00:01:18.390> much<00:01:18.540> me<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.869> get<00:01:19.020> 89

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
click again so pretty much me and get 89

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.749 
click again so pretty much me and get 89
to<00:01:20.070> 99<00:01:20.610> mining<00:01:21.080> extremely<00:01:22.080> fast<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:23.549> don't

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to 99 mining extremely fast you don't

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.130 
to 99 mining extremely fast you don't
get<00:01:23.880> any<00:01:24.119> loot<00:01:24.330> from<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:25.049> get

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
get any loot from it so you don't get

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
get any loot from it so you don't get
really<00:01:25.290> any<00:01:25.439> sellable<00:01:26.310> ores<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.939> but<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
really any sellable ores and but the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.200 
really any sellable ores and but the
only<00:01:27.810> thing<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:28.320> get<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.890> corrupted<00:01:29.640> ores

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
only thing you do get is corrupted ores

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.240 
only thing you do get is corrupted ores
now<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.380> pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.619> another<00:01:31.920> thing

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
now this is pretty much another thing

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.640 
now this is pretty much another thing
that's<00:01:33.119> completely<00:01:33.720> away<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:33.960> keyboard<00:01:34.470> but

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that's completely away from keyboard but

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
that's completely away from keyboard but
I<00:01:34.680> will<00:01:34.890> talk<00:01:35.070> about<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.430> towards<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> end<00:01:35.909> and

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I will talk about it towards the end and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.679 
I will talk about it towards the end and
the<00:01:37.140> only<00:01:37.320> thing<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.619> really<00:01:38.220> hate<00:01:39.090> about<00:01:39.509> this

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the only thing I really hate about this

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749 
the only thing I really hate about this
method<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:41.040> experience<00:01:41.250> rates

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
method is that your experience rates

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.010 
method is that your experience rates
goes<00:01:42.210> up<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.720> down<00:01:42.780> quite<00:01:43.409> often<00:01:44.030> in<00:01:45.030> 15s<00:01:45.750> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
goes up and down quite often in 15s and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
goes up and down quite often in 15s and
this<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.590> basic<00:01:46.829> understanding

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
this is just like a basic understanding

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.920 
this is just like a basic understanding
of<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.290> every<00:01:49.290> few<00:01:49.560> hours<00:01:49.640> honor<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:51.299> mining

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
of it every few hours honor the mining

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.249 
of it every few hours honor the mining
area<00:01:52.290> which<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> clan<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.579> Kula<00:01:53.790> clans

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
area which is a clan the Kula clans

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.770 
area which is a clan the Kula clans
every<00:01:55.259> few<00:01:55.500> hours<00:01:55.670> each<00:01:56.670> clan<00:01:57.090> gets<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.509> boost

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
every few hours each clan gets a boost

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.010 
every few hours each clan gets a boost
so<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:59.070> will<00:01:59.189> be<00:01:59.340> one<00:01:59.520> at<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> time<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.869> never

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so it will be one at a time and we never

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.219

before<00:03:04.109> this<00:03:04.470> happened<00:03:05.120> mining<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.420> gold

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
before this happened mining the gold

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.170 
before this happened mining the gold
concentrated<00:03:07.440> ores<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:07.980> best<00:03:08.220> at<00:03:08.489> around

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
concentrated ores was the best at around

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.440 
concentrated ores was the best at around
tops<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.049> hundred<00:03:10.889> and<00:03:11.040> twenty<00:03:11.430> years<00:03:11.459> so<00:03:12.299> this

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
tops a hundred and twenty years so this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.869 
tops a hundred and twenty years so this
is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> lot<00:03:12.959> faster<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.280> only<00:03:14.459> thing<00:03:14.670> is

00:03:14.869 --> 00:03:14.879 
is a lot faster but the only thing is

is a lot faster but the only thing is
you<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.810> two<00:03:16.019> 15s<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.829> mine<00:03:17.040> here

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you have to get two 15s to mine here

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.369 
you have to get two 15s to mine here
there<00:03:18.090> was<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> lot<00:03:18.389> of<00:03:18.419> requirements<00:03:19.109> that<00:03:19.169> had

experience and what you do is that you

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.979 
experience and what you do is that you

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
to the furnace and it pretty much just

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.759 
to the furnace and it pretty much just
keeps<00:03:54.599> going<00:03:54.900> because<00:03:55.019> these<00:03:55.260> are<00:03:55.440> stackable

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
keeps going because these are stackable

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.710

forth<00:03:57.900> from<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.139> bank<00:03:58.379> and<00:03:58.730> these<00:03:59.730> ores<00:04:00.000> will

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
forth from the bank and these ores will

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.089 
forth from the bank and these ores will
just<00:04:00.569> pile<00:04:00.810> up<00:04:00.840> on<00:04:01.139> each<00:04:01.290> other<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.769> if<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099
