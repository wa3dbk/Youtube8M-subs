had some good luck with good waves come
to<00:00:50.900> you<00:00:51.080> I<00:00:51.260> feel<00:00:51.890> like<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:52.460> hid<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.910> form<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.300> I

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
to you I feel like I hid the form that I

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.630 
to you I feel like I hid the form that I
needed<00:00:53.600> to<00:00:54.050> be<00:00:54.170> able<00:00:54.260> to<00:00:54.380> win<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:54.620> title<00:00:54.950> and

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
needed to be able to win the title and

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.640 
needed to be able to win the title and
then<00:00:55.880> I<00:00:56.060> came<00:00:56.239> up<00:00:56.420> against<00:00:56.660> Rollins<00:00:57.050> in<00:00:57.230> the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
then I came up against Rollins in the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.470 
then I came up against Rollins in the
quarter<00:00:58.040> and<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.430> my<00:00:58.550> luck<00:00:58.760> just<00:00:59.030> completely

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
quarter and and my luck just completely

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.890 
quarter and and my luck just completely
flipped<00:00:59.840> over<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.260> me<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:01.059> it<00:01:02.059> didn't<00:01:02.809> come

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:02.900 
flipped over on me and it didn't come

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.840 
flipped over on me and it didn't come
together<00:01:03.080> at<00:01:03.380> all<00:01:03.559> and<00:01:03.800> I<00:01:03.860> was<00:01:03.980> completely

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
together at all and I was completely

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.000 
together at all and I was completely
shattered<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.570> it's<00:01:05.810> still<00:01:06.530> pretty<00:01:06.650> hard<00:01:06.890> to

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
shattered and it's still pretty hard to

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.640 
shattered and it's still pretty hard to
take<00:01:07.190> now<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.610> couple<00:01:07.850> of<00:01:07.910> days<00:01:08.030> later

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.650 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.700 

and<00:01:15.120> personally<00:01:16.120> it<00:01:16.210> was<00:01:16.300> probably<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:17.530> bit

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
and personally it was probably the bit

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.620 
and personally it was probably the bit
the<00:01:17.830> best<00:01:18.010> World<00:01:18.250> Tour<00:01:18.460> waves<00:01:18.850> was<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.510> I've

for the event that was a huge dream of
mine<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.770> to<00:02:17.830> be<00:02:17.890> ah<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.010> make<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.310> final<00:02:18.700> was

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
mine and to be ah to make the final was

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:53.660 
mine and to be ah to make the final was
incredible<00:02:19.720> as<00:02:19.840> well

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.970 

it<00:02:54.670> seems<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.300> each<00:02:56.080> tongue<00:02:56.440> become<00:02:56.950> a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it seems like each tongue become a

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.500 
it seems like each tongue become a
contender<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.760> pull<00:02:57.940> it<00:02:58.060> off<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.360> like

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
contender and not pull it off it's like

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.500 
contender and not pull it off it's like
the<00:02:58.660> knife<00:02:58.840> goes<00:02:59.140> in<00:02:59.319> a<00:02:59.379> little<00:02:59.530> bit<00:02:59.739> deeper

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
the knife goes in a little bit deeper

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.479 
the knife goes in a little bit deeper
it<00:03:01.510> enrages<00:03:02.110> me<00:03:02.379> just<00:03:02.709> a<00:03:02.800> little<00:03:02.830> bit<00:03:03.099> more<00:03:03.280> so

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
it enrages me just a little bit more so
