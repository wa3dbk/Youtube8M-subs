00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.609
 hello everyone today we are not quite 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.740
 ordinary anboxing and not because it 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.980
 Redwood City Package 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:23.490
 california don't know but because inside 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 we are waiting for an unusual cartridge by 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:34.140
 there is nothing more to the link here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:37.230
 here is a pimple swims off well pimple 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.649
 Saves parcels from Russian post because 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.809
 that Russia wants to burst bubbles too 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:53.520
 break your stuff here is such a red 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:56.039
 cartridge in the case of which is written 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.430
 retro zones on the cartridge something written 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.020
 the cook as written by many probably 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.690
 thought it was some kind of game on 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 red transparent cartridge type like 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.090
 Zelda on gold but in fact this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.380
 of course not so it's very hard and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.780
 weighty flash cartridge such a thing 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 raise and 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:23.390
 and comes out a compact flash card which 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.790
 was bundled and cost extra 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.770
 how many dollars there do not remember 15 what 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.650
 in general it is a flash cartridge which 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.259
 allows you to load on it Roma 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 games and play them on the nintendo console 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.710
 entertainment system 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.549
 but this does not mean that I suddenly became abruptly 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.950
 pirate and I will now play only 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:47.340
 this cartridge and not buy new games 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.250
 for nes there is no now I will explain why 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.960
 I need the first and most important thing 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.290
 actually because of this crutch what 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.880
 bought is not an opportunity to play games 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.700
 for hamsters in Japanese because 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 i don't know japanese who watched my 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.369
 previous 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.310
 probably boxing park already 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.929
 guess for what games first 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.329
 queue i will use it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.060
 but did not look see of course but here 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:18.930
 for example this is the first form of fantasy 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.670
 which I played in English and this is 2 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.920
 files in the sea which does not exist 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.290
 in English but which is good 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.090
 fans are very well translated into 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.609
 English to Russian, they are probably her 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.409
 also translated but Russian translations 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.319
 still not up to that quality 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:37.139
 hold out before and falsification of all 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.549
 titles loses a lot so I 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.319
 I will play in English by the way 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.290
 readers of my instagram probably already 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.599
 saw only I wished this one 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.939
 cartridge and one my good friend me him 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.310
 donated it was very nice thanks still 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.930
 times artyom fantasy file 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.969
 1 and 2 on the same cartridges such 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.409
 what a great cool cartridge looks like 

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:06.359
 on the leadership form to them in size 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.680
 but white is cool and real 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.709
 license also 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.349
 the game mother I showed too in 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.919
 the same park does not exist in English 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.079
 language 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:18.060
 but in any case the translation even exists 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.180
 quite officially there is a long history 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 I'll tell you some other time 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.459
 I'll definitely try to play him 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.909
 surely it is that this abundance of RPB 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.949
 Japanese I can not do this and 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.139
 help will come to me here is this card 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:36.540
 Yes, I upload the English that you 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:39.180
 same game and I can already play 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.549
 the prefix on the emulator by itself I 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.849
 I can't stand playing because it's 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.909
 completely different and a lot of atmosphere eats 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:51.620
 second, what do i need this cartridge for 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.189
 these are all sorts of interesting hacks and 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.879
 independent games 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:59.819
 written for us there are many 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.919
 interesting works where the team even sometimes 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.829
 developers worked and did 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:08.579
 interesting khaki on mega exchange mario and 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.699
 many other games 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.229
 what interesting hacks will i find 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:16.799
 We will play on the console necessarily 

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:20.280
 I will show you 3 and very sad reasons 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.860
 all the same cartridges for us is the case 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.740
 past and many of them are already 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.340
 very rare many of them are already very 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:32.610
 hard to find even on ebay for the same 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:35.190
 most flintstones spend for them here 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.340
 the amount that now asks for ebay is 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.349
 really quite heavy for 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.099
 me at the moment and indeed hardly 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:46.080
 sometime but it dare because 

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:47.909
 such a large investment in a box 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.710
 with the game of course you are 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.139
 can you buy cartridges for such 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.409
 the price is also in the prefix it after that 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.169
 insert it you need all of their screen under 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.830
 there are no dust particles on it 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.780
 sit down 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.150
 if it's a secret to you, even many 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.949
 our childhood games are quite popular 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.039
 still in our childhood such as chip and 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:12.360
 Dale 2 duck tales 2 now stands already 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:16.520
 about 100 200 dollars so yourself 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.680
 You know, but I want to play 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.110
 sometimes pulls 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.500
 sooner or later more and more games 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.449
 will disappear from sale and such 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.050
 cartridges will come to the rescue and well 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:33.000
 if suddenly you are that 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.849
 to amateur programmer developers 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.159
 under nintendo entertainment system 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.050
 then with this cartridge you can 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:43.080
 check your game on real hardware 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.060
 They are on the emulator, which of course is also very 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.680
 and a very big plus now it is to 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:50.039
 Unfortunately, I can not even check with me 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:54.150
 no card reader for compact flash 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:57.150
 you will need to buy it and then I think 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.699
 you're also a tuple again because 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.159
 some games will have to play on it 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.680
 why compactflash and not 

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:07.500
 some kind of diesel even micro sd 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.330
 which is much smaller and more convenient and 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.729
 card reader and now built into any 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.229
 laptop because all the information 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:15.270
 processed by the processor itself 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:18.990
 nintendo entertainment system 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:23.099
 he is weak and I am not strong in these things 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:26.460
 but believing the developer â€™s site with 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.089
 compactflash works ten times 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.370
 faster 

00:06:27.089 --> 00:06:32.130
 games it supports is practical 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.889
 and everything has some list not 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.820
 support their mappers have any 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:41.250
 games that are made on these motors and 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:44.820
 either work with glitches or do not work 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:47.490
 in general, but there are less than 1 percent of them 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.740
 my so that they are unlikely to you at all 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:51.870
 once all popular games come across 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:55.550
 work great saves 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:57.150
 save the cartridge supports so 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.430
 why 

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:01.169
 why in this case such a quality 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.870
 product and not purchased 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.850
 not here in any way advertising and topics 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.889
 least i know that many of you 

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:08.760
 sure to write comments how many 

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:12.960
 it cost 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:15.780
 where to order what where what now I even 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:18.419
 I do not remember the name of the site as a keepsake if 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.669
 honestly so I will write here site 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.520
 go in and read everything yourself and everything 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.770
 I wanted to see what I wanted to tell you 

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.630
 to new meetings to new ranbaxy ngavt 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:32.600
 up to new videos yet 

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:32.600
 and now time pimple them pimpyrk 

00:07:51.669 --> 00:08:02.950
 Japanese newspapers and But newspapers us 

00:07:54.919 --> 00:08:02.950
 waiting for some unprecedented Japanese device
