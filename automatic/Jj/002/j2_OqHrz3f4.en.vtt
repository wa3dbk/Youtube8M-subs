you<00:02:32.120> can<00:02:32.300> make<00:02:32.480> some<00:02:32.690> absolutely<00:02:33.320> awesome

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
you can make some absolutely awesome

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.280 
you can make some absolutely awesome
scenes<00:02:34.130> with<00:02:34.310> him<00:02:34.460> now<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.940> I<00:02:35.600> think<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
scenes with him now and I think in the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
scenes with him now and I think in the
Russian<00:02:36.620> league<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:37.340> kind<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.820> a<00:02:37.910> lil<00:02:38.060> bit

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
Russian league it's kind of a lil bit

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.140 
Russian league it's kind of a lil bit
difficult<00:02:38.360> or<00:02:38.800> not<00:02:39.800> as<00:02:39.920> useful<00:02:40.190> to<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.970> him

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
difficult or not as useful to have him

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270 
difficult or not as useful to have him
in<00:02:41.300> teams<00:02:41.570> and<00:02:41.810> I<00:02:41.960> think<00:02:42.290> now<00:02:42.470> it's<00:02:42.770> gonna<00:02:43.040> make

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in teams and I think now it's gonna make

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.190 
in teams and I think now it's gonna make
for<00:02:43.340> some<00:02:43.760> really<00:02:44.240> awesome<00:02:44.390> hybrids<00:02:45.080> I'm

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
for some really awesome hybrids I'm

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.230 
for some really awesome hybrids I'm
gonna<00:02:45.350> probably<00:02:46.100> use<00:02:46.310> him<00:02:46.490> again<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.940> a<00:02:47.030> bar

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
gonna probably use him again and a bar

team<00:03:12.020> because<00:03:12.260> it<00:03:12.500> just<00:03:12.590> didn't<00:03:13.010> work<00:03:13.250> and<00:03:13.610> I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
team because it just didn't work and I

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.180 
team because it just didn't work and I
don't<00:03:14.420> know<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.870> just<00:03:15.110> felt<00:03:15.410> really<00:03:15.650> slows<00:03:15.980> you

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
don't know it just felt really slows you

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.380 
don't know it just felt really slows you
might<00:03:16.370> be<00:03:16.490> able<00:03:16.550> to<00:03:16.670> notice<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.000> in<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.150> clips

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
might be able to notice it in the clips

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.720 
might be able to notice it in the clips
but<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.810> past<00:03:18.140> thing<00:03:18.440> felt<00:03:18.739> so<00:03:19.010> weird<00:03:19.459> and

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
but the past thing felt so weird and

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.070 
but the past thing felt so weird and
slow<00:03:20.720> and<00:03:20.980> nothing<00:03:21.980> felt<00:03:22.400> fluid<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.480> didn't

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
slow and nothing felt fluid and I didn't

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.100 
slow and nothing felt fluid and I didn't
like<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.350> so<00:03:24.980> this<00:03:25.250> however<00:03:26.000> is<00:03:26.390> a<00:03:26.660> pretty<00:03:26.930> nice

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
like it so this however is a pretty nice

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.479 
like it so this however is a pretty nice
girl<00:03:27.320> from<00:03:27.440> your<00:03:27.620> yard<00:03:27.830> when<00:03:28.010> I<00:03:28.040> didn't<00:03:28.370> really

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
girl from your yard when I didn't really

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.030 
girl from your yard when I didn't really
start<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:28.940> go<00:03:29.030> in<00:03:29.180> but<00:03:29.330> that<00:03:29.420> is<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> very<00:03:30.040> very

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
start to go in but that is a very very

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.850 
start to go in but that is a very very
clean<00:03:31.489> ship<00:03:31.880> that<00:03:32.180> was<00:03:32.390> that's<00:03:33.050> pretty<00:03:33.470> good

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
clean ship that was that's pretty good

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.820 
clean ship that was that's pretty good
but<00:03:34.190> it<00:03:34.730> was<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.000> strange<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:36.230> was<00:03:36.380> really

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
but it was just strange it was really

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.759 
but it was just strange it was really
strange<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.340> passing<00:03:37.850> just<00:03:38.000> fell<00:03:38.150> off<00:03:38.269> and

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
strange the passing just fell off and

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.590 
strange the passing just fell off and
players<00:03:39.769> dribbling<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.640> didn't<00:03:41.060> seem<00:03:41.330> to

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
players dribbling just didn't seem to

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.750 
players dribbling just didn't seem to
work<00:03:41.870> at<00:03:42.260> all<00:03:42.560> I<00:03:42.739> don't<00:03:42.920> know<00:03:43.010> if<00:03:43.489> it<00:03:43.640> was<00:03:43.730> just

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
work at all I don't know if it was just

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.610 
work at all I don't know if it was just
me<00:03:43.970> perhaps<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.600> had<00:03:44.720> a<00:03:44.750> few<00:03:45.019> off<00:03:45.110> games<00:03:45.410> or

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
me perhaps I had a few off games or

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.170 
me perhaps I had a few off games or
doesn't<00:03:45.890> play<00:03:46.010> my<00:03:46.160> best<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.640> hadn't<00:03:47.090> actually

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
doesn't play my best I hadn't actually

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.120 
doesn't play my best I hadn't actually
played<00:03:47.510> fifa<00:03:47.900> today<00:03:48.019> until<00:03:48.380> i<00:03:48.470> used<00:03:48.650> this<00:03:48.830> team

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
played fifa today until i used this team

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.940 
played fifa today until i used this team
so<00:03:49.820> maybe<00:03:50.030> it<00:03:50.269> was<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.390> that<00:03:50.810> but<00:03:51.110> it<00:03:51.769> was

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
so maybe it was just that but it was

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:53.770 
so maybe it was just that but it was
weird<00:03:52.160> Thomas<00:03:52.549> Muller<00:03:52.790> was<00:03:52.970> really<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.750> only

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
weird Thomas Muller was really the only

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.630 
weird Thomas Muller was really the only
player<00:03:54.590> that<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.830> could<00:03:55.040> drip<00:03:55.250> with<00:03:55.370> that<00:03:55.519> and

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
player that I could drip with that and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.590 
player that I could drip with that and
Cristian<00:03:55.940> Tello<00:03:55.970> actually<00:03:56.480> there's

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
Cristian Tello actually there's

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.880 
Cristian Tello actually there's
literally<00:03:56.810> a<00:03:56.930> left<00:03:57.140> mid<00:03:57.290> on<00:03:57.410> her<00:03:57.530> right<00:03:57.680> mid

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
literally a left mid on her right mid

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.850 
literally a left mid on her right mid
well<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.850> only<00:03:59.030> players<00:03:59.570> that<00:04:00.440> I<00:04:00.470> felt

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
well the only players that I felt

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.740 
well the only players that I felt
comfortable<00:04:01.370> doing<00:04:01.459> step<00:04:01.970> overs<00:04:02.360> with<00:04:02.390> and

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
comfortable doing step overs with and

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.990 
comfortable doing step overs with and
dribbling<00:04:03.260> because<00:04:03.650> I<00:04:03.860> kind<00:04:04.549> of<00:04:04.610> like<00:04:04.760> to<00:04:04.910> do

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
dribbling because I kind of like to do

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000 
dribbling because I kind of like to do
it<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> sense<00:04:05.390> of<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.660> and<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.989> course<00:04:06.110> that's

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
it the sense of it and of course that's

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.570 
it the sense of it and of course that's
Sen<00:04:07.700> and<00:04:07.850> he<00:04:08.120> is<00:04:08.360> literally<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.580> slowest

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.440 
ever doubted what I can do a listener
all<00:04:15.260> right<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.620> can't<00:04:16.430> do<00:04:16.640> it<00:04:16.669> with<00:04:16.820> s<00:04:17.030> in<00:04:17.239> and

I'm gonna have to give it a seven out of
ten<00:04:19.370> it<00:04:19.700> wasn't<00:04:20.269> amazing<00:04:20.570> i<00:04:20.870> was<00:04:20.959> tempted<00:04:21.320> to

I'm Thomas Miller they were actually
pretty<00:04:28.940> good<00:04:29.240> as<00:04:29.419> a<00:04:29.479> Saudi<00:04:29.870> Alba<00:04:30.229> but<00:04:30.860> the

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
pretty good as a Saudi Alba but the

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:32.860 
pretty good as a Saudi Alba but the
defense<00:04:31.310> was<00:04:31.490> difficult<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.030> think<00:04:32.060> buddy<00:04:32.660> so

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
defense was difficult I think buddy so
