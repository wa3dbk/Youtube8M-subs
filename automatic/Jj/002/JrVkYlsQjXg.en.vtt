 Now we are in the Bleak Falls, which are ancient nordic ruins. 

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:13.033

 It blesses, I feel it. 

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.367
 You fool! 

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:00.433

 The solution to this particular puzzle is on the key itself. 

00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:54.100
 Up there is a wall of words from which you can learn dragon words of power. 

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:05.133
 The Words of Power were learned - Anger, Summoning the Storm
