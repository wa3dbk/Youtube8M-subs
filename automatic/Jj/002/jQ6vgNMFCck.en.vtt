00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 good morning thank you for coming to this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:09.130
 small channel of mysteries we are going to 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.860
 talk about a mystery 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.030
 quite pretty has become quite 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.220
 viral 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.920
 as the bucket challenge went viral 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.680
 of water 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:24.320
 or from the dip with water now there is a 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.199
 challenge that is very much appreciated as 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.720
 charly charly charly el chalÃ¡n or 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:33.550
 in Spanish of challenge charly charly charly 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.590
 this consists of the alleged invocation 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.010
 of a demon that respond to any 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.010
 Question 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.739
 To do this, two pencils or 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:47.620
 form of cross one over another and in the 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:50.430
 four quadrants are formed that are 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.520
 form is written the word yes and no 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.990
 next the participants 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.420
 they pronounce the words charles charles 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.160
 you are there after which the pencils are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.800
 will move 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.360
 we see videos and photos have circulated around 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.000
 the web with the tag charly charly 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.040
 charly challenge where the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.720
 phenomenon I will use it from social networks not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.090
 they have taken a challenge stop and have 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.230
 made their own versions of the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.950
 answers that the supposed demons gives 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:24.030
 the most common explanation about this challenge 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.980
 is that basically between the pencils and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.140
 the devil could be due to any 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:31.290
 encouragement then in a small stream 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.100
 of air or just that pencil that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.320
 it's up 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.080
 and it's always in a pretty position 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.570
 unstable and will usually tend to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.030
 move somewhere and obviously 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.650
 that would be the response of 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.080
 supposed demon so 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:51.560
 I do not know if you believe most of 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.560
 the challenges 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.050
 90 99 % 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:05.370
 it seems that fake lie 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.729
 while the Ouija already have a 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.280
 long story already already the whole world 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 know about the footprint depending on 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.850
 circulation people who do 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.790
 it seems that 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.760
 the Ouija does seem to open a 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.730
 window or a portal towards 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.189
 beings of the lower astral and it seems that 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.310
 It is very unwise to practice 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.980
 ouija so in this case I will ask 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.140
 me to you when the two games according to 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.290
 their stories do what has happened 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.140
 on the web or not movie which would give you 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.170
 more afraid to play an ouija or charly 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:46.610
 charly charly 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.750
 which I would never try to do fourth 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 I would risk more to do it 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.300
 or if you have already done the ouija and dispatch 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.240
 he leaves what was your result because 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.970
 there are always people who try everything 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.860
 so 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:05.330
 I just made this short video 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.980
 I hope you liked it and you know 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.150
 subscribe to the channel and like it if you 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.750
 liked it 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.750
 Thank you
