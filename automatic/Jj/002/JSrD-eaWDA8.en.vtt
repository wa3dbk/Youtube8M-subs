 new mechanical firm which is five 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.870
 I completed it a few minutes ago as you see 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.679
 she looks all around almost 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.910
 the same 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.770
 here is such an interesting entrance for us 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.830
 located on an island around the sea 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.750
 let's open our farm when we 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.460
 click on the diamond block with us 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.990
 the farm opens for that we need 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.359
 Redstone script 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.739
 when we click on this diamond block y 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.960
 us the door closes what's up to do 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.079
 Next, let's look at our 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.610
 Adi button to open the passage for weave 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.570
 harvest include watering this farm affair 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:51.149
 I alone did not help anyone 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 open open this part here 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.879
 and so we hit and watch and collect 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.920
 harvest let's press and open because 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.860
 that we will need to remove all one hundred 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.549
 percent as you can see we hit instead 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.979
 harvesting as you can see the crop is planted and 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.979
 there is nothing here let's try 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 to plant our crop come to the console 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.189
 controls and click on this one here 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:29.040
 button to turn on irrigation here at hearing 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.030
 characteristic sound that means everything 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.180
 went pretty well and let's go 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.220
 further and what does she meet us here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:44.130
 Here there are all that we have been here 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.710
 what I put this big 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.110
 variety as you see there is nothing 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 not all here let's collect and 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 let's see how much a company can give 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.990
 harvest in 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.240
 this is this farm 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.909
 honestly can give a lot more 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.490
 harvest but here there is a small bug that 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.000
 there it is 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:10.160
 for some reason, everything is stuck in one block 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:14.840
 so let me get the wool 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.090
 because it breaks fast we all 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.819
 got more 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.420
 as i was saying over there and here 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.590
 here we all get stuck as you see 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.920
 we have all gathered and let's go 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:37.220
 and I will show how to plant we get 47 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.850
 seeds 32 wheat 18 seeds hip then 20 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.220
 potatoes and forty-two carrots 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.750
 click on this button and we 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 our passage closes let's 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:52.310
 open here this passes and we click 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:57.680
 here and as you can see everything opens and so 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:59.769
 we forgot to turn off our system we all 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.650
 turn off watering 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:08.780
 let's go turn it off yes we turned off our 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:15.709
 watering so we need to go over there 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:16.910
 here and gathers our harvest we all fell 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:18.739
 nothing spoiled 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.640
 as you can see here and so we plant 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:24.530
 We press the button and everything is fine 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.480
