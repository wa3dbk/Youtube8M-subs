 childhood and a double it in the cairo so 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:29.630

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.730
 to say that what I like is so 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.019
 I'll tell you about the gameplay 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.440
 you will see I am the first 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.329
 nuke pretty quickly I use the n 94 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.239
 in diamonds so that was before the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:55.000
 departure I had all the areas of 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.630

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:12.670
 four models diamond I play 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.770
 solo mad catz then has my class I believe 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.030
 that I had bulletproof vest that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.530
 the usaid on time because I'm not 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.020
 sure but I had to have vest 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 bullet-proof sturdiness all the time at 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.630
 bust is essential that there is 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.830
 pillar history mascot title dexterity 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.820
 so here's a drone bomb plot 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.910
 against microstation drones then the 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.479
 first thing I'm going to talk to you about 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.370
 not to mention the the gameplay it was 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.000
 why do I do less two videos of 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.190
 funerals 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.780
 simply because it's the 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.020
 back home so I hope you have 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.720
 had a good comeback judge finally 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.430
 sell or high schools or a length I know 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.890
 not too much where Jesus is there so I hope 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.509
 you have had a good income 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.770
 so then less boring treant raw 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.110
 finally I will not tell you my life 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.290
 but everything and everything but basically this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.610
 year I have you did a lot when 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.530
 not bad so 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.880
 it will be warm enough I would have in 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.410
 week but in any case I will not play 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 more so that's sure on weekdays the 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.730
 weekend I would like a little but it's going 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.980
 to be hot because I had and I 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.250
 course on saturday morning at thales three 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.550

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.880
 Sunday after I will have a little time 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.230
 free and a little history 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.670
 so I will not play masses 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.590
 I hope you understand my name 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.250
 but in any case that's this year I 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 I'll have a lot of work you did so I 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 plead me on my channel I 'll be 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.860
 less active but I will try to 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.069
 continue to weigh 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.290
 2nd the cases you see I'm at 25 in 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.830
 very little time we do not even have three 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.110
 minutes on every bus bones had 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.519
 started quite slowly but well 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:09.500
 I'm going fast enough so the second one 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.810
 the second thing here so spoken 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.380
 it was the ideas so basically I 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.140
 looking for ideas for my channel then 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:21.200
 that didier be idea a level like 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.769
 atari looks good at videos 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.380
 basically I have stock in the gameplay 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.480
 ok that's not too poem the night I 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.819
 can do a last 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 stuff like that it happens what 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.500
 missing is for sure that one of the topics for 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.159
 my videos I never know too much about her 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.349
 technical 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:44.170
 so if you could please me 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:46.840
 gave topics for videos of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.470
 bullshit debates no I finally have the 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.750
 ideas what are I talking about there what 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.489
 would be pretty cool so I have it here j the 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.319
 note 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.239
 what I do not want either but gives 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.690
 in gameplay sleep or to tell of the 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.700
 shit 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.410
 Finally, I do not want to feel for the style 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.110
 she was singing advice on call of duty 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.519
 kid to everybody all so after 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.819
 I'm not asking for the death trick 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:12.099
 kill see but I ask for a trick ghost 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.810
 here is talk of bossens the tournament itself 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:17.500
 not that he still feels not brought in 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.060
 too low so it would not be bad that we 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:25.210
 gave me ideas and also at the level 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.289
 videos in red I do not know too much 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.860
 what to say in my videos 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.860
 so here we go 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.870
 now 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.550
 what can i still say 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:40.090
 there for example I have not much to 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.040
 tell my video if you give me some 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.100
 ideas to his rival to ilham will avoid from 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:47.470
 leave two three music clinics 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:51.780
 part I try to avoid the maintenance because 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.510
 that I know you do not have that so 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.470
 I will try to avoid that then at 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.830
 level of comments 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.770
 I saw in the previous video more 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:06.900
 even since as atari that basically you 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.740
 find that I'm lacking in that 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.810
 hatch I 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.340
 this pardon sentence I saw them 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:15.599
 often come back wasabi school fees 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.560
 you want peace that is not a 

00:05:15.599 --> 00:05:20.759
 because you have to know how to stop paris finally 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.380
 I can say good but I tried to 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:25.669
 put some enthusiasm all so 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.259
 after I do not know if it's a microphone or 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.740
 something but after when I 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.930
 replay 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
 indeed I have the impression that corn 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.539
 I feel like finally it does not commit suicide 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.210
 at all rpr when i started with 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.310
 how when pardon I comment on middle 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.289
 I was excited about 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.560
 the effort and all so there I do a 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:49.949
 extra effort for this video 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.830
 I hope you'll see this effort 

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:55.169
 and I hope she comments on how you 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.760
 not good but clear 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:59.260
 so here we go 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.670
 do not hesitate to tell me if you found 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.770
 what mountain better than the previous ones 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:06.370
 and I will do my best to 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.480
 improve it how did I get my first 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:15.550
 come case I'm 15 already for the 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:17.680
 second so I'm going to make myself 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.249
 doubling the excesses I'm not telling the 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.889
 shit 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:23.279
 I have not let all think so I 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.449
 will make me adouber unique 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:27.879
 this is not ready for this fight 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:29.289
 paris I have not much to say so 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.449
 I will stop talking because 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.339
 otherwise the greens to others I mean 

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:35.369
 shit and sweet so that will be all 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:37.539
 for this video good I leave you with 

00:06:35.369 --> 00:06:39.759
 a few minutes of music 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.369
 I hope it did not go awry and if 

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:46.079
 you do not want it to happen there 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:48.249
 just months of topics because 

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:49.089
 even if I'm not going to hurt you 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:51.039
 everything and that I will have a lot less 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:55.869
 time what's wrong with me it's not 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:07:00.699
 the gameplay is these comments too 

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:03.909
 well my voice and that's all for this 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:06.610
 nuclear gameplay on the spot 04 14 on 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.860
 mans solo here I hope that you 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.929
 will have pleased on this cat in the world 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.929
