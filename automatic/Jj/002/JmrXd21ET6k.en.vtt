hey guys quick vid here and show you the
boards<00:00:03.510> how<00:00:04.110> they<00:00:04.259> work<00:00:04.470> I<00:00:04.740> don't<00:00:05.009> have<00:00:05.130> them

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
boards how they work I don't have them

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.829 
boards how they work I don't have them
in<00:00:05.400> my<00:00:05.460> car<00:00:05.819> and<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.210> house<00:00:06.359> things<00:00:06.600> right<00:00:06.810> now

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
in my car and the house things right now

finishing those up

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.169 
finishing those up
I'll<00:00:08.910> have<00:00:09.030> them<00:00:09.240> up<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.690> soon<00:00:09.900> hopefully

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:11.179 
I'll have them up for you soon hopefully

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:21.859 
I'll have them up for you soon hopefully
it's<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.269> quick<00:00:12.300> shot<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.870> board's<00:00:20.869> wiring

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it's a quick shot of the board's wiring

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:22.519 
it's a quick shot of the board's wiring
right<00:00:22.080> here

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
right here

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.200 
right here
they<00:00:22.769> both<00:00:22.949> plug<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.609> don't<00:00:23.850> displace

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
they both plug in you don't displace

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.810 
they both plug in you don't displace
anything<00:00:24.720> plug<00:00:25.170> right<00:00:25.350> into<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.769> board<00:00:26.519> which

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
anything plug right into the board which

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.089 
anything plug right into the board which
is<00:00:26.970> right<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.830> switches<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.010> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
is right here switches for the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.529 
is right here switches for the
sequential<00:00:29.519> mode<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.090> turn<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.480> or

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
sequential mode you can turn it on or

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.430 
sequential mode you can turn it on or
off<00:00:30.750> as<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> relocation<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:33.000> wires<00:00:33.809> if<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.290> want

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
off as a relocation of wires if you want

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
off as a relocation of wires if you want
to<00:00:34.530> relocate<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:35.130> switch<00:00:35.880> somewhere<00:00:36.600> else

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
to relocate that switch somewhere else

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.430 
to relocate that switch somewhere else
like<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.590> by<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.550> dash<00:00:38.760> or<00:00:39.120> whatever<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
like up by your dash or whatever so you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
like up by your dash or whatever so you
can<00:00:40.559> turn<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.129> off<00:00:41.280> people<00:00:41.969> don't<00:00:42.270> like

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
can turn it on and off people don't like

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
can turn it on and off people don't like
the<00:00:42.600> sequential<00:00:42.989> mode<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.860> can<00:00:43.980> always<00:00:44.100> order

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
the sequential mode you can always order

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
the sequential mode you can always order
it<00:00:44.489> without<00:00:44.640> sequential<00:00:45.149> mode<00:00:45.239> too<00:00:45.480> if<00:00:45.629> you

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
it without sequential mode too if you

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.590 
it without sequential mode too if you
wanted<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> only<00:00:47.940> three<00:00:48.270> wires

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
wanted to but not the only three wires

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.810 
wanted to but not the only three wires
you<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.530> splice<00:00:49.800> in<00:00:50.039> anything<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.670> these

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you have to splice in anything are these

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.350 
you have to splice in anything are these
three<00:00:51.030> right<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:52.489> these<00:00:53.489> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.270> go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
three right here and these going to go

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.299 
three right here and these going to go
in<00:00:55.010> wire<00:00:56.010> harness<00:00:57.469> black<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.649> red<00:00:58.800> are<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
in wire harness black and red are the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.360 
in wire harness black and red are the
the<00:01:00.090> taillights<00:01:00.539> they<00:01:01.530> work<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.949> both<00:01:02.070> turn

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the taillights they work for both turn

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.960 
the taillights they work for both turn
signal<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> brake<00:01:03.030> light<00:01:04.640> yellow<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
signal and brake light yellow is the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.120 
signal and brake light yellow is the
running<00:01:06.659> lights<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:07.229> don't<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.770> with

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
running lights I don't have those with

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.590 
running lights I don't have those with
me<00:01:08.250> right<00:01:08.400> now<00:01:08.549> I'll<00:01:08.760> make<00:01:08.939> a<00:01:08.970> video<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.420> those

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
me right now I'll make a video of those

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
me right now I'll make a video of those
when<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.320> them<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.100> want<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.369> see<00:01:14.420> those

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
when I get them if you want to see those

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.820 
when I get them if you want to see those
are<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.630> three<00:01:15.840> wires<00:01:16.049> right<00:01:16.320> there<00:01:16.530> right

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
are the three wires right there right

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
are the three wires right there right
now<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.580> sequential<00:01:18.060> mode<00:01:18.619> make

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
now I have it in a sequential mode make

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.770 
now I have it in a sequential mode make
a<00:01:19.650> quick<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:20.939> then<00:01:21.240> I'll<00:01:21.390> turn

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
a quick video for you and then I'll turn

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.240 
a quick video for you and then I'll turn
the<00:01:21.900> sequential<00:01:22.200> off<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.770> can<00:01:22.860> see<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
the sequential off so you can see the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:35.380 
the sequential off so you can see the
brake<00:01:24.210> lights<00:01:24.479> but<00:01:24.930> um<00:01:25.580> here<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:33.110> sorry

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
brake lights but um here you go sorry

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.289 
brake lights but um here you go sorry
there<00:01:36.390> you<00:01:36.479> go

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
there you go

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.240 
there you go
it's<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.140> sequence<00:01:39.590> on<00:01:39.829> that<00:01:40.009> side<00:01:42.250> this

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
it's the sequence on that side this

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.169 
it's the sequence on that side this
sequence<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.359> other<00:01:44.479> side<00:01:45.850> sorry<00:01:46.850> it's<00:01:46.969> so

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179 
sequence on the other side sorry it's so

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:48.310 
sequence on the other side sorry it's so
shaky<00:01:47.210> I'm<00:01:47.600> trying<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.899> do<00:01:47.990> this<00:01:48.110> with<00:01:48.289> one

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
shaky I'm trying to do this with one

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.690 
shaky I'm trying to do this with one
hand<00:01:48.530> it's<00:01:48.860> not<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.130> easiest<00:01:49.340> thing<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
hand it's not the easiest thing in the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.200 
hand it's not the easiest thing in the
world<00:01:49.789> that<00:01:51.340> was<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.460> other<00:01:52.579> side

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
world that was the other side

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:02.949 
world that was the other side
go<00:01:54.340> turn<00:01:55.340> sequential<00:01:56.000> mode<00:01:56.179> off<00:01:59.350> we<00:02:00.350> go<00:02:01.959> there

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
go turn sequential mode off we go there

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.090 
go turn sequential mode off we go there
you<00:02:03.020> go<00:02:05.079> sorry<00:02:06.079> again<00:02:06.259> I'm<00:02:06.560> trying<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.860> do<00:02:06.979> this

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
you go sorry again I'm trying to do this

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.619 
you go sorry again I'm trying to do this
in<00:02:07.250> one<00:02:07.429> hand<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.850> not<00:02:08.000> exactly<00:02:08.390> the<00:02:08.599> easiest

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:08.629 
in one hand it's not exactly the easiest

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.240 
in one hand it's not exactly the easiest
thing<00:02:09.080> in<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.200> world<00:02:10.030> there<00:02:11.030> you<00:02:11.150> go

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
thing in the world there you go

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:22.089 
thing in the world there you go
other<00:02:13.250> side<00:02:20.170> that's<00:02:21.170> pretty<00:02:21.500> much<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:21.860> if<00:02:22.010> you
