00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello everyone today, I want you 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.849
 tell how to split a coconut and how 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.740
 choose coconut mean 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:15.179
 The main parameters of the choice of coconut and then 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.340
 that here these eyes were in color with us 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.640
 coconut that is not very dark 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.230
 still so dark and they're like 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.350
 moldy ie it is already 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.090
 shows that the coconut is spoiled and when 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.530
 you so shake that you can hear some water 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.620
 which is inside 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 it is treated means 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.629
 how are we going to chop coconut 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:48.539
 first we will need to pour out the liquid 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:50.600
 which is inside for that you need 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.360
 pierce one of these eyes 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.640
 coconut 3 peepholes and one of them 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.980
 it is pierced easier it is softer and two 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.199
 other sochi 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:05.820
 mean and here is the one that is closest 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.150
 located towards the center 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:16.350
 it will be the softest eye dad all 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:20.330
 pierced that is you i am a screwdriver and 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:26.780
 pierced, you can also use the stop 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.780
 a sharp knife and so here 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.490
 clear these throats they will be 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.689
 harder they harder pierced 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.810
 now drain the liquid from the coconut 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.140
 some capacity if coconut we have 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:00.359
 good not spoiled it is liquid to be 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.450
 tasty and sweet without any 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.420
 unpleasant odors to liquid 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.360
 poured easier and faster can be done 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.250
 one more hole one more option 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.319
 this you can put in the straw and give out 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.750
 this liquid 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:20.970
 but since I will use this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.239
 some coconut cooking 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:28.829
 I need to oil it so we go 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:34.970
 we will not drink but it is delicious therefore 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:38.670
 you can drink it with pleasure when 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:43.620
 vodichku was also just whether you can 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.829
 shake off if there is no sound that there 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.849
 splashing water means you already have all the juice 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:58.370
 poured but we got 1 coconut 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:03:02.639
 almost half a glass of juice now we will 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:05.150
 split how is he how to do us 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.010
 need some kind of hard object 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.819
 preferably metal so I took 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:17.730
 aluminum nut q and start coconut 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:20.430
 to knock our goal not from the first 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.400
 hitting smash a coconut and just evenly 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.859
 knock him pretty hard 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.859
 parties like this 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:13.980
 this part of coconut is weaker if 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.010
 on it knocks he rind will start 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.100
 crack you just can take it off 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.720
 and if you knock on the central part 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:26.790
 only goats will break into two parts but 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.380
 then a little uncomfortable to take out 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:33.360
 the flesh is better to peel 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.130
 cracked into several pieces 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.000
 which you just take off 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.740
 and thus the peel is separated as 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.750
 in the process of tapping you 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.760
 seem that all of you will not be able to 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.670
 when I split but just this 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.200
 the moment it starts to crack that is 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:54.980
 a few minutes of tapping and coconut 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.980
 will split 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.280
 hear the sound has changed when he 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:23.039
 I have already cracked a little 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:25.270
 deaf sound here is more such an assembly all 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:33.909
 the first piece disappeared 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:38.770
 and so here we remove the peel than convenient 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:42.069
 this way so that this pulp immediately 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.560
 separated from the peel if you just 

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:49.539
 you will knock on the center and coconut 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:52.960
 will split into two parts then not 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.979
 very convenient to take out the pulp to separate it 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.979
 skoda 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.259
 both 

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:18.699
 so we gave the peel of the pulp 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:21.810
 very easy and quick well five minutes and you 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:27.460
 cleaned the coconut and now this flesh 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:33.030
 we will shoot this dark pelt with a knife 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:36.220
 and I will cook coconut oil 

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:39.960
 see coconut recipe 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:43.080

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.660
 you plan to just eat 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.889
 just take the pieces took off that peel and 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:52.300
 eat or grate a cleaned 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.580
 coconut and 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.479
 you had coconut chips which 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.840
 can be used in cooking all 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:02.979
