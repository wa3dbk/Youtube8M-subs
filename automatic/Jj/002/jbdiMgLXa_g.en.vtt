00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
wing and I can't renew legs are call but

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.510 
wing and I can't renew legs are call but
we'll<00:02:31.320> hear<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> through<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.070> hinge<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.370> thing

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
we'll hear it through the hinge of thing

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.890 
we'll hear it through the hinge of thing
but<00:02:32.610> he's<00:02:32.730> got<00:02:32.880> some<00:02:33.000> personal<00:02:33.450> treads<00:02:33.780> that

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
but he's got some personal treads that

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.420 
but he's got some personal treads that
go<00:02:34.080> on<00:02:34.170> his<00:02:34.290> legs<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.710> they<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.950> combine<00:02:35.280> to

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
go on his legs and they can combine to

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.650 
go on his legs and they can combine to
form<00:02:35.460> scorpion<00:02:36.210> but<00:02:38.300> obviously<00:02:39.300> he<00:02:39.420> doesn't

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
form scorpion but obviously he doesn't

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:49.150 
form scorpion but obviously he doesn't
do<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.020> is<00:02:40.350> palpable

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:03:11.210 

so<00:02:50.160> there's<00:02:50.340> drill<00:02:50.670> arm<00:02:58.820> breast<00:02:59.820> caner<00:03:10.220> crane

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
so there's drill arm breast caner crane

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:21.740 
so there's drill arm breast caner crane
arm<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:13.230> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.500> crane<00:03:13.739> nose<00:03:13.920> their<00:03:20.750> utter

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
arm with a little crane nose their utter

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:35.390 
arm with a little crane nose their utter
wing<00:03:23.030> cutter<00:03:24.030> wing<00:03:24.239> if<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.450> did<00:03:24.570> you<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:35.370> a

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
wing cutter wing if you did you have a

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:45.860 
wing cutter wing if you did you have a
shovel<00:03:35.760> arm

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.820 

chapter<00:03:46.870> pillar<00:03:47.080> leg<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.440> think<00:03:47.470> is<00:03:47.650> what<00:03:47.770> he

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
chapter pillar leg I think is what he

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.660 
chapter pillar leg I think is what he
said<00:03:48.040> there<00:03:49.530> and<00:03:50.530> those<00:03:51.160> and<00:03:51.370> those<00:03:51.430> are<00:03:51.490> the

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
said there and those and those are the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.190 
said there and those and those are the
six<00:03:51.880> upgrades<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.420> again<00:03:52.750> you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:52.990> even

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
six upgrades and again you can even

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.990 
six upgrades and again you can even
close<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:53.650> manually<00:03:54.190> anytime<00:03:54.520> you<00:03:54.610> want<00:03:54.820> it

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
close that manually anytime you want it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.150 
close that manually anytime you want it
doesn't<00:03:55.270> automatically<00:03:55.690> close<00:03:55.900> itself<00:03:56.290> and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
doesn't automatically close itself and

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.710 
doesn't automatically close itself and
there's<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.490> purple<00:03:57.700> Gloin<00:03:58.030> now<00:03:58.390> if<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.540> put

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
there's the purple Gloin now if you put

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.600 
there's the purple Gloin now if you put
it<00:03:58.840> can<00:03:59.080> hold<00:03:59.230> two<00:03:59.590> coins<00:03:59.920> at<00:04:00.100> a<00:04:00.160> time<00:04:00.340> if<00:04:00.490> you

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
it can hold two coins at a time if you

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.910 
it can hold two coins at a time if you
put<00:04:00.820> into<00:04:01.290> indirect<00:04:02.290> succession<00:04:02.770> before

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
put into indirect succession before

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.470 
put into indirect succession before
turning<00:04:03.400> it<00:04:03.490> he'll<00:04:03.640> do<00:04:03.820> his<00:04:04.000> cell<00:04:04.240> burst

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
turning it he'll do his cell burst

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.810 
turning it he'll do his cell burst
attack

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:19.289 

okay<00:04:17.609> so<00:04:18.609> Brentley<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.910> don't<00:04:19.060> actually<00:04:19.150> have

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
okay so Brentley you don't actually have

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.640 
okay so Brentley you don't actually have
to<00:04:19.420> put<00:04:19.540> two<00:04:19.660> coins<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.019> you<00:04:20.140> can<00:04:20.260> just<00:04:20.410> bounce

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
to put two coins and you can just bounce

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.680 
to put two coins and you can just bounce
your<00:04:20.890> coin<00:04:21.220> off<00:04:21.459> of<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.730> alpha<00:04:22.300> that<00:04:22.420> thing

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
your coin off of that alpha that thing

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.690 
your coin off of that alpha that thing
now<00:04:23.230> basically<00:04:23.560> more<00:04:23.740> anymore<00:04:24.400> than<00:04:24.550> one

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
now basically more anymore than one

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:36.000 
now basically more anymore than one
register<00:04:24.880> of<00:04:25.240> that<00:04:25.420> does<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.780> cell<00:04:25.960> break<00:04:35.010> so

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
register of that does the cell break so

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.030 
register of that does the cell break so
there's<00:04:36.190> that<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.500> that's<00:04:38.650> really<00:04:38.770> all<00:04:38.950> there

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
there's that and that's really all there

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.810 
there's that and that's really all there
is<00:04:39.100> to<00:04:39.220> it<00:04:39.490> that's<00:04:39.700> the<00:04:40.030> DX<00:04:40.660> birth<00:04:41.020> driver

is to it that's the DX birth driver

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.750 
is to it that's the DX birth driver
really<00:04:42.820> pretty<00:04:42.970> cool<00:04:43.180> I<00:04:44.400> love<00:04:45.400> turning<00:04:45.670> them

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
really pretty cool I love turning them

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.520 
really pretty cool I love turning them
off<00:04:45.910> I<00:04:46.180> just<00:04:46.960> love<00:04:47.110> them

off I just love them
the<00:04:48.160> gashapon<00:04:48.790> you<00:04:49.360> know<00:04:49.450> capsule<00:04:49.870> toward

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
the gashapon you know capsule toward

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.330 
the gashapon you know capsule toward
machine<00:04:50.260> aspect<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.770> I<00:04:50.830> love<00:04:50.980> the<00:04:51.040> little

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
machine aspect of it I love the little

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.430 
machine aspect of it I love the little
when<00:04:51.940> it<00:04:52.030> when<00:04:52.330> it<00:04:52.360> pops<00:04:52.690> I<00:04:53.020> think<00:04:53.320> that's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
when it when it pops I think that's
