here<00:00:45.629> now<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.010> need<00:00:47.219> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
here now the first thing you need to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.549 
here now the first thing you need to
think<00:00:48.059> about<00:00:48.180> when<00:00:48.570> you're<00:00:48.719> drawing<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
think about when you're drawing here is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:50.990 
think about when you're drawing here is
where<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> crown<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> head<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.910> to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
where the crown of the head is going to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.240 
where the crown of the head is going to
be<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.899> decide<00:00:52.350> where<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
be so decide where that's going to be to

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.170 
be so decide where that's going to be to
start<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.730> them<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.059> mark<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.140> then

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
start with them just mark it and then

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.349 
start with them just mark it and then
first<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.559> you<00:00:58.559> need<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> draw<00:00:59.640> a<00:01:00.000> few

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
first of all you need to draw a few

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:10.500 
first of all you need to draw a few
radiating<00:01:01.140> lines<00:01:01.410> out<00:01:02.300> from<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> crown

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.780 

some<00:01:11.140> of<00:01:11.230> them<00:01:11.350> can<00:01:11.500> be<00:01:11.620> quite<00:01:11.650> large<00:01:14.340> okay<00:01:15.340> and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
some of them can be quite large okay and

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
some of them can be quite large okay and
some<00:01:16.060> quite<00:01:16.390> small<00:01:16.750> because<00:01:17.740> here<00:01:17.980> is<00:01:19.320> well

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.260 

has<00:01:23.350> a<00:01:23.380> life<00:01:23.650> of<00:01:23.770> its<00:01:23.860> own<00:01:24.100> really<00:01:24.460> so<00:01:24.910> you<00:01:24.970> want

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.260 
has a life of its own really so you want
to<00:01:25.390> convey<00:01:25.690> that<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.890> your<00:01:27.040> drawing<00:01:27.460> so<00:01:28.240> you

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270

to convey that in your drawing so you
want<00:01:28.480> to<00:01:28.600> make<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.810> series<00:01:29.380> of<00:01:29.410> s<00:01:30.070> shapes

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
want to make a series of s shapes

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.580 
want to make a series of s shapes
towards<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:31.480> edge<00:01:31.600> notice<00:01:32.080> I'm<00:01:32.230> not<00:01:32.350> really

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
towards the edge notice I'm not really

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.890 
towards the edge notice I'm not really
worrying<00:01:32.890> about<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.280> middle<00:01:33.550> just<00:01:33.730> yet<00:01:33.970> I'm

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
worrying about the middle just yet I'm

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.640 
worrying about the middle just yet I'm
just<00:01:35.260> forming<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:37.180> shape<00:01:37.480> of<00:01:37.660> the<00:01:37.810> air<00:01:37.960> the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
just forming the shape of the air the

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.220 
just forming the shape of the air the
hair<00:01:38.860> rather<00:01:39.130> with<00:01:39.610> these<00:01:39.790> little<00:01:39.970> s<00:01:40.890> shapes

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 
hair rather with these little s shapes

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:51.300 
hair rather with these little s shapes
running<00:01:44.230> down<00:01:47.430> okay<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:50.500> then<00:01:51.070> what<00:01:51.220> you

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
running down okay right then what you

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.650 
running down okay right then what you
can<00:01:51.430> do<00:01:51.610> in<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.790> middle<00:01:52.030> is<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.240> same<00:01:52.450> thing

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
can do in the middle is the same thing

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.280 
can do in the middle is the same thing
again<00:01:52.780> but<00:01:53.080> this<00:01:53.230> time<00:01:53.820> you're<00:01:54.960> making<00:01:55.960> them

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
again but this time you're making them

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.440 
again but this time you're making them
more<00:01:56.470> ribbon<00:01:56.860> like<00:01:57.100> I'm<00:01:57.610> sort<00:01:58.030> of<00:01:58.060> adding<00:01:58.390> a

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
more ribbon like I'm sort of adding a

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
more ribbon like I'm sort of adding a
second<00:01:58.810> edge<00:01:58.960> to<00:01:59.950> every<00:02:00.280> S<00:02:00.430> I'm<00:02:00.880> creating

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
second edge to every S I'm creating

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.950 
second edge to every S I'm creating
because<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.580> would<00:02:03.730> see<00:02:04.030> more<00:02:04.300> of<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.450> sort

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
because you would see more of that sort

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.470 
because you would see more of that sort
of<00:02:05.050> effect<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:06.340> the<00:02:06.580> back<00:02:06.760> of<00:02:06.940> someone's<00:02:07.360> head

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
of effect on the back of someone's head

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.220 
of effect on the back of someone's head
and<00:02:09.119> again<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.480> of<00:02:10.510> the<00:02:10.660> essays<00:02:11.020> are<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
and again some of the essays are the

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.650 
and again some of the essays are the
right<00:02:11.410> way<00:02:11.620> round<00:02:12.180> some<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.360> marine

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
right way round some of the marine

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.360 
right way round some of the marine
reverse<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.560> I'm<00:02:17.560> still<00:02:17.920> keeping<00:02:18.280> this

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
reverse like so I'm still keeping this

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.030 
reverse like so I'm still keeping this

original lines as a guide you're going

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.500 
original lines as a guide you're going
over<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.070> with<00:02:45.810> slightly<00:02:46.810> stronger<00:02:48.510> marks

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
over them with slightly stronger marks

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.070 
over them with slightly stronger marks
now<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:51.370> create<00:02:51.580> your

now to create your

now to create your
curly<00:02:53.770> curly<00:02:54.130> wavy<00:02:54.340> hair<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:59.830> I<00:02:59.950> suppose

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
curly curly wavy hair and in I suppose

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.620 
curly curly wavy hair and in I suppose
if<00:03:00.370> we<00:03:00.460> wanted<00:03:00.730> to<00:03:00.790> add<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:00.970> bit<00:03:01.210> of<00:03:01.240> shade<00:03:01.600> I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
if we wanted to add a bit of shade I

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.130 
if we wanted to add a bit of shade I
would<00:03:01.840> use<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.650> pencil<00:03:02.890> much<00:03:03.160> lighter<00:03:03.490> and

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
would use the pencil much lighter and

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.980 
would use the pencil much lighter and
still<00:03:05.140> working<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.860> lines<00:03:06.630> rather<00:03:07.630> than

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:07.990 
still working in lines rather than

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.200 
still working in lines rather than
shading<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.160> they're<00:03:09.400> still<00:03:09.700> working<00:03:09.940> in

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210 
shading like they're still working in

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:16.470 
shading like they're still working in
lines<00:03:12.120> I'm<00:03:13.120> going<00:03:13.510> over<00:03:13.810> bits<00:03:14.020> of<00:03:14.260> it<00:03:15.480> down

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480

lines I'm going over bits of it down
here<00:03:16.810> I'm<00:03:16.930> doing<00:03:17.050> the<00:03:17.170> same<00:03:17.410> thing<00:03:17.470> I'm<00:03:18.070> going

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
here I'm doing the same thing I'm going

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.430 
here I'm doing the same thing I'm going
over<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.940> again<00:03:19.030> with<00:03:19.210> lighter<00:03:19.540> lines<00:03:19.930> but<00:03:20.260> I'm

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
over it again with lighter lines but I'm

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:28.530 
over it again with lighter lines but I'm
doing<00:03:20.940> s's<00:03:21.940> again<00:03:24.360> just<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.540> give<00:03:25.780> a<00:03:27.540> little

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
doing s's again just to give a little

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.870 
doing s's again just to give a little
bit<00:03:28.780> of<00:03:28.930> shading<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.800> head<00:03:32.280> maybe<00:03:33.280> make<00:03:33.850> it

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
bit of shading to the head maybe make it

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.220 
bit of shading to the head maybe make it
look<00:03:34.150> as<00:03:34.240> though<00:03:34.360> it's<00:03:34.480> catching<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.050> light<00:03:35.170> a

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
look as though it's catching the light a

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.000 
look as though it's catching the light a
little<00:03:35.530> bit<00:03:36.930> all<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.170> time<00:03:38.410> you're<00:03:38.620> making

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
little bit all the time you're making

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.240 
little bit all the time you're making
shapes<00:03:39.310> like<00:03:39.730> this<00:03:40.140> wavy<00:03:41.140> wiggly<00:03:41.650> shapes<00:03:41.950> all

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
shapes like this wavy wiggly shapes all

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.720 
shapes like this wavy wiggly shapes all
the<00:03:42.400> time<00:03:42.640> because<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.810> hair<00:03:44.080> is<00:03:44.730> is

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
the time because this hair is is

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.790 
the time because this hair is is
representing<00:03:46.390> wavy<00:03:46.750> hair

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.140 

that's<00:03:55.800> to<00:03:55.980> find<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> edge<00:03:56.520> a<00:03:56.550> wee<00:03:56.880> bit<00:03:57.030> more

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
that's to find the edge a wee bit more

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.370 
that's to find the edge a wee bit more
obviously<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.600> is<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.870> back<00:03:58.020> of<00:03:58.170> someone's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
obviously this is the back of someone's

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.640 
obviously this is the back of someone's
head<00:03:58.800> so<00:03:59.190> um<00:03:59.580> I<00:04:00.020> thought<00:04:01.020> this<00:04:01.170> was<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.470> best

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
head so um I thought this was the best

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.480 
head so um I thought this was the best
way<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.830> show<00:04:02.160> you<00:04:02.220> really<00:04:02.520> and<00:04:03.270> that's<00:04:03.480> really

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
way to show you really and that's really

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.880 
way to show you really and that's really
all<00:04:05.490> there<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.240> it

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.040 

there<00:04:10.890> we<00:04:11.010> are
