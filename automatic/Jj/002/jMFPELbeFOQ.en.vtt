00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.770
 I need you to help me understand something that is preaching last Sunday 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.260
 to see young lady in that I can help you 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.580
 you told us that god does not want anyone to grow 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.580
 however it is evident that many have spent an eternity without Christ 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.119
 means this that God can not get what he wants 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.120
 God does not force anyone to come to Christ 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.750
 he decided to give men the freedom to choose depends on man 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.210
 make good use of the sacrifice of Jesus Christ 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.220
 then salvation regardless of the presence of 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.660
 God 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.630
 I'm the one who decides if you see something year 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.720
 they have told us the mercy of God 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.860
 my faith in the scriptures 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.290
 it does not depend on who wants it level that runs but of god who has 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.320
 mercy 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.870
 she just told me that it depends on the man 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.240
 as he told us on Sunday it depends on god pair of men 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.090
 of both andy 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.100
 god does his part ii the man must do his 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.040
 so then 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.960
 salvation does not depend on god but on man 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.250
 if it is necessary that the Britons their part so that the part they visited 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.920
 what does that mean that without the man's part the criteria do not 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.890
 it's no use 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.879
 God made 99 percent 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.890
 we must put the 1 percent that is missing so that we can be saved 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.180
 that means that if the percent condominates 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.140
 what Christ made all that sacrifice that speaks the scriptures was in vain 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 and it's no use salvation is man's then 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.220
 sandino you understand 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.680
 Salvation depends on them 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.380
 if only you could listen to yourself 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.060
 what he is saying is a complete contradiction if Christ died for me 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.409
 for me to be saved more however I must make the decision to accept it 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.980
 so that it can be saved then that salvation is in my hands in in the 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.750
 God's hands that means that salvation depends on the angels 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.479
 God gives us a free will for what we choose between good and evil 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.960
 God does not obligate anyone only those who want to make good use of their free 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.300
 will be saved 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.480
 but pastor 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.680
 Jesus told him that the man who fishes that is the key to sin 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 how can a person be clarified the time 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.190
 sandy I must go home already 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.360
 I need to count on some brothers for the arrangements of the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.350
 vangelis campaign you dwell next week you know remember to pray for 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.440
 that God speaks the hearts of the people who will be there 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.369
 but pastor 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.670
 to break God to open hearts if you say it does not depend 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.659
 of the most if the men's 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:12.760
 that such facts 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.710
