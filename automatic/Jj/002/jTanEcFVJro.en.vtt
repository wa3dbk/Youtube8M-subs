00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
over Matthew yet and I'm actually hoping

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.220 
over Matthew yet and I'm actually hoping
that<00:04:57.180> her<00:04:57.300> and<00:04:57.420> Tom<00:04:57.570> get<00:04:57.810> together<00:04:57.960> I<00:04:58.170> mean

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
that her and Tom get together I mean

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.690 
that her and Tom get together I mean
they<00:04:58.470> basically<00:04:58.650> are<00:04:59.130> both<00:04:59.370> single<00:04:59.550> parents

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
they basically are both single parents

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.610 
they basically are both single parents
at<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.240> point<00:05:00.510> and<00:05:00.690> they<00:05:01.260> have<00:05:01.410> a<00:05:01.440> nice

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
at this point and they have a nice

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.650 
at this point and they have a nice
dynamic<00:05:01.920> with<00:05:02.310> one<00:05:02.490> another<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:02.970> seems<00:05:03.360> like

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
dynamic with one another it seems like

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.530 
dynamic with one another it seems like
she<00:05:03.900> can<00:05:04.050> be<00:05:04.080> herself<00:05:04.380> with<00:05:04.680> him<00:05:05.010> and<00:05:05.340> he<00:05:06.300> can

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.640 
but right now I'm enjoying I'm enjoying
the<00:05:38.370> season<00:05:38.760> hopefully<00:05:39.540> it's<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.530> know

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650

the season hopefully it's you know
obviously<00:05:41.120> you<00:05:42.120> know<00:05:42.240> there's<00:05:42.930> nothing

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
obviously you know there's nothing

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.620 
obviously you know there's nothing
exciting<00:05:43.980> about<00:05:44.190> what<00:05:45.000> happened<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.480> Anna

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
exciting about what happened to Anna

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.320 
exciting about what happened to Anna
there's<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.770> know<00:05:46.800> but<00:05:47.100> it's<00:05:47.310> a<00:05:47.550> reality<00:05:47.820> that

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
there's you know but it's a reality that

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.700 
there's you know but it's a reality that
these<00:05:48.480> types<00:05:48.780> of<00:05:48.930> things<00:05:48.990> happen<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.590> it

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:49.710 
these types of things happen and it

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.770 
these types of things happen and it
usually<00:05:49.890> happens<00:05:50.220> when<00:05:50.700> it's<00:05:51.420> somebody<00:05:51.750> that

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
usually happens when it's somebody that

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.420 
usually happens when it's somebody that
you<00:05:51.990> know<00:05:52.020> not<00:05:52.500> necessarily<00:05:52.710> a<00:05:53.040> complete

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 
you know not necessarily a complete

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.800 
you know not necessarily a complete
stranger<00:05:53.670> and<00:05:54.060> I<00:05:54.090> think<00:05:54.270> that's<00:05:54.420> what<00:05:54.600> makes

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
stranger and I think that's what makes

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.510 
stranger and I think that's what makes
it<00:05:54.900> even<00:05:55.050> more<00:05:55.170> horrific<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.950> that<00:05:56.130> she

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
it even more horrific is that she

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.050 
it even more horrific is that she
trusted<00:05:56.880> him<00:05:57.060> and<00:05:57.120> she<00:05:57.810> she<00:05:58.320> had<00:05:58.790> she<00:05:59.790> wasn't

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
trusted him and she she had she wasn't

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.330 
trusted him and she she had she wasn't
looking<00:06:00.150> at<00:06:00.390> him<00:06:00.510> in<00:06:00.780> an<00:06:00.900> evil<00:06:01.320> way<00:06:01.350> ever<00:06:01.950> and

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
looking at him in an evil way ever and

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.220 
looking at him in an evil way ever and
the<00:06:02.940> fact<00:06:03.090> that<00:06:03.150> this<00:06:03.300> happened<00:06:03.750> to<00:06:03.840> her<00:06:03.990> when

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
the fact that this happened to her when

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.910 
the fact that this happened to her when
she<00:06:04.410> was<00:06:04.530> so<00:06:04.760> vulnerable<00:06:05.760> it's<00:06:06.270> just<00:06:06.480> so<00:06:06.600> sad

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:06.920 
she was so vulnerable it's just so sad

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.290 
she was so vulnerable it's just so sad
so<00:06:07.920> I'm<00:06:08.010> hoping<00:06:08.340> that<00:06:08.400> the<00:06:08.700> you<00:06:08.940> know<00:06:09.060> the

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
so I'm hoping that the you know the

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.750 
so I'm hoping that the you know the
season<00:06:09.690> can<00:06:09.960> you<00:06:10.680> know<00:06:10.800> we<00:06:11.190> can<00:06:11.310> move<00:06:11.460> on<00:06:11.610> to
