and Henry Cavill the thing is though is

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.100 
and Henry Cavill the thing is though is
that<00:02:59.909> he<00:03:00.060> better<00:03:00.239> hit<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.510> weights<00:03:00.780> quite<00:03:01.079> a

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
that he better hit the weights quite a

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.990 
that he better hit the weights quite a
bit<00:03:01.349> because<00:03:01.500> he<00:03:01.680> doesn't<00:03:01.920> really<00:03:02.280> he's

all the action scenes were going to see

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.089 
all the action scenes were going to see
in<00:03:12.689> this<00:03:13.409> movie<00:03:14.220> or<00:03:14.370> these<00:03:14.519> we<00:03:14.670> should<00:03:14.849> see<00:03:15.090> I

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
in this movie or these we should see I

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.229 
in this movie or these we should see I
mean<00:03:17.099> there<00:03:17.370> was<00:03:17.459> lots<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.790> other<00:03:17.940> choices

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
mean there was lots of other choices

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.640 
mean there was lots of other choices
Hugh<00:03:18.629> Jackman<00:03:19.140> would<00:03:19.290> have<00:03:19.379> been<00:03:19.470> a<00:03:19.500> better

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
Hugh Jackman would have been a better

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.890 
Hugh Jackman would have been a better
choice<00:03:19.799> i<00:03:20.220> think<00:03:20.459> if<00:03:21.209> Christian<00:03:21.599> Bale<00:03:21.750> was

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
choice i think if Christian Bale was

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.449 
choice i think if Christian Bale was
willing<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.230> return<00:03:22.440> there<00:03:22.889> was<00:03:22.980> rumors<00:03:23.370> that

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
willing to return there was rumors that

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.129

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
they were throwing money at him in the

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.589 
they were throwing money at him in the
offers<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:25.590> he<00:03:25.950> seems<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.940> either<00:03:27.269> those

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
rumors weren't true or Christian Bale

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.699

not<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.370> worst<00:03:53.609> choice<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.299> world<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:55.109> I

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
not the worst choice in the world but I

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.250 
not the worst choice in the world but I
definitely<00:03:56.010> have<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> hard<00:03:56.699> time<00:03:56.940> see<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:58.139> know

pull<00:04:10.829> off<00:04:10.980> his<00:04:11.160> Batman<00:04:11.579> I<00:04:11.760> guess<00:04:12.269> they<00:04:12.480> could

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
pull off his Batman I guess they could

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.270 
pull off his Batman I guess they could
just<00:04:12.660> get<00:04:13.019> you<00:04:13.199> know<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.470> stunt<00:04:13.709> guys<00:04:13.919> to<00:04:14.160> work

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
just get you know the stunt guys to work

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.830 
just get you know the stunt guys to work
on<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.639> or<00:04:14.760> whatever<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.060> case<00:04:15.239> may<00:04:15.449> be<00:04:15.480> for

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
on it or whatever the case may be for

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.719 
on it or whatever the case may be for
that<00:04:15.870> so<00:04:16.620> maybe<00:04:16.859> they<00:04:17.039> could<00:04:17.220> call<00:04:17.430> Scott

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
that so maybe they could call Scott

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.490 
that so maybe they could call Scott
Adkins<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.299> get<00:04:18.449> him<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.690> do<00:04:18.840> these<00:04:19.049> stunts
