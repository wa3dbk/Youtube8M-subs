00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:07.680
 our instructions contain type a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.740
 Food from all four important 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.750
 food groups our goal is the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.139
 daily need for nutrients too 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.139
 cover 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.180
 we have to give our children every day 0 2 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.369
 liters of fresh milk give to them 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.750
 sufficiently with calcium riboflavin and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.529
 other nutrients are supplied 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.720
 For decades, the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.000
 dairy industry and the us government 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 Milk is good for the bone calcium 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.660
 that for a healthy skeleton 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.399
 is essential in all 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.680
 wholesome foods 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.120
 but it is claimed that man 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.520
 more needed and therefore 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.230
 Dairy products should be taken before 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.280
 to all children and older women 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.570
 advised to drink more and more milk 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.660
 what is the most important nutrient in 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.020
 dairy products march 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.290
 the Carinthian card 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.290
 clear 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.780
 Osteoporosis or bone loss is 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.700
 a common age disorder the most 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.860
 is attributed to calcium deficiency 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.049
 but that would have to correct the 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.000
 Osteoporosis rate in countries where 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.050
 many calcium-rich dairy products 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.119
 being consumed will be particularly low 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.580
 but a Harvard study proves that 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.799
 just where people use a lot of calcium too 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.440
 are most often the ones for 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.440
 Osteoporosis typical hip fractures comes 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.680
 the higher the milk consumption the higher the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:37.600
 osteoporosis rate 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.030
 that's exactly the opposite of what 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.280
 one of the milk industry tells us 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.530
 the reason for this is that animal protein 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.700
 to the metabolic dose of an acidity 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.740
 of the body can lead 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.440
 to make up for this hyperacidity 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.119
 the body of europe uses 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.240
 he can most easily access 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.470
 on the calcium in our bones 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.190
 this process becomes the skeleton 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.190
 weakened
