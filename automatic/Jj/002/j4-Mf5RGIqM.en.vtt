direction we go to the button on the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
direction we go to the button on the
wall<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.760> corresponds<00:00:51.449> to<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:51.870> we'll

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
wall that corresponds to it and we'll

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.770 
wall that corresponds to it and we'll
press<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.969> line<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.180> gravel<00:00:54.600> falls

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
press that and a line of gravel falls

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.830 
press that and a line of gravel falls
down<00:00:55.309> then<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:56.820> do<00:00:57.090> is<00:00:57.149> press<00:00:57.510> this<00:00:57.629> button

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
down then all we do is press this button

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.920 
down then all we do is press this button
and<00:00:58.050> we'll<00:00:58.890> press<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.340> twice<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.480> reason<00:01:00.809> we

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and we'll press it twice the reason we

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.100 
and we'll press it twice the reason we
do<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> twice<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.910> once<00:01:02.910> base<00:01:03.359> movement<00:01:03.989> is

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
do it twice is once base movement is

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.460 
do it twice is once base movement is
equivalent<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.890> two<00:01:05.159> blocks<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.869> say<00:01:07.080> if

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
equivalent to two blocks so to say if

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.210 
equivalent to two blocks so to say if
the<00:01:08.150> car<00:01:09.150> was<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.720> we<00:01:10.439> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.740> move<00:01:10.860> one

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the car was here and we want to move one

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.289 
the car was here and we want to move one
space<00:01:11.369> we<00:01:12.299> go<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.200> then<00:01:13.950> two<00:01:14.100> such<00:01:14.460> one

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
space we go one and then two such one

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.840 
space we go one and then two such one
space<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.320> block<00:01:16.950> movements<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:20.490> reason

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
space is to block movements the reason

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.170 
space is to block movements the reason
that's<00:01:21.060> done<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.080> say<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.850> wanted<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> move

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's done is to say I wanted to move

gravel Pistons that are found in there
if<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.010> get<00:02:14.160> really<00:02:14.340> really<00:02:14.640> stuck<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.629> you

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
if you get really really stuck and you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
if you get really really stuck and you
don't<00:02:15.840> know<00:02:15.989> what<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
don't know what to do you can have a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.520 
don't know what to do you can have a
peek<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> solutions<00:02:18.810> I've<00:02:18.959> been<00:02:19.110> included

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
peek at the solutions I've been included

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.350 
peek at the solutions I've been included
them<00:02:19.920> all<00:02:20.069> in<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.340> little<00:02:20.700> red<00:02:20.849> room<00:02:21.090> found

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
them all in this little red room found

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.940 
them all in this little red room found
here<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:22.019> opposite<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.650> exit<00:02:24.799> you<00:02:25.799> just

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
here just opposite the exit you just

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.460 
here just opposite the exit you just
follow<00:02:26.099> all<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:26.489> codes<00:02:26.819> and<00:02:27.319> yeah<00:02:28.319> it's

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
follow all these codes and yeah it's

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.550 
follow all these codes and yeah it's
pretty<00:02:28.650> straightforward<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.630> for<00:02:31.319> level

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
pretty straightforward this for level

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.650 
pretty straightforward this for level
one<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:31.950> got<00:02:32.489> eight<00:02:32.790> movements<00:02:33.239> in<00:02:33.360> total

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
one it's got eight movements in total

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.630 
one it's got eight movements in total
and<00:02:33.840> that<00:02:33.900> will<00:02:34.319> get<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.920> red<00:02:35.280> card<00:02:35.519> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
and that will get you the red card to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.500 
and that will get you the red card to
exit<00:02:35.760> from<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> intersection<00:02:38.299> one<00:02:39.299> little

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
exit from the intersection one little

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.240 
exit from the intersection one little
important<00:02:40.019> thing<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.410> can<00:02:40.440> only<00:02:40.769> move

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
important thing we can only move

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.339 
important thing we can only move
vehicles<00:02:41.819> in<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> direction<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:43.079> they're

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
vehicles in the direction that they're

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.250 
vehicles in the direction that they're
facing<00:02:43.549> so<00:02:44.549> this<00:02:44.849> green<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.870> only<00:02:46.019> move

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
facing so this green one can only move

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.949 
facing so this green one can only move
left<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.709> right<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:48.090> blue<00:02:48.390> one<00:02:48.420> yellow

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
left to right and that blue one yellow

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.750 
left to right and that blue one yellow
one<00:02:49.049> purple<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.590> they<00:02:49.709> can<00:02:49.829> only<00:02:49.950> move<00:02:50.190> up<00:02:50.489> and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
one purple and they can only move up and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.500 
one purple and they can only move up and
down<00:02:51.290> so<00:02:52.290> yeah<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.819> is<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> first<00:02:54.299> level

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
down so yeah this is the first level

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.110 
down so yeah this is the first level
it's<00:02:54.870> relatively<00:02:55.500> easy<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.819> keep<00:02:56.970> on

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it's relatively easy as you keep on

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.449 
it's relatively easy as you keep on
going<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.230> get<00:02:58.560> harder<00:02:58.920> I've<00:02:59.069> included

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
going they do get harder I've included

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.479 
going they do get harder I've included
five<00:02:59.880> levels<00:03:00.329> in<00:03:00.480> total<00:03:00.510> I'm<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.739> fifth<00:03:01.980> one<00:03:02.190> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
five levels in total I'm the fifth one a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.879 
five levels in total I'm the fifth one a
heads<00:03:03.120> up<00:03:03.299> it<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.660> quite<00:03:03.959> hard<00:03:03.989> so<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.769> you

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
heads up it is quite hard so if you

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.530 
heads up it is quite hard so if you
can't<00:03:05.250> get<00:03:05.519> it<00:03:05.700> without<00:03:05.819> looking<00:03:06.299> at<00:03:06.389> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
can't get it without looking at the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.539 
can't get it without looking at the
solution<00:03:07.019> don't<00:03:07.410> stress<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.889> is<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.370> hard

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
solution don't stress it is really hard

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.819 
solution don't stress it is really hard
but<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.389> you<00:03:09.480> do<00:03:09.660> manage<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.989> do<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.260> job<00:03:10.650> well

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
but if you do manage to do it job well

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.170 
but if you do manage to do it job well
done<00:03:11.069> it's<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.579> really<00:03:11.849> good<00:03:11.940> achievement

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
done it's a really good achievement

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.509 
done it's a really good achievement
actually<00:03:12.930> because<00:03:13.200> I<00:03:13.500> couldn't<00:03:14.160> even<00:03:14.220> do<00:03:14.459> it

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
actually because I couldn't even do it

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.830 
actually because I couldn't even do it
without<00:03:14.730> looking<00:03:14.880> at<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.299> solutions<00:03:16.130> and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
without looking at the solutions and

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.120 
without looking at the solutions and
yeah<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.109> may<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.349> well<00:03:19.410> finish<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.859> one<00:03:20.099> up

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
yeah I may as well finish this one up

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.550 
yeah I may as well finish this one up
just<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.880> give<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.180> show<00:03:21.660> how<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:21.959> game<00:03:22.319> works

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
just to give you show how the game works

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.390 
just to give you show how the game works
and<00:03:23.359> yeah<00:03:24.410> another<00:03:25.410> thing<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:25.829> you<00:03:26.069> are

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
and yeah another thing that you are

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.009 
and yeah another thing that you are
allowed<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.760> do<00:03:27.030> if<00:03:27.180> there's<00:03:27.389> any<00:03:27.510> gravel<00:03:27.900> on

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
allowed to do if there's any gravel on

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.390 
allowed to do if there's any gravel on
the<00:03:28.049> track<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.650> are<00:03:28.829> allowed<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.160> just

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
the track you are allowed to just

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.099 
the track you are allowed to just
destroy<00:03:29.819> it<00:03:29.970> that's<00:03:30.329> no<00:03:30.510> big<00:03:30.690> deal<00:03:30.900> because

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
destroy it that's no big deal because

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.599 
destroy it that's no big deal because
you<00:03:31.410> needed<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.799> move<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.190> otherwise<00:03:32.430> it's

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
you needed to move and otherwise it's

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.920 
you needed to move and otherwise it's
just<00:03:32.730> going<00:03:32.910> to<00:03:32.970> get<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.269> way<00:03:33.389> I<00:03:33.630> need

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
just going to get in the way I need

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.720 
just going to get in the way I need
those<00:03:34.079> pieces<00:03:34.349> there<00:03:34.709> so<00:03:34.919> I'll<00:03:35.190> leave<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.430> mark

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
those pieces there so I'll leave a mark

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.210 
those pieces there so I'll leave a mark
and<00:03:35.910> I'll<00:03:36.720> continue<00:03:37.079> to<00:03:37.230> finish<00:03:37.889> up<00:03:38.040> this

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
and I'll continue to finish up this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:50.330 
and I'll continue to finish up this
little<00:03:38.549> course

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.880 

and<00:03:50.430> if<00:03:51.420> gravel<00:03:51.840> does<00:03:52.080> get<00:03:52.290> destroyed<00:03:52.650> like

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
and if gravel does get destroyed like

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.059 
and if gravel does get destroyed like
that<00:03:53.099> just<00:03:53.730> grab<00:03:54.090> another<00:03:54.330> piece<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.720> gravel

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
that just grab another piece of gravel

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.680 
that just grab another piece of gravel
just<00:03:56.069> tucking<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:57.090> actually<00:03:57.300> chew

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
just tucking it's just actually chew

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.210 
just tucking it's just actually chew
stuff<00:03:57.930> if<00:03:58.110> you<00:03:58.260> too<00:03:58.470> fast<00:03:58.739> for<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:58.980> piston<00:03:59.930> um

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
stuff if you too fast for the piston um

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:10.610 
stuff if you too fast for the piston um
yep<00:04:02.220> that's<00:04:02.790> all<00:04:02.940> good<00:04:09.379> actually<00:04:10.379> I<00:04:10.410> got<00:04:10.530> to

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
yep that's all good actually I got to

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.559 
yep that's all good actually I got to
move<00:04:10.680> all<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.010> them<00:04:11.220> up<00:04:11.370> I<00:04:11.489> think<00:04:11.730> yep<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.510> you

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
move all of them up I think yep so you

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.720 
move all of them up I think yep so you
can<00:04:12.840> also<00:04:12.989> if<00:04:13.260> you<00:04:13.440> wanted<00:04:13.799> rather<00:04:14.549> than

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
can also if you wanted rather than

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.159 
can also if you wanted rather than
moving<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.209> purple<00:04:15.510> one<00:04:15.629> up<00:04:15.780> there<00:04:15.989> now
