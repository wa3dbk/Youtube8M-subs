00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:09.460 
the whole movie because it was way too

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.190 
the whole movie because it was way too
big<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.909> first<00:01:10.090> draft<00:01:10.390> was<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:10.930> know<00:01:11.049> it<00:01:11.110> had

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.110 
couldn't possibly be done so I took a
deep<00:01:15.160> breath<00:01:15.190> and<00:01:15.430> said<00:01:15.610> okay<00:01:15.850> I'm<00:01:15.910> gonna<00:01:16.000> have

in<00:01:51.370> film<00:01:51.610> number<00:01:51.880> two<00:01:52.060> is<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.360> fact<00:01:52.479> that<00:01:52.600> it's

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
in film number two is the fact that it's

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.289 
in film number two is the fact that it's
the<00:01:52.930> middle<00:01:53.170> act<00:01:53.380> let's<00:01:53.860> react<00:01:54.159> play<00:01:54.430> some

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the middle act let's react play some

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.410 
the middle act let's react play some
people<00:01:55.570> find<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.960> a<00:01:56.080> darker<00:01:56.820> film<00:01:57.820> than<00:01:58.299> the

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
people find it a darker film than the

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.860 
people find it a darker film than the
first<00:01:58.659> it<00:01:58.840> is<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.049> darker<00:01:59.500> film<00:01:59.740> because<00:02:00.690> in<00:02:01.690> the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
first it is a darker film because in the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.930 
first it is a darker film because in the
first<00:02:02.140> act<00:02:02.440> you<00:02:02.560> introduced<00:02:02.979> everybody<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
first act you introduced everybody the

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.070 
first act you introduced everybody the
second<00:02:04.299> act<00:02:04.420> you<00:02:04.510> put<00:02:04.659> them<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.869> the<00:02:04.930> worst

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
second act you put them in the worst

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.539 
second act you put them in the worst
possible<00:02:05.500> position<00:02:05.650> they<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.130> ever<00:02:06.250> get<00:02:06.430> into

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
possible position they can ever get into

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:07.980 
possible position they can ever get into
in<00:02:06.760> their<00:02:06.880> lives<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.360> it's<00:02:07.510> everything<00:02:07.750> you

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
in their lives and it's everything you

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:10.469 
in their lives and it's everything you
know<00:02:08.080> they're<00:02:08.799> in<00:02:08.890> a<00:02:08.920> black<00:02:09.129> hole<00:02:09.429> never<00:02:10.209> able

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
know they're in a black hole never able

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:11.759 
know they're in a black hole never able
to<00:02:10.539> get<00:02:10.659> out<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:11.110> then<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.290> third<00:02:11.470> act<00:02:11.680> they

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:11.769 
to get out and then the third act they

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.070 
to get out and then the third act they
get<00:02:11.920> out<00:02:12.069> that's<00:02:13.060> just<00:02:13.120> again<00:02:13.569> that's<00:02:13.810> drama

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
get out that's just again that's drama

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.589 
get out that's just again that's drama
that's<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.799> way<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> works<00:02:15.220> you<00:02:16.120> don't<00:02:16.269> have<00:02:16.569> a

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
that's the way it works you don't have a

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.530 
that's the way it works you don't have a
Zuber<00:02:17.499> and<00:02:17.620> happy<00:02:17.889> second<00:02:18.249> act<00:02:18.430> what<00:02:19.299> was<00:02:19.420> the

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
Zuber and happy second act what was the

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.309 
Zuber and happy second act what was the
biggest<00:02:19.719> technological<00:02:20.200> advance

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
biggest technological advance

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.830 
biggest technological advance
the<00:02:21.500> making<00:02:21.769> of<00:02:21.860> one<00:02:22.010> in<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.189> making<00:02:22.400> of<00:02:22.519> two

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the making of one in the making of two

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.729 
the making of one in the making of two
well<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:23.989> wasn't<00:02:24.140> really<00:02:24.590> too<00:02:24.799> much<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
well there wasn't really too much of a

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.330 
well there wasn't really too much of a
technologically<00:02:27.739> but<00:02:27.859> there<00:02:27.950> wasn't<00:02:28.099> any

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
technologically but there wasn't any

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.160 
technologically but there wasn't any
giant<00:02:28.700> segment<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.510> major<00:02:29.750> technological

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
giant segment the major technological

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.789 
giant segment the major technological
break<00:02:30.650> was<00:02:30.829> in<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.159> and<00:02:31.400> that<00:02:31.879> was<00:02:32.060> using<00:02:32.799> you

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
break was in one and that was using you

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.619 
break was in one and that was using you
know<00:02:33.890> motion<00:02:34.760> control<00:02:35.000> cameras<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.540> that

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
know motion control cameras and that

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.720 
know motion control cameras and that
sort<00:02:35.810> of<00:02:35.840> thing<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.109> allow<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.489> ships<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.579> be

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
sort of thing to allow the ships to be

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.890 
sort of thing to allow the ships to be
able<00:02:37.849> to<00:02:37.939> move<00:02:38.030> freely<00:02:38.329> and<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.629> sort<00:02:38.870> of

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
able to move freely and that sort of

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.050 
able to move freely and that sort of
thing<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.049> was<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.409> big<00:02:39.560> advance

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
thing that was the big advance

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.869 
thing that was the big advance
everything<00:02:41.060> after<00:02:41.329> that<00:02:41.359> was<00:02:42.340> we're<00:02:43.340> able<00:02:43.670> to

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
everything after that was we're able to

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.369 
everything after that was we're able to
do<00:02:43.970> more<00:02:44.120> stop-motion<00:02:44.750> I<00:02:44.810> was<00:02:44.930> able<00:02:45.109> to<00:02:45.140> do<00:02:45.349> a

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:45.379 
do more stop-motion I was able to do a

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:46.690 
do more stop-motion I was able to do a
lot<00:02:45.590> more<00:02:45.620> things<00:02:45.799> they<00:02:46.430> weren't<00:02:46.579> really

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
lot more things they weren't really

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.910 
lot more things they weren't really
technological<00:02:47.389> advances<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.019> I<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.650> able<00:02:48.799> to

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
technological advances but I was able to

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.410 
technological advances but I was able to
get<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.099> lot<00:02:49.340> more<00:02:49.519> in<00:02:49.609> the<00:02:49.700> stop-motion<00:02:49.939> which

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
get a lot more in the stop-motion which

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.280 
get a lot more in the stop-motion which
I<00:02:50.510> couldn't<00:02:50.780> do<00:02:50.870> before

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
I couldn't do before

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.589 
I couldn't do before
and<00:02:53.349> you<00:02:54.349> know<00:02:54.439> generally<00:02:54.829> have<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:56.030> bigger

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
and you know generally have a bigger

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.750 
and you know generally have a bigger
scope<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.170> things<00:02:57.409> and<00:02:57.680> I<00:02:57.859> could<00:02:58.159> do<00:02:58.280> before<00:02:58.489> so

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
scope to things and I could do before so

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.649 
scope to things and I could do before so
if<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.510> first<00:02:59.659> film<00:02:59.930> was<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.310> technological

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
if the first film was a technological

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.360 
if the first film was a technological
challenge<00:03:02.659> to<00:03:03.019> get<00:03:03.530> ships<00:03:03.889> to<00:03:04.010> fly<00:03:04.189> in<00:03:04.340> space

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
challenge to get ships to fly in space

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.449 
challenge to get ships to fly in space
with<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.480> lot<00:03:05.659> of<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.930> movement<00:03:06.319> the<00:03:07.129> second

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
with a lot of that movement the second

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.080 
with a lot of that movement the second
one<00:03:07.549> was<00:03:07.760> to<00:03:07.909> do<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.620> stop-motion<00:03:09.620> movie<00:03:10.090> how

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
one was to do a stop-motion movie how

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.599 
one was to do a stop-motion movie how
did<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:11.450> choose<00:03:12.349> or<00:03:12.680> or<00:03:12.919> get<00:03:13.189> together<00:03:13.310> with
