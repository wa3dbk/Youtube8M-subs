00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
I mean it's just all liquid oil so I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 
I mean it's just all liquid oil so I
thought<00:01:15.560> I'd<00:01:15.680> be<00:01:15.740> getting<00:01:15.799> go<00:01:16.070> everywhere<00:01:16.729> but

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
thought I'd be getting go everywhere but

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.209 
thought I'd be getting go everywhere but
no<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.899> was<00:01:17.930> pretty<00:01:18.320> good<00:01:18.560> I<00:01:18.590> mean<00:01:18.710> when<00:01:19.130> you

opens<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:21.289> then<00:01:21.409> you<00:01:21.500> just<00:01:21.710> squeeze<00:01:21.979> it<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.820> I

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
opens and then you just squeeze it and I

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.550 
opens and then you just squeeze it and I
like<00:01:23.180> concentrate<00:01:23.509> it<00:01:23.780> on<00:01:23.869> my<00:01:24.020> end<00:01:24.229> a<00:01:24.439> little

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
bit but did it all over and it's not

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.109 
bit but did it all over and it's not
messy<00:01:27.560> at<00:01:27.740> all<00:01:27.950> so<00:01:28.310> I'm<00:01:28.430> pleased<00:01:28.820> about<00:01:28.850> that

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
messy at all so I'm pleased about that

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.120 
messy at all so I'm pleased about that
now<00:01:29.960> if<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:30.710> actually<00:01:30.890> works<00:01:32.320> it's<00:01:33.320> definitely

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
now if it actually works it's definitely

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.999 
now if it actually works it's definitely
definitely<00:01:34.579> not<00:01:34.969> as<00:01:35.119> good<00:01:35.180> as<00:01:35.509> some<00:01:36.009> deep

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
definitely not as good as some deep

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.120 
definitely not as good as some deep
conditioners<00:01:37.609> I<00:01:37.820> have<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:39.380> Aveda<00:01:39.649> one<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:40.070> I

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.209 
use the bumble and bumble one and those
ones<00:01:41.719> work<00:01:41.869> really<00:01:42.200> nicely<00:01:42.439> and<00:01:42.890> I'm<00:01:43.039> sure

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:43.219 
ones work really nicely and I'm sure

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.039 
ones work really nicely and I'm sure
there's<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:43.759> many<00:01:43.880> other<00:01:44.119> good<00:01:44.659> ones<00:01:44.840> out

a<00:01:54.350> noticeable<00:01:55.100> difference<00:01:55.250> it<00:01:55.609> could<00:01:55.759> have

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
a noticeable difference it could have

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.209 
a noticeable difference it could have
been<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.960> know<00:01:57.079> due<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.649> the<00:01:57.740> weather<00:01:57.890> or<00:01:58.189> you

that<00:02:26.930> kind<00:02:27.140> of<00:02:27.170> goes<00:02:27.319> hand-in-hand<00:02:27.620> but<00:02:28.069> I

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
that kind of goes hand-in-hand but I

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.839 
that kind of goes hand-in-hand but I
chose<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.430> one<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:30.620> wouldn't<00:02:31.459> buy<00:02:31.579> it<00:02:31.609> again

even though it's cheap but I mean it

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.500 
even though it's cheap but I mean it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.339 
doesn't really do much so instead say
not<00:02:38.510> that<00:02:38.689> you're<00:02:38.780> spending<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.079> lot<00:02:39.200> money
