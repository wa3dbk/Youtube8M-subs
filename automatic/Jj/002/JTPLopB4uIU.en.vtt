stone yeah he might be someone that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.130 
stone yeah he might be someone that
works<00:03:20.980> at<00:03:21.190> STAR<00:03:21.520> Labs<00:03:21.550> I<00:03:22.060> actually<00:03:22.630> think<00:03:23.020> that

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
works at STAR Labs I actually think that

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.740 
works at STAR Labs I actually think that
possibly<00:03:23.560> maybe<00:03:23.890> maybe<00:03:24.580> he<00:03:25.030> lost<00:03:25.209> his<00:03:25.480> legs

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
possibly maybe maybe he lost his legs

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.440 
possibly maybe maybe he lost his legs
during<00:03:26.110> the<00:03:26.380> Zod<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.400> Superman<00:03:27.820> fight<00:03:28.120> maybe

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
during the Zod and Superman fight maybe

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.540 
during the Zod and Superman fight maybe
he<00:03:28.780> got<00:03:28.990> crushed<00:03:29.590> they<00:03:29.890> got<00:03:30.040> crushed<00:03:30.310> or

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
he got crushed they got crushed or

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.800 
he got crushed they got crushed or
something<00:03:30.880> that<00:03:31.300> could<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.600> a<00:03:31.630> possibility

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
something that could be a possibility

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.199 
something that could be a possibility
but<00:03:32.410> screen<00:03:33.160> rant<00:03:33.370> was<00:03:33.490> actually<00:03:33.820> throwing<00:03:34.030> it

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
but screen rant was actually throwing it

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.580 
but screen rant was actually throwing it
out<00:03:34.300> there<00:03:34.480> that's<00:03:34.690> they're<00:03:35.230> saying<00:03:35.470> that

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
out there that's they're saying that

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.430 
out there that's they're saying that
well<00:03:35.920> maybe<00:03:36.540> he's<00:03:37.540> just<00:03:37.720> like<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:37.930> test<00:03:38.230> subject

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
well maybe he's just like a test subject

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.070 
well maybe he's just like a test subject
for<00:03:38.740> the<00:03:38.920> cybernetic<00:03:39.640> technology<00:03:40.300> and<00:03:40.600> then

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
for the cybernetic technology and then

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.470 
for the cybernetic technology and then
that'll<00:03:41.620> eventually<00:03:41.770> lead<00:03:42.490> to<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.450> know

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
that'll eventually lead to you know

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.690 
that'll eventually lead to you know
Victor<00:03:44.020> stone<00:03:44.260> after<00:03:44.530> whatever<00:03:44.860> happens<00:03:45.490> with

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
Victor stone after whatever happens with

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.610 
Victor stone after whatever happens with
him<00:03:45.880> maybe<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.420> bad<00:03:46.660> accident<00:03:47.080> all<00:03:47.410> it's

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
him maybe just a bad accident all it's

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.080 
him maybe just a bad accident all it's
got<00:03:47.770> to<00:03:47.860> be<00:03:47.950> some<00:03:48.100> kind<00:03:48.220> of<00:03:48.310> bad<00:03:48.490> accident<00:03:48.970> and

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
got to be some kind of bad accident and

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.590 
got to be some kind of bad accident and
then<00:03:49.480> he<00:03:49.660> gets<00:03:49.810> all<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.230> cyborg<00:03:50.680> technology

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
then he gets all the cyborg technology

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.570 
then he gets all the cyborg technology
integrated<00:03:52.600> with<00:03:52.810> his<00:03:52.959> body<00:03:53.230> now<00:03:53.680> another
