00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.400
 hi all dear subscribers and 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.550
 viewers today we will talk about new 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.320
 three maps to be entered by the world 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:15.440
 of tanks in update 95 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.850
 I want to draw your attention to stupid 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.580
 presumably will be released in update 95 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.529
 Nothing approved the map which further 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.170
 will be discussed already known to us so or 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.359
 otherwise their appearance in patch 95 is not 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.140
 confirmed but the background to this 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.019
 there are 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.219
 everywhere kg aries go on the internet and 1 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.230
 is in our game but only in another 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.079
 variations lost city lost city 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.420
 This is the first organ that resembles 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.910
 something monastery do not know what but something in 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 it has a map for a long time goes on the network 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.539
 assumed only for team fights 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:54.210
 and the next card is pit another card 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.879
 about which once told on 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.670
 site world of tanks. soup card for 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.120
 low-level battles 1 presumably 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.369
 on level 3 3 card case me ruinberg 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.010
 developers have recognized that ruinberg by 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.890
 I'm frankly dark and uncomfortable for 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.860
 gameplay so bring it to 95 and 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.840
 introduced to replace the snow ruinberg which 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 already judging by the screenshot me map 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.670
 looks bright and beautiful i agree with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.619
 developers ruinberg on fire was 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.040
 a little darkish but still 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.220
 nothing on my personal computer 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.590
 influenced completely but sorry for the guys who 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.600
 flew lagged landmine rose pink 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.720
 galloped and right that developers 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.210
 did the better optimization they 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.310
 did three things at once you seeing this card 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.170
 which many players didn't like and 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.110
 added a new one that will like 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.580
 to many 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.200
 below cancer dogs do not add them as I 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.360
 I think you liked this video 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.120
 because it's always interesting to know what 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.820
 We will be waiting in the next updates 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.120
 thanks so much more 7 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.120
 friends
