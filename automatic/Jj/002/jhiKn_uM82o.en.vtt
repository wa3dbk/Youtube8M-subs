video<00:00:10.980> we're<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.370> discussing<00:00:12.000> a

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
video we're going to be discussing a

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.539 
video we're going to be discussing a
short<00:00:12.870> piece<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.440> information<00:00:13.679> format

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
short piece of information format

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.939 
short piece of information format
silicon<00:00:15.240> that<00:00:15.420> studio<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.260> is<00:00:16.379> popped<00:00:16.650> up

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
silicon that studio which is popped up

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.000 
silicon that studio which is popped up
as<00:00:17.940> an<00:00:18.090> interview<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.750> gamingbolt<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.890> we're

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
as an interview on gamingbolt so we're

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.150 
as an interview on gamingbolt so we're
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.220> do<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> bit<00:00:20.789> of<00:00:20.820> analysis<00:00:21.119> on<00:00:21.600> this

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
going to do a bit of analysis on this

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.140 
going to do a bit of analysis on this
we're<00:00:23.160> going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.490> through<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.820> quote

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
we're going to go through the quote

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.120 
we're going to go through the quote
first<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.869> then<00:00:25.080> we're<00:00:25.230> going<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:26.099> into

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
first and then we're going to go into

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.230 
first and then we're going to go into
how<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:27.029> impacts<00:00:27.599> things<00:00:28.490> so<00:00:29.490> this

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
how this actually impacts things so this

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
how this actually impacts things so this
is<00:00:30.420> regarding<00:00:30.929> primarily<00:00:31.500> esram<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.730> we

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
is regarding primarily esram and we

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.410 
is regarding primarily esram and we
started<00:00:33.239> developing<00:00:33.559> yes<00:00:34.559> ten<00:00:35.340> years<00:00:35.820> ago<00:00:36.120> he

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
started developing yes ten years ago he

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.080 
started developing yes ten years ago he
starts<00:00:36.809> out<00:00:36.989> for<00:00:37.680> each<00:00:37.800> new<00:00:38.010> platform<00:00:38.579> they're

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
starts out for each new platform they're

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.830 
starts out for each new platform they're
doing<00:00:39.420> 16<00:00:39.870> currently<00:00:40.850> reported<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.000> we

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
doing 16 currently reported it to we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.100 
doing 16 currently reported it to we
have<00:00:43.020> been<00:00:43.879> keen<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.180> extracting<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.809> highest

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
have been keen on extracting the highest

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.020 
have been keen on extracting the highest
performance<00:00:46.590> by<00:00:46.770> taking<00:00:47.190> advantage<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
performance by taking advantage of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750 
performance by taking advantage of the
specific<00:00:48.570> specifics<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.770> platforms<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
specific specifics of the platforms so

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.630 
specific specifics of the platforms so
for<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> Xbox<00:00:51.660> one<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.110> course<00:00:52.379> we<00:00:52.829> use<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.280> SRAM

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
for the Xbox one of course we use a SRAM

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670 
for the Xbox one of course we use a SRAM
for<00:00:53.910> internal<00:00:54.329> calculations<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.110> internal

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
for internal calculations and internal

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.590 
for internal calculations and internal
buffers<00:00:56.039> now<00:00:56.850> he<00:00:56.910> moves<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
buffers now he moves on to the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.750 
buffers now he moves on to the
PlayStation<00:00:58.140> 4<00:00:58.410> where<00:00:58.800> he<00:00:58.920> says<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> unified

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
PlayStation 4 where he says the unified

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.400 
PlayStation 4 where he says the unified
memory<00:00:59.940> architecture<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.840> less<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> need

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
memory architecture is less of a need

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.490 
memory architecture is less of a need
for<00:01:02.250> us<00:01:02.430> since<00:01:02.910> everything<00:01:03.449> happens<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
for us since everything happens on the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.230 
for us since everything happens on the
GPU<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:07.130> right<00:01:08.130> there<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.640> actually<00:01:08.939> get<00:01:09.060> some

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
GPU so right there you actually get some

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.310 
GPU so right there you actually get some
important<00:01:09.720> piece<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.869> information<00:01:12.320> what

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
important piece of information what

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.679 
important piece of information what
basically<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.159> telling<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.880> is<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.509> in

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
basically this is telling you is that in

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.840 
basically this is telling you is that in
situations<00:01:16.369> where<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.729> GPU<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.900> really

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
situations where the GPU is not really

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.100 
situations where the GPU is not really
needed<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.880> fetch<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> lot<00:01:21.450> of<00:01:21.570> data<00:01:21.720> from<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
needed to fetch a lot of data from the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
needed to fetch a lot of data from the
cpu<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.189> UN<00:01:23.549> other<00:01:23.759> words<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.360> using

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
cpu the UN other words it's not using

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.770 
cpu the UN other words it's not using
our<00:01:24.810> humor<00:01:25.909> which<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.090> go<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.689> a

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
our humor which will go into in just a

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.560 
our humor which will go into in just a
moment<00:01:28.170> so<00:01:28.439> basically<00:01:28.829> GPGPU<00:01:29.820> computing<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
moment so basically GPGPU computing the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
moment so basically GPGPU computing the
esram<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:34.170> actually<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:35.070> too<00:01:35.280> much<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.579> a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
esram is actually not too much of a

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.760 
esram is actually not too much of a
hindrance<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.600> unified<00:01:36.990> memory<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
hindrance and the unified memory of the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
hindrance and the unified memory of the
xbox<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.220> ps4<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.970> course<00:01:39.000> means<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
xbox the ps4 which of course means that

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.170 
xbox the ps4 which of course means that
the<00:01:39.840> CPU<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.560> GPU<00:01:41.280> can<00:01:41.490> both<00:01:41.729> address<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the CPU and the GPU can both address the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.990 
the CPU and the GPU can both address the
same<00:01:42.390> memory<00:01:42.780> space<00:01:43.130> there's<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.490> super

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
same memory space there's not a super

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.330 
same memory space there's not a super
advantage<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.649> are<00:01:46.890> certain

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
advantage there now there are certain

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.050 
advantage there now there are certain
advantages<00:01:47.630> certainly<00:01:49.340> for<00:01:50.340> example<00:01:50.820> it

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
advantages certainly for example it

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.499 
advantages certainly for example it
means<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.310> be<00:01:53.579> less<00:01:54.180> cautious

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
means that you have to be less cautious

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.130 
means that you have to be less cautious
of<00:01:54.899> what's<00:01:55.140> being<00:01:55.439> utilized<00:01:56.070> in<00:01:56.369> esram<00:01:56.939> in<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
of what's being utilized in esram in the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.289 
of what's being utilized in esram in the
case<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.590> xbox<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.189> because<00:02:00.000> there<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.270> a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
case of the xbox one because there is a

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.330 
case of the xbox one because there is a
finite<00:02:00.899> amount<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.320> memory<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> Microsoft

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
finite amount of memory and Microsoft

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.740 
finite amount of memory and Microsoft
themselves<00:02:02.790> so<00:02:02.939> do<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.119> need<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.450> really

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
themselves so do you need to be really

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.499 
themselves so do you need to be really
selective<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.939> they're<00:02:05.939> actually<00:02:06.329> one

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
selective of this they're actually one

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.529 
selective of this they're actually one
of<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.740> points<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:09.000> uptake<00:02:09.479> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
of the points actually of the uptake of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.020 
of the points actually of the uptake of
esram<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
esram and

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.580 
esram and
go<00:02:11.209> into<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.600> just<00:02:11.870> a<00:02:11.930> moment<00:02:12.290> or<00:02:12.350> if<00:02:12.470> you

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
go into this in just a moment or if you

through<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.870> xbox<00:02:20.870> one<00:02:21.140> develop<00:02:21.709> a<00:02:21.800> day

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
through the xbox one develop a day

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.640 
through the xbox one develop a day
conference<00:02:22.420> which<00:02:23.420> was<00:02:23.600> hosted<00:02:23.750> by<00:02:23.959> Microsoft

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
conference which was hosted by Microsoft

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.140 
conference which was hosted by Microsoft
and<00:02:24.800> AMD<00:02:25.340> and<00:02:25.730> they<00:02:26.420> basically<00:02:26.600> said<00:02:27.230> yeah<00:02:28.150> we

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
and AMD and they basically said yeah we

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.040 
and AMD and they basically said yeah we
expect<00:02:30.880> basically<00:02:31.880> certain<00:02:32.270> render<00:02:32.569> targets

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
expect basically certain render targets

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.760 
expect basically certain render targets
to<00:02:33.380> be<00:02:33.640> partially<00:02:34.640> held<00:02:34.910> in<00:02:35.300> esram<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.260> rest

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
to be partially held in esram and rest

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.270 
to be partially held in esram and rest
of<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:36.980> can<00:02:37.130> be<00:02:37.250> held<00:02:37.430> in<00:02:37.610> ddr3<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.870> for<00:02:39.080> example

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
of it can be held in ddr3 so for example

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.880 
of it can be held in ddr3 so for example
the<00:02:40.280> sky<00:02:40.640> or<00:02:40.910> pretty<00:02:41.810> much<00:02:41.870> static<00:02:42.290> type<00:02:42.709> of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
the sky or pretty much static type of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.650 
the sky or pretty much static type of
objects<00:02:43.340> which<00:02:43.550> don't<00:02:43.850> really<00:02:44.090> require<00:02:44.209> a<00:02:44.420> lot

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
objects which don't really require a lot

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.310 
objects which don't really require a lot
of<00:02:44.690> detail<00:02:45.200> they<00:02:45.860> could<00:02:46.100> be<00:02:46.360> placed<00:02:47.360> in<00:02:47.690> ddr3

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
of detail they could be placed in ddr3

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.610 
of detail they could be placed in ddr3
memory<00:02:48.530> that<00:02:48.860> type<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.100> thing<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.120> anyway

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
memory that type of thing so anyway

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.170 
memory that type of thing so anyway
let's<00:02:51.620> put<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> little<00:02:52.040> bit<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.430> meat<00:02:52.730> on<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
let's put a little bit of meat on this a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.710 
let's put a little bit of meat on this a
little<00:02:53.390> bit<00:02:53.630> substance<00:02:54.170> yes<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:56.030> engine<00:02:56.510> it's

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
little bit substance yes the engine it's

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.110 
little bit substance yes the engine it's
a<00:02:56.810> middleware<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:58.340> used<00:02:58.550> a<00:02:58.790> lot<00:02:58.819> for

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
a middleware and it's used a lot for

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.100 
a middleware and it's used a lot for
particle<00:02:59.630> effects<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.170> post-processing<00:03:00.910> now

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
particle effects and post-processing now

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.080 
particle effects and post-processing now
this<00:03:03.110> goes<00:03:03.590> back<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:03.920> his<00:03:04.160> statement<00:03:04.760> where<00:03:04.970> he

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
this goes back to his statement where he

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.240 
this goes back to his statement where he
said<00:03:05.330> most<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.959> happens<00:03:06.260> on<00:03:06.350> the<00:03:06.500> GPU<00:03:06.860> in

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
said most this happens on the GPU in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.620 
said most this happens on the GPU in
other<00:03:07.400> words<00:03:07.519> he's<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.670> post-processing

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
other words he's a post-processing

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.259 
other words he's a post-processing
effects<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.470> because<00:03:09.739> they're<00:03:09.890> not

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
effects and because they're not

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.940 
effects and because they're not
utilizing<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.390> CPU<00:03:11.959> really<00:03:12.290> all<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.650> this<00:03:12.800> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
utilizing the CPU really all of this is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.280 
utilizing the CPU really all of this is
really<00:03:13.130> being<00:03:13.340> handled<00:03:13.670> in<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.850> GPU<00:03:14.450> that's

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
really being handled in the GPU that's

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.850 
really being handled in the GPU that's
why<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:17.299> unified<00:03:17.810> memory<00:03:18.019> architecture<00:03:18.739> is

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
why the unified memory architecture is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.000 
why the unified memory architecture is
less<00:03:19.040> of<00:03:19.070> a<00:03:19.250> big<00:03:19.430> deal<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.989> one<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.829> the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
less of a big deal so one of the

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.280 
less of a big deal so one of the
problems<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.549> have<00:03:22.910> with<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.209> article<00:03:23.959> piece

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
problems I have with this article piece

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.640 
problems I have with this article piece
on<00:03:24.590> gamingbolt<00:03:25.010> actually<00:03:25.760> is<00:03:25.970> it's<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.200> little

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
bit quick beta if I'm totally honest it

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.470 
bit quick beta if I'm totally honest it

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
actually serves that I quote the xbox

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.180 
actually serves that I quote the xbox

of<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.959> ps4<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.410> actually<00:03:42.829> somewhat

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
of the ps4 is actually somewhat

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.479 
of the ps4 is actually somewhat
irrelevant<00:03:44.230> so<00:03:46.329> it's<00:03:47.329> like<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:48.280> kind<00:03:49.280> of<00:03:49.340> don't

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
irrelevant so it's like I kind of don't

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.970 
irrelevant so it's like I kind of don't
like<00:03:49.760> that<00:03:50.090> because<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:50.570> this<00:03:51.260> actually<00:03:51.500> feeds

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
like that because it this actually feeds

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.610 
like that because it this actually feeds
into<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.340> lot<00:03:52.609> of<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.450> fanboy<00:03:53.989> wars<00:03:54.350> that

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
into a lot of the the fanboy wars that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.500 
into a lot of the the fanboy wars that
are<00:03:54.680> happening<00:03:54.920> right<00:03:55.160> now<00:03:55.400> and<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.970> don't

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
are happening right now and I don't

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.620 
are happening right now and I don't
really<00:03:56.989> think<00:03:57.140> that<00:03:57.290> that's<00:03:57.970> healthy<00:03:58.970> to<00:03:59.480> be

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
really think that that's healthy to be

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.050 
really think that that's healthy to be
honest<00:03:59.930> because<00:04:00.590> what<00:04:00.890> starts<00:04:01.280> happening<00:04:01.430> is

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
honest because what starts happening is

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.420 
honest because what starts happening is
