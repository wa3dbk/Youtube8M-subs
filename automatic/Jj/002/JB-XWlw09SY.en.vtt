point<00:02:06.140> someone<00:02:06.500> could<00:02:06.649> have<00:02:06.710> come<00:02:06.920> out<00:02:07.159> can

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
got hurt there's so many things that

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.620 
got hurt there's so many things that
happen<00:02:09.799> here<00:02:09.829> and<00:02:10.190> also<00:02:11.000> he's<00:02:11.360> on<00:02:11.600> a

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
happen here and also he's on a

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.199 
happen here and also he's on a
motorcycle<00:02:12.410> so<00:02:12.590> when<00:02:12.799> he<00:02:12.980> surrendered<00:02:13.640> you're

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
motorcycle so when he surrendered you're

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.140 
motorcycle so when he surrendered you're
not<00:02:14.450> sure<00:02:14.870> if<00:02:15.140> he's<00:02:15.380> gonna<00:02:15.530> take<00:02:15.829> off<00:02:16.010> again<00:02:16.310> so

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
not sure if he's gonna take off again so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.479 
not sure if he's gonna take off again so
I'm<00:02:17.329> sure<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.840> police<00:02:18.019> officer<00:02:18.530> thought<00:02:18.799> well

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
I'm sure the police officer thought well

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.039 
I'm sure the police officer thought well
maybe<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:20.060> is<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.239> way<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.570> I<00:02:20.600> can<00:02:20.810> lunge

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
maybe this is the way that I can lunge

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.259 
maybe this is the way that I can lunge
at<00:02:21.320> him<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:22.370> this<00:02:22.609> is<00:02:22.790> where<00:02:22.970> it's<00:02:23.090> really

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
at him and this is where it's really

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:24.880 
at him and this is where it's really
hard<00:02:23.570> for<00:02:23.660> me<00:02:23.840> because<00:02:24.049> in<00:02:24.320> our<00:02:24.380> country<00:02:24.620> we're

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
hard for me because in our country we're

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.440 
hard for me because in our country we're
getting<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.100> a<00:02:25.160> place<00:02:25.280> where<00:02:25.579> every<00:02:26.150> police

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
officer is wrong for everything they do

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.630 
officer is wrong for everything they do

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
right when they're not you know like

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.250 
right when they're not you know like

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
there's some bad police officers but

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.900 
there's some bad police officers but
there's<00:02:33.410> some<00:02:33.590> really<00:02:33.799> good<00:02:34.130> ones<00:02:34.340> who<00:02:34.579> just

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
there's some really good ones who just

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.940 
there's some really good ones who just
want<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.299> do<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.600> work<00:02:35.780> and<00:02:36.109> they're<00:02:36.829> getting

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
want to do the work and they're getting

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.610 
want to do the work and they're getting
lumped<00:02:37.459> in<00:02:37.609> so<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.600> was<00:02:38.930> for<00:02:39.230> me<00:02:39.350> what

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
lumped in so that was for me what

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.020 
lumped in so that was for me what
happened<00:02:39.950> when<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.070> read<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.430> well<00:02:40.609> it's

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
happened when I read this well it's

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:42.610 
happened when I read this well it's
important<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.510> note<00:02:41.660> that<00:02:41.690> the<00:02:42.170> law<00:02:42.290> was<00:02:42.500> not

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
important to note that the law was not

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.280 
important to note that the law was not
broken<00:02:42.920> at<00:02:43.250> all<00:02:43.459> they<00:02:43.880> shooting<00:02:44.570> is<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.900> condone

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
broken at all they shooting is a condone

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.039 
broken at all they shooting is a condone
means<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.799> ending<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.070> chase<00:02:46.310> in<00:02:46.459> certain<00:02:46.730> cases

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
means of ending a chase in certain cases

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.810 
means of ending a chase in certain cases
and<00:02:48.049> so<00:02:48.799> there<00:02:48.920> were<00:02:48.980> no<00:02:49.130> laws<00:02:49.459> actually

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
and so there were no laws actually

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.520 
and so there were no laws actually
broken<00:02:50.000> by<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:50.660> Department<00:02:51.350> of<00:02:51.410> Public

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
broken by the like Department of Public

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.620 
broken by the like Department of Public
Safety<00:02:52.100> in<00:02:52.340> Texas<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.180> he<00:02:53.239> shot<00:02:53.390> him<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.600> the

leg right he shot him in the leg the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.150 
leg right he shot him in the leg the
apparently<00:02:56.750> those<00:02:56.900> some<00:02:57.109> tactic<00:02:57.500> experts<00:02:57.950> did

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
apparently those some tactic experts did

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.670 
apparently those some tactic experts did
say<00:02:58.430> I<00:02:58.760> told<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.150> state's<00:02:59.390> men<00:02:59.600> that<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.440> was

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
say I told the state's men that this was

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.649 
say I told the state's men that this was
out<00:03:00.920> of<00:03:00.980> step<00:03:01.489> with<00:03:01.700> evolving<00:03:02.090> national

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
out of step with evolving national

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.330 
out of step with evolving national
standards<00:03:03.019> and<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.140> think<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.530> speaks<00:03:03.980> again

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
standards and I think that speaks again

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.369 
standards and I think that speaks again
to<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:05.090> climate<00:03:05.540> in<00:03:05.659> this<00:03:05.750> country<00:03:05.810> with<00:03:06.230> law

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
to the climate in this country with law

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:07.120 
to the climate in this country with law
enforcement

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
enforcement

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.760 
enforcement
however<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.360> important<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.750> note<00:03:08.900> that<00:03:08.930> the

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
however it's important to note that the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.460 
however it's important to note that the
the<00:03:10.400> officer<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.880> issued<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.840> karate-kick

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the officer that issued the karate-kick

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.380 
the officer that issued the karate-kick
he<00:03:13.070> was<00:03:13.250> it<00:03:13.460> was<00:03:13.550> deemed<00:03:13.730> excessive<00:03:14.180> force

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
he was it was deemed excessive force

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.600 
he was it was deemed excessive force
after<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.750> lengthy<00:03:14.930> review<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.800> he's<00:03:16.400> been

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
after a lengthy review and he's been

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.310 
after a lengthy review and he's been
punished<00:03:17.030> with<00:03:17.330> two<00:03:17.480> days<00:03:17.600> of<00:03:17.750> unpaid<00:03:17.930> leave

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
punished with two days of unpaid leave

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.770 
punished with two days of unpaid leave
yeah<00:03:18.920> but<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.970> were<00:03:20.150> some<00:03:20.450> ramifications

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
yeah but there were some ramifications

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.470 
yeah but there were some ramifications
for<00:03:21.470> it<00:03:21.620> yeah<00:03:21.980> but<00:03:22.400> I<00:03:22.430> even<00:03:22.610> think<00:03:22.940> that<00:03:23.000> is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
for it yeah but I even think that is

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.820 
for it yeah but I even think that is
just<00:03:23.510> because<00:03:24.080> of<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.200> fact<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.530> we're<00:03:24.740> in

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
just because of the fact that we're in

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.530 
just because of the fact that we're in
such<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.070> sensitive<00:03:25.640> place<00:03:25.880> right<00:03:26.150> now<00:03:26.270> when<00:03:26.450> it

such a sensitive place right now when it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.360 
such a sensitive place right now when it

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
comes to police officers that every

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:29.950 
comes to police officers that every

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
to jump to conclusions that this police

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.400 
to jump to conclusions that this police
officer<00:04:22.460> was<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.640> bad<00:04:22.910> guy<00:04:23.300> yeah<00:04:23.840> I<00:04:23.870> agree<00:04:24.260> what

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
officer was a bad guy yeah I agree what

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.470 
officer was a bad guy yeah I agree what
you<00:04:24.500> know<00:04:24.590> was<00:04:24.830> being<00:04:25.130> excessive<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:26.000> think<00:04:26.360> he

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
you know was being excessive I think he

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.390 
you know was being excessive I think he
may<00:04:26.600> have<00:04:26.690> gone<00:04:26.840> for<00:04:27.110> style<00:04:27.470> points<00:04:27.800> I'm

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
may have gone for style points I'm

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.600 
may have gone for style points I'm
taking<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:28.910> guy<00:04:29.120> down<00:04:29.290> rather<00:04:30.290> than

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
taking this guy down rather than

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.750 
taking this guy down rather than
probably<00:04:31.610> a<00:04:32.090> more<00:04:32.480> conservative<00:04:33.200> way<00:04:33.380> of<00:04:33.800> you

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
probably a more conservative way of you

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.540 
probably a more conservative way of you
know<00:04:34.880> taking<00:04:35.570> care<00:04:35.600> of<00:04:35.810> the<00:04:36.590> situation<00:04:36.770> yeah

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
know taking care of the situation yeah

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.180 
know taking care of the situation yeah
the<00:04:38.450> guy<00:04:38.600> that<00:04:38.780> I<00:04:38.810> haven't<00:04:39.620> seen<00:04:39.800> any<00:04:39.950> video

actually shooting out of I didn't know

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.970 
actually shooting out of I didn't know
cops<00:04:44.570> really<00:04:44.810> shot<00:04:45.050> out<00:04:45.200> of<00:04:45.350> windows<00:04:45.710> at

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
cops really shot out of windows at

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.800 
cops really shot out of windows at
suspects<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.730> mean<00:04:46.850> I'm<00:04:46.970> just<00:04:47.120> as<00:04:47.210> they're

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
suspects I mean I'm just as they're

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.660 
suspects I mean I'm just as they're
driving<00:04:48.290> yeah<00:04:48.470> that<00:04:48.740> seems<00:04:49.040> like<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.430> very

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
driving yeah that seems like a very

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.010 
driving yeah that seems like a very
difficult<00:04:49.940> situation<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:50.600> control

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
difficult situation to control

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.540 
difficult situation to control
completely<00:04:51.620> if<00:04:51.770> anything<00:04:52.190> that<00:04:52.340> would

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
completely if anything that would

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.010 
completely if anything that would
probably<00:04:52.730> be<00:04:52.910> the<00:04:53.060> one<00:04:53.240> that<00:04:53.450> we<00:04:53.630> should<00:04:53.660> be

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
probably be the one that we should be

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.840 
probably be the one that we should be
talking<00:04:54.350> about<00:04:54.470> more<00:04:54.740> is<00:04:54.920> that<00:04:54.980> other<00:04:55.640> than

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
talking about more is that other than

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.730
