00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 seriously all so I'm going today we 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.230
 will talk about two little cocks that have me 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.270
 been provided again by m 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.410
 notes that I thank his decor 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.410
 than today iphone 5 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.009
 they are hulls from in game so 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.519
 their particularity is that they are 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:27.720
 leather hulls so make brown leather 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.739
 and black leather of what I could test 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.079
 greatly chem life is that these are 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.460
 hulls with a pure it's end to these 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.300
 pretty to the touch will see in some 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.610
 minutes 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.800
 but that's kind of the 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.589
 representation of the leather smart cover 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.089
 which costs in the seventy where 80 

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:45.400
 red is not at all the short price 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.460
 this is not the subject so here are these shells 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.500
 are for iphone 5 and I find that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.390
 glass and aluminum it was lacking for 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.940
 make an even more classy product 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.379
 and beloved of leather and that's what 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.699
 link just out it's the causes 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.879
 who have just come out and 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.410
 a few days or weeks ago 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.000
 So here is the best in all this is 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.530
 to go see and you will see that there is 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.210
 a tiny weak point is his 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.450
 price but we will take it at the end of the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.759
 video 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.950
 here are the little boxes so his are 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.880
 completely classic boxes with 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.009
 a little photo of the protection the 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.170
 leather brand and that's by accepting 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.049
 behind indications with color 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.540
 it's not the most important is the price 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.500
 when 990 so it's a bit pricey there 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.810
 will come back just now I'm going to show 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.710
 why then we can on that and we come 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.799
 to take the hull there then the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.299
 well defended protection so here's the 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.299
 little protection so we'll go out 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.420
 the one in black of course to compare 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:47.140
 both at the same time 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.390
 here we arrange it on the side so 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.240
 here are the two small ones the two small ones 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.770
 so we will go to see in detail and the 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.280
 teeth same time it will be simpler and 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.369
 faster 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.290
 so here we have the two orifices for for 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.479
 the camera so a large orifices that's 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.740
 nice enough we had heard on the back 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.630
 leather very beautiful to the touch and very 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.579
 beautiful also with reflections a very beautiful 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.299
 color especially for the brown the black 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:16.850
 is a bit simple so I find we're going 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.160
 continue on the brown sideways 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.320
 right there is the small incase logo 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.820
 like behind except that here we find 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.010
 just the only one I think a leaf 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.130
 in parents find wide access for 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.680
 jack and lightning speakers 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.750
 here are the accesses for the vibrator 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.310
 and the volume in the same for ignition 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.140
 the interior is bright and gives a 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.570
 look super nice it must be seen in 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.430
 true to see it but it's fine 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:46.640
 that they put that brilliant create 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.890
 then here is sorry on a black is 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.150
 such a focus as it is a 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.570
 black model he does not want to make any 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.350
 point 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.240
 so that's exactly the same and 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.960
 it's rather nice we will come there 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.330
 look for the iphone that is there so that's 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.340
 black we will try directly with 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.850
 the black model so we drag up 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.130
 the volume buttons and we come 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.440
 drag the rest into the iphone 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:20.060
 so that's all returned so there down 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.560
 I have the nikkei focus g the little 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.480
 round for the fisheye that is always 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.250
 in the iphone so you see that it 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.740
 goes very very well so this is a 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.700
 big good point on the side we always have 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.330
 access to the volume mode and the mode of 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.490
 normal 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.690
 the volume buttons so small point 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:39.470
 this is it's a little bit 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.820
 too high on here here and so the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.910
 volume buttons certainly a little too hidden 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.920
 in the hull so it should rather be 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.510
 go by year to that from below and there 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.850
 will come a little better a little less than a 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.850
 little weak point for it's the rooster in 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.010
 down we get to see everything so this is 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.400
 pretty cool on the side well there's nothing to 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.180
 see 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.550
 so that changes nothing so there is 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.930
 nothing that has changed is fine on the 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.990
 black model 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.150
 we will come to do the same with the 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:12.020
 brown protection in clipping at all and 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.680
 here it is to return so the same a wide 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.660
 a broad entry the screen that is a bit 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.910
 protected when put on the ground so 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.650
 there is the production that comes back on 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.030
 the screen so that's a big good point 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.760
 that is, when you put your 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.920
 hull on a table for example and well 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.370
 the screen will not touch the table and so 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.810
 will protect the screen set to wood no yes 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.750
 I do not know tomorrow after tomorrow it's 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.040
 well so that's what makes it great so 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.400
 no change for the buttons of 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.340
 volume 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.620
 here it's a bit too big but 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.190
 well we will not complain 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.630
 and then the beautiful brown leather of 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.970
 behind who is going great with a 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.170
 iphone black even if on titles 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.300
 protection they put that with an iphone 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.060
 white and know down before too 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.010
 well so white and black the proof this 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.460
 that they wanted to see the little 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.560
 change 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:05.910
 we will now talk about the leather in him 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.920
 same which is a very fine leather he sources 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.350
 he sees himself especially with the thickness so 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.780
 of protection that's just a 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.950
 thickness that goes back to the 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.680
 protection but that's it 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:19.290
 the actual thickness these bags for coke 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.310
 and the leather is like the interior there is 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:26.010
 a transparent plastic surface 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:29.880
 belleu is just a very thin surface of 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:32.190
 leather that covers the protection but that 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.880
 feel the durability and especially that that 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.010
 inspires confidence for against shocks 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:42.030
 and above all I can not find the word 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:43.980
 against the leather that will come off at 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.440
 as the fine leather 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.640
 it's known to take off small to 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.840
 little while there no we really 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.060
 the impression that it will not hold as 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.670
 a smart cover I have one 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:06:00.030
 here under the arm so here it's a 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:02.220
 smart cover black leather version so she 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.290
 has had her time she you see the 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:08.190
 difference between for example leather 

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.450
 so of the protection and the leather of 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.670
 their rights of co to the south that a dac 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.530
 smart cover is very very hungry and that 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.820
 it is just as hungry but inspires the 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.300
 more confidence while you saw him 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.000
 when you like it you do not feel like 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.950
 only with a stroke of low stripes he goes 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.460
 to leave and it is rather a pity 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:30.420
 and while really there that's like 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.980
 it's beautiful and above all it's nice 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.110
 so that's basically what I 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:37.590
 could say about 7 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.590
 hull of at in chains she does not have 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.300
 particular name besides snapkeys so 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.540
 here you are on the apple store 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:48.480
 online at m agglo tense where I 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.570
 think full of many others in brief 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.910
 price now 49 euros 90 I think that 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:58.110
 a bit expensive why for access 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:01.980
 complicated at the volume knob and also 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:05.270
 for leather which is certainly very 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:08.040
 very good bill and who aspires 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.200
 solidity but if we compare to the smart 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:15.750
 cover that has a larger area and 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:18.240
 which has a little more utility a little 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.010
 more symbolic is more particular 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.110
 that it only listens 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:29.310
 limay 69 euros so 20 euros apart 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:31.020
 about here it's a little bit 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.650
 petty on the part of a cashier to do 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:37.110
 an iphone case to those of this type a 

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:39.510
 cheap at 50 euros anyway it's not 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:41.370
 given so here's thanks to everyone for seeing 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:45.380
 this video and see you soon for 

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.380
 new ideas at the barrette aisles
