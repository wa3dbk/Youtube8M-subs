00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.469

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.430
 fight thanks fine here hematoma 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
 how bounce 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.539
 of course a small fee for that result 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.309
 which you saw this here 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 the story before the fight that very little 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.230
 time left until the fight and 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.320
 in this situation how real 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 You were ready before this fight, but you were 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.249
 well prepared if I did not tell anyone 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.489
 only close people know I broke 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:51.149
 edge for seven days before the fight serious 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.809
 fracture was she's really here 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.769
 feared that a couple of people found out everything 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.129
 my team, well, everything was glory 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.850
 god first round the world tried 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.680
 hold you like suffocating reception desk 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.720
 how strong the grip of the yardstick was 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.630
 whether the dangerous moment in it was quite good 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.160
 grip but only the second time now 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.600
 when he worked there that is me when 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.820
 sense of danger began to shove his hand 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
 for kinda kept calm on the contrary 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.750
 hanging hung to get a little tired hands 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.570
 and not tear the clinch to work capture 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.760
 but just by wear down and in the previous 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.800
 the question that the princes here was not a question 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.500
 training here was already a battle of characters 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.540
 and techniques of experience because time is 12 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.780
 days to prepare but impossible to fight 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.790
 that is, we only built with trophies on 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.140
 bout how do you start there 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.930
 the battle then immediately how to switch 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.050
 delete you saw there was a shift various 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.670
 positions 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.070
 generally not standard more resistant so 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.780
 further attacks because something worked on these 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.550
 things that is really very 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.020
 difficult from the side you flew out 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:59.620
 incomprehensibility workin right stand in 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.180
 left stand you change what plans 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.980
 Now how are you going to celebrate the victory and 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.620
 planned or already the next fight is 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.380
 if so, well, I hope to just relax 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.990
 my wife from my own for some time 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.490
 the battle was scheduled on November 30th but not 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.760
 I know whether he will or not because 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.190
 promoters a bit 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.930
 Well, I do not know there mood upset either 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.440
 scared that I would now fight and not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.050
 club hall 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.160
 the result they didn't want there 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.600
 probably get upset as i guess 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.400
 if suddenly I didn't want to lose 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.110
 you take an hour to see something from 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.690
 this fight will not take place then I hope that I 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.880
 rest for at least three months went by all 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.260
 once again congratulations on the conclusion 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.750
 maybe a few words to the fans 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.330
 those who have suffered a huge thank you to everyone who 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.120
 rooted for me to everyone who rooted for our species 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.690
 sport wish live look cool 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.690
