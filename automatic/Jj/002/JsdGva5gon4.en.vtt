00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
which I'll get you know down the line

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.539 
which I'll get you know down the line
probably<00:03:49.170> after<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.470> start<00:03:49.799> feeling<00:03:50.130> better

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
probably after I start feeling better

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.250 
probably after I start feeling better
shoulder<00:03:51.060> house<00:03:51.180> I<00:03:51.329> get<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.600> run<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:51.959> go<00:03:52.079> down

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
shoulder house I get the run and go down

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.430 
shoulder house I get the run and go down
some<00:03:52.880> so<00:03:53.880> pretty<00:03:54.269> much<00:03:54.359> with<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.109> seems<00:03:55.350> like

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
some so pretty much with this seems like

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.020 
some so pretty much with this seems like
i<00:03:55.620> said<00:03:55.799> it's<00:03:55.920> similes<00:03:56.280> board<00:03:56.549> presses<00:03:56.910> and

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
i said it's similes board presses and

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.970 
i said it's similes board presses and
allows<00:03:57.299> you<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.750> work<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.139> your<00:03:58.200> lock<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.739> and

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
allows you to work on your lock out and

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.559 
allows you to work on your lock out and
you<00:03:59.549> know<00:03:59.670> you<00:03:59.760> could<00:03:59.910> just<00:04:00.030> add<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.269> whole<00:04:00.510> new

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
you know you could just add a whole new

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.319 
you know you could just add a whole new
dimension<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:01.200> your<00:04:01.380> training<00:04:01.940> but<00:04:02.940> also<00:04:02.970> i

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
dimension to your training but also i

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.360 
dimension to your training but also i
did<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> lot<00:04:03.750> of<00:04:03.780> research<00:04:04.230> on<00:04:04.470> board<00:04:04.889> presses

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
did a lot of research on board presses

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.520 
did a lot of research on board presses
and<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.549> seems<00:04:05.790> that<00:04:06.109> you<00:04:07.109> know<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> lot<00:04:07.500> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
and it seems that you know a lot of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.470 
and it seems that you know a lot of
people<00:04:07.620> who<00:04:08.010> are<00:04:08.130> way<00:04:08.310> more<00:04:08.750> advanced<00:04:09.750> in

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
people who are way more advanced in

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
recommended board presses to keep a lot

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.360

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
bench press and you know that's not my

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.510 
bench press and you know that's not my
planet<00:04:25.260> but<00:04:26.260> we<00:04:26.350> could<00:04:26.500> definitely<00:04:26.710> you<00:04:27.370> know

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
planet but we could definitely you know

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.629 
planet but we could definitely you know
use<00:04:27.729> this<00:04:28.000> to<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:28.630> stronger<00:04:29.130> build<00:04:30.130> a<00:04:30.280> lot<00:04:30.460> of

pressure<00:04:34.780> off<00:04:35.050> your<00:04:35.229> shoulders<00:04:35.680> so<00:04:35.830> that's

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
pressure off your shoulders so that's

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.950
