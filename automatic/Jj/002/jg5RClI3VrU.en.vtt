still missing to you from the front so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.200 
still missing to you from the front so
you<00:01:04.100> got<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> pick<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.580> from<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> center

you got to pick it up from the center
and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.420> stays<00:01:07.040> pretty<00:01:08.040> pretty<00:01:08.400> good<00:01:08.640> forward

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
and it stays pretty pretty good forward

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.719 
and it stays pretty pretty good forward
way<00:01:09.299> so<00:01:09.650> should<00:01:10.650> be<00:01:10.860> pretty<00:01:10.890> good<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
way so should be pretty good it's it's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.410 
way so should be pretty good it's it's
kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.030> high<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:13.100> little<00:01:14.100> top-heavy<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:14.939> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
kind of high a little top-heavy but I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
kind of high a little top-heavy but I
don't<00:01:16.020> think<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> be<00:01:16.740> too<00:01:16.950> bad<00:01:16.979> i

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
don't think it's going to be too bad i

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.670 
don't think it's going to be too bad i
can<00:01:17.490> set<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:17.850> way<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.180> this<00:01:18.540> doesn't<00:01:19.290> tip

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
can set it way up like this doesn't tip

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.870 
can set it way up like this doesn't tip
over<00:01:19.860> so

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.790 

should<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.330> that's<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.020> new<00:01:25.200> shock<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.740> the

tape<00:03:12.190> take<00:03:13.190> a<00:03:13.220> file<00:03:13.610> and<00:03:13.970> rough<00:03:14.540> up<00:03:14.750> the

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
tape take a file and rough up the

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.350 
tape take a file and rough up the
classic<00:03:15.440> real<00:03:15.620> good<00:03:15.830> it's<00:03:16.400> meant<00:03:16.820> to<00:03:16.970> stick<00:03:17.210> to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
classic real good it's meant to stick to

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.000 
classic real good it's meant to stick to
metal<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:17.840> it's<00:03:18.710> like<00:03:20.050> it's<00:03:21.050> a<00:03:21.170> 10<00:03:21.440> pound<00:03:21.680> per

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
metal and it's like it's a 10 pound per

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.600 
metal and it's like it's a 10 pound per
square<00:03:22.040> inch<00:03:22.540> hold<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.500> basically<00:03:25.190> what's<00:03:25.460> on

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
square inch hold so basically what's on

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.210 
square inch hold so basically what's on
here<00:03:25.970> is<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.330> little<00:03:27.140> more<00:03:27.380> than<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.650> square<00:03:27.950> inch

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
here is a little more than a square inch

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.730 
here is a little more than a square inch
so<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.210> will<00:03:29.300> hold<00:03:29.420> about<00:03:29.570> that's<00:03:30.050> about<00:03:30.260> 15

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
so it will hold about that's about 15

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.250 
so it will hold about that's about 15
pounds<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:32.000> can<00:03:32.030> you<00:03:32.570> can<00:03:32.720> lift<00:03:32.960> the<00:03:33.110> whole

pounds you can you can lift the whole

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.170 
pounds you can you can lift the whole
