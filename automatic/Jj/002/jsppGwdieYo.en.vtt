to<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.850> lot<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.420> stuff<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.110> was<00:03:04.200> there<00:03:04.470> but

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
to a lot of the stuff that was there but

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.620 
to a lot of the stuff that was there but
I<00:03:05.160> kind<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.400> thought<00:03:05.520> Lamar<00:03:06.060> was<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.270> bit<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
I kind of thought Lamar was a bit of a

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.110 
I kind of thought Lamar was a bit of a
spare<00:03:07.320> part<00:03:07.620> yeah<00:03:08.100> I<00:03:08.190> mean<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:08.550> was<00:03:08.820> kind<00:03:09.060> of

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
spare part yeah I mean it was kind of

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.780 
spare part yeah I mean it was kind of
just<00:03:09.240> AI<00:03:09.480> didn't<00:03:10.200> really<00:03:10.410> key<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.370> franklin

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
just AI didn't really key into franklin

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.180 
just AI didn't really key into franklin
in<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.120> mile<00:03:12.330> that<00:03:12.540> much<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.110> either<00:03:13.800> way<00:03:14.130> you

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
in the mile that much and either way you

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.710 
in the mile that much and either way you
know<00:03:14.430> if<00:03:14.550> anybody<00:03:14.850> else<00:03:15.000> felt<00:03:15.270> the<00:03:15.360> same<00:03:15.540> way

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
know if anybody else felt the same way

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.570 
know if anybody else felt the same way
but<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:16.020> me<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.140> was<00:03:16.410> certainly<00:03:16.860> how<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.400> was

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
but for me that was certainly how it was

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.820 
but for me that was certainly how it was
and<00:03:17.910> I'd<00:03:18.600> like<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.780> hear<00:03:19.020> more<00:03:19.080> from<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.650> mask

on<00:03:39.930> vats<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:41.310> guess<00:03:41.460> what<00:03:41.640> kind<00:03:41.730> of<00:03:41.850> you

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
on vats and I guess what kind of you

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.640 
on vats and I guess what kind of you
know<00:03:42.060> we're<00:03:42.390> talking<00:03:42.900> about<00:03:42.960> weapons<00:03:43.440> and

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
know we're talking about weapons and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.840 
know we're talking about weapons and
stuff<00:03:43.830> you're<00:03:44.040> going<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.340> weapons<00:03:44.550> and

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
stuff you're going to get weapons and

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.100 
stuff you're going to get weapons and
whatever<00:03:45.180> put<00:03:45.390> in<00:03:45.480> at<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.660> single<00:03:45.990> player

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
whatever put in at the single player

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.020 
whatever put in at the single player
anyway<00:03:46.650> I'd<00:03:46.770> imagine<00:03:47.190> hopefully<00:03:47.880> at<00:03:47.970> least

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
anyway I'd imagine hopefully at least

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
anyway I'd imagine hopefully at least
because<00:03:48.270> of<00:03:48.450> course<00:03:48.600> are<00:03:48.690> going<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:48.930> doing

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
because of course are going to be doing

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.830 
because of course are going to be doing
that<00:03:49.260> online<00:03:49.880> it's<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.000> question<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:51.480> we've

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
that online it's the question then we've

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.690 
that online it's the question then we've
addressed<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.350> first<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:52.800> the<00:03:53.370> second<00:03:53.670> one

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
addressed the first one the second one

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.600 
addressed the first one the second one
is<00:03:53.910> when<00:03:54.230> when<00:03:55.230> is<00:03:55.410> it<00:03:55.530> gonna<00:03:55.590> hem<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:56.220> don't

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
is when when is it gonna hem I don't

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.640 
is when when is it gonna hem I don't
know<00:03:56.730> if<00:03:57.030> it<00:03:57.240> does<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> doesn't<00:03:58.230> like<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
know if it does if it doesn't like I

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.140 
know if it does if it doesn't like I
can't<00:03:58.920> imagine<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.400> won't<00:03:59.610> hear<00:03:59.940> what

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
can't imagine it won't hear what

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.420 
can't imagine it won't hear what
happened<00:04:00.510> before<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:01.200> end<00:04:01.710> of<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.950> year<00:04:01.980> and

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
happened before the end of the year and

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.490 
happened before the end of the year and
because<00:04:03.120> it<00:04:03.450> would<00:04:03.570> just<00:04:03.750> doesn't<00:04:04.350> make<00:04:04.440> sense

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
because it would just doesn't make sense

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.680 
because it would just doesn't make sense
it<00:04:04.890> would<00:04:04.950> take<00:04:05.130> some<00:04:05.370> time<00:04:05.610> to<00:04:05.820> do<00:04:05.940> dlc<00:04:06.450> like

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
it would take some time to do dlc like

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.000 
it would take some time to do dlc like
that<00:04:06.870> adding<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.380> the<00:04:07.530> single<00:04:07.890> player

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
that adding all the single player

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.100 
that adding all the single player
experience<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:09.090> would<00:04:09.240> take<00:04:09.390> some<00:04:09.600> time<00:04:09.810> to<00:04:09.990> do

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
experience it would take some time to do

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.110 
experience it would take some time to do
it<00:04:10.290> cold<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.740> right<00:04:10.920> is<00:04:11.130> you<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:11.520> whatever

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
it cold it right is you know whatever

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.240 
it cold it right is you know whatever
okay<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.500> course<00:04:13.530> they've<00:04:13.890> got<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.040> lot<00:04:14.220> of

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
okay and of course they've got a lot of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.160 
okay and of course they've got a lot of
stuff<00:04:14.520> going<00:04:14.550> on<00:04:14.880> between<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.570> the<00:04:16.080> new

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.170 
stuff going on between now and the new

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.900 
stuff going on between now and the new
year<00:04:16.440> so<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:16.799> wouldn't<00:04:17.040> make<00:04:17.130> sense<00:04:17.190> maybe

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
year so it wouldn't make sense maybe

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.150 
year so it wouldn't make sense maybe
next<00:04:18.180> year<00:04:18.359> maybe<00:04:18.690> march<00:04:19.470> sometime<00:04:19.739> other

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
next year maybe march sometime other

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.050 
next year maybe march sometime other
either<00:04:21.060> way<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:22.440> know<00:04:22.650> you<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.729> question

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
either way you know you the question

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.800 
either way you know you the question
that<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.240> know

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
