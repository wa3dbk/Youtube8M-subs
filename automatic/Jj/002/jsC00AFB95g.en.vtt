demo and now I don't know if you can

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
demo and now I don't know if you can
hear<00:00:40.170> it<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.710> hear<00:00:40.860> them<00:00:41.010> both<00:00:41.250> both

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the audio files at the same time and I

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.270 
the audio files at the same time and I
think<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> glitch<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.469> boosts

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
think this is a glitch that it boosts

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.619 
think this is a glitch that it boosts
the<00:00:47.399> time<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> click<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.809> one<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.289> time

the time if you click it one more time

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.150 
the time if you click it one more time
it<00:00:51.629> brings<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> pirates<00:00:52.559> caverns<00:00:53.010> now
