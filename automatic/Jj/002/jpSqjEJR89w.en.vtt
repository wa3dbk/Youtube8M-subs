day when I had lots of spare time I was

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.010 
day when I had lots of spare time I was
a<00:01:32.280> football<00:01:33.000> manager<00:01:33.150> nuts<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.810> absolutely

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
a football manager nuts I absolutely

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
a football manager nuts I absolutely
loved<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> game<00:01:34.890> but<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:35.759> days<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.000> just

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
loved that game but these days I just

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
loved that game but these days I just
don't<00:01:36.420> after<00:01:36.600> time<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.049> said<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
don't after time like I said it it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
don't after time like I said it it
really<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> major<00:01:38.310> time<00:01:38.759> sink<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.329> it's

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
really is a major time sink and it's

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.760 
really is a major time sink and it's
quite<00:01:39.600> dangerous<00:01:39.810> actually<00:01:40.170> football

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
quite dangerous actually football

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.310 
quite dangerous actually football
manager<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> thought<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.810> picked<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> up

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
manager so I thought I picked this up

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.240 
manager so I thought I picked this up
because<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.710> said<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.040> quite<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
because like I said it is quite a

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.120 
because like I said it is quite a
simplified<00:01:44.880> version<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> football<00:01:46.740> manager

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
simplified version of a football manager

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.069 
simplified version of a football manager
and<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.250> thought<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.700> might<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.780> cater

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
and I thought this might you know cater

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.899 
and I thought this might you know cater
to<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:49.740> niche<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.399> there<00:01:50.610> are<00:01:50.700> two

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
to that little niche and there are two

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
to that little niche and there are two
ways<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.420> which<00:01:51.450> football<00:01:51.990> manager<00:01:52.350> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
ways in which football manager is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.160 
ways in which football manager is
fundamentally<00:01:53.130> different<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.090> game<00:01:54.360> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
fundamentally different to this game the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.260 
fundamentally different to this game the
first<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.369> kind<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:56.909> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
first is that this is kind of like a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.160 
first is that this is kind of like a
football

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
football

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.490 
football
RPG<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.549> such<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> thing<00:01:59.909> were<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.270> exist<00:02:00.600> not<00:02:01.409> in

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
RPG if such a thing were to exist not in

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.020 
RPG if such a thing were to exist not in
the<00:02:01.590> sense<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.009> Inazuma<00:02:02.460> Eleven<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:03.000> a

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
the sense of like Inazuma Eleven it's a

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.580 
the sense of like Inazuma Eleven it's a
little<00:02:03.210> bit<00:02:03.299> different<00:02:03.540> from<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.689> but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
little bit different from that but

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.550 
little bit different from that but
basically<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.130> get<00:02:05.420> cards<00:02:06.420> training<00:02:07.259> cards

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
basically you get cards training cards

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.350 
basically you get cards training cards
that<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.950> apply<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.250> your<00:02:08.459> players<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.030> boost

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
that you apply to your players to boost

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.760 
that you apply to your players to boost
the<00:02:09.509> stats<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.020> that's<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.530> takes<00:02:10.679> about

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the stats and that's it it takes about

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.120 
the stats and that's it it takes about
five<00:02:11.069> seconds<00:02:11.550> you<00:02:11.910> look

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
five seconds you look

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.230 
five seconds you look
the<00:02:12.280> stats<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.640> your<00:02:12.670> player<00:02:12.880> that<00:02:13.060> need

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
the stats of your player that need

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.120 
the stats of your player that need
improving<00:02:13.540> you<00:02:14.320> look<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.710> cards<00:02:15.040> that

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
improving you look at the cards that

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.800 
improving you look at the cards that
you've<00:02:15.250> got<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:16.210> know<00:02:16.330> common<00:02:16.600> sense

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
you've got and you know common sense

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.360 
you've got and you know common sense
dictates<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.410> needs<00:02:17.590> improving<00:02:17.680> you<00:02:18.190> just

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
dictates what needs improving you just

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.520 
dictates what needs improving you just
apply<00:02:18.640> those<00:02:18.880> cards<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.510> player<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:20.350> boost

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
apply those cards to the player to boost

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.590 
apply those cards to the player to boost
those<00:02:20.740> stats<00:02:21.100> it's<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:22.150> simple<00:02:22.360> it's

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
those stats it's really simple it's

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.870 
those stats it's really simple it's
really<00:02:22.630> intuitive<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:23.740> suchly<00:02:24.430> quite<00:02:24.610> fun

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
really intuitive and suchly quite fun

really intuitive and suchly quite fun
the<00:02:25.210> second<00:02:25.480> major<00:02:25.600> difference<00:02:26.020> is<00:02:26.230> in<00:02:26.560> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
the second major difference is in the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.400 
the second major difference is in the
way<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> fixtures<00:02:27.880> are<00:02:28.000> handled

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
way that the fixtures are handled

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.120 
way that the fixtures are handled
traditionally<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.500> football<00:02:29.770> man<00:02:29.890> is<00:02:29.980> again

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
traditionally the football man is again

once the football season begins that's

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.280 
once the football season begins that's
it<00:02:33.340> pretty<00:02:33.550> much<00:02:33.670> every<00:02:34.030> game<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.240> play<00:02:34.360> is<00:02:34.780> a

it pretty much every game you play is a

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.600 
it pretty much every game you play is a

something like that but every game is

really great little addition to the

these<00:03:02.350> cards<00:03:02.830> which<00:03:03.160> makes<00:03:03.400> your<00:03:03.580> team<00:03:03.820> better

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
these cards which makes your team better

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.570 
these cards which makes your team better
so<00:03:05.350> it<00:03:05.470> kind<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.710> makes<00:03:05.860> failure<00:03:06.310> not

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
so it kind of makes failure not

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.480 
so it kind of makes failure not
something<00:03:07.120> that<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.660> annoying<00:03:08.440> but<00:03:09.130> something

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
something that is annoying but something

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.250 
something that is annoying but something
that's<00:03:09.610> essential<00:03:10.180> it<00:03:10.660> also<00:03:10.810> takes<00:03:11.050> away<00:03:11.140> that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
that's essential it also takes away that

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.020 
that's essential it also takes away that
sense<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.800> what<00:03:12.040> am<00:03:12.130> I<00:03:12.220> doing<00:03:12.490> wrong<00:03:12.520> because

football<00:03:27.490> manager<00:03:27.520> you<00:03:28.060> might<00:03:28.210> want<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.570> try<00:03:28.900> a

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
football manager you might want to try a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.230 
football manager you might want to try a
new<00:03:29.140> formation<00:03:29.560> or<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> new<00:03:30.100> system<00:03:30.460> but<00:03:31.090> you're

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
new formation or a new system but you're

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.610 
new formation or a new system but you're
scared<00:03:31.480> of<00:03:31.540> losing<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.870> game<00:03:32.020> so<00:03:32.500> it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
scared of losing the game so it

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.320 
scared of losing the game so it
definitely<00:03:32.830> eliminates<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.700> sense<00:03:34.090> of

definitely eliminates that sense of
frustration<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:35.440> kind<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.740> puts<00:03:35.920> people<00:03:36.250> off

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
frustration that kind of puts people off

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
simulator it's definitely much more

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.000 
simulator it's definitely much more
accessible<00:03:41.230> than<00:03:41.320> something<00:03:41.530> like<00:03:41.650> football

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
accessible than something like football

room the way you handle transfers and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
new signings and contracts is also much

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
simpler and much more streamlined you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.380 
simpler and much more streamlined you
basically<00:03:56.860> get<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.250> fixed<00:03:57.760> budget<00:03:58.150> at<00:03:58.300> the

promoted or relegated your budget

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.680

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
reflects that and changes accordingly so

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.420 
reflects that and changes accordingly so
