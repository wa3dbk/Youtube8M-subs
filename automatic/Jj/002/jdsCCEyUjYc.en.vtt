job<00:01:21.390> done<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.049> now<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.380> there<00:01:22.590> now<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> does

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
job done it's now in there now it does

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.070 
job done it's now in there now it does
have<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.610> look<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:24.000> here<00:01:24.330> now<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> reason<00:01:24.840> for

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
have a look out here now the reason for

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
have a look out here now the reason for
this<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.290> because<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.590> desert<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.430> lot

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
this is because it's desert it's a lot

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.070 
this is because it's desert it's a lot
of<00:01:26.880> ones<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.210> career<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.930> have<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of ones in career and what they have a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.740 
of ones in career and what they have a
