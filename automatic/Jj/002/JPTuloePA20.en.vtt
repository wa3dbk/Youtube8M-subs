00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello to all these plastic today I'm going 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
 to make a comparison of two products 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.910
 that I'm going to use during a 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 Time is my first comparison video 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.629
 of products then I'll explain 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.910
 a little the features that to me 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.430
 I like to see in these videos the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.370
 products in question are this product 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.320
 new that has taken out garnier that ensures 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:28.470
 an erasure of all imperfections 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.039
 in 5 seconds and I'm going to compare it with 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.840
 the per professional that is that I 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.810
 you have seen in many videos 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.600
 own I have recommended them and because 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.710
 They are also my friends, I also know 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.500
 I recommend because I've been very successful 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.410
 well then I'll tell you a little bit 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.000
 the characteristics of each and I'm going to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.440
 start with the features that are 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.670
 of color and smell texture in this aspect 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.429
 is that it takes the base palm of vélez 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.399
 because good has a texture 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.199
 completely uniform when when 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.770
 diffuse is when you extend it in the 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.950
 skin has a makeup color with what 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.509
 which does not start from zero at the time of 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.670
 apply it but then go back to 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:15.759
 to blur it on the skin the truth is that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.450
 the texture is completely integrated 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.549
 that leaves on the skin is like 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.149
 velvet like peach this is what 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:29.679
 share this the two share and the 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:32.679
 smell is something better and in that of benito in 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:37.869
 against what has the honey that does not 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:40.149
 they have achieved a perfect texture because 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.409
 As you can see, it has a lot of air inside 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.110
 of the boat then Miguel tube and then 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.140
 it comes out as small itching 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.630
 the texture when it diffuses is a 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.610
 little bit more pink when it fades 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.040
 it remains the same 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:08.550
 but the smell is not as pleasant as 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:12.000
 of venice and then well then the texture 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.270
 it's not so green good next 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.390
 both function 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 they perform quite well even 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.530
 the one that does best in this case is the 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.740
 legal and that both for many 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.740
 hours with many hours I gave you one morning 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.530
 and fulfills the function of closing above all 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.850
 the choirs good to see you already know that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.550
 has commented on many videos that I 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.340
 I have oily skin and with dogs very 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.530
 dilated in this central area of ​​the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.300
 doublets and especially in the 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.790
 different these tests that you have the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.890
 Oily skin is not new, so 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.790
 then these two products meet 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:56.790
 pretty good at closing the pores if it's 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.660
 true that in terms of duration 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.960
 I tell you 6 hours for sure on my skin 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.000
 but this finishes 6 hours with the pore 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.060
 in better conditions more closed than 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.069
 the one of vélez 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.500
 the next element that I would comment 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.970
 it would be the good price not right now 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.760
 as I have this since I have 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:19.150
 I would rather give it to you 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.700
 I think it cost something like 30 or 35 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:28.090
 euros however that of garnier us 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:31.190
 costs 11 95 99 12 worth us which 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:35.180
 because in the end it comes out much better this one 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:38.420
 with which in summary the comparison of 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.070
 these two products already at the end and you know 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.950
 that I have recommended you a lot 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.290
 benefit but in the end who wins base of 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.450
 good leganés I hope you have been 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.120

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.120
