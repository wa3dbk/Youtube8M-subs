 jezzi fiorentino 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.829
 of which we often remember luca flores entered into the heart not only for the skill 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.049
 unfortunately also due to the premature death 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.310

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.060
 connect digital terrestrial. 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.370
 there is nothing else I could not see from another topic. at that critical moment 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.370
 to furnish 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.680
 we were there 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 for now we 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.450
 this project you have of the collaboration between david riondino are 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.100

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:24.649
 for freed florence this radio is born that will then become the write florence 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:27.649
 becomes the headquarters d 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.299
 two main orchestras 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.450
 they preserve everything in a pink text by Francesco Ferrari where they are the best 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:38.449
 Italian jazz musicians 

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:44.019
 you are a naturist type 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.110
 it is a tool 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.269
 emergencies are important 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.680

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.599

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.809
 others

 let's say herbs 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.589
 it is worth the years of difference between me and stefano quite normal certainly 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:09.749
 here is a little and the pride of the school that they manage at 25 years activity center 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.419

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:20.139
 interesting musicians 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.439
 we have a bit of this festival for which to create artistic direction rome it 10 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.469
 edition 2 a. let's see library of 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.909
 of your concert with les italy is that it has closed and the lesson now that it has closed 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.239
 the festival because iti lumediluna are the ones who are at the pc the truth 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.520
 look at the new 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.189
 as far as I know - summer goes on 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.429
 but there is no doubt it is clear 

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:52.569
 if there are the conditions to make it go on then 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.729
 it is a festival that is nothing but my cousin 

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:03.249
 the search for sponsors is also very good and good at communication 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.169
 it is clear we see 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:08.289
 the future cannot be hypothesized that much. 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.380
 do not believe the technicians say the square of the flounder i dobro avoid 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.639
 jokes a little more serious we hear for a moment your cousin what you think 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:21.289
 stefano di puccio cousin of alessandro en diciamo care the most part 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.620
 strictly organizational 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:30.389
 functional king alessandro very confident you on the next of this festival is me 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.680
 I am always polemical I hate the example I will do more every year I wonder if 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.680
 because I do it and then daily.net 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.669
 and here the news is that next year I must say this I had 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.289
 its own interest by the administration 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.379
 in short, in the end they noticed us in short 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:54.370
 when it was really that 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.750
 well since then our vat is made of waste 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.000
 at piazza della passera the festival will continue also next year 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.570
 we see in September here for another series of concerts organized by 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:06.750
