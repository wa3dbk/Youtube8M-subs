to be making a half a gallon which I've

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.029 
to be making a half a gallon which I've
already<00:01:00.840> made<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.320> many<00:01:01.530> times<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to make a bigger amount this time

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.429

because<00:01:06.299> I've<00:01:06.420> kind<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.140> through<00:01:07.170> it

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
because I've kind of going through it

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
because I've kind of going through it
really<00:01:07.590> fast<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> did<00:01:09.420> was<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.810> made<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
really fast so what I did was I made a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.539 
really fast so what I did was I made a
saltwater<00:01:10.590> solution<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:13.100> what's<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.250> half

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
saltwater solution of what's this half

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810 
saltwater solution of what's this half
gallon<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> water<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.500> six<00:01:16.920> teaspoons<00:01:17.340> of

gallon of water and six teaspoons of

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.060 
gallon of water and six teaspoons of
salt<00:01:18.439> basically<00:01:19.439> when<00:01:19.830> you're<00:01:19.920> making

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
salt basically when you're making

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.359 
salt basically when you're making
fermented<00:01:20.610> veggies<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.780> want<00:01:22.250> for<00:01:23.250> each

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
fermented veggies you want for each

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
with the three tablespoons and that's

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
with the three tablespoons and that's
just<00:01:32.130> perfect<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.640> me<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.210> you're<00:01:33.360> making

this at home you might want to consider

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.760 
this at home you might want to consider
using<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.119> lesser<00:01:36.479> amount<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.650> be
