00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.240
 this is a song today I will not leave 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.770
 me so they do not get scared 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.420
 and will follow a squirrel reggaeton and 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.370
 eating is my little sister who is 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.620
 eating an apple ok 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.970
 this song is called where do you get that 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.670
 you leave I do not dedicate myself to do this 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.189
 take covers and then upload them in video 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.660
 the truth this is not the first time 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.220
 I do this but nothing else is because it is 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.500
 for a special person that is my 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.570
 primita the most what is of all the 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.730
 days for who it is but I can not say 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.500
 names for who because I love him or 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.030
 angry do not worry about it get it 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.030
 the week that goes in good 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.679
 the song does not do it to me that nothing else 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.030
 I go more or less to local figure and the 

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:48.030
 intro is 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.190
 they are first is the funk tone 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.740
 and then it's being west 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.890
 it is reached 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.850
 then follow 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.350
 then it's still very good 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.590
 and it repeats 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.439
 I'll just sing to come not 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:40.189
 because I asked your friends how 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.469
 I'm going all the time to the 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.469
 places where I think you 're going to like 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:51.119
 I do not think so 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.119
 all right 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.980
 not because it happens 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.950
 all right 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.099
 and do not think 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.280
 I dream you every day that I miss you 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:28.260
 So much is just normal 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:40.550
 I love you too much but it's gone and the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:40.550
 chorus returns to peace although yes 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 and there is the song that allows 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.239
 pleased pleased as well as very 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.239
