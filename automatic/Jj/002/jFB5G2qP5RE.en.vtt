00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.759
 hey i'm ok from nataly minetti me 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.949
 I am a very successful counters 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.460
 texture player for the international 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.279
 top team mtw here and in this video 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.849
 Do you see a section of the content 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:33.450
 to it in my premium forum on the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.670
 homepage to see gives warmly 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.190
 Welcome to the next guide in this 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.469
 spirit I will focus on perhaps 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.410
 I'm trying to remove that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.660
 whole with post and sales would like to show 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 how the whole thing looks to you a few 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 Tricks show that you use very well 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
 can also be such a few generally steel 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.550
 fleeting probably recognizes but there 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 just show you which areas make sense 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.820
 are and which are better, so to speak 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.070
 as other than that, example is caught 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.559
 just in the banana right next to him 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.149
 opposite center with the wrong means 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.030
 I'll show you a couple 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.280
 grade flash for one, it is often like that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.789
 if you come as terror yes banana here 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.350
 then it is about throwing such surfaces 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.999
 no wonder if you are here as abb 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.499
 not blind is that means in a bp 

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:21.539
 front is in this area here 

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:35.719
 I get even one simple but yet 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:35.719
 Away there it is gone 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:44.520
 There she is not there but here they stand 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 front edge and here goals or even her 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.399
 aims 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.479
 it's hard to do that though 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.219
 me so in this game 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.600
 so many are front here was 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.560
 now just the roof one protects yes 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:02:03.299
 then I am here now the position 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:05.610
 take this flash show the yard if 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.970
 this would throw and the console stands 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.009
 here 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.869
 then realized country where since you are not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.640
 not blind yes next alternative 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.470
 This natural is the area 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.049
 all over the roof to throw oversized 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.900
 area but not because 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.150
 they drain somewhere else cairo above 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.470
 and not that far that is in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.540
 The flash can be basically a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.110
 give popsong over here even brings 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.170
 Nothing 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.370
 because most of the time you are yes it is very 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.480
 seldom that it simply pushes aggressively 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.920
 and the flash land as I said up here 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.599
 there it is in this area 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.549
 better one else to throw 70, 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.200
 possibility to just run here yes 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:42.090
 and here so that you have not seen 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.579
 what is going on through the area 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.299
 The alpiq should throw me this 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.920
 at this angle 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.269
 but if I stand here the wall 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.910
 run 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.370
 but here flash animal then the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.410
 perfect for a natural it is like that 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.459
 As a player, you might do it all 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 so can see the solid minimal there 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.420
 I've come to see you then and if you have 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.410
 has now become too short as it is now 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.090
 I have to throw with swing 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.680
 the one way to say for example 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.660
 for whom, of course , there would be 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.220
 not all you have to fall for it 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.889
 be careful if i can just here 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.780
 for that I can sometimes this knew 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.790
 hang here you have to 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.100
 put it down there reasonably and then here 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.299
 the throw then it also ends up 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.370
 especially as it is really difficult to get there 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.530
 so max del it is possible but one 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.090
 surface now, however, after we to 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.190
 for example just makes you quickly jump 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.010
 through and the flash about it but me 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.420
 stand here on the wall then you see 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.340
 This is this area finished now 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.299
 have this flickering light has anna 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.069
 mannebach because I have 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.959
 normally you are so great 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.250
 minimal flashes that you always have 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.299
 to move again can kill one more 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.530
 could still kill on 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.980
 so do not bring by flash 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.690
 That's why I always recommend simply 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.129
 to throw the people firmly and 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.750
 to proceed with it if you always surface 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.909
 somehow wants to throw something for gang 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.170
 from further afield of course 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:57.459
 Relative demand is therefore here 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.209
 to go to any place without flash for 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.860
 example too dry 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.349
 then he really landed with him 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.500
 can not count aggressively 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.970
 the banana against the atp 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.870
 if you know that no one is right 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.849
 Of course, you only have bad luck 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.690
 throw 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.090
 then you have to take care that we are her 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.709
 stop if he drops it anyway 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.269
 yes, not with turnaround throws so 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.010
 now not somehow there and here 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.630
 again why and how it works 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.010
 was when I return up there somewhere 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.020
 does not make the player directly on any 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.780
 fall wind that must come pretty short 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.500
 you want them from here, so to speak 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.320
 just drop it 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.210
 and then it goes directly to the one in the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.800
 players who would stand in front 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.900
 So now aggressively recommends goal 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.940
 tried or would stand here 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.320
 but here would also draw the player 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.389
 because counting here is his 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.830
 maybe because she is relatively short and 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:46.000
 you can not take it away 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.860
 bad at bsc I think so 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.820
 already shown so I need now 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.080
 always to respond there's 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.940
 of course, the warning to flash over here 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.960
 yes or the variant over gang too 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.190
 flashing you show me briefly on 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.900
 Of course there are many small ones here 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.470
 Of course you can over here 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.169
 areas 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.099
 You can over here a beautiful 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.570
 bottle I do not think so yet 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:07.570
 If you look at the 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:10.570
 wall is thus yes, and here this 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.830
 this one uses this step area 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.729
 then you can stop flash 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:19.300
 why would have dropped that one 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.300
 minimal one may there professor and this 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.650
 really perfect because there so short 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.419
 about this box that you have no chance 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.440
 as a terror somehow get away too 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.860
 So let me tell you I'm here 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.760
 ahead 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.990
 in this area yes I'll show you 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.410
 how the flash would look like for 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.410
 the speaker 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.380
 that is not really fit post 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:01.939
 okay that's alright so many things 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.620
 here each other was mocking for example 

00:06:01.939 --> 00:06:06.669
 of cable drums or something yes you 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.669
 stand here and throw this flash 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.780
 Does it really matter how you throw it 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.620
 At what angle you throw them you can 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.009
 is slightly shorter must continue 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.840
 throw 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:16.340
 Of course, I've seen that, but now 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.740
 would have to introduce here belongs to the request 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.969
 the flash mob I never play about 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.009
 march her far forward I'm almost in 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.719
 this area borders and ireland the 

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.460
 surface above me 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:29.479
 I do it once the other the faith 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.979
 I was a bit further there is therefore 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:32.779
 you can turn right from michael heller 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:35.810
 throw up and this is on everyone 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:37.520
 case better than a flash he uses 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.080
 a lot of swing throws because you can see 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.560
 Stop even longer so they are up 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.729
 every case a bit shorter of course 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.210
 as a possibility somehow in the ground too 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.710
 use 

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:49.699
 but that was bad of course now 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.840
 thrown so water you can throw 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:51.259
 Of course, here's his short one 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.449
 to stop 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:54.409
 the front edge can be dispatched with it 

00:06:53.449 --> 00:06:56.479
 you do not continue to count that is the 

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:59.300
 advantage could have had the one here 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.560
 in groups with handle and aim when 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.330
 Of course, the terror is not possible then 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.800
 you have to be in front of the flash 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.210
 turn away 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.789
 yes that was a small excerpt 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.069
 a video that is in my extreme 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:12.589
 forum to see on netcode 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:13.490
 illuminati point you can come 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:15.229
 but of course on everyone else 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.599
 for example, portals are tracking 

00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:20.210
 youtube is the net limina on 

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:22.400
 facebook is the netqos and hopes that 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.680
 It's also a short or my private one 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.379
 channel are on facebook mtv rookie and 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.589
 in youtube andrology many thanks for 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:29.589
