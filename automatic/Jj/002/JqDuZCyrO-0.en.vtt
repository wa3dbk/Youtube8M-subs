00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 this wave then as you could 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.509
 to hear it in the news the next 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.480
 apple keynote will be held on September 9th 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.120
 so apple is going to present his mobile bone 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.019
 so the ios and the next he will go out 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.139
 so c read more 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.350
 and as many of you are 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.680
 on iphone jailbroken or ipad and so 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.140
 running 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.300
 and when you want to make the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.650
 day on the ios suite you will not know 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.869
 simply because you have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.830
 clicked restore same sought after bet 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.140
 up to date if your iphone and I broke it 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.520
 normal escape to pengrowth it does 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 so it'll be blocked so what you 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.780
 must do to be able to go to the ios 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.079
 did that so it's a 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:47.850
 restore you have to connect your 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.039
 iphone itunes before the battery and if 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.120
 possible this case better 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:52.680
 so you have to put it in dfu mode 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.660
 so to put it in dfu mode 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.489
 as I said you hook up to your 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.379
 computer with some lights on 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.660
 opened earlier and you press the 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:05.280
 home button as well as the button 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.140
 lock leave you in a hurry 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.420
 until the screen goes out 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.500
 and as soon as the screen turns off a few 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.119
 seconds after you let go of the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.979
 lock button while leaving 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 the home button at that time 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.979
 Itunes admits that he detected it 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.130
 an iphone in recovery mode and has it 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.130
 so to impress on the ios fast if you 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.960
 see this old today or 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.869
 then monday witt 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 I advise you to make the 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.500
 day to the last bone 7 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.430
 if you do not want to move on to a sequel 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.530
 because once the water is empty 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 will be released all the restorations will 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.740
 believe on the factual consequences otherwise 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.140
 further away from having the bone is ios 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.750
 so about September 9th 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.320
 apparently apple is going to release a new 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.990
 ipad 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:57.840
 what seems and apparently the gouache 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.079
 will finally be presented according to some 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.149
 rumors 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.009
 and so here you have also 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.340
 questions or high about the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.899
 keynote to restore your iphone 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.129
 to spend the next uv you can 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.569
 put all the comments and I 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.569
 answer as quickly as usual
