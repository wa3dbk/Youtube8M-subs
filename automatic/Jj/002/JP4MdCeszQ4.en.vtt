00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:07.330
 Let's see 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:11.430
 here we review very 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.430
 briefly this fact 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.360
 necaxa ray players 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:28.550
 louis and alejandro 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:33.650
 They were consigned to the center d 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.650
 social readaptation in aguascalientes 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.840
 found elements the judge for 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.629
 accuse them of the crime of malicious injuries 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:51.490
 against a 22 - year - old was 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:54.820
 with triple skull and facial fracture 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.150
 the aggression happened on Sunday in the 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.890
 parking lot of a shopping center 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:05.740
 when the players came out of a 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:09.909
 antro where they launched offensive compliments to 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.869
 the victim's premium 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:16.259
 who with a couple of friends left 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 a bar 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.359
 louis marshals claimed his attitude and he 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.140
 they launched against him to hit him 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:30.319
 even when I was on the floor 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.820
 They kicked the body of the young and the 

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:34.490
 head 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.110
 so these players the rays of the 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:42.660
 necaxa 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:46.020
 luis gorosito recent from uruguay and 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.930
 Alejandro Molina are in jail in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.080
 aguascalientes and the injured is very 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.210
 serious risk of losing his life and 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.600
 even an idiocy 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.510
 and for a bravado remove me these 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.700
 straws and you're 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.700
 it does not take them out there 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:14.569
 Well, the glasses that make you forget 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.120
 who are they 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.430
 the prestige creep 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.450
 and good and the institution should 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.709
 unsubscribe them so you can not have 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.769
 finally the sport is an example for 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.980
 youth is for society is 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.379
 discipline is effort is dedication is 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.780
 clear clean game or you can not have 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.879
 two players who are 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.000
 terrific be the stars or not 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.420
 you can have that kind of people whose 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 behavior outside the court is 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.030
 wild and barbarous goodbye to apply the 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.640
 law his career also ended at least 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.420
 to Mexican soccer but also the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.740
 man a little prudence 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.630
 they did not touch it, they told her 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.680
 It was not to finish on a 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.680
 pitched confrontation 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:12.420
 but it was like what happened in Brazil 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.810
 remember that some Mexicans 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.700
 they got into a row that later the 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.040
 exhibited the scandal throughout the country 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.310
 and now that they are already saying that it is not 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.739
 true 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.860
 Well yes they have used 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.550
 influences because the young people that the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.710
 they accused were influential 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.900
 they did not explain to us how they went 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:43.400
 so much vacation time 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:47.299
 it did not cost them here practically the 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.450
 exposed to public shame in 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.959
 diverse 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:56.580
 but you can not expect it to not react 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.580
 the companion of a lady 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.370
 against nature but I also 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.290
 I think that is to say it is exactly in one country 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:08.300
 like this other day the gun pulls you out 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.950
 as we saw a few weeks ago with the 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.020
 guys from a truck that shoot him 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.010
 to another for simply being there 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.230
 arguing 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.030
 I think that of course you can if you go with 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.459
 your partner with your cousin with women 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.350
 elements that happens to make you of 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.020
 words but I imagine that there will be 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.540
 gone maybe to the blows and then there yes 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.390
 and also leaving a bar I do not know at 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.640
 three in the morning with drinks and all that 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.990
 anything can happen and I think that 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.630
 there are times when of course one 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.670
 have to demand respect for women 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.530
 with which you go with women in 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.080
 general but there should also be 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.450
 prudence in such a medium 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.580
 violence like the one we are living 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.729
 here in mexico the pse 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.879
 tavo muciÃ±o remember in guadalajara 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:58.319
 that also coming out of a bar 

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:01.259
 they shoot forcing him to at home 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.979
 on his knees from there and the other one is the 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.979
 cabins 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.759
 that was also a mess of a woman 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.279
 to which apparently he was piropeando 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:21.569
 or something told him and that's where they give him the 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:23.339
 bullet was not something the Uruguayan is the 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.229
 player who this region the savior 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:27.120
 cabins shoot him in the head 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:29.550
 supposedly because nothing else fell 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:35.149
 wrong or not shot but does not die 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:35.149
 Survive because they were already in the bathroom 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:45.149
 of soccer because it seems that he had put 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:47.729
 your voice claims something but learns one 

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:50.279
 there are women who earn 20 compliments 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.789
 entering the club and no way to walk 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.760
 with 20 individuals entering still without 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:57.840
 glasses 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:02.580
 and then inside and then leaving, then, not 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.580
 what happened to them brick to brick 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:11.010
 that the one in jail for killing 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:14.010
 A compadre need to sing us the 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.010
 jail 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.830
 but it was a tradition of brick and 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:24.950
 the android tradition 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:28.670
 is propagated with the woman or not her 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:30.230
 promised not if you want we put it now 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.930
 distance and where the children are 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:36.210
 that they extract from 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.990
 fills me with short fuse the brick there 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:42.550
 what to say 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:47.710
 because that's how things were arranged in 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.720
 good law good I think that duels do not 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.100
 I think at some point 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.840
 there is an anecdote I think that with 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.660
 Artemio de Valle Arizpe this famous 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.910
 chronicler of the early 20th century who 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.300
 for some reason they challenge them to 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.830
 duel and then he almost to get there 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:10.660
 the day of the duel say say to me 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:13.190
 opponent who gives me for dead the most 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:18.380
 famous 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:23.120
 mourning was solved in peace because the one that 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:25.930
 he had to choose the weapons he said we 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:29.680
 we sat both in a powder keg 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.680
 we light the wick 

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.270
 and whoever stays at the last earns well
