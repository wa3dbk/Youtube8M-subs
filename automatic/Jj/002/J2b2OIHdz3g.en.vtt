gaff<00:00:53.510> now<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.899> slide<00:00:55.230> around<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.520> nice

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
gaff now we slide around here and nice

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
gaff now we slide around here and nice
little<00:00:57.690> boost<00:00:57.899> track<00:00:58.680> splits<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.430> end

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
little boost track splits so you can end

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.459 
little boost track splits so you can end
up<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> floor<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:01.020> still<00:01:01.260> go

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
up on the floor there and still go

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.830 
up on the floor there and still go
around<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.820> optimum<00:01:03.239> path<00:01:03.510> is

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
around but the the optimum path is

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840 
around but the the optimum path is
through<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> plane<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.489> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.670> slide

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
through the plane and you can slide

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.100 
through the plane and you can slide
around<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.119> corner<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.510> pick<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.689> some<00:01:06.840> coins

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
around the corner to pick up some coins

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.990 
around the corner to pick up some coins
the<00:01:07.380> coins<00:01:07.590> give<00:01:07.799> you<00:01:07.950> extra<00:01:08.640> little<00:01:08.820> bit<00:01:08.909> of

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
the coins give you extra little bit of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.420 
the coins give you extra little bit of
speed<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.990> tiny<00:01:10.200> little<00:01:10.470> bit<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.070> we<00:01:11.340> have

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
speed just a tiny little bit and we have

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.100 
speed just a tiny little bit and we have
a<00:01:11.460> flying<00:01:11.760> section<00:01:12.210> down<00:01:12.360> which<00:01:12.510> have<00:01:12.689> control

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a flying section down which have control

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.630 
a flying section down which have control
there<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.830> get<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.070> bit<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> extra

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
there but you can get a bit of extra

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
there but you can get a bit of extra
distance<00:01:14.820> if<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.869> time<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.350> right<00:01:16.590> and

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
distance if you time it just right and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
distance if you time it just right and
obviously<00:01:17.490> jump<00:01:17.790> off<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.540> end<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
obviously jump off the end of the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560 
obviously jump off the end of the
platform<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> then<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.790> we're<00:01:21.180> gonna<00:01:21.270> fly

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
platform and then here we're gonna fly

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.100 
platform and then here we're gonna fly
down<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.920> bottom<00:01:23.659> coins<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:24.960> to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
down to the bottom coins there to

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.819 
down to the bottom coins there to
collect<00:01:25.229> again<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.390> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.720> cut<00:01:28.560> through

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
collect again and you can cut through

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.340 
collect again and you can cut through
here<00:01:29.430> with<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> couple<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.570> boosts<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.200> get

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
here with a couple of boosts you can get

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.560 
here with a couple of boosts you can get
across<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.950> baggage<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.549> nicely<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.420> don't

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
across the baggage here nicely and don't

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.330 
across the baggage here nicely and don't
really<00:01:33.960> even<00:01:34.320> need<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> mushroom<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
really even need a mushroom for that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.310 
really even need a mushroom for that
because<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> boost<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:37.079> jump

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
because you can get a boost on the jump

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.770 
because you can get a boost on the jump
and<00:01:37.590> that's<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:39.060> sunshine<00:01:39.450> Airport

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and that's it for sunshine Airport

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
and that's it for sunshine Airport
there's<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.560> much<00:01:40.770> else<00:01:40.829> going<00:01:41.430> on

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
there's not really much else going on

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.649 
there's not really much else going on
there<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> can<00:01:41.880> probably<00:01:42.030> cut<00:01:42.299> across<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
there you can probably cut across the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.380 
there you can probably cut across the
grass<00:01:42.869> just<00:01:43.140> before<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:44.390> baggage

for this now here's the first bit where
we<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.430> a<00:02:29.459> branch<00:02:29.790> in<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.299> path<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.620> best

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
we get a branch in the path and the best

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.400 
we get a branch in the path and the best
ways<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.849> go<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.299> off<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.959> right<00:02:34.140> so<00:02:34.319> you

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.170 
challenging in parts so you start off
and<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:49.670> go<00:03:49.849> to<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.840> air<00:03:51.049> and<00:03:51.920> glide<00:03:52.400> in<00:03:52.760> down

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
and you go to the air and glide in down

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.259 
and you go to the air and glide in down
here<00:03:53.769> I'll<00:03:54.769> sneak<00:03:55.280> over<00:03:55.489> a<00:03:55.700> bit<00:03:55.910> of<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.060> track

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
here I'll sneak over a bit of the track

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.420 
here I'll sneak over a bit of the track
there<00:03:56.450> there's<00:03:57.319> a<00:03:57.410> slight<00:03:57.769> opportunity<00:03:58.250> there

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
there there's a slight opportunity there

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.650 
there there's a slight opportunity there
to<00:03:58.459> croute<00:03:58.880> the<00:03:59.000> corner<00:03:59.299> if<00:03:59.360> you've<00:03:59.480> got<00:03:59.630> a

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
to croute the corner if you've got a

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.170 
to croute the corner if you've got a
boost<00:03:59.959> but<00:04:00.590> not<00:04:00.860> much<00:04:01.099> and<00:04:01.519> then<00:04:02.060> we're

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
boost but not much and then we're

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.800 
boost but not much and then we're
sliding<00:04:02.360> around

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
sliding around

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.059 
sliding around
antigrav<00:04:03.170> style<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:05.079> hit<00:04:06.079> those<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.680> recover

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:07.069 
antigrav style and hit those and recover

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:08.650 
antigrav style and hit those and recover
boosters<00:04:07.370> if<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.579> can<00:04:07.849> to<00:04:08.120> get<00:04:08.239> some<00:04:08.390> extra

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
boosters if you can to get some extra

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.960 
boosters if you can to get some extra
speed<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.200> there's<00:04:09.319> one<00:04:09.500> on<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.400> entrance<00:04:10.760> to

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
speed and there's one on the entrance to

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.360 
speed and there's one on the entrance to
this<00:04:11.090> split<00:04:11.480> in<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.900> road<00:04:12.709> where<00:04:13.130> you've<00:04:13.250> got

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
this split in the road where you've got

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.090 
this split in the road where you've got
green<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.060> pink<00:04:14.360> paths<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.989> tend<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.769> the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
green and pink paths I tend to like the

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.030 
green and pink paths I tend to like the
pink<00:04:16.549> path<00:04:16.790> ahead<00:04:17.239> of<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.450> green<00:04:17.750> again<00:04:18.470> think

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
pink path ahead of the green again think

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.210 
pink path ahead of the green again think
it<00:04:19.220> lines<00:04:19.820> you<00:04:20.060> up<00:04:20.150> nicely<00:04:20.389> for<00:04:20.780> things

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
it lines you up nicely for things

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.000 
it lines you up nicely for things
towards<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.400> end<00:04:22.550> adds<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.450> little<00:04:23.630> bit<00:04:24.010> easier

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
towards the end adds a little bit easier

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.879 
towards the end adds a little bit easier
to<00:04:25.070> hold<00:04:25.370> -<00:04:25.700> I<00:04:25.729> find<00:04:26.270> certainly<00:04:26.870> down<00:04:27.620> the

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
to hold - I find certainly down the

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.890 
to hold - I find certainly down the
green<00:04:28.250> path<00:04:28.490> you<00:04:28.729> get<00:04:28.910> a<00:04:28.970> nice<00:04:29.150> slide<00:04:29.600> around

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
green path you get a nice slide around

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.719 
green path you get a nice slide around
there<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:30.500> you've<00:04:30.620> got<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.220> jump<00:04:31.520> and

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
there and then you've got the jump and

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.029 
there and then you've got the jump and
you'll<00:04:31.820> see<00:04:32.000> that<00:04:32.150> that<00:04:32.419> particular<00:04:33.200> jump<00:04:33.740> on

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
you'll see that that particular jump on

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:35.920 
you'll see that that particular jump on
the<00:04:34.220> pink<00:04:34.430> path<00:04:34.610> is<00:04:34.789> ever<00:04:35.419> so<00:04:35.660> slightly

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
the pink path is ever so slightly

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.680 
the pink path is ever so slightly
further<00:04:36.320> forward<00:04:36.830> then<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.880> the<00:04:38.300> green<00:04:38.510> one

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
further forward then the the green one

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.090 
further forward then the the green one
obviously<00:04:39.110> if<00:04:39.260> you've<00:04:39.410> got<00:04:39.560> boost<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:39.979> can

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
obviously if you've got boost you can

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.590 
obviously if you've got boost you can
also<00:04:40.220> cut<00:04:40.520> across<00:04:40.729> here<00:04:40.970> through<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.360> pipes

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
also cut across here through the pipes

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.810 
also cut across here through the pipes
look<00:04:42.440> for<00:04:42.590> those<00:04:42.710> areas<00:04:42.919> with<00:04:43.250> the<00:04:43.340> pipes<00:04:43.550> and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
look for those areas with the pipes and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.890 
look for those areas with the pipes and
the<00:04:43.970> off-road<00:04:44.240> section<00:04:44.600> because<00:04:44.780> that's

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
the off-road section because that's

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.810 
the off-road section because that's
always<00:04:45.169> a<00:04:45.350> good<00:04:45.560> place<00:04:45.800> to<00:04:46.190> boost<00:04:46.490> through

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
always a good place to boost through

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.270 
always a good place to boost through
especially<00:04:47.000> on<00:04:47.330> those<00:04:47.539> time<00:04:47.930> trials<00:04:48.410> so<00:04:49.039> next

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
especially on those time trials so next

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.090 
especially on those time trials so next
up<00:04:49.600> possibly<00:04:50.600> my<00:04:50.840> favourite<00:04:51.260> course<00:04:51.470> at<00:04:51.860> the

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
up possibly my favourite course at the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.779 
up possibly my favourite course at the
entire<00:04:52.370> game<00:04:52.700> and<00:04:52.940> that's<00:04:53.479> Mount<00:04:53.870> hua<00:04:54.080> Rio<00:04:54.789> now

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
entire game and that's Mount hua Rio now

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:58.360 
entire game and that's Mount hua Rio now
this<00:04:56.060> track<00:04:56.389> doesn't<00:04:56.960> have<00:04:57.229> any<00:04:57.380> laps<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:57.950> is<00:04:58.160> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
this track doesn't have any laps it is a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.500 
this track doesn't have any laps it is a
straight<00:04:58.729> downhill<00:04:59.210> race<00:05:00.700> so<00:05:01.700> no<00:05:02.030> repeated

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
straight downhill race so no repeated

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.629 
straight downhill race so no repeated
sections<00:05:03.050> so<00:05:03.889> you're<00:05:04.010> gonna<00:05:04.130> see<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.400> whole

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
sections so you're gonna see the whole

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.360 
sections so you're gonna see the whole
thing<00:05:04.669> now<00:05:05.180> we'll<00:05:06.139> show<00:05:06.350> you<00:05:06.380> where<00:05:07.010> we<00:05:07.160> can

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
thing now we'll show you where we can

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.000 
thing now we'll show you where we can
where<00:05:08.300> there<00:05:08.479> might<00:05:08.630> be<00:05:08.690> places<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.380> gain<00:05:09.620> some

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
where there might be places to gain some

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:13.360 
where there might be places to gain some
time<00:05:11.349> so<00:05:12.349> as<00:05:12.500> far<00:05:12.680> as<00:05:12.800> I'm<00:05:12.889> aware<00:05:12.950> the<00:05:13.220> right

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
time so as far as I'm aware the right

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.480 
time so as far as I'm aware the right
ending<00:05:13.639> well<00:05:14.389> I've<00:05:14.660> really<00:05:15.349> any<00:05:15.710> shortcuts

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
ending well I've really any shortcuts

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.640 
ending well I've really any shortcuts
per<00:05:16.700> se<00:05:16.970> in<00:05:17.240> this<00:05:17.630> but<00:05:18.349> there<00:05:18.500> are<00:05:18.530> some

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
per se in this but there are some

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.990 
per se in this but there are some
branching<00:05:19.400> paths<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:20.419> take<00:05:20.599> note<00:05:20.840> of<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:22.250> we

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
branching paths to take note of so we

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.550 
branching paths to take note of so we
get<00:05:23.240> dropped<00:05:23.479> out<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.810> plane<00:05:24.020> and<00:05:24.320> we're

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
get dropped out the plane and we're

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.670 
get dropped out the plane and we're
straight<00:05:24.919> into<00:05:25.160> the<00:05:25.250> action<00:05:25.660> on<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:27.260> top<00:05:27.470> of

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
straight into the action on the top of

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.469 
straight into the action on the top of
this<00:05:28.030> mountain<00:05:29.030> peak

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 
this mountain peak

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:32.180 
this mountain peak
we<00:05:30.810> get<00:05:30.960> a<00:05:30.990> little<00:05:31.199> boost<00:05:31.440> here<00:05:31.710> from<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:31.919> jump

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
we get a little boost here from the jump

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.800 
we get a little boost here from the jump
and<00:05:32.370> there's<00:05:32.699> options<00:05:32.970> to<00:05:33.270> slide<00:05:33.449> round<00:05:33.659> you

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
and there's options to slide round you

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.330 
and there's options to slide round you
can<00:05:33.900> slide<00:05:34.080> around<00:05:34.199> the<00:05:34.349> top<00:05:34.530> and<00:05:34.919> you<00:05:35.159> get<00:05:35.310> a

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
can slide around the top and you get a

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.520 
can slide around the top and you get a
nice<00:05:35.490> little<00:05:35.669> jump<00:05:36.030> off<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.840> top<00:05:37.110> there<00:05:37.319> with

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
nice little jump off the top there with

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.260 
nice little jump off the top there with
an<00:05:37.620> extra<00:05:37.919> boost<00:05:38.129> I've<00:05:38.729> got<00:05:38.909> on<00:05:39.060> the<00:05:39.120> bottom

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
an extra boost I've got on the bottom

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.790 
an extra boost I've got on the bottom
and<00:05:39.509> you<00:05:39.569> can<00:05:39.599> see<00:05:39.720> round<00:05:40.110> the<00:05:40.229> top<00:05:40.379> here<00:05:40.560> again

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
and you can see round the top here again

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.279 
and you can see round the top here again
and<00:05:41.520> slide<00:05:41.909> round<00:05:42.389> and<00:05:42.659> use<00:05:42.780> these<00:05:42.930> boots<00:05:43.199> now

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
and slide round and use these boots now

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:44.899 
and slide round and use these boots now
this<00:05:43.409> is<00:05:43.560> very<00:05:43.740> tricky<00:05:44.069> she's<00:05:44.310> been<00:05:44.460> come<00:05:44.729> off

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909 
this is very tricky she's been come off

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:46.760 
this is very tricky she's been come off
you've<00:05:45.240> got<00:05:45.569> immediately<00:05:46.169> get<00:05:46.319> into<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.590> power

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
slide otherwise you're gonna go right

I love these windy icy turns on Mount
hua<00:05:53.849> Rio<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.479> then<00:05:55.229> we<00:05:55.319> go<00:05:55.500> anti-gravity<00:05:55.979> so

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
hua Rio and then we go anti-gravity so

picking up the coins jumping off here if
you<00:05:58.919> can<00:05:59.129> to<00:05:59.250> get<00:05:59.340> the<00:05:59.460> boost<00:05:59.669> I<00:05:59.849> didn't<00:06:00.120> manage

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
you can to get the boost I didn't manage

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.629 
you can to get the boost I didn't manage
to<00:06:00.360> nail<00:06:00.599> it<00:06:00.629> and<00:06:00.840> then<00:06:01.620> we're<00:06:01.889> gonna<00:06:02.039> hit<00:06:02.370> a

00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 
to nail it and then we're gonna hit a

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:05.059 
to nail it and then we're gonna hit a
ramp<00:06:03.120> to<00:06:03.270> get<00:06:03.509> air<00:06:03.840> as<00:06:04.199> a<00:06:04.259> couple<00:06:04.620> of<00:06:04.710> boosts

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:05.069 
ramp to get air as a couple of boosts

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.629 
ramp to get air as a couple of boosts
there<00:06:05.310> which<00:06:06.270> you<00:06:06.449> can<00:06:06.659> land<00:06:06.960> on<00:06:07.199> now<00:06:08.190> I<00:06:08.219> nail

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
there which you can land on now I nail

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.790 
there which you can land on now I nail
one<00:06:08.909> there<00:06:09.180> and<00:06:09.599> that<00:06:09.750> gives<00:06:09.960> me<00:06:10.139> an<00:06:10.349> extra<00:06:10.560> bit

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
one there and that gives me an extra bit

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.649 
one there and that gives me an extra bit
of<00:06:10.830> air<00:06:11.069> and<00:06:11.280> then<00:06:11.789> we're<00:06:12.330> gonna<00:06:12.419> hit<00:06:12.569> this

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
of air and then we're gonna hit this

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:17.119 
of air and then we're gonna hit this
boost<00:06:12.960> here<00:06:13.319> and<00:06:14.159> we're<00:06:14.849> inside<00:06:15.979> swing<00:06:16.979> him

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
boost here and we're inside swing him

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.499 
boost here and we're inside swing him
round<00:06:17.310> there<00:06:17.639> with<00:06:17.789> some<00:06:17.940> power<00:06:18.180> slides

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:18.509 
round there with some power slides

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:21.709 
round there with some power slides
before<00:06:19.289> we<00:06:19.469> come<00:06:19.620> out<00:06:19.710> into<00:06:19.919> section<00:06:20.639> of<00:06:20.849> water

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
before we come out into section of water

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.080 
before we come out into section of water
and<00:06:22.229> with<00:06:22.440> boosts<00:06:23.219> so<00:06:23.490> if<00:06:23.580> you<00:06:23.669> can<00:06:23.819> try<00:06:23.969> and

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
and with boosts so if you can try and

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.930 
and with boosts so if you can try and
time<00:06:24.419> this<00:06:24.629> right<00:06:24.810> nail<00:06:25.319> these<00:06:25.650> don't<00:06:26.580> think

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
time this right nail these don't think

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.610 
time this right nail these don't think
I'm<00:06:27.000> going<00:06:27.120> to<00:06:27.210> manage<00:06:27.449> it<00:06:27.629> no<00:06:27.840> not<00:06:28.259> quite<00:06:28.469> but

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
I'm going to manage it no not quite but

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.800 
I'm going to manage it no not quite but
I've<00:06:28.889> got<00:06:29.009> a<00:06:29.039> couple<00:06:29.190> of<00:06:29.370> them<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:29.669> then<00:06:30.509> we're

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
I've got a couple of them and then we're

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:32.779 
I've got a couple of them and then we're
off<00:06:31.259> for<00:06:31.680> another<00:06:31.830> jump<00:06:32.129> I'm<00:06:32.310> gonna<00:06:32.460> get<00:06:32.639> hit

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
off for another jump I'm gonna get hit

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.879 
off for another jump I'm gonna get hit
here<00:06:33.000> red<00:06:33.330> shell<00:06:34.759> don't<00:06:36.050> avoid<00:06:37.050> it<00:06:37.319> so<00:06:37.590> far

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889 
here red shell don't avoid it so far

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:40.640 
here red shell don't avoid it so far
okay<00:06:38.250> so<00:06:38.990> branches<00:06:39.990> off<00:06:40.139> to<00:06:40.169> left<00:06:40.500> and<00:06:40.590> right

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
okay so branches off to left and right

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.040 
okay so branches off to left and right
and<00:06:40.860> then<00:06:40.919> that<00:06:41.219> branches<00:06:41.729> again<00:06:42.029> I<00:06:42.240> go<00:06:42.750> right

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
and then that branches again I go right

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.870 
and then that branches again I go right
and<00:06:43.319> right<00:06:43.770> because<00:06:44.099> you<00:06:44.190> get<00:06:44.310> that<00:06:44.460> booster

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
and right because you get that booster

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.430 
and right because you get that booster
pad<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.300> then<00:06:45.659> you've<00:06:45.779> got<00:06:45.930> these<00:06:46.080> tree

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
pad and then you've got these tree

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.990 
pad and then you've got these tree
stumps<00:06:46.770> which<00:06:46.919> you<00:06:47.069> can<00:06:47.219> get<00:06:47.310> boots<00:06:47.550> off<00:06:47.849> as

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
stumps which you can get boots off as

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.480 
stumps which you can get boots off as
well<00:06:48.240> I<00:06:48.479> think<00:06:49.259> that's<00:06:49.469> the<00:06:49.590> optimum<00:06:50.279> path

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:50.490 
well I think that's the optimum path

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:53.170 
well I think that's the optimum path
around<00:06:50.849> their<00:06:51.360> number<00:06:52.050> through<00:06:52.259> the<00:06:52.380> trees

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:53.180 
around their number through the trees

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.309 
around their number through the trees
quite<00:06:54.180> tricky<00:06:54.360> that<00:06:54.569> bit<00:06:54.750> and<00:06:54.900> annoying

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 
quite tricky that bit and annoying

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:56.659 
quite tricky that bit and annoying
because<00:06:55.409> you<00:06:55.590> tend<00:06:55.860> to<00:06:55.919> have<00:06:56.039> a<00:06:56.099> weapon<00:06:56.580> in

00:06:56.659 --> 00:06:56.669 
because you tend to have a weapon in

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:58.909 
because you tend to have a weapon in
hand<00:06:56.849> and<00:06:57.180> it's<00:06:57.599> really<00:06:57.930> difficult<00:06:58.199> to<00:06:58.469> use<00:06:58.770> it

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
hand and it's really difficult to use it

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.709 
hand and it's really difficult to use it
not<00:06:59.159> not<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.520> easiest<00:06:59.729> place<00:06:59.879> and<00:07:00.509> look<00:07:00.629> at

00:07:00.709 --> 00:07:00.719 
not not the easiest place and look at

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:03.019 
not not the easiest place and look at
these<00:07:00.779> big<00:07:01.020> ramps<00:07:01.440> on<00:07:01.620> the<00:07:01.860> slalom<00:07:02.159> slope<00:07:02.550> and

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:03.029 
these big ramps on the slalom slope and

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:06.649 
these big ramps on the slalom slope and
they<00:07:03.150> give<00:07:03.330> you<00:07:03.449> extra<00:07:03.900> boosts<00:07:04.969> why<00:07:05.969> Indy<00:07:06.360> path

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:06.659 
they give you extra boosts why Indy path

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:08.149 
they give you extra boosts why Indy path
through<00:07:07.020> here<00:07:07.349> don't<00:07:07.650> think<00:07:07.860> you<00:07:07.919> get<00:07:08.009> any

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:08.159 
through here don't think you get any

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:09.680 
through here don't think you get any
boost<00:07:08.400> thought<00:07:08.789> going<00:07:09.090> through<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.509> flight

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
boost thought going through the flight

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:11.629 
boost thought going through the flight
or<00:07:09.870> anything<00:07:10.050> nice<00:07:10.710> blue<00:07:10.919> shell<00:07:11.159> there<00:07:11.370> slow

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 
or anything nice blue shell there slow

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.019 
or anything nice blue shell there slow
me<00:07:11.789> down<00:07:12.919> so<00:07:13.919> yeah<00:07:14.460> and<00:07:14.580> don't<00:07:14.759> think<00:07:14.849> there's

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:15.029 
me down so yeah and don't think there's

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:16.159 
me down so yeah and don't think there's
only<00:07:15.120> booster<00:07:15.479> going<00:07:15.659> through<00:07:15.779> the<00:07:15.840> flanks

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169 
only booster going through the flanks

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.800 
only booster going through the flanks
but<00:07:16.319> then<00:07:16.440> we've<00:07:16.590> got<00:07:16.800> this<00:07:16.949> some<00:07:17.810> Daniel

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:18.810 
but then we've got this some Daniel

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.480 
but then we've got this some Daniel

nice<00:07:32.349> jump<00:07:32.770> going<00:07:33.520> to<00:07:33.639> air<00:07:33.849> going<00:07:34.509> through

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:34.780 
nice jump going to air going through

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.450 
nice jump going to air going through
these<00:07:34.930> hoops<00:07:35.259> to<00:07:35.469> get<00:07:35.560> that<00:07:35.710> extra<00:07:36.099> speed

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:36.460
