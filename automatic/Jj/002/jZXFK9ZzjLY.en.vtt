Collings D s 2h with medium gauge
strings<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:11.849> Collings<00:00:12.630> triple<00:00:13.349> o<00:00:13.469> 2h<00:00:13.769> with

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
strings and a Collings triple o 2h with

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.460 
strings and a Collings triple o 2h with
light<00:00:14.969> strings<00:00:15.360> both<00:00:16.730> d'addario's<00:00:18.470> question

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
light strings both d'addario's question

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.109 
light strings both d'addario's question
has<00:00:19.590> been<00:00:19.740> raised<00:00:20.039> about<00:00:20.279> which<00:00:20.670> one<00:00:20.880> might<00:00:21.090> be

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
has been raised about which one might be

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.630 
has been raised about which one might be
best<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.539> finger<00:00:21.900> picking<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.400> thought

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
best for finger picking and so I thought

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
best for finger picking and so I thought
I'd<00:00:23.820> do<00:00:23.970> much<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.390> same<00:00:24.570> sort<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.869> thing<00:00:25.109> on

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
I'd do much the same sort of thing on

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.980 
I'd do much the same sort of thing on
both<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:26.340> let<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.670> hear<00:00:26.910> I'm<00:00:27.269> doing<00:00:27.840> this

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
both to let you hear I'm doing this

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.400 
both to let you hear I'm doing this
through<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> basic<00:00:28.859> q3<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:32.149> well<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:34.170> your

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
through a basic q3 and well it's your

00:00:34.410 --> 00:01:06.719 
through a basic q3 and well it's your
opinion

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.640 

that's<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:07.910> ds2<00:01:08.270> H<00:01:08.840> with<00:01:10.720> Daddario<00:01:11.720> uj7<00:01:12.290> teams

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
that's the ds2 H with Daddario uj7 teams

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.120 
that's the ds2 H with Daddario uj7 teams
but<00:01:12.860> it<00:01:12.920> might<00:01:13.220> be<00:01:13.520> an<00:01:13.760> e<00:01:14.030> this<00:01:14.720> is<00:01:15.050> the<00:01:15.800> triple

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
but it might be an e this is the triple

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.290 
but it might be an e this is the triple
o<00:01:16.280> 2h<00:01:17.050> both<00:01:18.050> stock<00:01:18.380> either<00:01:18.680> way<00:01:18.890> with<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:20.060> very

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
o 2h both stock either way with on very

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:53.630 
o 2h both stock either way with on very
ej6<00:01:20.780> knees

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.870 

once<00:01:54.640> again<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.930> ds2<00:01:56.229> H<00:01:56.560> stem<00:01:57.159> sounds<00:01:57.700> like

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
once again the ds2 H stem sounds like

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:34.300 
once again the ds2 H stem sounds like
this

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.680 

and<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:37.010> triple<00:02:38.010> Oh<00:02:38.099> two-inch<00:02:38.540> sounds<00:02:39.540> like

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and the triple Oh two-inch sounds like

00:02:39.690 --> 00:03:16.120 
and the triple Oh two-inch sounds like
this

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.449 

so<00:03:17.130> that's<00:03:17.370> just<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.730> brief<00:03:18.920> comparison<00:03:19.920> like

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
so that's just a brief comparison like

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.450 
so that's just a brief comparison like
the<00:03:20.640> like<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:21.030> hope<00:03:21.209> that's<00:03:21.390> helpful
