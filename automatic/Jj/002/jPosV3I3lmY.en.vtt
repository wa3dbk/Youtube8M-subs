00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:26.369
 I slept a day with him and here I have these 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:32.009
 showed the charms that supposedly I passed 9000 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.659
 meters now so by the way he programm 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.659
 Ajabun will download us in the appstore 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.220

 seven kilometers 1670 16 100 kilometers 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.180
 92 percent movement target i.e. when 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.490
 you do pump up the programm guy 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 makes writing your weight height and so 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.670
 further and then program to calculate 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.189
 how much do you need to go for 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.299
 the whole day I have the duration of step 1 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.489
 hour 30 minutes 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.530
 total consumption as kilocalories 2 2634 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:15.730
 record 49 minutes walked active consumption 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.620
 606 people calories record alone 2:29 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.780
 consumption alone nineteen 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.019
 sixty five calories also we have it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:27.850
 may show a dream that is this 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:30.880
 programs point and wot dream it is written that I 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.560
 slept 9:47 is one hundred twenty two percent 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.310
 that is, I slept more though they 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.250
 calculated 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.980
 but you could sleep for eight hours 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.170
 here you can see the chart here 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.180
 move time writes on the same schedule 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:48.400
 I could also move my light 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 sleep 5:29 deep 4:18 fell asleep in 30 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.150
 minutes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.370
 also awake for 30 minutes and slept for 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.650
 10 hours 17 minutes I was awakened 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.890
 i don't know i kind of woke up but maybe 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.140
 be he did not count but generally give you 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.200
 I'll tell you about the jargon and generally excellent 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.200
 thing 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:17.470
 with oars on the vadik brought the following 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.280
 and the following next nyashka protect 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:24.760
 We remove the boxes and the next one is 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 there will be a light connector for 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.950
 este cards that is like a camera connection 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.110
 kit only for iphone 5 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.130
 for me that's just such a way 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.740
 which is all working in him 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.020
 I tried throwing pictures and so on 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.510
 that is, quite from the extra here such 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.420
 a book that is everything you need for a person 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.530
 who if combo 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:56.050
 the next thing is a polo clip on the case 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.030
 him there must be pieces of paper inside but I 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.220
 already all disclosed for it can can not 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.070

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:11.110
 way dad here they themselves are papers 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:15.600
 I don't need them from the laser itself 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.600
 teeth are not laser 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:23.140
 log clip itself is small and here it is 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.770
 big they all close such here 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:28.150
 covers and cover become a gift 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.970
 the science of it has been a reverse interfered with this 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.440
