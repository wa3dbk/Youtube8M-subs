00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
months and then watching all these

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.890 
months and then watching all these
videos<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.670> then<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
videos about it and then when you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.969

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
eventually come to play a couple of

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.010 
eventually come to play a couple of
months<00:01:26.189> later<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.670> not<00:01:26.850> really<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.600> big<00:01:27.960> thing

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
months later it's not really a big thing

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.149 
months later it's not really a big thing
anymore<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.040> there<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.970> it'll<00:01:30.570> cost

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
anymore is it but there we go it'll cost

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
1200 Microsoft Points which I believe is

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.840 
1200 Microsoft Points which I believe is
equivalent<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:33.990> 15<00:01:34.200> dollars<00:01:34.860> which<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
equivalent to 15 dollars which is a lot

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
equivalent to 15 dollars which is a lot
of<00:01:35.939> money<00:01:36.119> not<00:01:37.049> too<00:01:37.380> sure<00:01:37.590> if<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:37.770> more<00:01:38.130> than

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
of money not too sure if it's more than

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.370 
of money not too sure if it's more than
the<00:01:38.430> last<00:01:38.610> map<00:01:38.850> pack<00:01:39.060> or<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:40.110> sounds

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
so I want to try out basically it's a

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.590 
so I want to try out basically it's a
pitch<00:03:15.940> where<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.930> saw<00:03:17.430> die<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.940> corner<00:03:19.390> and

pitch where you saw die in a corner and

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.720 
pitch where you saw die in a corner and
then<00:03:19.810> after<00:03:20.200> you've<00:03:20.320> died<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:21.549> know<00:03:21.640> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
then after you've died and you know the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.150 
then after you've died and you know the
power-ups<00:03:22.150> you<00:03:22.209> can<00:03:22.360> get<00:03:22.510> like<00:03:22.720> x<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.320> max<00:03:23.799> ammo

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
power-ups you can get like x to max ammo

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.390 
power-ups you can get like x to max ammo
all<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.810> once<00:03:25.810> you've<00:03:25.989> died<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.400> revived

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
all of that once you've died and revived

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.240 
all of that once you've died and revived
by<00:03:27.640> your<00:03:27.790> third<00:03:28.030> teammate<00:03:28.510> you<00:03:29.470> get<00:03:29.680> bigger

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
by your third teammate you get bigger

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.289 
by your third teammate you get bigger
chance<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.910> getting<00:03:31.680> those<00:03:32.680> power-ups

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
chance of getting those power-ups

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.210 
chance of getting those power-ups
apparently<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.330> mean<00:03:34.690> he<00:03:35.230> says<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.560> works<00:03:35.769> and

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
apparently I mean he says it works and

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.009 
apparently I mean he says it works and
he<00:03:36.549> doesn't<00:03:36.700> sound<00:03:37.150> like<00:03:37.239> it<00:03:37.360> lying<00:03:37.600> so

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
he doesn't sound like it lying so
