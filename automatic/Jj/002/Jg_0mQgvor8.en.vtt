proportions the French proportion is all
equal<00:01:14.760> parts<00:01:15.060> I'm<00:01:15.270> using<00:01:15.479> quality

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
equal parts I'm using quality

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.530 
equal parts I'm using quality
ingredients<00:01:16.619> with<00:01:16.830> mine<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> allows<00:01:18.210> each

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
ingredients with mine so it allows each

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.420 
ingredients with mine so it allows each
ingredient<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.380> express<00:01:19.770> itself<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
ingredient to express itself in the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.640 
ingredient to express itself in the
drink<00:01:20.700> if<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.180> don't<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.780> orange<00:01:22.560> liqueur

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
drink if you don't have orange liqueur

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
drink if you don't have orange liqueur

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that's that creative equality you can

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.630 
that's that creative equality you can
use<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> little<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.439> more<00:01:25.619> lemon<00:01:25.860> juice<00:01:26.040> and

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640

so it vacuum seals in there I think it

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.760
