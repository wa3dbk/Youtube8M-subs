the<00:03:46.760> front<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.480> in<00:03:47.930> my<00:03:48.079> opinion<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.560> think<00:03:48.769> you

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
the front so in my opinion I think you

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.530 
the front so in my opinion I think you
should<00:03:49.010> go<00:03:49.130> ahead<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.400> sew<00:03:49.549> on<00:03:49.579> a<00:03:49.819> comb<00:03:50.510> with

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
should go ahead and sew on a comb with

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.150 
should go ahead and sew on a comb with
two<00:03:50.959> in<00:03:51.139> the<00:03:51.200> back<00:03:51.380> just<00:03:51.590> to<00:03:51.680> be<00:03:51.799> on<00:03:51.889> the<00:03:51.920> safe

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
two in the back just to be on the safe

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.580 
two in the back just to be on the safe
