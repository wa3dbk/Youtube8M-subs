hopefully you can say that will see
their<00:04:26.860> gears<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.370> stuff<00:04:30.960> when<00:04:31.960> you're<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.680> corn

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
their gears and stuff when you're a corn

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:36.480 
their gears and stuff when you're a corn
in<00:04:33.160> there<00:04:33.310> closes<00:04:34.180> in<00:04:34.360> their<00:04:34.539> ear<00:04:35.430> okay<00:04:36.430> you

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
in there closes in their ear okay you

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.860 
in there closes in their ear okay you
can<00:04:36.640> see<00:04:36.850> just<00:04:37.090> got<00:04:37.300> picked<00:04:37.510> up<00:04:37.630> by<00:04:37.690> the

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
can see just got picked up by the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.810 
can see just got picked up by the
mechanism<00:04:38.470> now<00:04:38.830> it's<00:04:39.010> just<00:04:39.160> not<00:04:39.430> spinning

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
mechanism now it's just not spinning

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.860 
mechanism now it's just not spinning
right<00:04:39.910> now<00:04:39.940> otherwise<00:04:40.210> we've<00:04:40.510> been<00:04:40.660> doing

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
right now otherwise we've been doing

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.250 
right now otherwise we've been doing
this<00:04:41.039> so<00:04:42.039> right<00:04:42.190> here<00:04:42.490> this<00:04:42.669> is<00:04:43.419> a<00:04:43.570> spring<00:04:44.050> what

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
this so right here this is a spring what

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.360 
this so right here this is a spring what
happen<00:04:44.560> is<00:04:44.650> it<00:04:44.830> pushes<00:04:45.220> the<00:04:45.340> corn<00:04:45.639> up<00:04:46.510> against

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
happen is it pushes the corn up against

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.010 
happen is it pushes the corn up against
there's<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.580> one<00:04:48.880> special<00:04:49.330> gear<00:04:49.660> here<00:04:49.900> it's

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
there's this one special gear here it's

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.650 
there's this one special gear here it's
got<00:04:50.110> teeth<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:50.740> that<00:04:50.860> pulls<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.280> in<00:04:51.400> and<00:04:51.660> you

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
got teeth in it that pulls it in and you

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.850 
got teeth in it that pulls it in and you
can<00:04:52.810> see<00:04:53.020> the<00:04:53.050> spiked<00:04:53.410> wheel<00:04:53.620> right<00:04:53.830> here

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 
can see the spiked wheel right here

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.700 
can see the spiked wheel right here
comes<00:04:54.729> all<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:54.940> way<00:04:55.030> up<00:04:55.240> what<00:04:56.169> happens<00:04:56.500> is

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
comes all the way up what happens is

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.610 
comes all the way up what happens is
when<00:04:57.490> it<00:04:57.580> gets<00:04:57.610> spinning<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:59.410> can<00:04:59.530> actually

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
when it gets spinning you can actually

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.560 
when it gets spinning you can actually
see<00:04:59.800> the<00:05:00.100> ear<00:05:00.310> coordinator<00:05:00.940> being<00:05:01.090> pulled<00:05:01.389> in

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
see the ear coordinator being pulled in

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.690 
see the ear coordinator being pulled in
at<00:05:01.810> the<00:05:01.930> same<00:05:02.050> time<00:05:02.229> they<00:05:02.440> pulled<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:02.919> it's

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
at the same time they pulled in it's

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.390 
at the same time they pulled in it's
spinning<00:05:04.210> around<00:05:04.330> and<00:05:04.690> what<00:05:04.840> happens<00:05:05.169> is<00:05:05.400> will

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
spinning around and what happens is will

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.250 
spinning around and what happens is will
hear<00:05:06.610> all<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.789> teeth<00:05:07.120> rubs<00:05:07.570> up<00:05:07.720> against<00:05:08.139> it

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
hear all the teeth rubs up against it

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.550 
hear all the teeth rubs up against it
knocks<00:05:08.979> all<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.310> colonel<00:05:09.639> loose<00:05:10.169> and<00:05:11.169> once<00:05:11.380> it
