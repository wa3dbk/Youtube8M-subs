00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 good night friends of youtube like 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 are today I bring you a video for the 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.780
 tournament of danielle borja 1 in this case 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 it's a top 10 something that I do not do much but 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.889
 I hope you enjoy it good in this 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.949
 case is the best games of mario 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.050
 good bros all we will ever have 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.400
 played any of these classic games 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.439
 mario bros 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 undoubtedly the nintendo mascot is for 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.970
 me the best video game character 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 even surpassing sonic bomberman and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 others with nothing more to say let's start 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.940
 with the top position number 10 mario tennis 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 for wii perhaps many do not know the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.070
 game and they will be saying that shit does 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.170
 this game here so simple this game 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.329
 brings something unique that did not bring the others 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.789
 mario tennis games now in this 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.950
 game the wii command can be used as 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.079
 a tennis racket as if it were 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.300
 truth this game brings more or less of 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.699
 characters the game also has 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.100
 superpowers every time you throw strong 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.649
 the clear command not so strong because if 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.629
 you do not break the TV xp you make a power 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.850
 amazing each character has one 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.900
 different good you will wonder why 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.910
 I did not put this game 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.130
 one place higher for this innovation 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.380
 The simple thing is that it bores a 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.510
 little fast because despite Mode 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.200
 the racket after a while you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.790
 I was bored 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.730
 although it will bring you fun 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.190
 beginning in the exhibition mode 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.860
 placed number 9 mario and luigi companions 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.080
 in time for nintendo ds there are many 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.330
 games of this type in mario bros but 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.970
 I've only played 2 and of those 2 I prefer 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.250
 this undoubtedly with the nintendo ds the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 game is great story too 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.600
 is good also in a part we 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.640
 we found with mario and luigi of babies and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.890
 we have to spend it with them xd 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 making the game a little more difficult 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.810
 but fun in this game is also 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.200
 requires thinking talking with the touch x 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.540
 of position number 8 super mario bros 2 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.960
 but I'm not talking about the 3ds 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.970
 but the oldest hehe this game is 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
 here since this one is very unique and original 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.500
 since the gameplay is very different and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 a little more fun like now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.550
 you can grab things and throw them at 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.489
 enemies and can also be opened 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.470
 doors with many x positions 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.450
 catalog this game as the worst 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 'Mario Bros' because it's different haha 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.050
 Well, I think innovation is what 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.690
 first since they made a change 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.790
 excellent but clear without leaving the side 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.800
 the classic xd good in this game 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.260
 we can choose four characters at 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.120
 king or princess peach and of course 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.550
 Mario each has a special power 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.740
 like luigi and that when it falls it falls with 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.140
 style hehe although the ending is a 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.790
 shit since everything is a fucking dream 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.100
 xdddd put 7 mario kart wii really 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.900
 I did not decide on the 3 but I decided 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
 for this as the mario tennis 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.250
 for its innovation in this case is the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.709
 helm of the guild and comparison of mario 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.510
 tennis this one did not bore me despite 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.850
 that always be careless races 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.770
 they are fun good this game brings 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.990
 new items like the mushroom that makes you 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.820
 giant and the rocket that in my opinion is 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.960
 the most effective since it makes you advance 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.330
 pretty put 6 mario bros 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.700
 if the classic Danish mario bros does not 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.980
 could not miss in this top the game that 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.900
 it only revolutionized mariobros but 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.820
 several games in general with one 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.340
 playability of the host for the time 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.530
 an excellent game was also the first 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.230
 game that brought the horny little song 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.330
 the one we all know x from the 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.490
 gameplay was very good for the time 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.860
 in this game so few items the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.200
 star the fungus red green the flower of 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.910
 fire this game brings a lot of bugs 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.900
 and mistakes like the one you go through 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.320
 wall xd 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.990
 despite everything the game is great 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:46.920
 put 5 super Mario 64 for the nintendo 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:49.320
 64 another game that revolutionized in this 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.480
 case the graphs in 3d besides that in 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.130
 this game mario's skills are 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.800
 much more diverse than those of 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.020
 previous games of the saga of mario in 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.170
 this delivery mario can walk run 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.790
 crouch crawl swim climb and jump 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.950
 at great heights or distances 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.110
 using the analog stick and buttons 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.000
 Command console as 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.490
 mario's special ability in games 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.290
 previous was jumping was lent particular 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.480
 attention to this movement 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.250
 of play is very employment is like the gta 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.009
 that you can walk wherever you want 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.660
 but without killing xd besides in this game 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.580
 you have to grab stars and you 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.120
 increase an item that are wings in the hat 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:30.180
 from mario x from position 4 super mario 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.520
 galaxy for the wii many will think that 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.669
 the 2 is much better but this is my top 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.070
 and besides I have not played the 2 this game is 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.650
 it looks like mario 64 only with more 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.389
 graphics and a much more open space 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.250
 good the concept or the story is that 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.919
 this game develops in space 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.900
 outside where mario travels from galaxy in 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.150
 galaxy to recover some objects 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.830
 called power stars that are obtained 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.840
 completing certain missions or 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.080
 defeating enemies in their respective 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.880
 levels the game is hilarious because 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.979
 you can converse and do what you want 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.470
 especially I like to walk on the 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.360
 xd world in this game is fun 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:08.669
 also some levels are something 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.009
 difficult although at first easy it is 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.080
 like on a level that you have to play to 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.449
 the hidden ones with some stars xd 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:17.550
 well now we will say in my 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.510
 review the three best mario games 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.290
 bros 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.480
 put 3 super mario bros 3 for the nes 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:26.340
 no doubt this game could not miss 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.110
 which is very funny since now 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.630
 we will have to pass worlds like 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.700
 current several but with x numbers of 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.980
 besides that this game brings an item 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.870
 fantastic that mario has a tail 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.150
 of beaver and can fly for a while and 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.520
 also kill your enemies besides the 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.320
 game brings a fun bonus that every 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.750
 Once you finish a level you can grab 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.270
 an item and if you grab three equal 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.160
 three or five lives xd the game was 

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.260
 designed to attract players from 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.720
 various skill levels for 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.790
 help less skilled players the 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.500
 bonus coins and extra lives 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.480
 they are more abundant in the first 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.640
 worlds while the following 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:05.760
 present more complex challenges for 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.310
 most experienced players ranked 2 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.830
 new super mario bros wii for wikis 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.990
 of good I spoke before game in my 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.910
 analysis but anyway here 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.130
 I will also talk about this great 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.930
 game not decided whether I put it in 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.630
 first place or the first one 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.520
 put xd but I decided on the other well 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.009
 let's talk about this game on 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.469
 game 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.689
 two new grandiose items that are the 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:31.089
 penguin and the champ peak but the game 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.249
 it's like the classics but with graphics 

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:35.529
 improved ones I think is one of the 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.749
 games with more graphics in the good uil 

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:40.119
 the story is the same x of the game 

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:42.159
 brings new news one of them as 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:44.349
 I already said the other items the best in my 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.719
 opinion that we can play 4 players 

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:49.960
 at the same time among other novelties 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:51.939
 like when mario gets to have 99 lives 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.099
 Mario takes off his cap still not 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.499
 succeeded there will be able to load some 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.360
 small frozen enemies and throw them 

00:06:56.499 --> 00:07:01.629
 and they can also be charged to 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.849
 characters et cetera etcetera 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:06.569
 put one in my opinion the best game 

00:07:03.849 --> 00:07:09.159
 mario super mario world for the snes 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.529
 many may not agree but 

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.569
 This is a great game for me , 

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:15.909
 many say that in this game appeared 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.830
 For the first time I do xd 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.020
 besides the skills like running and 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.969
 jump found in previous titles 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.039
 the player has the possibility of 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:26.169
 float with the help of certain objects 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:28.840
 specials and execute new styles of 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:31.360
 jumps such as the spin 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.430
 the game is very long and the worlds are 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:35.380
 fun addition an item is added 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.449
 fantastic that is the mario conca for 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.880
 super mario world includes an option 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.680
 Multiplayer that allows two players 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.199
 finish the game cooperatively 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.000
 playing in turns during navigation 

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:47.979
 of the general map and to access the 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.500
 stage levels the main player 

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:52.389
 controls Mario while the second 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.430
