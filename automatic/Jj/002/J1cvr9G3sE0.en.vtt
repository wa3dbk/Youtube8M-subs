showed<00:03:19.579> you<00:03:19.730> at<00:03:19.790> the<00:03:19.850> beginning<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.420> actually

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
showed you at the beginning I actually

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.900 
showed you at the beginning I actually
have<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.260> version<00:03:21.709> on<00:03:22.130> one<00:03:22.489> other<00:03:22.640> character

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910

that<00:03:23.239> does<00:03:23.420> about<00:03:23.769> 26,000<00:03:24.769> damage<00:03:25.130> you've

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
that does about 26,000 damage you've

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.979 
that does about 26,000 damage you've
probably<00:03:25.910> seen<00:03:26.299> that<00:03:26.480> in<00:03:26.570> the<00:03:26.630> last<00:03:26.660> ring

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
probably seen that in the last ring

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.900 
probably seen that in the last ring
that's<00:03:27.200> actually<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.650> one<00:03:27.799> I<00:03:27.829> was<00:03:28.040> using<00:03:28.220> so<00:03:28.640> I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
that's actually the one I was using so I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.930 
that's actually the one I was using so I
would<00:03:29.360> say<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.570> decent<00:03:30.410> level<00:03:30.590> 50<00:03:31.130> would<00:03:31.459> be<00:03:31.519> in

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
would say a decent level 50 would be in

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.140 
would say a decent level 50 would be in
level<00:03:32.360> about<00:03:32.720> like<00:03:32.959> this<00:03:33.110> 18,000<00:03:33.980> damage<00:03:34.700> to

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
level about like this 18,000 damage to

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.120 
level about like this 18,000 damage to
about<00:03:35.590> 28,000<00:03:36.590> somewhere<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:36.950> ballpark

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
about 28,000 somewhere in that ballpark

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.890 
about 28,000 somewhere in that ballpark
obviously<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.000> higher<00:03:38.150> damage<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.690> better

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
obviously the higher damage the better

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.870 
obviously the higher damage the better
it's<00:03:39.140> going<00:03:39.320> to<00:03:39.410> be<00:03:39.680> but<00:03:40.340> if<00:03:40.430> you'd<00:03:40.579> looked<00:03:40.760> at

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
it's going to be but if you'd looked at

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.400 
it's going to be but if you'd looked at
the<00:03:41.000> wiki<00:03:41.299> there<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:41.570> says<00:03:41.750> also<00:03:42.230> many
