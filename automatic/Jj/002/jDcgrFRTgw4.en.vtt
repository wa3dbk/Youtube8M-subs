00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.300
 and day and welcome here 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.260
 the German railway and the associated 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.759
 seat reservation yes that's it 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.009
 no reason for me anymore 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.870
 Out of hand so were from time to time 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.880
 That's why you said it was better 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.800
 train you so car is safer if 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.140
 you maybe drive and reserve 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.840
 you have a seat, please, I have 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.539
 done and I know what that people 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.640
 little means it's not just four 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.320
 euro extra I have to pay for it 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.090
 in a certain place that's right 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 have passed in this large space where 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.760
 are each basically equal to 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.469
 sit down 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.670
 one would have been in there already 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.930
 can one expect indeed that I 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.460
 someday , and then I have to 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.590
 perhaps an opinionated to sit a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.840
 I also have somehow in my car 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.399
 at least towards the right on the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.710
 driver's seat to sit at the train 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.870
 costs 4 euros extra 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 that there is faded in somewhere that 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.100
 I can sit there four euros 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.890
 Well that does not necessarily mean that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 world but this psychic pressure the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.480
 The German train generated with me 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 that is there are no limits for 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.640
 because while already on the platform 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:15.240
 stand and I think seat 54 row 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.580
 48 railway tracks 18,000 cars 32 meters already 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.439
 where must please print out nice times 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.060
 sitting to serve is me 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.520
 psychic pressure at once from zero 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.930
 1000 yes, because what does one mean? 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.900
 seat reservation and that means 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.329
 it always means the thought where 70 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.369
 and much worse is this damned 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.079
 seat also be free and in 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.119
 my life I do not know why or 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.360
 which costs are heavily exposed there 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.280
 the thing is so principle free itself 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.619
 if the train would start from Bielefeld 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.310
 would your old omi be sitting and that 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.710
 right to think she is allowed to sit there 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.259
 because he's just expensive and then you go 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.320
 in this train you are already rock 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.299
 previously looked at the railway track in the area 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.740
 cae the car would have to stand in the one 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.290
 seat for me and only for me 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.780
 Alone to Paris in the reason already 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.760
 reserved 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.060
 first through this stupid wagon long ago 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.140
 beautiful 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.480
 hello no with the looks said already 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 no i will not sit next to you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.690
 but you go through and try this one 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.900
 bit in the corner already too 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.830
 where catch 74 and that stupid 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.180
 Mark is not correct either 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.810
 it's always a little bit running away 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.950
 crude 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.180
 Maybe I'm just a beginner 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.520
 but it is not that easy 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.530
 not 73 74 5 it's actually on the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.780
 another side back and forth man 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 have to look closely and then 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.580
 do you stand at once? 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.360
 also a pretty romanistik student 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.459
 probably see 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.320
 No, that's not my opinion 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.880
 seat that was never and I know 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.180
 not why I could not offer that 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.560
 can 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.000
 Do you want to stay online 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.340
 maybe next to the young pretty one 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.010
 Romanist students from Portugal sit 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.050
 no, of course not worth 18 euros for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.560
 instead pay 70 always next to 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.200
 any great service providers 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.880
 live nothing but their task to 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.200
 have seemed to me from their last 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.090
 Here to tell that happened 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.709

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.340
 but then you come sometime yours 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.690
 74th place and what happens to me people 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.760
 always the same comes already close 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.799
 try to express sympathy alone 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.680
 out of fear, yes, because that will be now 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.480
 how do I convince seminar in the first place 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.269

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.459

 then you do not know what will happen 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.150
 This person you ask yourself in the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.010
 She starts at the platform 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.560

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.330

 Great discussion convince the people

 Of course all other people are watching 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.709
 how do you solve this situation in the first place 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.930
 some assessment center how does that get 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.459

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.980
 this chunk of the person sitting there 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:10.230
 maybe not get up or the place 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.390

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.370
 or old omis or one last time was 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.549
 there is a group of polish students 18 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.199
 If I want to wake it up I have to 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.120
 enforce the right that I am there 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.919
 seated during three polish 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.570
 Exchange students who have no money 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.040
 and the real long ride in the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.090
 come the weld to the data 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.180

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.040

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.139
 Take the place now 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.300

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.729
 for euro, I pay four euros for that 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.639
 mentally stressing me out 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.830
 people basically go to sleep 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.770
 must I have to say an old granny 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.630
 the salier academic stupid hip 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.850
 Now I have to splash 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.949
 defend my rights for four euros 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.810
 if I'm paying only four euros why 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.220
 the German train can not be someone 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.990
 turn off everyone to his 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.530
 shitty seat puts him 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.990

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.460
 150 euros for the ic of the may 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.500
 be sat where you want 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.780
 Instead, land is not on the report 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 the Polish travel group somehow 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.710
 because I have heart yes I have heart 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.910
 people sleep on mine 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.440
 seating and then go 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.500
 thank you hours of bicycle wegschob 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.690
 no, it's not okay 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.400
 baked and the bord bistro what I 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.550
 I have learned to stay there 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 then buy me for another 18,000 euros 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.500
 drinks because you only drinks 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.120
 So one should consume only the amount 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.220
 stay long in the bord bistro as you can 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.099
 to have between the team or what drinks 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.800
 So I buy a three hour cologne 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:42.740
 Of course I'll buy another cola why 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.000
 if I buy a damn cola 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.289
 totally overpriced them 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.150
 German train then I can too 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.490
 have the right to sit without we are 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.070
 the whole ride in this bord bistro 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.150
 At least I have to spend there 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:59.900
 do not tell anyone 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.900
 that's for sure
