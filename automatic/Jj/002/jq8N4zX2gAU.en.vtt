00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
below the waterline as you can see it's

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.039 
below the waterline as you can see it's
flawed<00:01:26.220> anyway<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:27.119> has<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.509> redone

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.899 

I'll<00:01:31.049> have<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.590> usually<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.430> paint<00:01:32.759> with

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909

I'll have to I usually like paint with
dry<00:01:33.150> brush<00:01:33.450> over<00:01:34.110> detail<00:01:34.530> but<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> one

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
dry brush over detail but on this one

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.429 
dry brush over detail but on this one
because<00:01:36.150> there's<00:01:36.329> already<00:01:36.479> so<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:37.049> paint

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
because there's already so much paint

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710 
because there's already so much paint
I'm<00:01:38.400> going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> probably<00:01:38.880> end<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.360> just<00:01:39.570> doing

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
I'm going to probably end up just doing

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.590 
I'm going to probably end up just doing
a<00:01:40.049> thin<00:01:40.439> paint<00:01:40.740> wash

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.810 

but<00:01:45.600> that's<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.320> long<00:01:46.920> ways<00:01:47.160> from<00:01:47.370> getting<00:01:47.700> into

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
but that's a long ways from getting into

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.990 
but that's a long ways from getting into
that<00:01:47.940> right<00:01:48.390> now<00:01:48.860> here's<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.190> repainted<00:01:50.760> hull

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that right now here's the repainted hull

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the parts where it's orange up there on

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.690 
the parts where it's orange up there on
the<00:01:56.040> turret<00:01:56.430> bases<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.470> bow<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:59.400> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the turret bases and bow that's the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.910 
the turret bases and bow that's the
original<00:01:59.880> color<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.140> guy<00:02:01.290> painted<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
original color that the guy painted the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
original color that the guy painted the
deck<00:02:02.160> and<00:02:02.460> it's<00:02:02.580> kind<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.880> like<00:02:03.090> more<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.330> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
deck and it's kind of like more like a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.890 
deck and it's kind of like more like a
flesh<00:02:03.840> tone<00:02:04.110> anything<00:02:04.590> else<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> horrid<00:02:05.460> yep

done now I did a black base and a silver
dry<00:02:59.280> brush<00:02:59.580> over<00:02:59.940> them<00:03:00.060> so<00:03:00.600> they<00:03:00.780> came<00:03:00.959> out

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
dry brush over them so they came out

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.479 
dry brush over them so they came out
nice<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.680> gunmetal<00:03:02.160> colored<00:03:03.030> and<00:03:03.410> you<00:03:04.430> may<00:03:05.430> be

able to see them on the pic of a full

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.650 
able to see them on the pic of a full
ship<00:03:08.160> maybe<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.030> my<00:03:09.390> cameras<00:03:09.900> are

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
ship maybe not because my cameras are

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.940 
ship maybe not because my cameras are
at<00:03:11.020> all<00:03:11.790> so<00:03:12.790> anyway<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:14.320> turrets<00:03:14.710> light

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
at all so anyway that the turrets light

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.520 
at all so anyway that the turrets light
took<00:03:15.160> over<00:03:15.460> an<00:03:15.670> hour<00:03:15.790> each<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.810> get<00:03:17.020> this<00:03:17.260> right

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
took over an hour each to get this right

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.060 
took over an hour each to get this right
and<00:03:17.770> then<00:03:17.860> to<00:03:18.010> paint<00:03:18.250> them<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:18.730> stuff

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
and then to paint them up and stuff

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.870 
and then to paint them up and stuff
moving<00:03:21.070> on<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.610> next<00:03:21.880> slide<00:03:23.430> now<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.700> is

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
moving on to the next slide now this is

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.440 
moving on to the next slide now this is
like<00:03:25.060> a<00:03:25.090> major<00:03:25.450> difficulty<00:03:27.030> take<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.060> look<00:03:28.300> at

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
like a major difficulty take a look at

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.250 
like a major difficulty take a look at
that<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.990> the<00:03:30.330> decks<00:03:31.330> are<00:03:31.600> about<00:03:31.810> a<00:03:31.840> quarter

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
that and the decks are about a quarter

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.940 
that and the decks are about a quarter
inch<00:03:32.290> wider<00:03:32.860> than<00:03:33.900> wider<00:03:34.900> than<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.470> hull<00:03:35.710> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
inch wider than wider than the hull and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.080 
inch wider than wider than the hull and
so<00:03:38.950> I'm<00:03:39.070> not<00:03:39.250> sure<00:03:39.460> whether<00:03:39.610> I'm<00:03:39.820> real

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
so I'm not sure whether I'm real

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.600 
so I'm not sure whether I'm real
motorized<00:03:40.690> or<00:03:40.960> not<00:03:41.140> because<00:03:41.560> if<00:03:41.770> I<00:03:41.950> make<00:03:42.160> any

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
motorized or not because if I make any

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.520 
motorized or not because if I make any
part<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.090> deck<00:03:43.450> removable<00:03:44.110> and<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.350> try

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
part of that deck removable and you try

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.170 
part of that deck removable and you try
to<00:03:44.560> take<00:03:44.800> it<00:03:44.980> out<00:03:45.130> it<00:03:45.310> could<00:03:45.430> just<00:03:45.550> pop<00:03:45.940> up

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
to take it out it could just pop up

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.450 
to take it out it could just pop up
about<00:03:46.390> ten<00:03:46.720> feet<00:03:46.990> because<00:03:47.590> it's<00:03:47.770> wedged<00:03:47.950> in<00:03:48.250> so

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460 
about ten feet because it's wedged in so

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.030 
about ten feet because it's wedged in so
tight<00:03:48.730> so<00:03:49.480> I<00:03:49.930> haven't<00:03:50.260> decided<00:03:50.530> on<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:50.980> I

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
tight so I haven't decided on that I

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.040 
tight so I haven't decided on that I
might<00:03:51.310> take<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:51.970> outside<00:03:52.090> put<00:03:52.570> it<00:03:52.660> upside<00:03:53.020> down

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
might take it outside put it upside down

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.650 
might take it outside put it upside down
in<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.980> Sun<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.400> the<00:03:54.520> decks<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.970> place<00:03:55.240> for<00:03:55.630> a

in the Sun with the decks in place for a
wild<00:03:55.870> sea<00:03:56.020> route<00:03:56.790> see<00:03:57.790> if<00:03:57.910> it<00:03:58.060> corrects<00:03:58.600> itself

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
wild sea route see if it corrects itself

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.500 
wild sea route see if it corrects itself
not<00:03:59.740> any<00:04:00.010> way<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.280> could<00:04:00.460> glue<00:04:00.940> them<00:04:01.090> in<00:04:01.210> and<00:04:01.390> not

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
not any way I could glue them in and not

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.390 
not any way I could glue them in and not
have<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.750> motorized<00:04:02.290> entrance<00:04:02.830> and<00:04:03.040> just<00:04:03.190> play

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
anyway all that writing on the box top

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.290 
anyway all that writing on the box top
is<00:05:08.370> my<00:05:08.550> hours<00:05:08.999> so<00:05:10.460> seven<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.550> half<00:05:11.669> hours<00:05:12.060> in

is my hours so seven and half hours in
that's<00:05:12.599> what<00:05:12.779> she<00:05:12.960> looks<00:05:13.169> like<00:05:13.639> coming<00:05:14.639> along

nice<00:05:15.090> thing<00:05:15.330> good<00:05:15.449> enough<00:05:15.689> to<00:05:15.810> do<00:05:15.930> a<00:05:15.960> little

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
nice thing good enough to do a little

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.170 
nice thing good enough to do a little
parts<00:05:16.560> fabrication<00:05:17.340> which<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.669> why<00:05:17.819> I<00:05:17.849> took<00:05:17.969> a

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
parts fabrication which is why I took a

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.869 
parts fabrication which is why I took a
break<00:05:18.419> but<00:05:18.719> arts<00:05:19.529> fabrication<00:05:20.189> is<00:05:20.310> no<00:05:20.460> problem

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
break but arts fabrication is no problem

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:22.909 
break but arts fabrication is no problem
I<00:05:20.999> expected<00:05:21.509> it<00:05:21.629> bought<00:05:21.990> the<00:05:22.139> model<00:05:22.319> used<00:05:22.680> on

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
I expected it bought the model used on

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.700 
I expected it bought the model used on
eBay<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.520> know<00:05:23.639> so<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:24.990> experienced<00:05:25.560> at<00:05:25.680> that

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
eBay you know so I'm experienced at that

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.529 
eBay you know so I'm experienced at that
and<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.069> lot<00:05:26.219> of<00:05:26.249> my<00:05:26.460> models<00:05:26.849> have<00:05:27.029> fabricated

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
and a lot of my models have fabricated

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:29.149 
and a lot of my models have fabricated
parts<00:05:27.960> and<00:05:28.169> nobody's<00:05:28.469> ever<00:05:28.560> been<00:05:28.830> the<00:05:28.949> wiser

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
parts and nobody's ever been the wiser

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.909 
parts and nobody's ever been the wiser
itself<00:05:30.110> so<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.349> not<00:05:31.590> going<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:31.800> be<00:05:31.889> a

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 
itself so that's not going to be a

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.300 
itself so that's not going to be a
problem<00:05:32.340> anyway<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.419> is<00:05:33.659> a<00:05:33.860> Dave<00:05:34.860> and<00:05:35.219> this

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
problem anyway this is a Dave and this

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
and a half hours in I figured a few more

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.029 
and a half hours in I figured a few more
hours<00:05:40.650> in<00:05:40.680> I'll<00:05:40.979> do<00:05:41.159> a<00:05:41.189> follow-up<00:05:41.610> video<00:05:41.909> and

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 
hours in I'll do a follow-up video and
