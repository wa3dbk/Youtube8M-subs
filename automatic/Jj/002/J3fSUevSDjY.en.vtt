00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.930
 yyyyy 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.340
 look fragment 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.579
 stop right now you see that through 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.460
 a few moments the ball will be in 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.919
 players he will be at the players 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.260
 white uniform in other words a goalkeeper 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:38.030
 blues first by himself gave the ball 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:41.360
 let's make sure to the opponent 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.170
 you all saw now let's go back 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.170
 a little bit back 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:52.730
 stop here the ball already flies to the ground for 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:56.090
 Help such a ball I flew specifically 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:01.450
 looked 3.9 seconds 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:05.990
 during this time and this player and this player 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:08.680
 opponent and this player and even this player 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:12.560
 could well be together 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:16.909
 landing sword puzzles asked 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:20.510
 why do you need such a floor 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:23.030
 such a ball knocking is savannah where 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.670
 actually it's just a groove in 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.650
 struggle what did you have to do in this 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.360
 situations 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:34.240
 obviously not so enter the ball in the game 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:39.159
 there were other options please note 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.080
 on this player who could well 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.619
 come up for making a sword on this 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.159
 player who could do the same thing as 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.640
 give on this player who can 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:56.560
 current, too, could come closer apartment 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.750
 take the ball and through the groove into these of the defense 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.600
 what conclusion from this situation what conclusion 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.110
 from what we have seen with you output 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:09.259
 very simple need to cherish the ball and not 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:12.290
 give a single chance to the opponent so 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.860
 so he took the ball and began his attack 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.860
 everything 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.349
 look fra 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.349
 end 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.450
 and now in slow motion 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:52.610
 Stop 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:55.430
 let's number footballer 123 as 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.000
 you see the ball flies to the lawn 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:02.270
 and then it will be white 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.060
 that is, the goalkeeper again knocks the ball in 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:08.630
 fight and strictly speaking the first pass 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.700
 gives the ball to the opponent if possible 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.030
 act differently 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:17.600
 I am sure that you can for example player number 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.220
 one can calmly fall off to the flank 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.810
 get closer to your goal get the ball 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.190
 player number two can do the same 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:31.489
 player number three 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.280
 similarly any of these players 123 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:37.190
 gets the ball and after two pass through 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.459
 coming out of defense is very simple 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.709
 why don't the goalkeeper do this with his 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.709
 defenders I do not know everything 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.420
 look in 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.420
 end 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.120
 and now in slow motion 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:17.299
 stop as you saw after the first 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.329
 scrolling the ball will again be white then 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:24.350
 There is a blue goalkeeper the first Paz 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.960
 gives the ball to his opponent he does it with 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.860
 manic spice can you play 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:37.930
 in another way of course we can denote 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:41.870
 football players in defense 1 2 and 3 is enough 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:46.430
 1 falls off the flank gets the ball from 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.419
 goalkeeper 2 retires patient cool ryu and then 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.789
 doing the same 3 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:56.780
 falls back and onto the right flank and 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:58.789
 also gets the ball from from the goalkeeper in 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.210
 further through the pass they come out of 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:04.940
 defense why don't they do defense 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.120
 blue why does not the goalkeeper 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.449
 I have no answer to this question 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.449
 everything 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.030
 look in 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.030
 end 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.280
 and now in slow motion 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.070
 stop attraction 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.800
 generosity goalkeeper walls them again gives 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.550
 the ball to the opponent is clearly seen by 1 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.040
 scroll 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:06:00.800
 you can or you can play differently 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.800
 of course you can give the ball to this defender 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:12.360
 You can give the ball to this defender and through 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:15.990
 pass quietly go out of defense why 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.260
 don't do it blue i don't know me 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.260
 everything 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.880
 look 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.880
 cop 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.599
 and now in slow motion 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:55.880
 stop all the same picture the ball is injected into 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.699
 the fight 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:02.240
 Then he turns his opponent in 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:05.090
 white uniform players could it have been 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:08.080
 avoid this whether it was possible to play 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.410
 the ball through the pass well of course you could 

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:17.210
 let's go back a little 

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:19.960
 stop here this player or this one 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:25.789
 the player could safely walk away 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:29.990
 get a pass from the goalkeeper and go out 

00:07:25.789 --> 00:07:31.250
 from defense via pic again nobody this 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.250
 doesn't do 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:36.830
 of course you can ask where 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.930
 actually output through devote 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:42.229
 then called exit pass 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:47.110
 all this will be at the beginning I wanted to show 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:48.919
 that putting the ball into play 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:52.819
 pointless exercise 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:55.940
 five fragments i hope i convinced you 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:59.240
 in this but the next movie there already 

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:04.210
 I'll talk directly about quitting 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.210
 from the defense through the groove I have everything
