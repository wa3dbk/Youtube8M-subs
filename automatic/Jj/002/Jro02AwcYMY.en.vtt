00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
with a brightness rating of 415 it's so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.350 
with a brightness rating of 415 it's so
it's<00:00:55.680> pretty<00:00:55.890> damn<00:00:56.070> bright<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.610> they

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
it's pretty damn bright and they

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.360 
it's pretty damn bright and they
included<00:00:57.870> something<00:00:58.199> called<00:00:58.440> graphic<00:00:59.039> RAM

included something called graphic RAM

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.270 
included something called graphic RAM
and<00:00:59.730> this<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.210> kind<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.449> confusing<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:01.109> explain

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
and this is kind of confusing to explain

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.039 
and this is kind of confusing to explain
but<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.670> basic<00:01:03.059> thing<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.870> going

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
but the basic thing of it is it's going

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.719 
but the basic thing of it is it's going
to<00:01:04.110> reduce<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.470> power<00:01:04.799> consumption<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.580> to

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
to reduce your power consumption up to

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.580 
to reduce your power consumption up to
twenty<00:01:06.030> six<00:01:06.240> percent<00:01:06.330> while<00:01:06.869> displaying<00:01:07.260> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
twenty six percent while displaying a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.980 
twenty six percent while displaying a
still<00:01:07.860> image<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.369> LG<00:01:09.210> claims<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.720> this<00:01:09.869> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
still image and LG claims that this is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
still image and LG claims that this is
going<00:01:10.140> to<00:01:10.200> increase<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.740> expected<00:01:11.250> overhaul

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
going to increase the expected overhaul

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.880 
going to increase the expected overhaul
battery<00:01:11.970> life<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.409> ten<00:01:13.710> percent

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
battery life by up to about ten percent

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
battery life by up to about ten percent
so<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.790> pretty<00:01:15.119> awesome<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.409> know<00:01:16.530> we

pretty<00:02:08.069> amazing<00:02:08.369> things<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.270> camera

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
pretty amazing things with the camera

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.059 
pretty amazing things with the camera
and<00:02:09.899> actually<00:02:10.289> before<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.590> talk<00:02:10.770> about<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and actually before I talk about the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.890 
and actually before I talk about the
camera<00:02:11.370> I'll<00:02:11.489> talk<00:02:11.700> about<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.150> design<00:02:12.599> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
camera I'll talk about the design the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.850 
camera I'll talk about the design the
back<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
back of the

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.800 
back of the
I'm<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.070> I<00:02:14.100> flicked<00:02:14.400> this<00:02:14.610> quickly<00:02:14.850> check

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
I'm here I flicked this quickly check

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.190 
I'm here I flicked this quickly check
out<00:02:15.960> what<00:02:16.110> they've<00:02:16.230> done<00:02:16.440> with<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.550> back<00:02:17.790> now

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
out what they've done with the back now

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.480 
out what they've done with the back now
you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.350> see<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> camera<00:02:19.800> interface<00:02:20.130> right

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
you can see the camera interface right

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.760 
you can see the camera interface right
here<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:20.940> these<00:02:21.210> are<00:02:21.630> volume<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.620> power

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
here now these are volume and power

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.470 
here now these are volume and power
buttons<00:02:22.920> there<00:02:23.280> are<00:02:23.430> no<00:02:23.640> buttons<00:02:23.880> on<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:24.240> side

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
buttons there are no buttons on the side

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.750 
buttons there are no buttons on the side
here<00:02:24.510> guys<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.200> they've<00:02:25.800> moved<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.580> whole

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
here guys so they've moved the whole

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.030 
here guys so they've moved the whole
thing<00:02:27.030> over<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.080> back<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.710> reason

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
thing over to the back and the reason

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.790 
thing over to the back and the reason
why<00:02:29.630> this<00:02:30.630> is<00:02:30.810> what<00:02:30.960> they<00:02:31.080> explained<00:02:31.500> i'm<00:02:31.650> just

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
why this is what they explained i'm just

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.380 
why this is what they explained i'm just
using<00:02:31.920> my<00:02:32.130> Nexus<00:02:32.490> here<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> demonstrate<00:02:32.910> this

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
using my Nexus here to demonstrate this

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.420 
using my Nexus here to demonstrate this
everyone<00:02:34.200> apparently<00:02:34.530> holds<00:02:35.070> their<00:02:35.220> phone

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
everyone apparently holds their phone

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.300 
everyone apparently holds their phone
like<00:02:35.700> this<00:02:35.900> with<00:02:36.900> your<00:02:37.290> finger<00:02:37.770> naturally

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
like this with your finger naturally

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.740 
like this with your finger naturally
resting<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> back<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.210> I've<00:02:39.390> got<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.630> say

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
resting on the back and I've got to say

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
resting on the back and I've got to say
when<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:40.020> hold<00:02:40.350> my<00:02:40.530> phone<00:02:40.680> up<00:02:40.830> to<00:02:40.860> my<00:02:41.040> head

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
when I do hold my phone up to my head

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.420 
when I do hold my phone up to my head
that<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.550> how<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:41.820> hold<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:44.010> know<00:02:44.130> that's

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
that is how I hold it so you know that's

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.590 
that is how I hold it so you know that's
what<00:02:44.700> they've<00:02:44.820> done<00:02:44.940> they've<00:02:45.150> put<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.450> volume

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
what they've done they've put the volume

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600 
what they've done they've put the volume
rockers<00:02:46.170> there<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.980> power<00:02:47.190> button<00:02:47.430> at

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
rockers there and the power button at

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.100 
rockers there and the power button at
the<00:02:47.640> back<00:02:47.790> as<00:02:48.000> well<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.510> control<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
the back as well so you can control it

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.050 
the back as well so you can control it
while<00:02:49.260> having<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:49.709> finger<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.250> hand<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.970> a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
while having your finger and hand in a

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.910 
while having your finger and hand in a
natural<00:02:51.270> position<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.440> that's<00:02:52.590> kind<00:02:52.830> of

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
natural position so that's kind of

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.340 
natural position so that's kind of
interesting<00:02:53.720> we'll<00:02:54.720> have<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.959> see<00:02:55.080> how<00:02:55.110> that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
interesting we'll have to see how that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.810 
interesting we'll have to see how that
actually<00:02:55.470> feels<00:02:55.770> in<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.040> hand<00:02:56.280> I<00:02:56.430> don't<00:02:56.670> know

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
actually feels in the hand I don't know

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:57.920 
actually feels in the hand I don't know
it'd<00:02:56.970> probably<00:02:57.150> be<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.360> little<00:02:57.450> bit<00:02:57.630> odd<00:02:57.780> at

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
it'd probably be a little bit odd at

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.390 
it'd probably be a little bit odd at
first<00:02:57.959> but<00:02:58.290> then<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.470> might<00:02:58.709> actually<00:02:58.950> feel

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
first but then it might actually feel

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.640 
first but then it might actually feel
quite<00:02:59.550> nice<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.060> we'll<00:03:00.209> find<00:03:00.450> out<00:03:00.660> now<00:03:01.380> talking

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
quite nice so we'll find out now talking

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.440 
quite nice so we'll find out now talking
about<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.070> camera<00:03:02.459> it's<00:03:02.610> a<00:03:02.700> rear<00:03:02.970> 13

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
about that camera it's a rear 13

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.479 
about that camera it's a rear 13
megapixel<00:03:04.050> camera<00:03:04.350> with<00:03:04.380> OAS<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.250> means

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
megapixel camera with OAS this means

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.449 
megapixel camera with OAS this means
optical<00:03:06.180> image<00:03:06.510> stabilization<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:08.310> is

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
optical image stabilization and this is

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.890 
optical image stabilization and this is
actually<00:03:08.580> kind<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.030> big<00:03:09.209> deal<00:03:09.239> because<00:03:09.600> this

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
actually kind of a big deal because this

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.810 
actually kind of a big deal because this
is<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.140> first<00:03:10.170> smartphone<00:03:10.770> to<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.310> optical

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
is the first smartphone to have optical

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.390 
is the first smartphone to have optical
image<00:03:12.209> stabilization<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:13.620> such<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.040> big

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
image stabilization with such a big

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.220 
image stabilization with such a big
megapixel<00:03:15.030> camera<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.480> normally<00:03:15.810> have<00:03:15.989> 4

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
megapixel camera that normally have 4

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.220 
megapixel camera that normally have 4
megapixels<00:03:16.920> or<00:03:16.980> 8<00:03:17.100> megapixels<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:18.330> has<00:03:18.600> 13

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
megapixels or 8 megapixels this has 13

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.570 
megapixels or 8 megapixels this has 13
so<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.620> camera<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.070> going<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.280> be<00:03:20.370> pretty

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
so the camera is going to be pretty

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.880 
so the camera is going to be pretty
spectacular<00:03:21.420> they<00:03:21.840> said<00:03:22.049> it<00:03:22.140> has<00:03:22.290> excellent

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
spectacular they said it has excellent

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.060 
spectacular they said it has excellent
low-light<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.790> know<00:03:23.940> basically<00:03:24.630> what<00:03:24.810> this

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
low-light you know basically what this

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.310 
low-light you know basically what this
optical<00:03:26.070> image<00:03:26.340> stabilisation<00:03:26.790> does<00:03:27.390> is<00:03:27.630> when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
optical image stabilisation does is when

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.720 
optical image stabilisation does is when
you're<00:03:28.500> kind<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.769> holding<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.280> and<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.580> might

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
you're kind of holding it and you might

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.810 
you're kind of holding it and you might
your<00:03:29.880> hand<00:03:30.090> might<00:03:30.269> shake<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.049> something<00:03:31.410> it

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
your hand might shake or something it

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
your hand might shake or something it
stabilizes<00:03:32.820> that<00:03:32.970> image<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.390> it<00:03:33.450> won't<00:03:33.600> blow

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
stabilizes that image and it won't blow

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.160 
stabilizes that image and it won't blow
and<00:03:34.049> stuff<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.610> now<00:03:35.930> moving<00:03:36.930> on

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
and stuff like that now moving on

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.470 
and stuff like that now moving on
they've<00:03:37.380> also<00:03:37.530> managed<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.160> fit<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.480> 3000
