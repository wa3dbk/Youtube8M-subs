design behind the anti troops spawn base

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.210 
design behind the anti troops spawn base
there<00:00:18.450> is<00:00:18.660> no<00:00:18.930> way<00:00:19.170> on<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.560> space<00:00:19.920> you're

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
there is no way on this space you're

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.680 
there is no way on this space you're
gonna<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:20.460> able<00:00:20.610> to<00:00:20.670> spawn<00:00:20.940> in<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> troop<00:00:21.480> and

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
gonna be able to spawn in a troop and

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.860 
gonna be able to spawn in a troop and
less<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.260> outside<00:00:22.940> alright<00:00:23.940> let's<00:00:24.720> get

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
less it on the outside alright let's get

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.320 
less it on the outside alright let's get
into<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.170> replay<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.620> as<00:00:26.100> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.610> see<00:00:26.670> the
