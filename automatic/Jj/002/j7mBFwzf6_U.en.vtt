00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.980
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.290
 I think that from here we are in a new 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.240
 video in which we will review the improvement 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.220
 visual and flora skills and the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.230
 new skin of fit that for now is the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.640
 unique to this new cycle although it is 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.130
 possible that in the coming days 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.750
 let's count on more even though we thought 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.910
 that it was early for a new record 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.710
 from rivers they have surprised us about 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.750
 all because it appears on the website of 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.880
 support the next champion in receiving 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.980
 a record that would be pop and as they comment 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.750
 on the official website the mechanics of fi 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.730
 now it's still based on being more 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.260
 quick and skillful than his rivals but 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.719
 now also has the tools 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.949
 needed to play from behind or 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.629
 help the team 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.059
 so that it does not involve killing and killing 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.399
 before reviewing your skill kit 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.399
 let's see their animations and base turn 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.550
 let me show you and not 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.789
 Submit foolish 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.789
 accept your defeat 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.880
 it's your turn to see your skills 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.090
 we begin with the passive dance of 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.070
 duelist we identify the points 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.530
 weak of all enemy champions 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.479
 that we have close if we manage to attack 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.819
 one at its weak point that we inflict 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.380
 true damage with that attack 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.560
 we will also win a small 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.119
 speed and healing bonus 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.250
 we will discover a new weak point every 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.200
 once we reach one or when a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.289
 moderate time without attacking the one 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.240
 we already know, we continue with the cv 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.910
 onslaught we rushed to a point 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.979
 and we hit an enemy close to the one 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.230
 we cause damage and apply effects of 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.390
 impact the skill prioritizes the 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 champions and tries to achieve them in their 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.380
 weak points finally if we achieve 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.180
 reach an enemy with the ability 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
 the ramming cooling is 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.819
 restores we continue by double ups 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.709
 replica we adopted a defensive position 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.180
 that allows us to stop all the damage and 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.980
 the control skills of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.150
 adversary for a fraction of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.220
 second 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.440
 then we attack in one direction 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.329
 and we damage and slows down moss during a 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 brief period of time to the champion 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.989
 enemy that we reach if the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.950
 skill has stopped some effect from 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.020
 Adverse control 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.020
 instead of slowing down stuns 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 now we continue with the fencing we get 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 additional attack speed with 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.970
 our next two basic attacks 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.370
 the first can not inflict a critical 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.410
 but slows the target while 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.560
 the second inflicts a critical in all 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.890
 the cases and we end with the ultimate 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.720
 excellent match we select a champion 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.239
 enemy as an objective and we won 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.760
 additional speed plus also 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.709
 discover all your weak points every 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.480
 Once we hit one of them 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.060
 we imply a percentage of your life 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.950
 maximum as true damage if we achieve 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.840
 destroy the four skinny points of 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.550
 enemy or at least one before 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.470
 kill them we created a broad and 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.650
 Durable healing area for our 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.650
 team 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.440
 finally let's see his death animation 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.620
 and this would be the skills kit of 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.540
 now I would like to know your 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.880
 opinion as I always tell you so 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 participate through the comments 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.530
 now we're going with the rabbit fit skin 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.040
 pretty successful themed Easter for 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.050
 the champion will cost 975 real points and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 has a new turn to base model 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.940
 and textures plus new effects for 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:14.070
 its ultimate we begin by reviewing its 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.070
 animations followed by your base spin 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.250
 i 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.250
 you bore me 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.590
 expressly 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.530
 It is now your turn to review your 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.530
 death skills and animation 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.530
 would change 

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.580
 ah 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.260
 yes 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.820
 and this would be the first patch of the cycle 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.680
 quite small although you know that 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.900
 can be adding more content to what 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.200
