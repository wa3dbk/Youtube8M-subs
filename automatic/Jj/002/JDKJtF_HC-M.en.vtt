00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
is much different from the traditional

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.109 
is much different from the traditional
cable<00:01:18.030> at<00:01:18.420> most<00:01:19.290> usual<00:01:20.220> drives<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:20.790> which

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
cable at most usual drives which which

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.899 
cable at most usual drives which which
are<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.659> speak<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.540> drive<00:01:25.049> itself

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
are you speak to this is a drive itself

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:29.120 
are you speak to this is a drive itself
this<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.090> how<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> looks<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.829> all

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this is how it looks like from all

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.800 
this is how it looks like from all
different<00:01:29.540> angles<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:33.270> guess<00:01:33.420> this<00:01:33.659> is

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
different angles and I guess this is

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.080 
different angles and I guess this is
small<00:01:35.119> LED<00:01:36.119> status<00:01:36.570> indicator<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.909> this<00:01:38.909> is

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
small LED status indicator and this is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.510 
small LED status indicator and this is
the<00:01:39.210> back<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.869> guess<00:01:40.619> it's<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.009> premium

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
the back of it I guess it's a premium

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.920 
the back of it I guess it's a premium
plastic<00:01:42.000> feel<00:01:42.780> which<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.820> hardly<00:01:44.820> scratching

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
what else do we get here I guess this is

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.170 
what else do we get here I guess this is
a<00:01:51.750> small<00:01:52.290> manual<00:01:52.649> show<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.130> how<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> plug<00:01:54.000> and

downloading some serious and movies in a
full<00:02:59.500> HD<00:02:59.709> or<00:03:00.340> blu-ray<00:03:01.120> ribbed<00:03:02.280> which<00:03:03.280> is<00:03:03.549> a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
full HD or blu-ray ribbed which is a

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.940 
full HD or blu-ray ribbed which is a
huge<00:03:04.360> file<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.670> requires<00:03:06.670> lot<00:03:07.090> of<00:03:07.269> space<00:03:07.630> and

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
huge file and requires lot of space and

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.660 
huge file and requires lot of space and
I<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.360> external<00:03:10.360> hard<00:03:10.480> drives<00:03:11.370> rather<00:03:12.370> than

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
I like external hard drives rather than

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.670 
I like external hard drives rather than
the<00:03:12.880> desktop<00:03:13.299> versions<00:03:13.720> because<00:03:13.870> it<00:03:14.290> requires

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the desktop versions because it requires

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.599 
the desktop versions because it requires
a<00:03:15.450> external<00:03:16.450> power<00:03:16.989> source<00:03:17.319> which<00:03:17.769> would<00:03:18.370> be

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
a external power source which would be

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:21.599 
a external power source which would be
interrupted<00:03:19.239> due<00:03:19.540> to<00:03:19.750> a<00:03:19.780> cut<00:03:20.560> power<00:03:20.829> or<00:03:21.190> rain

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
interrupted due to a cut power or rain

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.870 
interrupted due to a cut power or rain
or<00:03:21.910> anything<00:03:22.540> like<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.400> would<00:03:24.579> lose

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
or anything like that and you would lose

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.780 
or anything like that and you would lose
your<00:03:25.420> data<00:03:25.660> while<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.680> one<00:03:26.950> doesn't<00:03:27.519> require

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
your data while this one doesn't require

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
your data while this one doesn't require
any<00:03:28.180> power<00:03:28.889> supply<00:03:29.889> so<00:03:30.790> when<00:03:31.180> you<00:03:31.269> laptop<00:03:31.630> the
