00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
printer of the form 1 and this is an SLA

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.370 
printer of the form 1 and this is an SLA
or<00:00:17.970> stereolithography

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
or stereolithography

or stereolithography
printer<00:00:19.710> when<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.010> think<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.430> 3d<00:00:20.699> printing

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
printer when you think of 3d printing

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.910 
printer when you think of 3d printing
you're<00:00:21.180> probably<00:00:21.480> thinking<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:22.500> extrusion

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
you're probably thinking of an extrusion

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560 
you're probably thinking of an extrusion
based<00:00:23.279> printer<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.060> spool<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
based printer you have a spool of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.630 
based printer you have a spool of
plastic<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.320> feeds<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.740> plastic<00:00:26.250> through<00:00:26.609> a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
plastic it feeds the plastic through a

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
plastic it feeds the plastic through a
hot<00:00:26.970> end<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.480> melts<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.109> squirts<00:00:28.590> it

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
hot end which melts it and squirts it

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
hot end which melts it and squirts it
out<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.010> builds<00:00:29.429> up<00:00:29.519> your<00:00:29.670> model<00:00:30.000> in<00:00:30.179> this<00:00:30.330> way

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
out and builds up your model in this way

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.810 
out and builds up your model in this way
SLA<00:00:31.170> printers<00:00:31.560> work<00:00:31.769> very<00:00:32.040> differently<00:00:32.430> they

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
SLA printers work very differently they

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.270 
SLA printers work very differently they
use<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.140> photosensitive<00:00:34.140> liquid<00:00:34.559> resin<00:00:34.829> you

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
use a photosensitive liquid resin you

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280 
use a photosensitive liquid resin you
fill<00:00:35.550> up<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.820> tank<00:00:36.059> and<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.690> use<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> laser

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
fill up a tank and then you use a laser

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
fill up a tank and then you use a laser
to<00:00:37.530> cure<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> resin<00:00:38.460> each<00:00:38.850> layer<00:00:39.360> at<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> time

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
to cure the resin each layer at a time

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530 
to cure the resin each layer at a time
so<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.559> case<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.100> builds<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.640> layer<00:00:41.879> lifts

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
so in this case it builds a layer lifts

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
so in this case it builds a layer lifts
it<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.780> builds<00:00:43.379> another<00:00:43.620> layer<00:00:43.860> lifts<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.520> up

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it up builds another layer lifts it up

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
it up builds another layer lifts it up
now<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:44.969> advantage<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> laser<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.200> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
now the advantage of the laser is you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.440 
now the advantage of the laser is you
get<00:00:46.530> much<00:00:46.739> finer<00:00:47.129> detail<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.940> get<00:00:48.059> really

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
get much finer detail you can get really

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.910 
get much finer detail you can get really
really<00:00:48.629> high<00:00:48.899> quality<00:00:48.930> prints<00:00:49.590> with<00:00:49.770> this

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
really high quality prints with this

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.920 
really high quality prints with this
thing<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.460> not<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.879> only<00:00:51.030> SLA<00:00:51.629> style

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
thing this is not the only SLA style

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.330 
thing this is not the only SLA style
printer<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.920> one<00:00:53.070> that's<00:00:53.219> very

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
printer this is just one that's very

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.250 
printer this is just one that's very
affordable<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.480> compact<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.079> extremely

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
affordable very compact and extremely

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
well made so so far I've just pulled

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.240 
well made so so far I've just pulled
this<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:57.870> out<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.260> box<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> set<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> in

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
this thing out of the box and set it in

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
this thing out of the box and set it in
place<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.730> plugged<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> computer<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
place I plugged it into the computer and

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810 
place I plugged it into the computer and
filled<00:01:01.289> up<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.559> tray<00:01:01.859> with<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.160> resin<00:01:02.670> that's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
filled up the tray with the resin that's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
filled up the tray with the resin that's
all<00:01:03.030> I've<00:01:03.149> done<00:01:03.300> no<00:01:03.539> adjustment<00:01:04.140> no<00:01:04.260> setup

let's<00:01:05.189> go<00:01:05.339> find<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.670> fun<00:01:05.909> model<00:01:06.299> from

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
let's go find a fun model from

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
let's go find a fun model from
Thingiverse<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.260> print<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> out<00:01:07.799> see<00:01:08.070> how<00:01:08.159> it

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
Thingiverse and print it out see how it

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
Thingiverse and print it out see how it
turns<00:01:08.400> out<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.939> printer<00:01:09.210> comes<00:01:09.420> with<00:01:09.630> some

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
turns out the printer comes with some

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.390 
turns out the printer comes with some
free<00:01:10.020> software<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> started<00:01:11.250> you

free software and to get started you

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.710 
free software and to get started you
just<00:01:11.430> select<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:11.970> resin<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.420> you're<00:01:12.570> going

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
just select the resin that you're going

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.929 
just select the resin that you're going
to<00:01:12.750> use<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.260> import<00:01:13.650> your<00:01:13.740> model<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:14.909> a

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
to use and import your model this is a

model I got from Thingiverse I'll link
to<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.799> down<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.159> description<00:01:17.640> but

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
to it down in the description but

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.640 
to it down in the description but
basically<00:01:18.420> once<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
basically once you get it in you

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.380 
basically once you get it in you
generate<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> supports<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> puts<00:01:21.180> all

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
generate the supports and it puts all

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
generate the supports and it puts all
the<00:01:21.509> support<00:01:21.869> material<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.439> place<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:23.009> you

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the support material in place for you

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.929 
the support material in place for you
then<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.150> hit<00:01:24.630> send<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> printer<00:01:25.939> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
then you just hit send a printer the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
then you just hit send a printer the
print<00:01:27.210> -<00:01:27.360> almost<00:01:27.780> three<00:01:27.930> hours<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:28.650> was

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
print - almost three hours but it was

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.080 
print - almost three hours but it was
really<00:01:29.009> cool<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> watch<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.640> come<00:01:29.790> up<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
really cool to watch it come up out of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.420 
really cool to watch it come up out of
the<00:01:30.240> resin<00:01:33.710> once<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.920> finished<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.400> just

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
the resin once it was finished I just

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.340 
the resin once it was finished I just
removed<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> build<00:01:36.329> platform<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:37.110> flipped

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
removed the build platform and flipped

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.890 
removed the build platform and flipped
it<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:37.619> into<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> finishing<00:01:38.880> tray<00:01:39.210> all<00:01:39.630> this

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it over into the finishing tray all this

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.270 
it over into the finishing tray all this
finishing<00:01:40.290> equipment<00:01:40.710> comes<00:01:40.920> with<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
finishing equipment comes with the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.340 
finishing equipment comes with the
printer<00:01:41.549> each<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.570> resin<00:01:42.869> trays<00:01:43.079> has<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
printer each of the resin trays has a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.679 
printer each of the resin trays has a
cover<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.700> stop<00:01:44.909> light<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.329> curing

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
cover as well to stop light from curing

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
cover as well to stop light from curing
it<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.439> model<00:01:46.740> pops<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.100> off<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.399> build

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it the model pops right off the build

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.850 
it the model pops right off the build
platform<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> drop<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.200> into<00:01:49.380> some

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
platform and then you drop it into some

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.830 
platform and then you drop it into some
alcohol<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.729> get<00:01:50.850> all<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.090> extra<00:01:51.360> resin<00:01:51.750> off

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
alcohol to get all the extra resin off

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.870 
alcohol to get all the extra resin off
the<00:01:51.960> outside<00:01:52.320> of<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.740> rinse<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> for

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the outside of it you rinse it for

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310 
the outside of it you rinse it for
several<00:01:54.270> minutes<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:54.960> need<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> let

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
several minutes and then you need to let

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.810 
several minutes and then you need to let
it<00:01:55.350> dry<00:01:55.470> before<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.130> start<00:01:56.159> messing<00:01:56.520> with<00:01:56.700> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it dry before you start messing with it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.440 
it dry before you start messing with it
too<00:01:57.030> much

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
too much

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.480 
too much
it<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.350> pretty<00:01:58.530> amazing<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.189> how<00:01:59.369> it

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
it was pretty amazing to see how it

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.880 
it was pretty amazing to see how it
looked<00:01:59.670> coming<00:02:00.000> right<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.630> bath<00:02:00.890> with

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
looked coming right out of the bath with

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.230 
looked coming right out of the bath with
the<00:02:02.009> tools<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.549> remove<00:02:02.820> some<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.119> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the tools you can remove some of the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
the tools you can remove some of the
support<00:02:03.600> material<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.200> honestly<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> kind<00:02:05.130> of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
support material but honestly it kind of

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
support material but honestly it kind of
breaks<00:02:05.520> off<00:02:05.729> pretty<00:02:06.030> easily<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> pull<00:02:06.840> a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
breaks off pretty easily if you pull a

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
breaks off pretty easily if you pull a
little<00:02:06.960> bit<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:07.890> can<00:02:08.099> go<00:02:08.190> back<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.520> trim

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
little bit then you can go back and trim

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.540 
little bit then you can go back and trim
up<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.030> extra<00:02:09.330> connection<00:02:09.599> points<00:02:10.050> that<00:02:10.229> are

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
up the extra connection points that are

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.890 
up the extra connection points that are
Dover<00:02:10.820> with<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.240> tweezers<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.630> they

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
Dover with the tweezers that they

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.110 
Dover with the tweezers that they
provide<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.980> print<00:02:13.220> detail<00:02:13.370> was<00:02:13.820> pretty

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
provide the print detail was pretty

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.360 
provide the print detail was pretty
amazing<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.780> even<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.350> little<00:02:15.470> hoses<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
amazing and even the little hoses on the

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910 
amazing and even the little hoses on the
feet<00:02:16.580> printed<00:02:17.000> you<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:17.840> see<00:02:18.260> the<00:02:18.410> layer<00:02:18.590> lines

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
feet printed you can see the layer lines

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.110 
feet printed you can see the layer lines
on<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.220> model<00:02:19.490> but<00:02:19.580> they<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.820> whole

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
on the model but they have a whole

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.640 
on the model but they have a whole
series<00:02:20.330> of<00:02:20.540> finishing<00:02:20.990> techniques<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:21.530> can

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
series of finishing techniques that can

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.480 
series of finishing techniques that can
help<00:02:21.740> with<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:23.740> so<00:02:24.740> that<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.070> pretty<00:02:25.250> amazing

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
help with that so that is pretty amazing

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.830 
help with that so that is pretty amazing
this<00:02:25.850> turned<00:02:26.060> out<00:02:26.150> way<00:02:26.360> better<00:02:26.390> than<00:02:26.660> I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
this turned out way better than I

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.020 
this turned out way better than I
thought<00:02:26.870> it<00:02:27.080> was<00:02:27.320> going<00:02:27.560> to<00:02:27.650> and<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.430> kind<00:02:29.000> of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
thought it was going to and I'm kind of

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.670 
thought it was going to and I'm kind of
blown<00:02:29.270> away<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.660> how<00:02:29.810> much<00:02:29.960> detail<00:02:30.200> there<00:02:30.560> is

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
blown away with how much detail there is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.900 
blown away with how much detail there is
in<00:02:30.830> this<00:02:30.950> thing<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.340> think<00:02:31.520> I<00:02:31.550> might<00:02:31.700> print

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
in this thing I think I might print

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.160 
in this thing I think I might print
another<00:02:32.120> one<00:02:32.300> of<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.720> actually<00:02:32.960> paint

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
another one of these and actually paint

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.170 
another one of these and actually paint
it<00:02:33.260> like<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.440> model<00:02:33.860> but<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.520> one<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:34.910> like

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
it like a model but for this one I like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.670 
it like a model but for this one I like
the<00:02:35.360> fact<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.630> it's<00:02:35.840> clear<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.500> pretty

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
the fact that it's clear it's pretty

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.410 
the fact that it's clear it's pretty
cool<00:02:36.860> so<00:02:37.400> about<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.910> machine

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
cool so about the machine

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420 
cool so about the machine
I<00:02:38.450> was<00:02:38.720> blown<00:02:38.930> away<00:02:39.080> at<00:02:39.410> how<00:02:39.440> well<00:02:40.070> it's<00:02:40.280> put

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
I was blown away at how well it's put

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.680 
I was blown away at how well it's put
together<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.970> how<00:02:41.120> they<00:02:41.240> seemed<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.600> have

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
together and how they seemed to have

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.120 
together and how they seemed to have
thought<00:02:41.840> of<00:02:41.900> everything<00:02:42.440> as<00:02:42.590> far<00:02:42.770> as<00:02:42.830> the

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
thought of everything as far as the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.070 
thought of everything as far as the
tolerances<00:02:43.760> for<00:02:43.820> where<00:02:44.240> things<00:02:44.420> fit<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.020> how

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
tolerances for where things fit and how

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.170 
tolerances for where things fit and how
things<00:02:45.290> close<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.160> how<00:02:46.250> things<00:02:46.430> move<00:02:46.760> and

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
things close and how things move and

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.760 
things close and how things move and
it's<00:02:47.450> just<00:02:47.600> really<00:02:47.810> well<00:02:47.990> made<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.470> course<00:02:48.680> I

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
it's just really well made of course I

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.410 
it's just really well made of course I
love<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:48.980> color<00:02:49.280> scheme<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.790> well<00:02:49.820> but<00:02:50.180> it's<00:02:50.330> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
love the color scheme as well but it's a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.700 
love the color scheme as well but it's a
really<00:02:50.690> great<00:02:50.870> machine<00:02:51.230> I've<00:02:51.380> been<00:02:51.530> very

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
really great machine I've been very

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.650 
really great machine I've been very
impressed<00:02:52.100> with<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.550> far<00:02:52.730> as<00:02:53.090> far<00:02:53.270> as<00:02:53.360> cost

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
impressed with it so far as far as cost

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.150 
impressed with it so far as far as cost
this<00:02:54.080> is<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.320> little<00:02:54.680> bit<00:02:54.800> more<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.070> an

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
this is a little bit more of an

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
this is a little bit more of an
expensive<00:02:55.610> machine<00:02:55.760> something<00:02:56.600> you<00:02:56.810> probably

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
expensive machine something you probably

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.720 
expensive machine something you probably
wouldn't<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.740> have<00:02:57.890> a<00:02:57.920> your<00:02:58.160> house<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.580> do

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
wouldn't just have a your house to do

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.100 
wouldn't just have a your house to do
things<00:02:58.970> here<00:02:59.270> and<00:02:59.450> there<00:02:59.630> but<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.960> bigger

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
things here and there but the bigger

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.050 
things here and there but the bigger
issue<00:03:00.200> from<00:03:00.830> the<00:03:01.010> machine<00:03:01.310> cost<00:03:01.580> is<00:03:01.850> the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
issue from the machine cost is the

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.000 
issue from the machine cost is the
material<00:03:02.510> cost<00:03:02.750> this<00:03:03.110> canister<00:03:03.500> right<00:03:03.800> here

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
material cost this canister right here

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.220 
material cost this canister right here
is<00:03:04.190> $100<00:03:05.030> now<00:03:05.360> granted<00:03:05.690> this<00:03:05.870> will<00:03:06.050> probably

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
is $100 now granted this will probably

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.620 
is $100 now granted this will probably
last<00:03:06.440> you<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.830> long<00:03:07.010> time<00:03:07.070> it<00:03:07.610> barely<00:03:08.210> used<00:03:08.450> any

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
last you a long time it barely used any

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.630 
last you a long time it barely used any
to<00:03:09.200> make<00:03:09.380> this<00:03:09.680> but<00:03:10.100> you<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.460> consider

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
to make this but you have to consider

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.760 
to make this but you have to consider
that<00:03:11.150> this<00:03:11.510> being<00:03:11.750> a<00:03:11.870> hundred<00:03:12.140> dollars<00:03:12.410> kind

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
that this being a hundred dollars kind

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.140 
that this being a hundred dollars kind
of<00:03:12.860> limits<00:03:13.280> what<00:03:13.580> you're<00:03:13.730> going<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:13.910> probably

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
of limits what you're going to probably

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.300 
of limits what you're going to probably
print<00:03:14.750> with<00:03:14.959> it<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.260> printer<00:03:15.620> that<00:03:15.770> can<00:03:15.890> do<00:03:16.070> this

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
print with it a printer that can do this

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.190 
print with it a printer that can do this
kind<00:03:16.580> of<00:03:16.610> quality<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.240> really<00:03:17.480> probably<00:03:18.020> not

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
kind of quality is really probably not

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.630 
kind of quality is really probably not
something<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.680> would<00:03:18.830> use<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.040> just<00:03:19.459> make

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
something you would use to just make

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.130 
something you would use to just make
little<00:03:19.820> widgets<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.480> put<00:03:20.630> around<00:03:20.810> your<00:03:20.959> house

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
little widgets to put around your house

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.080 
little widgets to put around your house
or<00:03:21.440> like<00:03:21.590> toys<00:03:21.920> or<00:03:22.340> anything<00:03:22.370> like<00:03:22.640> that<00:03:22.730> but

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
or like toys or anything like that but

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.400 
or like toys or anything like that but
it<00:03:23.209> has<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.330> high<00:03:23.540> enough<00:03:23.720> quality<00:03:24.080> that<00:03:24.320> you

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
it has a high enough quality that you

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.620 
it has a high enough quality that you
can<00:03:24.590> use<00:03:24.770> it<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.040> print<00:03:25.310> models<00:03:25.760> or<00:03:25.970> the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
can use it to print models or the

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.870 
can use it to print models or the
original<00:03:27.260> to<00:03:27.530> then<00:03:27.709> make<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:27.980> mold<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:28.760> be

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
original to then make a mold of and be

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.460 
original to then make a mold of and be
able<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.090> recast<00:03:29.510> and<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:29.959> if<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.110> think<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.380> it

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
able to recast and so if you think of it

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:31.720 
able to recast and so if you think of it
from<00:03:30.500> that<00:03:30.740> perspective<00:03:30.950> this<00:03:31.430> probably

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
from that perspective this probably

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.130 
from that perspective this probably
isn't<00:03:31.910> that<00:03:32.150> expensive<00:03:32.660> because<00:03:32.810> you're<00:03:33.020> not

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
isn't that expensive because you're not

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.260 
isn't that expensive because you're not
going<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.440> print<00:03:33.650> 20<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.250> these<00:03:34.459> on<00:03:34.850> this

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
going to print 20 of these on this

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.420 
going to print 20 of these on this
machine<00:03:35.450> you're<00:03:35.780> going<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:35.990> print<00:03:36.230> one<00:03:36.500> finish

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
machine you're going to print one finish

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.220 
machine you're going to print one finish
it<00:03:37.580> really<00:03:37.850> nicely<00:03:38.060> then<00:03:38.510> make<00:03:38.690> a<00:03:38.720> mold<00:03:39.050> and

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
it really nicely then make a mold and

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.199 
it really nicely then make a mold and
cast<00:03:39.620> it<00:03:39.860> out<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:40.070> some<00:03:40.250> cheaper<00:03:40.580> material<00:03:41.030> as

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
cast it out of some cheaper material as

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.850 
cast it out of some cheaper material as
far<00:03:41.420> as<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.600> resins<00:03:41.959> they<00:03:42.170> do<00:03:42.230> have<00:03:42.500> multiple

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
far as the resins they do have multiple

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.710 
far as the resins they do have multiple
resins<00:03:43.250> I<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.610> clear<00:03:44.030> but<00:03:44.300> they<00:03:44.360> have<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> few

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
resins I have clear but they have a few

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.910 
resins I have clear but they have a few
different<00:03:44.750> colors<00:03:45.230> they<00:03:45.440> also<00:03:45.560> have<00:03:45.890> a

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
different colors they also have a

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.280 
different colors they also have a
flexible<00:03:46.550> resident<00:03:46.970> a<00:03:47.030> castable<00:03:47.540> resin<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.080> a

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
flexible resident a castable resin and a

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.960 
flexible resident a castable resin and a
tough<00:03:48.500> resin<00:03:48.890> I<00:03:48.980> believe<00:03:49.190> this<00:03:49.459> clear<00:03:49.670> resin

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
tough resin I believe this clear resin

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.730 
tough resin I believe this clear resin
does<00:03:50.120> look<00:03:50.360> a<00:03:50.450> little<00:03:50.690> cloudy<00:03:50.990> once<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:51.560> comes

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
does look a little cloudy once it comes

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.350 
does look a little cloudy once it comes
off<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:52.040> printer<00:03:52.340> but<00:03:52.520> apparently<00:03:52.910> with<00:03:53.150> some

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
off the printer but apparently with some

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.030 
off the printer but apparently with some
sanding<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.020> a<00:03:54.200> little<00:03:54.380> bit<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.560> work<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.740> can

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
sanding and a little bit of work you can

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.260 
sanding and a little bit of work you can
get<00:03:55.160> it<00:03:55.280> to<00:03:55.340> where<00:03:55.430> it's<00:03:55.550> perfectly<00:03:55.910> clear

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
get it to where it's perfectly clear

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.970 
get it to where it's perfectly clear
I've<00:03:56.540> not<00:03:56.750> put<00:03:56.900> that<00:03:57.080> work<00:03:57.260> in<00:03:57.470> yet<00:03:57.680> but<00:03:57.890> it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
I've not put that work in yet but it

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.380 
I've not put that work in yet but it
would<00:03:58.130> be<00:03:58.250> interesting<00:03:58.670> to<00:03:58.790> see<00:03:59.000> what<00:03:59.270> this

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
would be interesting to see what this

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390 
would be interesting to see what this
looks<00:03:59.600> like<00:03:59.750> if<00:03:59.990> it's<00:04:00.170> totally<00:04:00.590> clear<00:04:00.890> so<00:04:01.310> in

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
looks like if it's totally clear so in

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.770 
looks like if it's totally clear so in
my<00:04:01.520> opinion<00:04:01.610> this<00:04:01.970> machine<00:04:02.300> would<00:04:02.390> be<00:04:02.540> great

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
my opinion this machine would be great

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.630 
my opinion this machine would be great
for<00:04:02.959> making<00:04:03.080> models<00:04:03.650> or<00:04:03.920> making<00:04:04.250> things<00:04:04.459> that

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
for making models or making things that

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.460 
for making models or making things that
need<00:04:04.850> really<00:04:05.300> high<00:04:05.480> tolerance<00:04:05.780> if<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.350> were

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
need really high tolerance if you were

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.199 
need really high tolerance if you were
making<00:04:06.830> some<00:04:07.070> small<00:04:07.310> parts<00:04:07.700> that<00:04:07.940> had<00:04:08.120> to

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
making some small parts that had to

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.449 
making some small parts that had to
perfectly<00:04:08.690> fit<00:04:08.780> together<00:04:09.260> this<00:04:09.650> machine<00:04:10.070> will

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:10.459 
perfectly fit together this machine will

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.070 
perfectly fit together this machine will
definitely<00:04:11.000> do<00:04:11.150> that<00:04:11.180> another<00:04:11.720> one<00:04:11.900> of<00:04:12.020> the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
definitely do that another one of the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.960 
definitely do that another one of the
big<00:04:12.230> advantages<00:04:12.350> of<00:04:12.800> this<00:04:13.160> machine<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:13.820> I

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
big advantages of this machine and I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.340 
big advantages of this machine and I
think<00:04:14.150> it<00:04:14.239> plays<00:04:14.360> into<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.840> cost<00:04:15.050> is<00:04:15.320> the

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
think it plays into the cost is the

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.320 
think it plays into the cost is the
plug-and-play<00:04:15.830> ability<00:04:16.640> a<00:04:16.820> lot<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.180> the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
plug-and-play ability a lot of the

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.150 
plug-and-play ability a lot of the
extrusion<00:04:17.660> based<00:04:17.959> printers<00:04:18.320> have<00:04:18.620> a<00:04:18.859> lot<00:04:19.130> of

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
extrusion based printers have a lot of

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.979 
extrusion based printers have a lot of
adjustment<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.150> has<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.419> be<00:04:20.540> made<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:20.900> soon

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
adjustment that has to be made as soon

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.120 
adjustment that has to be made as soon
as<00:04:21.140> you<00:04:21.229> take<00:04:21.380> them<00:04:21.500> out<00:04:21.590> of<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.770> box<00:04:21.950> you<00:04:22.100> have

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
as you take them out of the box you have

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.300 
as you take them out of the box you have
to<00:04:22.250> level<00:04:22.520> the<00:04:22.610> bed

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
to level the bed

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.710 
to level the bed
you<00:04:23.340> have<00:04:23.490> to<00:04:23.639> adjust<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.090> stepper<00:04:24.300> motors

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
you have to adjust the stepper motors

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.510 
you have to adjust the stepper motors
adjust<00:04:25.169> the<00:04:25.290> extruder<00:04:25.770> all<00:04:26.040> these<00:04:26.220> things

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
adjust the extruder all these things

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.610 
adjust the extruder all these things
just<00:04:26.639> to<00:04:26.910> get<00:04:27.030> it<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.510> dialed<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:27.990> this<00:04:28.410> one

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
just to get it really dialed in this one

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.100 
just to get it really dialed in this one
I<00:04:28.740> literally<00:04:29.190> took<00:04:29.580> out<00:04:29.760> of<00:04:29.790> the<00:04:29.940> box<00:04:30.180> set<00:04:30.990> it

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
I literally took out of the box set it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.780 
I literally took out of the box set it
on<00:04:31.200> the<00:04:31.290> desk<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.740> hit<00:04:31.919> print<00:04:32.130> and<00:04:32.430> for

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
on the desk and hit print and for

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.980 
on the desk and hit print and for
something<00:04:33.060> like<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.480> be<00:04:33.570> able<00:04:33.660> to<00:04:33.750> come

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
something like that to be able to come

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.350 
something like that to be able to come
out<00:04:34.020> at<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.710> quality<00:04:35.010> says<00:04:35.460> a<00:04:35.490> lot<00:04:35.760> about<00:04:36.090> the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
out at this quality says a lot about the

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.210 
out at this quality says a lot about the
build<00:04:36.570> quality<00:04:36.750> of<00:04:36.990> the<00:04:37.080> machine<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.680> about

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
build quality of the machine and about

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:39.740 
build quality of the machine and about
what<00:04:38.370> you<00:04:38.490> can<00:04:38.669> expect<00:04:39.030> from<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.389> over<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
what you can expect from it over the

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.930 
what you can expect from it over the
long<00:04:39.900> term<00:04:40.139> so<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.560> quality<00:04:41.220> plays<00:04:41.610> a<00:04:41.639> lot

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
long term so that quality plays a lot

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.310 
long term so that quality plays a lot
into<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.300> cost<00:04:42.540> but<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.870> think<00:04:43.020> it's<00:04:43.110> well

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
into the cost but I think it's well

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.870 
into the cost but I think it's well
warranted<00:04:43.919> one<00:04:44.190> more<00:04:44.370> thing<00:04:44.520> about<00:04:44.639> this

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
warranted one more thing about this

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.670 
warranted one more thing about this
printer<00:04:45.210> is<00:04:45.360> that<00:04:45.600> they<00:04:45.840> actually<00:04:46.260> have<00:04:46.470> their

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
printer is that they actually have their

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.290 
printer is that they actually have their
own<00:04:46.740> software<00:04:47.220> which<00:04:47.550> I<00:04:47.669> showed<00:04:47.850> you<00:04:48.000> earlier

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
own software which I showed you earlier

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.000 
own software which I showed you earlier
and<00:04:48.450> it's<00:04:48.780> really<00:04:49.139> simple<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.620> use<00:04:49.800> it's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
and it's really simple to use it's

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.320 
and it's really simple to use it's
really<00:04:50.250> easy<00:04:50.430> it<00:04:50.730> generates<00:04:51.120> all<00:04:51.210> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
really easy it generates all the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.940 
really easy it generates all the
supports<00:04:51.720> for<00:04:51.810> you<00:04:52.080> and<00:04:52.260> as<00:04:52.410> far<00:04:52.530> as<00:04:52.590> 3d

supports for you and as far as 3d

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.260 
supports for you and as far as 3d
printing<00:04:53.220> software<00:04:53.400> it's<00:04:53.820> actually<00:04:54.120> one<00:04:54.240> of

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
printing software it's actually one of

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.090 
printing software it's actually one of
the<00:04:54.389> nicer<00:04:54.690> ones<00:04:54.720> that<00:04:55.050> I've<00:04:55.139> used<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:55.500> far<00:04:55.710> so

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
the nicer ones that I've used so far so

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.650 
the nicer ones that I've used so far so
that's<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.430> form<00:04:56.669> 1<00:04:56.820> plus<00:04:56.850> I'm<00:04:57.389> really
