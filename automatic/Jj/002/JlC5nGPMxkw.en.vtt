00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.679
 so 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.630
 killer instinct who is not aware of this 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.670
 reprint never a great fighting game 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.179
 which is now available only under the side 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.220
 swan 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 Well, I say hello to you all 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.350
 my one point and today I would like you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.350
 tell about your opinion on this game 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:43.110
 just imagine the picture 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.360
 fighting 2013 get and pretty 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 positive evaluations of critics who should 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.100
 also onext gene in my fairy tale 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.500
 fans of this genre of games but that 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 turned out to be a failure and maybe you are listening 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.240
 now on that person but i'm not really 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 fan of fighting games like everything in childhood 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.130
 played marvel kombat and beijing is not the 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.440
 cool complicated list but for example i'm at 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.320
 the joys of life in general are all 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.720
 why what about killer instinct 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.850
 it turned out to be some kind of slag 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.400
 unfinished ringing out for free and this 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.680
 by the way says a lot about zbox market 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.270
 the fighting game generally turns out like you 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.670
 upload to your hard drive 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.369
 free game in the end for which you need 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.260
 pay yes yes yes just like in 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.630
 shareware casual games 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.670
 your downturn donuts and so here we have 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.220
 There is an expo that you need to earn for 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.259
 certain missions are there 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.900
 different characters that are bought either 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.899
 open like new skins 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.030
 everything is pretty simple and sounds good in 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.910
 a gift you are free to play in single player 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.580
 with a friend on 2 gamepads and in multiplayer 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.619
 what's the catch what I spodviglo 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.440
 write this text and voice you all 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.800
 it is in such a negative Tony 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.869
 and everything is just gameplay and I donâ€™t know how 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.450
 it came out but the game reminds me terribly 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.190
 street fighter here seems like battle mechanics 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.270
 based on twisted around 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.720
 combo buttons 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.940
 Yes, and the graphics looks like this combo 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.490
 I'm just up to both or still street 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.140
 fighter and many were buhurt and 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.290
 anal hemorrhage from these 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.730
 combo but then the apogee of the action came to 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.160
 full condition 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.980
 the controller needs to be taken almost up 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.890
 kicking this fucking combo out 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.340
 so also the controller's cross became 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.080
 Better but nothing helps you 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.900
 that many combos are done by 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.990
 a few clicks the cross is not in the side and 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.540
 diagonally and later meme class 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.830
 already ordinary buttons but so on 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.770
 xbox one controller 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 this click happens extremely hero 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.100
 and you do not perform a combo you are killing 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.660
 don't get xp and it all over again because it's not 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.310
 single character combo 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.890
 absolutely all of these people at all 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.560
 characters are made so that is from this 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.530
 not to leave and win without them is extremely difficult 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.440
 In general, I did not expect this drain 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.260
 up for free for this type of home 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.420
 games are cool but buy and it is clearly not 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.970
 would critics say it is very 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.790
 good application for a great fighting game 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.640
 but you need to modify it so only 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.190
 you need to refine a lot in general all 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.590
 I do not want to further delve into the discussion 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.110
 of this game and saying goodbye to you on this 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.660
 place in general thank you for your attention with you 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.000
 was van point who liked you know 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.810
 what to do but in good games not 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810
 forget to play 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.280
 job
