00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
even doing it myself in-game it's

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630 
even doing it myself in-game it's
actually<00:00:31.320> from<00:00:31.439> an<00:00:31.619> app<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> destiny<00:00:32.460> app

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640

you can be set to the volume button it

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.110 
you can be set to the volume button it
doesn't<00:02:58.830> really<00:02:58.920> matter<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.700> once<00:02:59.850> you<00:02:59.970> have

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
ships go over to your shaders and it'll

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.300 
ships go over to your shaders and it'll
show<00:03:15.210> all<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.810> shaders<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.230> you<00:03:16.590> have<00:03:16.830> as

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
show all the shaders that you have as

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.290 
show all the shaders that you have as
you<00:03:17.520> can<00:03:17.580> see<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.760> don't<00:03:17.970> really<00:03:18.120> have<00:03:18.270> that

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
you can see I don't really have that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.240 
you can see I don't really have that
many<00:03:18.600> but<00:03:18.780> they<00:03:18.870> are<00:03:18.989> quite<00:03:19.200> cool<00:03:19.470> next<00:03:20.160> you

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
many but they are quite cool next you

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.979 
many but they are quite cool next you
want<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.400> activate<00:03:20.820> your<00:03:20.940> auto<00:03:21.150> touch<00:03:21.510> macro

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
want to activate your auto touch macro

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.870 
want to activate your auto touch macro
so<00:03:22.260> whatever<00:03:22.620> button<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:22.980> say<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.340> press<00:03:23.700> that

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
so whatever button you say to press that

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.280 
so whatever button you say to press that
button<00:03:24.060> now<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:24.780> we're<00:03:24.959> going<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:25.170> be

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
button now and we're going to be

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.500 
button now and we're going to be
recording<00:03:25.680> a<00:03:25.980> macro<00:03:26.190> so<00:03:26.880> what<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.060> macro<00:03:27.390> is

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
recording a macro so what a macro is

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.479 
recording a macro so what a macro is
it's<00:03:27.720> basically<00:03:27.870> to<00:03:28.080> repeat<00:03:28.410> what<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:28.800> do<00:03:29.010> so

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
it's basically to repeat what we do so

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:32.660 
it's basically to repeat what we do so
select<00:03:29.730> a<00:03:30.120> shader<00:03:30.690> back<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.860> select<00:03:32.430> another

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
select a shader back out select another

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.510 
select a shader back out select another
shader<00:03:33.060> back<00:03:33.930> out<00:03:34.170> keep<00:03:34.830> repeating<00:03:35.130> this<00:03:35.370> over

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
shader back out keep repeating this over

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.949 
shader back out keep repeating this over
and<00:03:35.760> over<00:03:35.790> again<00:03:35.940> but<00:03:36.239> all<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.450> shaders<00:03:36.810> you

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
and over again but all the shaders you

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.660 
and over again but all the shaders you
want<00:03:37.200> as<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.650> see<00:03:37.739> we're<00:03:38.190> just<00:03:38.220> backing

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
want as you can see we're just backing

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.400 
want as you can see we're just backing
out<00:03:38.820> it's<00:03:39.300> going<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:39.510> record<00:03:39.870> us<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.260> when

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
out it's going to record us and when

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.660 
out it's going to record us and when
you're<00:03:40.530> happy<00:03:40.920> with<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.220> recording<00:03:41.340> you

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
you're happy with the recording you

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.340 
you're happy with the recording you
select<00:03:42.000> and<00:03:42.180> Shady's<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.540> want<00:03:42.690> end<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
select and Shady's you want end the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.650 
select and Shady's you want end the
recording<00:03:43.860> and<00:03:44.010> as<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.520> can<00:03:44.610> see<00:03:44.820> whenever<00:03:45.450> we

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
recording and as you can see whenever we

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.540 
recording and as you can see whenever we
want<00:03:45.870> we<00:03:46.050> can<00:03:46.200> activate<00:03:46.650> this<00:03:46.860> macro<00:03:47.280> at<00:03:47.400> any

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
want we can activate this macro at any

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.280 
want we can activate this macro at any
point<00:03:47.850> in<00:03:47.970> time<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.510> press<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> or<00:03:48.989> touch

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
point in time so press the or touch

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.440 
point in time so press the or touch
button<00:03:49.650> and<00:03:49.800> select<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> script<00:03:51.209> from<00:03:51.360> the

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
button and select the script from the

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.060 
button and select the script from the
thing<00:03:51.750> we're<00:03:51.959> going<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.110> replay<00:03:52.470> it<00:03:52.500> for<00:03:52.620> nine

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
thing we're going to replay it for nine

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.949 
thing we're going to replay it for nine
nine<00:03:53.280> nine<00:03:53.310> times<00:03:53.820> basically<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.750> is<00:03:54.930> just

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
nine nine times basically this is just

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.420 
nine nine times basically this is just
going<00:03:55.260> to<00:03:55.320> repeat<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.709> over<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.160> over<00:03:56.220> again

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
going to repeat it over and over again

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.910 
going to repeat it over and over again
and<00:03:56.870> basically<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.110> allows<00:03:58.440> us<00:03:58.470> to<00:03:58.709> actually

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
and basically this allows us to actually

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.020 
and basically this allows us to actually
play<00:03:59.400> xbox

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
play xbox

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.120 
play xbox
while<00:04:00.450> our<00:04:00.570> phone<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:01.290> cycles<00:04:01.680> through<00:04:01.890> the

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
while our phone just cycles through the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.979 
while our phone just cycles through the
shaders<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.270> can<00:04:03.360> see<00:04:03.420> it'll<00:04:03.780> change

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
shaders and as you can see it'll change

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.420 
shaders and as you can see it'll change
the<00:04:04.170> shaders<00:04:04.530> for<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.860> I'm<00:04:05.010> not<00:04:05.130> actually

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
the shaders for you I'm not actually

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.190 
the shaders for you I'm not actually
touching<00:04:05.550> my<00:04:05.850> iPhone<00:04:06.239> at<00:04:06.360> this<00:04:06.510> point<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:07.140> is

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
touching my iPhone at this point this is

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.780 
touching my iPhone at this point this is
actually<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.709> touch<00:04:08.040> doing<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.400> so<00:04:08.520> as<00:04:08.610> you<00:04:08.670> can

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
actually I touch doing it so as you can

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.810 
actually I touch doing it so as you can
see<00:04:09.230> my<00:04:10.230> phone<00:04:10.500> is<00:04:10.680> basically<00:04:10.950> on<00:04:11.160> my<00:04:11.310> desk<00:04:11.550> I'm

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
see my phone is basically on my desk I'm

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.729 
see my phone is basically on my desk I'm
not<00:04:12.000> touching<00:04:12.420> it<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.660> it's<00:04:13.320> just<00:04:13.500> cycling

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
not touching it and it's just cycling

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.830 
not touching it and it's just cycling
through<00:04:14.130> with<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.640> macro<00:04:15.090> over<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.660> over

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
through with the macro over and over

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.509 
through with the macro over and over
again<00:04:15.900> selecting<00:04:16.590> different<00:04:16.769> shaders<00:04:17.160> as

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
again selecting different shaders as

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.300 
again selecting different shaders as
I've<00:04:18.060> seen<00:04:18.330> and<00:04:18.780> as<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.019> can<00:04:19.109> see<00:04:19.169> my<00:04:19.799> TV<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.190> on
