00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 catherine simon muscle maker goes today 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.850
 It's about a biceps workout with you 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.519
 at the same time your back 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.500
 trained and although it is an exercise the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.540
 I like to do my own 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 body weight currently not sufficient unless 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.780
 I had to somehow 95 kilo wien that 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 I really like him on the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
 That's why I get too muscle 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.670
 support here in dipps belt of 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.890
 ganes the shop the gypsum in muscle macher 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.510
 and can you not wonderful 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.439
 only for the tips you can use the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.480
 but you can of course 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.580
 especially in the field of pull-ups 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.929
 use and I use this well 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.399
 always a very peculiar kind 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.110
 and wise I know that there are many 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.739
 athlete gives education differently for him 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.030
 I always go through here first 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.420
 you have here for example a ten kilo 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420
 disc 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.400
 so 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.140
 Now all I have to do is watch it 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.580
 not at critical altitude 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.320
 wonderful I like all this like this 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.340
 pressure here in the lower back area too 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.080
 also have a bit on the 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.090
 That's why it's so important for him 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.350
 tips for rear wider is now see 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.810
 I stand there as it is now mine 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.030
 body weight at about 95 kilo approximately 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.190
 84 kilo even brings on the scales 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.270
 Ten kilos and here we say 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.640
 that's another kilo 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.690
 Now I'm sugar at the 95 kilo and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.490
 Now I have the possibility with it 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.710
 to do pull-ups for the burden 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.880
 to get stronger on the biceps 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.320
 I show the pulls under attack 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.369
 you simply times as you can give me 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.590
 just watch it 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.090
 It is always important that you are in front of it 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.830
 Beginning of the movement the ideal 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.510
 reach for me is that now 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.560
 not necessarily the ideal private 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.330
 I 'm always relatively critical 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.009
 If the device were expressed I would like 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.700
 Having a bit closer is easy 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.530
 to do with 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.600
 because you see the grip should be about 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.580
 would like to shoulder level so 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.540
 shoulder width grip that is now here 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.860
 a little more 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.540
 but I leave the whole here now 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.979
 do not break and start now 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.420
 just with the movement 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.490
 and you will soon see that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.490
 Reiz is relatively strong on the biceps 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.150
 so 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.170
 Of course, I'm not up to that 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.670
 gone painful 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.650
 For now I'm only concerned about you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.019
 to show that very important in the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.370
 move about guilty worker's grip 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.019
 it was a small one for me now 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.780
 a little bit more than shoulder width then 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.680
 very important just trying at the 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.750
 so overcoming moves 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.480
 one and a half to two seconds 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.610
 spend and muscle stretch 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.730
 So in the eccentric condition 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 about twice the time two to three 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.069
 seconds 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.010
 so that the muscle of the biceps also straight 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.510
 really nice stretch is now the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.069
 ten kilo entrance could still be one 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.049
 a little bit higher but just one 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.910
 slow motion achievement wonderful 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.519
 then the biceps also just above the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 strip only immediately in growth stimulus 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.180
 That's a really good exercise 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.220
 for example, the transition from 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.709
 Back training to arm training too 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.390
 because just because both muscle groups 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.870
 I'm also trained 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.310
 again 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.900
 That's why I would suggest here 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.500
 We'll see you in the next video 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.500
 many greetings
