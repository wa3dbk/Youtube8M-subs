tray<00:00:01.709> phase<00:00:01.920> hooked<00:00:02.190> up<00:00:02.600> there<00:00:03.600> as<00:00:03.870> well<00:00:07.940> still

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
tray phase hooked up there as well still

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.100 
tray phase hooked up there as well still
have<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.150> figure<00:00:09.300> out<00:00:09.510> whether<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.840> is<00:00:09.900> the

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
have to figure out whether this is the

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.950 
have to figure out whether this is the
invite<00:00:10.349> for<00:00:10.380> out<00:00:10.710> but<00:00:10.889> I<00:00:11.070> think<00:00:11.219> that's<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
invite for out but I think that's the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:18.529 
invite for out but I think that's the
suction<00:00:12.960> side<00:00:13.190> but<00:00:14.190> get<00:00:14.309> it<00:00:14.400> right<00:00:14.549> one<00:00:14.700> day<00:00:17.539> at

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
suction side but get it right one day at

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.269 
suction side but get it right one day at
a<00:00:18.600> man

I've just cleaned it up a bit those
things<00:00:22.830> lived<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.250> sea<00:00:23.430> container<00:00:23.820> for<00:00:24.529> six

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
things lived in a sea container for six

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.400 
things lived in a sea container for six
years<00:00:25.829> only<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.369> only<00:00:26.490> six<00:00:26.759> years<00:00:26.849> old<00:00:27.410> see

years only it's only six years old see
here<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.770> first<00:00:29.189> run<00:00:32.540> haven't<00:00:33.540> actually

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:33.629 
here we go first run haven't actually

00:00:33.629 --> 00:01:06.719 
here we go first run haven't actually
tested<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.170> yet<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.559> see<00:00:34.680> how<00:00:34.769> we<00:00:34.829> go

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:26.270 

smelly

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.160 

Oh<00:01:26.340> rowdy<00:01:27.270> I've<00:01:27.600> just<00:01:27.840> swapped<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
Oh rowdy I've just swapped the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.020 
Oh rowdy I've just swapped the
three-phase<00:01:28.560> leads<00:01:28.860> around<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.729> engine

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
three-phase leads around so the engine

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.750 
three-phase leads around so the engine
runs<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.390> Reverse<00:01:30.740> and<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.190> it<00:01:32.280> sounds<00:01:32.460> any

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
runs in Reverse and see if it sounds any

00:01:32.760 --> 00:02:46.450 
runs in Reverse and see if it sounds any
different

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:46.460 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.040 

hmmm<00:02:47.460> I<00:02:47.670> think<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.480> thing's<00:02:48.660> really<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.020> a

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
hmmm I think this thing's really is a

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.770 
hmmm I think this thing's really is a
power<00:02:49.310> she<00:02:50.310> runs<00:02:50.460> real<00:02:50.700> well<00:02:50.880> just<00:02:51.540> need<00:02:51.660> to

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
power she runs real well just need to

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.170 
power she runs real well just need to
find<00:02:51.990> out<00:02:52.170> which<00:02:52.350> way<00:02:52.590> this<00:02:53.520> engine<00:02:53.760> s<00:02:54.000> there

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
find out which way this engine s there

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.120 
find out which way this engine s there
under<00:02:54.360> make<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.600> little<00:02:54.840> pump<00:02:55.050> properly<00:02:55.260> I'm

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
under make this little pump properly I'm

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.980 
under make this little pump properly I'm
not<00:02:56.430> sure<00:02:56.640> whether<00:02:56.850> that's<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.330> pickup<00:02:57.720> or

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
not sure whether that's the pickup or

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that's the pickup inside there in the

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:00.440 
that's the pickup inside there in the
housing

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
housing

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.030 
housing
I'd<00:03:01.260> say<00:03:01.410> that's<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.680> filter<00:03:03.590> mmm<00:03:04.590> interesting

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
I'd say that's a filter mmm interesting

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.100 
I'd say that's a filter mmm interesting
gotta<00:03:05.940> figure<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.240> out<00:03:06.480> maybe<00:03:06.690> ever<00:03:06.900> pull<00:03:07.080> a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
gotta figure this out maybe ever pull a

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.110 
gotta figure this out maybe ever pull a
line<00:03:07.350> off<00:03:07.500> here<00:03:07.710> I'll<00:03:07.830> be<00:03:07.920> able<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.160> see<00:03:08.400> what

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
line off here I'll be able to see what

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.220 
line off here I'll be able to see what
are<00:03:09.150> there<00:03:09.300> any<00:03:09.420> oils<00:03:09.780> moving<00:03:10.730> anyway<00:03:12.230> next

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
are there any oils moving anyway next

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.910 
are there any oils moving anyway next
step<00:03:13.560> something<00:03:13.830> else<00:03:14.100> thanks<00:03:14.460> for<00:03:14.580> watching
