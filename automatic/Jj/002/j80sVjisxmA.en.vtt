00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
classic representation it seems like

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.260 
classic representation it seems like
like<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.130> riders<00:06:31.490> series<00:06:31.910> has<00:06:32.090> more

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
like the riders series has more

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.910 
like the riders series has more
representation<00:06:32.660> than<00:06:33.200> the<00:06:33.650> classics<00:06:34.130> do<00:06:34.310> but

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:35.920 
representation than the classics do but

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.860 
representation than the classics do but
