00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.359 
which I think you're still gonna happen
and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.259> may<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.439> five<00:01:34.710> members<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.189> that's

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
and it may be five members so that's

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.219 
and it may be five members so that's
nine<00:01:35.670> members<00:01:36.030> obeys<00:01:36.329> gonna<00:01:36.570> lose<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> day
