00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 the gin room is a lounge 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.180
 relatively small in question of 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.490
 size but also present 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.950
 numerous novelties serves as an annual appointment 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.259
 to the entire automotive industry from 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.810
 the large corporations with numerous 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:24.020
 generalist or premium brands up to 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640
 small craft builders 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.359
 tuning specialists and even the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.580
 small body shops, especially Italians 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.890
 in this video we are going to review 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.110
 everything that is not normally seen 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.780
 a hall of this type the most cars 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.750
 curious the funniest the most 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.180
 specials but if we had to start 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.549
 this report somewhere was fair 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.280
 here behind me the car that more 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:53.079
 Expectation has lifted the Ferrari 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.449
 forgive the ferrari 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.829
 This is the aspect presented by the 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.070
 Ferrari stand Geneva Motor Show 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:04.000
 since its inauguration a lot of people 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.090
 an authentic wall covering Ferrari 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.250
 the most spectacular car without a place 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.030
 doubts of the sample we give you some 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.399
 fast data the enzo's successor has 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.740
 a v12 engine placed in position 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:21.670
 6.3 liters back central 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.039
 only 800 horses to them we must add 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.310
 a Kers system similar to the one 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.100
 used in formula1 that contributes 163 others 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.649
 electric horses benefits 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.350
 as you can imagine are infarct 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:39.340
 from 0 to 100 in less than three seconds and 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:43.690
 from 0 to 200 in less than 7 and from 0 to 300 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.789
 also in just 15 seconds 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.610
 we are before the serial ferrari 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.150
 fast never built 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.000
 you like it, you want one 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.670
 difficult this ferrari costs a million 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.600
 euros but that's not the problem the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.220
 problem is that only 499 will be made and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:08.310
 they are all sold the organization of the 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.250
 Geneva lounge awarded to Ferrari 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 some unusual privileges for 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.860
 example organize your press conference in 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.840
 the best time at 12 noon and without 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.580
 no other competition because here the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.550
 press conferences are always two in 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.380
 two before such a show of strength 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.390
 his rival whenever he could do 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.480
 lamborghini to try to eclipse a 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.630
 little to the ferrari as this you are 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.950
 seeing the poison in the background is a 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.780
 sale dor a tad more powerful and with a 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.730
 sophisticated body that you are looking for 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.890
 affect especially in the section 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.130
 aerodynamic looks like a car from le mans 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.770
 with that shark rear fin a 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.970
 spoiler of spectacular proportions and 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.760
 a tremendous frontal 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.510
 is not more powerful than the Ferrari but if 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:01.910
 it's more expensive and more exclusive three 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.480
 million euros for only three 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.819
 owners 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.159
 if in Ferrari it was difficult to have a 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:13.150
 privileged view of his new work 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:15.489
 teacher the same thing happens more or less in 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.950
 mclaren at the manufacturer's stand 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:22.390
 British behind all these legs 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.120
 is the p1 your new super car the only 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.160
 that can get in trouble on track and 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.569
 on the road to the new beast of 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.349
 maranello the p1 is a car of 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.620
 carbon with central engine v8 and also 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:40.720
 support of a kers type formula 1 the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.140
 combination of both propellants give 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.140
 this hybrid so special 900 horses 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.230
 of power its accelerations are 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.579
 comparable to those of the Ferrari but 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.879
 gives two seconds in the 0 to 300 game 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:00.099
 they would care about this information to the 375 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:02.270
 lucky owners who know what 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.870
 may allow 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.720
 and bugatti to all that then practically 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.090
 nothing the brand of the volkswagen group follows 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.270
 placing his last units of 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.130
 veyron in grand vitesse and announced in the 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.650
 night before the celebration of 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.870
 contest a special version decorated 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.810
 by the French conceptual artist 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.090
 bernard bennett 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.550
 that version however for some 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.550
 mysterious motive was not in the state 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.020
 why 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.580
 the one that was and very well accompanied 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.580
 by the way of the Italian actress gina 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.730
 lollobrÃ­gida was don horacio pagani the 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.540
 creator of this masterpiece is about 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:52.560
 del guaira a central engine model 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.000
 Mercedes and 730 horses capable of 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.610
 compete with the best 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.980
 super sports of the east market 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.230
 small builder craftsmanship bet 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.280
 by the carbon chassis in the 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.930
 active aerodynamics and an aesthetic 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.249
 absolutely breathtaking as the 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.189
 gina dress 

00:05:09.249 --> 00:05:15.339
 when we talk about supercars of 

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:17.169
 authentic super sports records 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:19.839
 of speed begin to be quite 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.239
 interesting especially in the face of 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:23.319
 promotion of cars 

00:05:21.239 --> 00:05:26.019
 recently pagani had some 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.059
 quibble about it since its 

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:30.579
 wire and beat the track record of the 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.709
 British program top gear more than 

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:34.089
 famous all over the world but then it 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:36.849
 discovered that the car was wearing 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:39.219
 racing tires something the 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.869
 own program does not match in its 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:45.549
 regulation but if we talk about records 

00:05:42.869 --> 00:05:50.169
 nothing better than the ones you 've got 

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:53.049
 this car is the can ixe that will put a 

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:57.549
 completely carbon version of the 

00:05:53.049 --> 00:06:03.459
 This car is capable of accelerating 

00:05:57.549 --> 00:06:08.229
 from 0 to 300 in 1453 seconds of braking 

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:13.539
 from 300 to 0 in 666 and to do the 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:14.650
 complete play 0 300 0 in 21 to 19 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.770
 seconds 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.260
 to get it mount a v8 engine 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:26.540
 own design of 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:29.660
 one thousand 140 horses neither one more nor one less 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.540
 paganini with ixe 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.750
 and gta 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:36.940
 and this is a Spanish company that 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.220
 finally he has managed to make reality 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.820
 a dream that he had for several years 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.760
 in gestation and you can already buy a 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.830
 gta spanked a car 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.720
 better than I want what the 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.060
 Sunday eight the CEO of the 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:54.380
 good company because the car you have 

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.910
 for example here my back is already a 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.540
 car to deliver to the customer is a 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.770
 car that we will deliver in a few months 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.940
 but it is really managed already because 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.280
 we still have some small ones 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:06.170
 aspects of definition but really 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.440
 we have reached a stage of development 

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:11.360
 end where we have a car that we're going 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.960
 among customers with 930 horses 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.800
 finally with a new sequential box 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.530
 automatic robotic seven 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.270
 speeds with a few tweaks 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.360
 aesthetic with respect to what we had 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:25.040
 so far in the prototypes and good and 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.600

 with all the last minute systems of 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.880
 last generation installed ready now 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.320
 for the enjoyment of our customers

 in very limited series here in Geneva 

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:59.150
