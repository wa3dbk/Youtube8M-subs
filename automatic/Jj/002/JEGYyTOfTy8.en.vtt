00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.040
 hello friends filmed in dna 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.610
 today I will show information for 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:26.700
 beginner beekeepers here look 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:32.100
 the bees do something they punish 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:37.140
 thieves of other people see you caught them and 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:41.200
 about the account of these beads hairs 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.920
 the bee becomes higher and then she 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.640
 never water they never kill 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.640
 letter pressed here so punished 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.129
 and this is a sign that coals are here 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:01.059
 bees fall 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:06.520
 somehow strangers 10 probably coil 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:10.810
 Does this grandfather have a family? 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:15.270
 one good side lives 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:20.860
 and here I have 2 of all empty and 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:23.800
 It turns out I put for 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.850
 crystallized honey a couple of frames 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.979
 the result is nothing scary here 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.270
 maybe the bees just popped out 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:35.670
 but nevertheless u now removed the frame with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.440
 honey was 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 represented she bothered me and forgot 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.149
 to remove 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.470
 Well, it is necessary that there were no gaps wrong 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:50.970
 i.e. it provokes theft 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.250
 and then if the family is not weak can 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:59.290
 thieves plunder the whole family 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.000
 destroy before new meetings come on 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.130
 connection and model of what point ru 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.130
 By the way, whoever interested, came out my new 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.640
