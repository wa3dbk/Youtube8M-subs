00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
cooperation with a messiah for us is

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.850 
cooperation with a messiah for us is
that<00:01:19.220> we<00:01:20.000> have<00:01:20.270> we<00:01:20.990> have<00:01:21.020> very<00:01:21.350> powerful

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:21.860 
that we have we have very powerful

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.350 
that we have we have very powerful
software<00:01:22.130> suite<00:01:22.580> called<00:01:22.850> still<00:01:23.150> service

software suite called still service

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.510 
software suite called still service
engine<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.870> allows<00:01:24.140> you<00:01:24.350> to<00:01:24.560> do<00:01:24.710> basically

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
engine it allows you to do basically

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.010 
engine it allows you to do basically
three<00:01:25.760> different<00:01:26.090> layers<00:01:26.240> on<00:01:26.600> what<00:01:26.780> we<00:01:26.900> have

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
three different layers on what we have

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.290 
three different layers on what we have
on<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.260> ship<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:27.880> and<00:01:28.880> that<00:01:29.120> is

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
on the ship right now and that is

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.740 
on the ship right now and that is
actually<00:01:29.480> being<00:01:29.980> being<00:01:30.980> constructed<00:01:31.970> now<00:01:32.150> for

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
actually being being constructed now for

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.790 
actually being being constructed now for
the<00:01:32.960> MSI<00:01:33.380> laptop<00:01:35.260> that<00:01:36.260> will<00:01:36.410> that<00:01:36.740> will

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
the MSI laptop that will that will

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.710 
the MSI laptop that will that will
basically<00:01:37.040> mean<00:01:37.430> that<00:01:37.610> any<00:01:37.790> poke<00:01:38.090> any<00:01:38.420> key<00:01:38.690> on

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
basically mean that any poke any key on

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.320 
basically mean that any poke any key on
the<00:01:39.260> laptop<00:01:39.620> will<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.860> programmable<00:01:40.310> for<00:01:41.120> very

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
the laptop will be programmable for very

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.880 
the laptop will be programmable for very
advanced<00:01:41.660> macros<00:01:42.170> everything<00:01:42.620> can<00:01:42.770> be

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
advanced macros everything can be

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.680 
advanced macros everything can be
remapped<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.700> all<00:01:43.910> of<00:01:44.030> this<00:01:44.120> these<00:01:44.480> things

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
remapped and all of this these things

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.270 
remapped and all of this these things
can<00:01:44.870> be<00:01:44.900> done<00:01:44.990> on<00:01:45.230> the<00:01:45.320> fly<00:01:45.530> and<00:01:45.980> more

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
can be done on the fly and more

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.440 
can be done on the fly and more
importantly<00:01:46.760> they<00:01:46.910> will<00:01:46.970> actually<00:01:47.300> have<00:01:47.420> a

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
importantly they will actually have a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.600 
importantly they will actually have a
statistics<00:01:48.050> module<00:01:48.470> that<00:01:49.070> will<00:01:49.250> literally

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
statistics module that will literally

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.140 
statistics module that will literally
help<00:01:50.120> improve<00:01:50.750> game<00:01:51.110> performance<00:01:52.030> it's<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
help improve game performance it's a

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.820 
help improve game performance it's a
very<00:01:53.330> intelligent<00:01:53.570> module<00:01:54.110> all<00:01:54.230> going<00:01:54.530> and
