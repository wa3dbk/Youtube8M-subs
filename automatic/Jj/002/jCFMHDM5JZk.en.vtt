00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.389
 The guys on YouTube 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.429
 together and once again the staff 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.130
 I'm going back today talking about it. 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 of the canary production reproduction 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.329
 Belgian 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.759
 in this delicate time is where 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:23.789
 enough of the water so it's talking a 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.949
 bit of my of my handling even though I 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.059
 I learned over time that you are creating 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.069
 hair right 

00:00:27.059 --> 00:00:30.029
 management that I do at the time of 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.309
 reproduction 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.460
 I realized too that the Internet we 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.980
 do not have the hot information that on the day 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 by day but a is more that that thing 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.059
 even the one that they pay you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.309
 that beans and rice 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.050
 then in the scut one finds in the day to day the 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.390
 people are faced with many issues that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.749
 We get a little lost so I'll go 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.909
 happening to you here a little of the 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:56.339
 than what I learned than I did 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.859
 lived in the reproduction of Belgian canary 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:00:59.760
 so the staff 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.550
 production of white shrimp 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.700
 Is not something difficult you need to have one? 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.310
 clear logical healthy couple right 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.070
 a healthy couple with large cage 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.280
 mean you are already managing to make the 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.180
 reproduction in an interesting way 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.939
 So how to do this when you do not 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.860
 will confess then both male reproduction 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.509
 as the female will have to be ready 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.479
 But you're going to have to be singing beauty. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.090
 It's going to have to be fire affects in your self. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.280
 I'm not your ape, eh? 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.770
 Let's say so it has to be 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.869
 prepared to detect the asking place 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.189
 to detect make mill 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.789
 so this is something we will have 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.750
 observing observation observes 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.259
 on a daily basis 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.490
 so what to use first as 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:54.439
 I already spoke in a medium-sized cage 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:57.270
 provides bonding to it provides tow cap 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.909
 sisal this will depend on each one 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.710
 so you'll see I was not observing 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.560
 if she will be if she will be 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.899
 taking cooking only if she is 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.030
 giving a little joke or it's already chirping 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.420
 It's beating like that but it's singing. 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.620
 well for her this is an indication that 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.380
 already will itself playback watching 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 that sound stands out 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.959
 it is worth remembering that the question of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.940
 feeding area if it is loose with 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.830
 balanced feed 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.290
 the mineral is interesting a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.660
 multivitamin in the water at the beginning of this 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.739
 reproduction phase is quite 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:43.170
 interesting then watching it on 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.099
 female beating piano wing at decade stands 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.840
 soft 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.080
 Did you realize that you were drinking too much 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.750
 water and if I learned from some colleagues 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.660
 researching and and there is true and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.150
 interesting observation then it will 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.230
 to be preparing for the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.440
 reproduction 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:07.170
 what to do thereafter their 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.910
 best computer or you like it 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.670
 goes of the choice of each one 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.790
 slope near it is not interesting 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.070
 sometimes vote together because you can 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.230
 happen in compatibility 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.390
 so it's interesting to leave the side he 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.579
 will sing to it you will realize that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.519
 she goes down if he is at the point 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:29.640
 so that's all it is to put together if 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.320
 for a gala scheme will come back and 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.350
 I do not find it interesting, I prefer the 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.989
 mating then they do that way 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.620
 with it the other side is observed are 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.540
 exchanging food exchanged personal food there 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.690
 already indicates that it may be 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.910
 already accepted the other is love is the cut 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.079
 I find it interesting that I think a lot of myself 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:55.319
 even in the Belgian canary then you can 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.450
 put together with edson make no 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:01.319
 I think that will make the fault will cross 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:04.019
 female and soon after she is doing 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.620
 the posture and it is good to be careful in 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:09.600
 interesting observation always note that 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.319
 she made a nest 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.750
 if she did not make one thousand it's good to drink 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:20.760
 care after birth that I can 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.830
 the formation of the puppies may occur 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.040
 not have made nests is very 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:30.120
 and the pups have already happened with 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:33.570
 of atrophying the paws for not having 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.000
 for not having support does not have union support 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.850
 happens is something that happens on the day 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.650
 The day that we do not sell research 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:47.370
 from the internet or goes on 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:50.970
 time in the sun happens the bird pass 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.400
 pass a bad pass with sudden illness and 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.400
 found it was something that 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.400
 happened to me in my experience I 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.260
 I'm passing you silver and avoiding 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.910
 to avoid drafts at this time. 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.430
 noise leaving gaza in a suitable place 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:13.290
 easy to handle without much noise and 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.570
 patience patience because it is nature 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.430
 who decides no matter how we had the 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.780
 I like it, so we have to 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.260
 be careful we have to have a 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.020
 handling and such but is patience because it is 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.810
 the nature that decides the course 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.570
 she chooses each time more 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:35.130
 basically this is what I hope it passes 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:37.620
 for you to leave in a clear way as it is 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.720
 production and personal observation has to 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.520
 observe enough you will realize that 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.140
 she will ask for a gala 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.750
 You'll realize you'll see the 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:49.830
 confectionery in it and put the 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:53.040
 male ready he crossed is a short time 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.820
 You have cub and tub are three days. 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:59.280
 It's good to be careful. It 's basically that. 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.530
 There's nothing special about it, there's no 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:06.810
 good a good supplementation a good 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:10.500
 power is that important of ddd 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.290
 chance of success in reproduction 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:17.100
 this video this video that pass this 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:18.930
 for you who is not this seven-beast 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.340
 is a simple thing is to 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:22.950
 food 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.590
 the mineral food is all right 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.800
 can also enter fillet reproduction 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.690
 everyone both male and female 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:37.030
 care without too much stress on chain 

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:39.820
 Wind observation and that 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:42.070
 and I just have patience that everything everything 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.340
 happens naturally 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.870
 I hope to pass out to you rather 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:51.340
 knowledge this video is more focused 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:53.860
 for the beginner to the same person is that 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:57.100
 who has that doubt as I had as 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:01.360
 I had and could not do it. 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:06.240
 information I needed on the internet 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.240
 so I hope to help you, it's okay
