00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.969
 I want more 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.390
 very good to all and welcome to me 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.890
 channel I am capi or pinto today I bring you a 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.500
 cheap equipment this time a hybrid team 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.509
 of the Bundesliga with three players 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.430
 the barclays as you see is a team that 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:27.439
 many havre players is tested is 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.090
 a very competitive team a team with 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.740
 which has been able to climb from the second 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.930
 division forgiveness from the sixth division 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.610
 until the second division good 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.620
 you ask why you go down for a subject of 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.660
 do a little the fool we try to do 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.879
 skills but good and being a second 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.800
 I still surrender to a very very good level and 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.960
 as you see in goal I have adler is a 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.570
 incredible goalkeeper the truth and we tried 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.180
 noyer and adler I think a very porter 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.710
 seemed almost the same I think if 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.539
 there are not too many coins 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.010
 Adler is the ideal goalkeeper for both a 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.260
 Bundesliga team as for a 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.480
 German team then in defense 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.579
 I have water tennis felipe santana 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.860
 could be the alternative or are the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.780
 alternative to dante ya hume in yes we 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.130
 they like it a lot as it is my case to me 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.710
 the players seem a bit slow 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.479
 talking about hummels and dante and I think that 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.340
 both wathen and felipe santana have 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.009
 a terrific pace to make central 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.990
 they are very high they go very well up and 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.860
 they also steal the ball in a way 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.070
 brutal they go very well 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.560
 I never have found very top 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.420
 not be a corner and I think 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 two central ones of the best there are in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.659
 last as for bands I have schmelzer 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.880
 ya rafinha 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.710
 if you ask or if you think they are 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.469
 two slow players I assure you that 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.479
 for nothing are two very fast laterals 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:41.890
 they seemed to me very fast besides going up 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.259
 the attack I liked the shot 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.459
 that has especially the schmelzer and 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.259
 then for good it does not go very well 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.179
 up the truth but it's not going very well 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.540
 ball that is a fundamental requirement 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.400
 for the sides 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.050
 after defensive midfielder I have a 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.150
 jaime martinez and ramires in a 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.350
 beginning I wanted to put luis gustavo already 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.210
 ramírez but for a theme of 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.580
 rapport with mandzukic because no 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.810
 I could put it but good to start 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.150
 Talking about Ramírez, it seems like a 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.700
 defensive midfielder very very good very 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.320
 full he is that he has it all though 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.100
 in his statistics it seems that he does not have 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.170
 and it's not a big chut I love that I do not have 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.970
 a great shot is brutal the shot that has 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.770
 already happened in fifa 13 and it's a real 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.260
 checked a player who will serve you 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.260
 so much to attack you if you get caught 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.930
 against or to defend you if you get caught in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.850
 one against the opposing team is a 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.290
 offensive center incredible forgiveness and if not 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.990
 you have tried it because you are losing 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.790
 to a great midfielder of the game and then 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.530
 his side jaime martínez that after 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.060
 put a bit to force me 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.820
 finishing quite liking quite 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.760
 sorry I think the only thing that is missing is 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.459
 a bit of rhythm and a tad a tad 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 just shooting because still in the shot 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.840
 I thought it was pretty good, it's a great 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.760
 player about everything scored me three 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.010
 field rooms forward on 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.230
 all in areas not within the area 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.569
 but on the edge of the area a little 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.159
 to give passes from there overlooked what 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.260
 does perfectly having these two 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:07.260
 great and so high players that I have 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.510
 of forwards and above all so what 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.819
 the most outstanding is undoubtedly at the time of 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.129
 defend and defend a corner above 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.080
 and after hundreds of defenders I have 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.400
 offensive elements sorry I have to 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.739
 draxler 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.930
 de bruijn I think you call this one 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.190
 bruijn are two large 900 defensive 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.950
 so 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.600
 and players who are very tied have 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.090
 surprised most players of 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.800
 ultimate team that have started playing or 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.530
 who had previously played 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.750
 seemed like two incredible players have 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.940
 the 253 of bad leg and four 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.590
 filigree stars so if you 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.480
 like to do a little filigree or you're 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.480
 things are very agile players 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.770
 they have a lot of dribbling and then alter the 5 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.570
 of bad legs so much if you go by 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:50.520
 side and end up centering you interprete 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.500
 inward and ended up crashing they go to 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.210
 do perfectly because I already say what I have 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.800
 tried a lot that and they are the 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.630
 players that yes if you do not have five 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.280
 bad leg stars because if I have 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.540
 in the leg that chute or as they do 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.640
 inside they will end up putting a 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.670
 brutal zambombazo and very possibly 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.200
 I ended up scoring goal in the end two 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.460
 incredible players that if you do not what 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.380
 have you tried I encourage you to try it 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.590
 because they are very cheap and they are very 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.570
 boys as I say track led and ebro and 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.510
 then in the front I have two 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.580
 brutal beasts the truth 20 kingman 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 chucky to start inside because I 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:25.710
 it seems an incredible forward is a 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.630
 very high player a player is very 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.340
 tempted you were already expecting that you were 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.810
 since before he began the game 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.750
 although people really wanted 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.820
 make more expensive but it 's very very cheap and 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.370
 then manzulli then a player that without 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.420
 doubt stands out for its headbuttons 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.830
 comparing them by their would say that 20 that 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.690
 he seems a faster player although the 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.160
 true the speed of marczuk and neither 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.860
 it is far behind but it is that 20 is 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.230
 very very dress a very beast player that 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.000
 if he starts running, he seems to have 90 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.280
 of rhythm practically when you're from the 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.290
 feeling that has given me to me comes 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.150
 stagnant very very large they have a lot 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.490
 power the time to run and in 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.990
 definitive a very very good rhythm then 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.520
 in the shot the two are very similar 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.020
 but despite the fact that it is more chic according to their 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.690
 statistics have more rhythm more shot 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.030
 I forgive the mind shot that I love 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:12.240
 the chute as subtle where you're going to 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.010
 remove very strong and very placed and about 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.810
 all his shot a straight shot and a very shot 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.250
 powerful I love the mind that the shot 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.050
 I do not really like it that much, but still 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.490
 so he does it quite well and 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.100
 after more upload then it has as the 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.170
 ink scare good but it's the shooter 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.240
 insane who forgives seemed more powerful 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.250
 and then above because they play it very 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.500
 good but more chic yes I like more 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.639
 has a very good jump earn many 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.370
 Sometimes it is very difficult 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.229
 and well, two brutal strikers and 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.580
 I encourage you to this team because I 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.830
 I assure that it will work very well 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.270
 I have a couple of friends who have already 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.249
 done and they're telling me that it has 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.349
 rendered at a very good level that has 

00:05:46.249 --> 00:05:49.999
 liked it a lot and they will not sell it 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.650
 because the truth is getting them 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:53.479
 climb up division is very quickly and 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.520
 without losing practically any party 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:57.560
 as I say it has a very strong defense 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.810
 of hundreds of troops that serve both 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.340
 to attack as to defend and four 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.110
 players up here that are going to hit you 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.659
 a camera you are going to score a goal 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.550
 surely a boy left it to him 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.599
 how many goals for you to see what is 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.090
 able to make this equipment to try 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:12.560
 convince them even more if possible 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:15.110
 that you have this team because it is very 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.659
 very good and nothing I hope he says to the 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:21.219
 aik that subscribe to the channel and it's not in 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:21.219
 the next video until soon
