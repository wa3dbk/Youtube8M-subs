Channel today I am going to show you how
to<00:00:21.590> build<00:00:21.860> a<00:00:22.040> beautiful<00:00:22.520> ring<00:00:22.760> using<00:00:23.119> Miyake

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
to build a beautiful ring using Miyake

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.499 
to build a beautiful ring using Miyake
curves<00:00:24.259> as<00:00:25.009> you<00:00:25.220> can<00:00:25.400> see<00:00:25.580> is<00:00:25.700> very<00:00:25.820> good<00:00:26.180> and

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
curves as you can see is very good and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.900 
curves as you can see is very good and
the<00:00:26.660> making<00:00:26.930> off<00:00:27.080> is<00:00:27.259> not<00:00:27.470> quite<00:00:27.740> difficult<00:00:27.980> so

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
the making off is not quite difficult so

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.550 
the making off is not quite difficult so
let's<00:00:29.119> take<00:00:29.390> a<00:00:29.420> look<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:29.990> material<00:00:30.410> we

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
let's take a look to the material we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:38.200 
let's take a look to the material we
need<00:00:35.590> we<00:00:36.590> need<00:00:36.620> three<00:00:37.100> millimeter<00:00:37.699> Mayu

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
need we need three millimeter Mayu

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:49.160 
need we need three millimeter Mayu
ki-chul's<00:00:38.930> choosing<00:00:39.769> your<00:00:39.920> favorite<00:00:40.129> colors

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.310 

then<00:00:50.170> we<00:00:50.320> need<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.500> needle<00:00:50.829> 3<00:00:51.790> meters<00:00:52.120> of<00:00:52.360> Miyake

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
then we need a needle 3 meters of Miyake

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.140 
then we need a needle 3 meters of Miyake
drag<00:00:53.980> in<00:00:54.850> my<00:00:54.880> case<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.239> choose<00:00:55.600> Nemo<00:00:56.230> thread<00:00:56.590> and

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
drag in my case I choose Nemo thread and

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.830 
drag in my case I choose Nemo thread and
the<00:00:58.150> scissors

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
the scissors

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:11.410 
the scissors
that's<00:00:59.559> all<00:00:59.770> so<00:01:00.160> let's<00:01:00.370> get<00:01:00.520> started

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.330 

I<00:01:13.060> already<00:01:14.060> threaded<00:01:14.659> the<00:01:15.020> needle<00:01:15.050> so<00:01:15.830> I<00:01:15.860> start

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
I already threaded the needle so I start

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:24.280 
I already threaded the needle so I start
inserting<00:01:16.700> three<00:01:17.180> cubes<00:01:22.600> as<00:01:23.600> you<00:01:23.810> can<00:01:23.990> guess

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
inserting three cubes as you can guess

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:30.880 
inserting three cubes as you can guess
this<00:01:25.130> is<00:01:25.310> the<00:01:25.430> first<00:01:25.460> line<00:01:29.440> for<00:01:30.440> the<00:01:30.530> second

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
this is the first line for the second

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.430 
this is the first line for the second
line<00:01:31.040> are<00:01:31.460> returning<00:01:32.150> certain<00:01:32.600> one<00:01:32.840> bit<00:01:33.110> more

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
line are returning certain one bit more

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.270 
line are returning certain one bit more
and<00:01:34.030> once<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.210> got<00:01:35.450> it<00:01:35.600> past<00:01:35.930> return<00:01:36.770> passing

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
and once I got it past return passing

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:55.440 
and once I got it past return passing
the<00:01:37.430> thread<00:01:37.759> inside<00:01:38.240> the<00:01:38.420> third<00:01:38.720> cool

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.190 

so<00:01:56.450> tense<00:01:56.840> all<00:01:57.170> join<00:01:57.829> all<00:01:58.159> together<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
so tense all join all together and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.859 
so tense all join all together and
shifting<00:02:00.200> all<00:02:00.409> one<00:02:01.189> meter<00:02:01.429> away<00:02:01.820> from<00:02:02.179> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
shifting all one meter away from the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.099 
shifting all one meter away from the
needle<00:02:03.520> as<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.700> can<00:02:04.880> see<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:05.299> set<00:02:05.750> up<00:02:05.929> the

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
needle as you can see I set up the

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.830 
needle as you can see I set up the
second<00:02:06.439> line<00:02:06.819> then<00:02:07.819> passing<00:02:08.360> the<00:02:08.390> needle

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
second line then passing the needle

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.170 
second line then passing the needle
through<00:02:09.229> the<00:02:09.289> 4th<00:02:09.890> bead

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
through the 4th bead

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.289 
through the 4th bead
I<00:02:11.319> will<00:02:12.319> repeat<00:02:12.590> all<00:02:12.860> inserting<00:02:13.670> one<00:02:13.700> field

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
I will repeat all inserting one field

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.900 
I will repeat all inserting one field
more<00:02:14.569> using<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.410> silver<00:02:15.890> color<00:02:16.190> cool

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
more using a silver color cool

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.130 
more using a silver color cool
once<00:02:17.750> I<00:02:17.900> pass<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.379> I<00:02:19.360> return<00:02:20.360> passing<00:02:20.989> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
once I pass it I return passing the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.430 
once I pass it I return passing the
thread<00:02:21.470> through<00:02:22.129> the<00:02:22.370> second<00:02:22.760> cool<00:02:23.030> as<00:02:23.690> is<00:02:24.110> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
thread through the second cool as is the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:33.069 
thread through the second cool as is the
mirror<00:02:24.709> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.489> fifth<00:02:25.790> one<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.810> third

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
mirror of the fifth one the third

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:52.800 
mirror of the fifth one the third
passing<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.799> needle<00:02:34.250> through<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.730> 5th

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.649 

then<00:02:53.810> insert<00:02:54.230> one<00:02:54.620> cue<00:02:54.860> more<00:02:55.220> and<00:02:55.519> we<00:02:56.000> fix<00:02:56.330> it

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
then insert one cue more and we fix it

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.259 
then insert one cue more and we fix it
to<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.290> first<00:02:57.680> cube<00:02:58.540> inserted<00:02:59.540> before<00:03:01.269> then

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
to the first cube inserted before then

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.199 
to the first cube inserted before then
of<00:03:02.510> course<00:03:03.140> pass<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.220> needle<00:03:04.430> through<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
of course pass the needle through the

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.350 
of course pass the needle through the
series<00:03:05.810> one<00:03:06.170> and<00:03:06.500> as<00:03:07.040> you<00:03:07.220> can<00:03:07.400> see<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.879> closed

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
series one and as you can see I closed

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.619 
series one and as you can see I closed
off<00:03:08.599> the<00:03:08.840> second<00:03:09.200> line<00:03:12.970> these<00:03:13.970> two<00:03:14.209> verse

off the second line these two verse

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.410 
off the second line these two verse
lines<00:03:15.019> are<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.980> key<00:03:16.220> to<00:03:16.430> understand<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
lines are the key to understand the

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.589 
lines are the key to understand the
technique<00:03:17.900> we<00:03:18.079> are<00:03:18.110> using<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.860> make<00:03:19.069> the<00:03:19.280> ring

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.809 

as<00:03:23.599> you<00:03:23.840> will<00:03:24.049> see<00:03:24.290> I<00:03:24.500> follow<00:03:24.890> repeating<00:03:25.670> the

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
as you will see I follow repeating the

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.750 
as you will see I follow repeating the
same<00:03:26.120> step<00:03:26.450> until<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.500> get<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.829> side<00:03:28.099> of<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
same step until to get the side of the

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.670 
same step until to get the side of the
ring<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.060> need<00:03:29.450> for<00:03:29.840> your<00:03:29.989> finger<00:03:32.680> remember

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
ring you need for your finger remember

ring you need for your finger remember
that<00:03:33.920> you<00:03:34.129> can<00:03:34.370> create<00:03:34.579> a<00:03:34.730> bracelet<00:03:35.329> too<00:03:35.540> for

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
that you can create a bracelet too for

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:38.229 
that you can create a bracelet too for
example<00:03:36.709> you<00:03:37.010> should<00:03:37.040> wear<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.730> bracelet

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
example you should wear the bracelet

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.420 
example you should wear the bracelet
using<00:03:38.480> five<00:03:38.959> or<00:03:39.260> six<00:03:39.680> cubes<00:03:40.099> on<00:03:40.459> each<00:03:40.910> line<00:03:42.430> ok

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
using five or six cubes on each line ok

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.930 
using five or six cubes on each line ok
done<00:03:44.030> once<00:03:44.810> I<00:03:45.019> got<00:03:45.290> my<00:03:45.530> length<00:03:45.829> I<00:03:46.160> need<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.670> join

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
done once I got my length I need to join

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.319 
done once I got my length I need to join
both<00:03:47.209> parts<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.200> order<00:03:48.410> to<00:03:48.739> close<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.220> ring<00:03:49.489> so

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
both parts in order to close the ring so

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.069 
both parts in order to close the ring so
I<00:03:50.359> will<00:03:50.810> see<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:52.099> curves<00:03:52.489> has<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.420> done<00:03:53.720> among

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
I will see the curves has I done among

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.069 
I will see the curves has I done among
the<00:03:54.379> previous<00:03:54.920> lines<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.700> I<00:03:56.359> will<00:03:56.750> close<00:03:57.049> it

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
the previous lines and I will close it
