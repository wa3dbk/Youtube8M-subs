welded to the frame of the bicycle I'm

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.100 
welded to the frame of the bicycle I'm
not<00:00:28.349> very<00:00:28.500> good<00:00:28.619> at<00:00:28.710> welding<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:30.000> worked

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.860 

attached<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> back<00:00:34.559> wheel<00:00:35.690> we<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.840> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
attached to the back wheel we have a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.670 
attached to the back wheel we have a
motor<00:00:37.640> from<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.760> blower<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.360> car<00:00:39.600> which<00:00:40.469> has

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
motor from the blower of a car which has

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.150

a<00:00:40.710> socket<00:00:41.309> attached<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.660> axle<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
a socket attached to the axle there so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.200 
a socket attached to the axle there so
that<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.879> when<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> wheel<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that as you can see when the wheel is

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.680 
that as you can see when the wheel is
around<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> motor<00:00:48.899> spins<00:00:50.210> motor<00:00:51.210> right<00:00:51.420> there

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
around the motor spins motor right there

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.430 
around the motor spins motor right there
as<00:00:51.870> soon<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.140> he<00:00:52.260> starts<00:00:52.559> turning<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> wheel

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
as soon as he starts turning the wheel

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.500 
as soon as he starts turning the wheel
in<00:00:55.440> fact<00:00:55.680> turning<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> motor<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.610> motor<00:00:57.030> is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
in fact turning the motor the motor is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.500 
in fact turning the motor the motor is
held<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> bungee<00:00:58.320> cord<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.180> runs

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
held on by a bungee cord and it runs

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.549 
held on by a bungee cord and it runs
into<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.820> 800<00:01:02.820> watt<00:01:03.030> converter<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:04.289> that<00:01:04.440> the

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
into an 800 watt converter so that the

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.929 
into an 800 watt converter so that the
direct<00:01:04.860> current<00:01:05.190> from<00:01:05.399> the<00:01:05.430> motor<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.880> be

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
direct current from the motor can be

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.020 
direct current from the motor can be
turned<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.420> alternating<00:01:06.960> current<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:08.030> run

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
turned into alternating current to run

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.649 
turned into alternating current to run
and<00:01:09.689> SNES<00:01:10.729> okay<00:01:11.729> so<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.390> it<00:01:12.510> works

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and SNES okay so this is how it works

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.690 
and SNES okay so this is how it works
and<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.920> we're<00:01:14.010> going<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.189> do<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> start

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and what we're going to do is start

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.370 
and what we're going to do is start
getting<00:01:15.180> electricity<00:01:15.479> flowing<00:01:16.020> through<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
getting electricity flowing through the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
getting electricity flowing through the
system<00:01:16.560> we're<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.610> turn<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
system we're going to turn on the

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.340 
system we're going to turn on the
converter<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.659> I'm<00:01:18.810> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:18.990> turn<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
converter and I'm going to turn on the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:30.280 
converter and I'm going to turn on the
SNES<00:01:19.680> then<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.580> going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> play<00:01:20.880> some<00:01:20.939> mario

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.260 

now<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.830> whole<00:01:31.040> point<00:01:31.250> of<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.520> system<00:01:31.970> is

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
now the whole point of this system is

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.290 
now the whole point of this system is
that<00:01:32.810> if<00:01:33.170> you<00:01:33.350> stop<00:01:33.650> peddling<00:01:34.160> a<00:01:34.400> Nintendo

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
that if you stop peddling a Nintendo

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.600 
that if you stop peddling a Nintendo
will<00:01:35.480> turn<00:01:35.720> off<00:01:35.990> we<00:01:36.950> in<00:01:37.070> order<00:01:37.340> to<00:01:37.460> keep

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
will turn off we in order to keep

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.810 
will turn off we in order to keep
playing<00:01:37.940> a<00:01:38.060> video<00:01:38.330> game<00:01:39.100> Petaling

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:56.780 

come<00:01:44.030> check<00:01:44.180> it<00:01:44.240> out

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.410 

I'm<00:01:57.240> gonna<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:57.570> one<00:01:57.780> level

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
I'm gonna be in one level

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.720 
I'm gonna be in one level
then<00:01:59.600> we'll<00:01:59.720> stop<00:01:59.960> it

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:25.720 

ok<00:02:08.030> maybe<00:02:08.210> not

to hack saw the Christmas tree frame and
weld<00:02:53.830> all<00:02:54.070> of<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.459> try<00:02:54.790> and<00:02:54.850> get<00:02:55.000> the<00:02:55.180> wheel

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
weld all of it and try and get the wheel

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.750 
weld all of it and try and get the wheel
spin<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.110> good<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.410> everything<00:02:56.770> but<00:02:56.950> it's

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
spin and good and everything but it's

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.209 
spin and good and everything but it's
working<00:02:58.060> good
