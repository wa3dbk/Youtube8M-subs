maybe very very slight little purplish
tinge<00:00:53.110> in<00:00:53.350> there<00:00:53.559> and<00:00:53.830> we're<00:00:54.550> checking<00:00:54.760> the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.089 
tinge in there and we're checking the

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.420

quality<00:00:55.269> of<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:55.930> pulse<00:00:56.170> is<00:00:56.500> it<00:00:56.769> difficult<00:00:57.220> to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
quality of the pulse is it difficult to

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.020 
quality of the pulse is it difficult to
find<00:00:57.730> is<00:00:58.089> it<00:00:58.540> very<00:00:58.720> strong<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.140> bounding

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

patient over specific acupuncture points
that<00:01:17.620> will<00:01:17.740> help<00:01:17.890> me<00:01:18.070> to<00:01:18.190> determine<00:01:18.490> one<00:01:19.000> if

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
that will help me to determine one if

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.510 
that will help me to determine one if

what points I need to treat to make him
feel<00:01:23.560> better<00:01:23.770> it's<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:24.610> you<00:01:24.640> can<00:01:24.850> see<00:01:25.030> already

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
feel better it's and you can see already

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.820 
feel better it's and you can see already
even<00:01:25.690> there<00:01:25.900> at<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.080> top<00:01:26.260> of<00:01:26.290> his<00:01:26.590> neck<00:01:26.800> that

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
even there at the top of his neck that

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.820 
even there at the top of his neck that
would<00:01:27.280> be<00:01:27.370> a<00:01:27.400> positive<00:01:27.640> reaction<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:29.470> over

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
would be a positive reaction that's over

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.550 
would be a positive reaction that's over
what<00:01:30.040> we<00:01:30.160> call<00:01:30.370> the<00:01:30.520> bladder<00:01:30.790> ten<00:01:31.240> point<00:01:31.660> handy

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
what we call the bladder ten point handy

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.500 
what we call the bladder ten point handy
really<00:01:33.070> doesn't<00:01:33.430> mind<00:01:33.640> his<00:01:33.850> needles<00:01:34.270> and

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
really doesn't mind his needles and

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.250 
really doesn't mind his needles and
that's<00:01:35.350> true<00:01:35.740> of<00:01:35.920> most<00:01:36.280> horse<00:01:36.730> patients<00:01:37.390> they

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
that's true of most horse patients they

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.870 
that's true of most horse patients they
actually<00:01:38.680> quite<00:01:38.920> enjoy<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.430> treatment

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
actually quite enjoy the treatment

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.360 
actually quite enjoy the treatment
because<00:01:40.000> of<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.360> endorphin<00:01:40.960> release<00:01:41.370> that

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
because of the endorphin release that

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.180 
because of the endorphin release that
occurs<00:01:42.700> with<00:01:42.970> needling<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.830> one<00:01:45.040> of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
occurs with needling and that is one of

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.160 
occurs with needling and that is one of
the<00:01:45.280> reasons<00:01:45.670> that<00:01:45.850> acupuncture<00:01:46.390> works<00:01:46.780> as<00:01:47.110> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
the reasons that acupuncture works as a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.230 
the reasons that acupuncture works as a
treatment<00:01:47.650> it's<00:01:48.250> one<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.490> the<00:01:48.640> most<00:01:48.790> common

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
treatment it's one of the most common

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.030 
treatment it's one of the most common
questions<00:01:49.720> that<00:01:49.870> I<00:01:50.080> get<00:01:50.200> from<00:01:50.500> clients

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
questions that I get from clients

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.830 
questions that I get from clients
because<00:01:51.910> what<00:01:52.180> does<00:01:52.420> that<00:01:52.630> little

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
because what does that little

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.950 
because what does that little
acupuncture<00:01:53.470> needle<00:01:53.740> actually<00:01:54.280> do<00:01:54.870> when<00:01:55.870> you

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
acupuncture needle actually do when you

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.050 
acupuncture needle actually do when you
think<00:01:56.200> about<00:01:56.290> acupuncture<00:01:57.070> from<00:01:57.400> a<00:01:57.520> Western

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
energy flow then when we add our other

energy flow then when we add our other
things<00:02:27.879> like<00:02:28.120> electricity<00:02:28.870> or<00:02:29.079> vitamin<00:02:29.530> b12

to these points
we<00:02:31.489> can<00:02:31.670> either<00:02:31.819> increase<00:02:32.420> our<00:02:32.870> stimulation
