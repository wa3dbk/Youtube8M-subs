00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.139
 good in all that 'whatever 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.260
 commenting on this new gameplay about 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.960
 how to use an ak-47 or rather more 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.300
 how to use information about 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 information on how to use it is not how 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.599
 use it but information about how 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.210
 use it first we're going to look like 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.619
 show it to me as I have the commitment of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.309
 button 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.510
 and the gun always of death and 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.510
 usp good 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 I will talk about being as the 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.610
 second distance 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.680
 and basically they were just that 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.570
 know that how to shoot the second 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.220
 distance and 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.260
 and nothing else there what 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.140
 they also about being more alone 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.989
 the distance of how to shoot the if 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 you are here if you are here if the day is 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.750
 there and me if the uncle is 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.530
 we are going to say it that way further if it is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.220
 possible good we will proceed to the 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.570
 explanation but good I'm going to skip the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:26.070
 part in which he is here because male 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 if uncle is here government 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.310
 for bursts but the bullet and firing 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.900
 always the uncle who was always yellow 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.100
 I'm on top of you, I'm pointing your head 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.360
 it's possible 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.410
 good if it is a distance or more 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.060
 less close is already controlling the record 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:47.180
 You already know that I frequented that 27 is 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 very high has a great setback but the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.320
 recoil has a setback in the form of 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 7 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.420
 producing upside down a fee according to 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.189
 as 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.229
 according to afp stop then from a 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.470
 recoil different from the way in which 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.470
 now with 60 less in the form of 7 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.800
 and they are shaped like seven the best thing is if 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.780
 it's close to move and shoot like 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 as if it is here I have here 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.960
 again you have to turn it on 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.540
 I also recommend jumping a little to 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.890
 that the other fails the bullets and you shoot 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.660
 led and it is already here because 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 I basically have 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.450
 to the country the country this news graffiti 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.550
 because I do not have the graffiti pin on 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.410
 well now if it's far 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.820
 good half distance that would at least be 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.430
 from here it's good who's a little more 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.830
 near here until there then I 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.900
 I recommend more than you can do two 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.900
 things or go goes to the bullet 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.400
 like ever some red fingers because 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.099
 he said 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.930
 that that's more for those who already 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.360
 they can play well with bed 27 when 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.209
 you already have a lot of practice doing that or 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.769
 against the record that is what I do 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.379
 I dispose for bad luck the uba 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.739
 distant distance not so good for 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.739
 make it close 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.620
 that basically 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.319
 encourages the pillage is just where 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.900
 you're looking at the brood and satyrs and a 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.770
 fixed head 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.540
 and already long distance 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.730
 let's get on the other side to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.590
 the blade can see why if 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.350
 I put there we can not approach anymore 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.880
 long distance is please tell us 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.010
 bursts of two bursts of three not 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.410
 learn to shoot bullet bullet if you are 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.350
 Away though it's mate practice practicing 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:44.300
 with this because if you learn to master and 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:44.300
 have controlled the letter for the bullet 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.220
 and best of all, shoot at 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:53.440
 it was worth it and without haste until it was loaded 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.239
 pointing to the clear head adjusting the 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.090
 head so I recommend is to aim for 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.080
 body if you are yellow point to the 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.209
 body and when you already have a little 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.060
 If I already give the body enough to try 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.459
 with your head already for 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:12.700
 kill him faster I always say that what 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:15.930
 better is progressive do not start people 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.930
 point to the head and kill logo 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.940
 A) Yes 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.470
 we see good 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.170
 that's why I say of people says he pointed to 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.450
 the head shoots but clenches fists and is 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.610
 a guy who does not even know a mouse like him 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.610
 It says yes 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:43.990
 this says to the police bodies of the 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.600
 head more or less it is easier to give the 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.120
 I think I reinforce less in giving the body and 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.530
 is going to catch a little more there the trick to 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.690
 side to the ice cream of my soul and good with 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.930
 this ends this little guide on how 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.760
 use the ak 47 I recommend it to be 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.430
 six to not see effect if you're 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.790
 close if it is a close distance you 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:18.900
 move if it is far good installs if 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:18.900
 it's far for this to be crap 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.580
 we're just quiet in that I know that 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.610
 do not have that middle distance that the 6th 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.240
 and what you see 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:36.460
 only those from a distance described it 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.180
 they lived here in spear few bullets 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:50.319
 because I want to save and when 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:52.150
 away the bullets and so on and so on like this and 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.310
 so with practice the first one is going to 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.810
 leave sure not but with much 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.380
 practice 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.700
 and you will be perfect and good gentlemen 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.490
 I leave you now 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.940
 this next guide may be that one 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.940
 of the vp 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.860
 and good I say goodbye to you 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.460
 I hope we liked this video 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.460
 I hope it serves 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:29.650
 and good one to all 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:33.670
 and then good before I say goodbye 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.800
 One thing I forgot, I forgot 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:39.000
 and 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.919
 the ak-47 I always recommend that first 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.520
 has always did the white is the 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:46.120
 first the first thing you do is that 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.190
 please the white 

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.840
 it's advice that says a lot of people 

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:54.680
 says that the first shot always more 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:57.380
 powerful is something that I never 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.750
 I have never realized that the truth 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.310
 he has never said he has first shot not what 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:04.130
 has killed one hour 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:06.020
 I never realize it but I recommend it 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.569
 a lot so I also recommend it to 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.219
 you apart the first if not all 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:14.819
 but think that it 's the first shot you 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.770
 you give the other two that go behind and 

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:18.629
 after three bullets in mind that the 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.479
 first shot the second and the third to 

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:23.219
 root with him like that and there's always the 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.589
 first shot of why if not the others 

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:26.999
 two issues nothing 

00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:29.399
 this would be three bursts clear if 

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:31.259
 we go there and billiards needed there 

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.479
 all where the first goes if it would already be 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:36.389
 does not pick up good that or not pick up that already 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:40.709
 would be all for the straight or the perfection 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:42.180
 good physics I say goodbye now yes of everything 

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:45.809
 greetings to all I hope that it is liked 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:47.610
 this video and the next carrey video 

00:07:45.809 --> 00:07:50.999
 about the tutorial will probably be 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:55.020
 long the turn would be to carry the vp 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:57.559
 of the m4 or some more weird mega 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.559
 adjusted everything
