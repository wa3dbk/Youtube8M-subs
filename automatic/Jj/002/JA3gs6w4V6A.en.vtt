this<00:01:55.090> device<00:01:55.770> my<00:01:56.770> opinion<00:01:57.490> would<00:01:57.580> be<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
this device my opinion would be that

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.190 
this device my opinion would be that
it's<00:01:58.119> definitely<00:01:58.479> a<00:01:58.509> good<00:01:58.659> product<00:01:58.869> and

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
it's definitely a good product and

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.450 
it's definitely a good product and
fairly<00:01:59.950> easy<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.340> install<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.729> use<00:02:01.110> however

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
fairly easy to install and use however

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.109 
fairly easy to install and use however
the<00:02:03.460> earphones<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.330> as<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.869> can<00:02:04.990> see<00:02:05.020> our<00:02:06.119> are

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
the earphones and as you can see our are

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.639 
the earphones and as you can see our are
not<00:02:07.390> the<00:02:07.569> best<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:08.049> think<00:02:08.259> they<00:02:08.350> might<00:02:08.530> have

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
not the best I think they might have

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.160 
not the best I think they might have
been<00:02:08.769> defective<00:02:09.130> the<00:02:09.670> right<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.810> left<00:02:10.840> sides

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
been defective the right and left sides

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.770

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
just switch them and use a better pair

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.720
