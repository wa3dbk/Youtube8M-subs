let's go into the speedboat speedboat

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.479 
let's go into the speedboat speedboat
put<00:02:45.660> it<00:02:45.750> in<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.900> mine<00:02:46.079> cart<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.739> furnace

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.690 
there and we have a speed boat let's
check<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.140> as<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:52.950> see<00:02:52.980> once<00:02:53.579> i

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
check this out and as you can see once i

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.979 
check this out and as you can see once i
get<00:02:53.849> off<00:02:53.970> this<00:02:54.209> block<00:02:54.660> in<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:56.340> second<00:02:57.030> there<00:02:57.900> we

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
get off this block in a second there we

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.349 
get off this block in a second there we
go<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.379> it<00:02:58.650> crashed<00:02:58.890> ok<00:02:59.790> i'm<00:03:00.030> going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.269> have

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
go and it crashed ok i'm going to have

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.880 
go and it crashed ok i'm going to have
to<00:03:00.390> make<00:03:00.569> another<00:03:00.750> one<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.470> that's<00:03:01.620> kind

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
to make another one and that that's kind

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.890 
to make another one and that that's kind
of<00:03:01.920> glitch<00:03:02.159> it<00:03:02.340> drops<00:03:02.579> wood<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.390> it's<00:03:03.629> it

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
of glitch it drops wood and it's it

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
of glitch it drops wood and it's it
should<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.409> more<00:03:04.620> durable<00:03:04.859> than<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.489> it's

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
should be more durable than that if it's

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.210 
should be more durable than that if it's
a<00:03:06.000> speedboat<00:03:06.810> right<00:03:07.440> i<00:03:07.650> mean<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.040> would<00:03:08.190> think

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
a speedboat right i mean you would think

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.330 
a speedboat right i mean you would think
if<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.879> made<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.239> iron<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.890> let's<00:03:11.069> just

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
if it's made out of iron so let's just

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.069 
if it's made out of iron so let's just
I'll<00:03:11.549> show<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.790> how<00:03:11.970> see<00:03:12.480> how<00:03:12.540> much<00:03:12.629> faster

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
I'll show you how see how much faster

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.899 
I'll show you how see how much faster
this<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.290> going<00:03:13.530> right<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:13.799> as<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.640> can<00:03:14.730> see

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
this is going right now as you can see

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:17.270 
this is going right now as you can see
we're<00:03:15.090> going<00:03:15.209> a<00:03:15.450> lot<00:03:15.720> faster<00:03:15.959> so<00:03:16.859> pretty<00:03:17.099> cool

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
we're going a lot faster so pretty cool

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.339 
we're going a lot faster so pretty cool
i<00:03:17.489> like<00:03:17.849> the<00:03:18.000> speedboat<00:03:18.450> it'd<00:03:18.810> be<00:03:18.930> nice<00:03:19.049> it<00:03:19.260> was

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
i like the speedboat it'd be nice it was

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.569 
i like the speedboat it'd be nice it was
a<00:03:19.410> little<00:03:19.590> bit<00:03:19.739> faster<00:03:20.160> because<00:03:20.280> it<00:03:20.430> is<00:03:20.549> a

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
a little bit faster because it is a

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.339 
a little bit faster because it is a
speedboat<00:03:21.180> i<00:03:21.239> mean<00:03:21.480> i<00:03:21.599> wouldn't<00:03:21.810> say<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.139> is

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
speedboat i mean i wouldn't say this is

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.460 
speedboat i mean i wouldn't say this is
like<00:03:22.530> speedboats<00:03:23.310> like<00:03:23.790> speed<00:03:24.389> but<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:25.290> this

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
like speedboats like speed but if this

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.009 
like speedboats like speed but if this
is<00:03:25.650> more<00:03:25.919> like<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.700> don't<00:03:27.209> even<00:03:27.299> know<00:03:27.599> but<00:03:27.840> it's

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
is more like I don't even know but it's

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:29.780 
is more like I don't even know but it's
not<00:03:28.200> speedboat<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.980> wouldn't<00:03:29.639> say<00:03:29.760> that

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
not speedboat I wouldn't say that

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.869 
not speedboat I wouldn't say that
anyways<00:03:30.299> so<00:03:31.109> let's<00:03:31.260> crash<00:03:32.069> this<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.790> then

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879 
anyways so let's crash this and then

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.280 
anyways so let's crash this and then
we'll<00:03:33.000> continue<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:34.400> ok<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.870> what<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.109> next

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
we'll continue on ok so what the next

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.550 
we'll continue on ok so what the next
thing<00:03:37.560> I'm<00:03:37.769> going<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:38.160> show<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.760> is<00:03:39.349> let's<00:03:40.349> go

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
thing I'm going to show you is let's go

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.559 
thing I'm going to show you is let's go
the<00:03:40.739> motorboat<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.760> motor<00:03:41.970> boat<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.359> pretty

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
the motorboat the motor boat is pretty

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:49.159 
the motorboat the motor boat is pretty
much<00:03:42.690> even<00:03:42.870> slower<00:03:43.379> made<00:03:43.949> out<00:03:44.069> of<00:03:44.220> wood<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:48.169> we

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
much even slower made out of wood and we

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.119 
much even slower made out of wood and we
got<00:03:49.290> the<00:03:49.319> motor<00:03:49.560> boat<00:03:49.790> ok<00:03:50.790> you'll<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.180> it's

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
got the motor boat ok you'll see it's

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.559 
got the motor boat ok you'll see it's
nothing<00:03:53.129> too<00:03:53.430> big<00:03:53.579> show<00:03:53.879> just<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.269> little<00:03:54.480> bit

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
nothing too big show just a little bit

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.059 
nothing too big show just a little bit
faster<00:03:55.400> yeah<00:03:56.400> be<00:03:56.730> easier<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.060> craft<00:03:57.919> not<00:03:58.919> have

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
faster yeah be easier to craft not have

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.159 
faster yeah be easier to craft not have
to<00:03:59.370> waste<00:03:59.549> as<00:03:59.790> much<00:03:59.819> I<00:04:00.329> think<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.049> really

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169 
to waste as much I think this is really

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:02.930 
to waste as much I think this is really
cool<00:04:01.349> as<00:04:01.530> well<00:04:01.560> I<00:04:01.889> like<00:04:02.129> it<00:04:02.280> it's<00:04:02.489> a<00:04:02.609> little<00:04:02.819> bit

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
cool as well I like it it's a little bit

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.420 
cool as well I like it it's a little bit
slower<00:04:03.209> makes<00:04:03.660> sense<00:04:03.959> kind<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.340> for<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
slower makes sense kind of for the

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.129 
slower makes sense kind of for the
motorboat<00:04:05.819> the<00:04:06.209> speedboat<00:04:06.660> see<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
motorboat the speedboat see the

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:08.479 
motorboat the speedboat see the
speedboat<00:04:07.530> should<00:04:07.709> be<00:04:07.799> faster<00:04:08.160> this<00:04:08.310> one<00:04:08.459> I

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
speedboat should be faster this one I

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.390 
speedboat should be faster this one I
think<00:04:08.579> is<00:04:08.819> about<00:04:09.090> right<00:04:09.470> yeah<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.709> think<00:04:10.859> so<00:04:11.160> and

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
think is about right yeah I think so and

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.089 
think is about right yeah I think so and
then<00:04:11.849> we<00:04:12.180> got<00:04:12.329> the<00:04:12.449> ice<00:04:12.720> breaker<00:04:13.470> boat<00:04:13.829> here

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
then we got the ice breaker boat here

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.069 
then we got the ice breaker boat here
that<00:04:14.310> didn't<00:04:14.579> break<00:04:14.730> those<00:04:14.970> weird<00:04:15.269> but<00:04:15.930> um

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
that didn't break those weird but um

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.610 
that didn't break those weird but um
yeah<00:04:16.680> this<00:04:16.889> boat<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.220> kind<00:04:18.060> of<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.510> don't<00:04:18.959> want

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
yeah this boat is kind of I don't want

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.110 
yeah this boat is kind of I don't want
to<00:04:19.680> say<00:04:19.919> it's<00:04:20.099> good<00:04:20.250> but<00:04:20.459> I'm<00:04:20.579> almost<00:04:20.910> positive

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
to say it's good but I'm almost positive

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.050 
to say it's good but I'm almost positive
it<00:04:21.479> is<00:04:21.510> because<00:04:21.870> I<00:04:21.900> it<00:04:22.260> doesn't<00:04:22.469> work<00:04:22.650> for<00:04:22.890> me

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
it is because I it doesn't work for me

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.130 
it is because I it doesn't work for me
maybe<00:04:24.060> I'm<00:04:24.240> doing<00:04:24.390> something<00:04:24.510> wrong<00:04:24.930> where

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
maybe I'm doing something wrong where

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.909 
maybe I'm doing something wrong where
you<00:04:25.229> have<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.440> do<00:04:25.530> something<00:04:25.710> I've<00:04:25.890> been

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
secret creeper boat as well which I

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.330 
secret creeper boat as well which I
don't<00:04:35.800> know<00:04:35.949> but<00:04:36.940> yeah<00:04:37.449> let's<00:04:38.130> try<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.250> turn

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
don't know but yeah let's try and turn

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.430 
don't know but yeah let's try and turn
around<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.880> as<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.630> can<00:04:40.780> see<00:04:40.810> if<00:04:41.080> I<00:04:41.139> try<00:04:41.320> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
around and as you can see if I try and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.659 
around and as you can see if I try and
break<00:04:41.560> this<00:04:41.740> ice<00:04:41.919> it<00:04:42.100> doesn't<00:04:42.370> work<00:04:42.460> I<00:04:42.639> don't

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
break this ice it doesn't work I don't

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:47.010 
break this ice it doesn't work I don't
know<00:04:42.910> I<00:04:43.320> don't<00:04:44.320> know<00:04:44.440> how<00:04:44.680> maybe<00:04:45.669> it's<00:04:45.880> no<00:04:46.780> I

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
know I don't know how maybe it's no I

don't know I honestly don't know how to

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.420 
don't know I honestly don't know how to
break<00:04:48.460> it<00:04:48.960> maybe<00:04:49.960> it<00:04:50.169> works<00:04:50.380> I<00:04:50.620> don't<00:04:50.830> think<00:04:51.310> it

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
break it maybe it works I don't think it

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.370 
break it maybe it works I don't think it
does<00:04:51.550> maybe<00:04:52.270> I'm<00:04:52.419> doing<00:04:52.540> something<00:04:52.660> wrong<00:04:53.080> I

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
does maybe I'm doing something wrong I

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.300 
does maybe I'm doing something wrong I
have<00:04:54.040> absolutely<00:04:54.160> no<00:04:54.610> idea<00:04:54.760> but<00:04:55.949> yeah<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:56.979> can't

have absolutely no idea but yeah I can't
seem<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.669> get<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:57.910> part<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.419> this<00:04:58.510> mod<00:04:58.750> to

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
seem to get that part of this mod to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.360 
seem to get that part of this mod to
work<00:04:59.110> what<00:04:59.680> I'm<00:04:59.770> actually<00:04:59.860> going<00:05:00.070> to<00:05:00.130> do<00:05:00.220> is

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
work what I'm actually going to do is

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.010 
work what I'm actually going to do is
place<00:05:00.639> a<00:05:00.669> bunch<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.030> boats<00:05:01.240> see<00:05:01.690> if<00:05:01.780> I<00:05:01.840> can<00:05:01.960> get

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
place a bunch of boats see if I can get

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:07.650 
place a bunch of boats see if I can get
any<00:05:02.199> cool<00:05:02.500> secret<00:05:02.889> ones<00:05:06.180> all<00:05:07.180> there<00:05:07.510> is<00:05:07.630> a

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
creeper boat and I saw a secret boat

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.700 
creeper boat and I saw a secret boat
over<00:05:10.360> there<00:05:10.419> see<00:05:11.169> this<00:05:11.289> is<00:05:11.380> the<00:05:11.410> one<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.590> was
