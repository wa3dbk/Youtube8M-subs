00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.769
 manager for all devices g3f break 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.120
 called the file hop like any 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.040
 appstore 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.800
 unfortunately he will not give access to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
 file system and device all data 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.949
 will be in local storage 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.350
 which are only available from this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.519
 applications 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.769
 Initially files hub file can be 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.430
 import from gallery or camera 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.859
 devices 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.439
 In addition, you can create your own folders and 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.070
 text documents 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.079
 I would especially like to note 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.850
 the ability to import data 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.840
 voice recorder as well as songs from ipod player 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.940
 the application can view 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.690
 most modern file types 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.890
 video photo listen to music 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.070
 view data in pdf and doc 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.620
 formats files you work with 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.239
 most often can be marked with an asterisk 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.960
 will be available from a separate menu 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 favorites 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.399
 in the program using a special 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.879
 buttons can change the appearance of files 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.980
 and folders 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.530
 here you can sort them by 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:09.150
 you parameter besides local 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.560
 hub for file data storage can be 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.049
 connect most popular 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520
 cloud data storage for this 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.049
 there is a special section in 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.820
 the program 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 it can connect such cloud 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.400
 Vault as dropbox google drive 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.720
 Yandex drive sludge sing skydrive boxing and 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.490
 some kind of chinese baidu disk in a couple 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.860
 taps you can access any 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
 from the cloud files after that it will 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.759
 Your local storage is loaded except 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.000
 This can upload files from 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.170
 local storage to any cloud 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.030
 thus the application will allow 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.890
 move files between cloud files 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.610
 repositories or copy them on oh 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.869
 device unfortunately view file 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.960
 which is in the cloud storage 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.000
 it does not work you need to download it 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.430
 the same is true for songs to 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.079
 listen to any mp3 or wav track 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.189
 from cloud storage will be required 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.189
 load it into the program 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.000
 The hop file has built-in music and 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.140
 video player available playlist creation 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 and play in a chaotic manner 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.160
 music playback supported 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.690
 background respectively app 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.010
 can be used as a musical 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:27.049
 player there is a special 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.190
 miniature player window through which 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.140
 You can change the playback volume 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.799
 also switch between tracks 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.930
 playlist among settings file hop especially 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.530
 note nothing they are all typical for 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.220
 applications from this section 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.620
 Separately worth noting the opportunity 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.269
 transfer files between and devices 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.280
 as well as a device and a computer 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.260
 last case when using 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.810
 Wi-Fi network you will need to go through 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.099
 browser to a specific address and lay out 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.890
 on it or copy from it 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.180
 certain files transfer data by 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.280
 bluetooth is only possible between 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.250
 devices on which the file is installed 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.860
 Hop and data transfer to the hut is nothing 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.579
 other than copying application data 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.579
 via aytyuns 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.980
 Overall I liked the app 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.870
 especially its design and ability 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.450
 connect to cloud storage 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.819
 besides, any of the files are in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.890
 You can open the hub file in the local folder. 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.840
 using any external 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.489
 supported applications further 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.470
 versions of the program I would like to see 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.549
 ability to edit basic types 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.590
 file download hub file for iphone ipod 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.849

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.010
