00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:09.950
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.720
 this new video today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.720
 cydia that has already been updated to the 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:17.300
 version 1.1 point dayz and have changed 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.570
 enough things increases the capacity 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.850
 to have more sources and more tweets that 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.039
 before it was a bit limited and now it has 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.610
 included a multitasking but it is limited 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.699
 and only for payment applications to 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.340
 through google and as icon 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:37.160
 josep let's see him now 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.170
 as you see I still have the icon 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.850
 old because I still do not update it 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.810
 let's get inside application to 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.810
 see that we 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.510
 is loading as you see we have four 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.760
 updates below that is the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.489
 update and as you can see the icon is already 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.390
 has updated to the version of me 7 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.390
 we confirm 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.309
 good once we have installed what 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.280
 first that we are called exceptions the 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.990
 icon has finally been adapted to the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.659
 seven and it's more in line with the 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.659
 operating system let's go 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.149
 as we see first has not changed 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.979
 nothing and the main screen and as 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.409
 we see if we fix what has changed 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.240
 are the tabs below before 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.259
 we had the cydia section that is the 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.140
 main screen 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.360
 the section of sources that before 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.310
 called sections and as we see here 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.920
 now let's have all the sources 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.960
 where we have before the sections and 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.030
 we are going to administer from here the 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.130
 sources that we have at the time of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.140
 update the repositories we are going to 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.510
 have a little animation when you give it 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.680
 to update 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.410
 as we see here 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.290
 in the changes tab follow everything 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.270
 exactly the same they have not touched it and 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.390
 now we go to the tab that changes the most 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.790
 has suffered now is called installed at 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.630
 just like on the ipad before we had here 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.610
 three sections packages sources and 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.440
 storage now what they have done is 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.360
 leave only the tweets we have 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 installed and have not organized them to 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.100
 through tabs as we have to do 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.230
 user and advanced that what we have 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.720
 before the previous version but now what 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.160
 that we have added is a tab 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.410
 recent that the truth that is coming 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.980
 quite good very comfortable since we can 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.700
 see the last thing we have installed 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.110
 in case some trine horse we know which 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.019
 it's going to be the last tweet and we can 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.620
 erase or multiply and in the tab 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:41.190
 search has barely changed 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.190
 this has been all 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.480
 and now and more since it has gone back to 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.989
 update and not just once but two 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.629
 times more to version 1.1 point 11 and a 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.819
 the 1.1 point 12 but they are just 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:57.510
 updates to correct bugs 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.220
 version 1.1 point 10 and now yes yes os 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.409
