the time values that are using for now

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.910 
the time values that are using for now
this<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.759> songs<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.210> key<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> C<00:00:15.570> major<00:00:16.350> so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
all the notes that you're using

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.269 
all the notes that you're using
unnatural<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.619> no<00:00:19.770> sharps<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.220> flats

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
unnatural there are no sharps or flats

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.400 
unnatural there are no sharps or flats
you<00:00:20.699> got<00:00:21.020> c<00:00:22.020> d<00:00:22.350> e<00:00:22.590> f<00:00:23.010> g<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.180> B<00:00:24.390> now<00:00:25.080> there<00:00:25.260> are

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
you got c d e f g a and B now there are

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.050 
you got c d e f g a and B now there are
some<00:00:25.439> instances<00:00:26.220> where<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.550> will<00:00:26.760> go<00:00:26.789> out<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
some instances where you will go out a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.040 
some instances where you will go out a
key<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.599> use<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> g-sharp<00:00:28.680> um<00:00:29.570> now<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:30.720> isn't

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
key and use a g-sharp um now this isn't

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
key and use a g-sharp um now this isn't
for<00:00:31.260> for<00:00:31.470> time<00:00:31.740> value<00:00:32.160> so<00:00:32.189> you've<00:00:32.790> got<00:00:32.820> four

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
for for time value so you've got four

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.660 
for for time value so you've got four
beats<00:00:33.450> per<00:00:33.930> bar<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.469> every<00:00:35.190> beat<00:00:35.399> has<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
beats per bar and every beat has a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.360 
beats per bar and every beat has a
quarter<00:00:36.059> time<00:00:36.300> value<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.870> if<00:00:37.829> we<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
quarter time value so if we look at the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:59.550 
quarter time value so if we look at the
intro<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> goes

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.100 

so<00:01:00.560> the<00:01:00.739> first<00:01:01.010> section<00:01:01.280> goes

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.790 

and<00:01:05.500> we<00:01:05.890> starting<00:01:06.280> on<00:01:06.400> D<00:01:06.640> here<00:01:07.650> playing<00:01:08.650> that

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
and we starting on D here playing that

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.180 
and we starting on D here playing that
four<00:01:09.040> sixteenth<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.820> then<00:01:10.060> we<00:01:10.180> slidin<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:11.190> e4

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
four sixteenth and then we slidin to e4

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.950 
four sixteenth and then we slidin to e4
sixteenth<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:12.940> then<00:01:13.090> we're<00:01:13.210> hitting<00:01:13.450> g<00:01:13.720> down

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
sixteenth and then we're hitting g down

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.160 
sixteenth and then we're hitting g down
here<00:01:14.290> for<00:01:14.710> an<00:01:14.800> eighth<00:01:15.010> and<00:01:15.340> then<00:01:16.240> hitting<00:01:16.510> he

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
here for an eighth and then hitting he

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.690 
here for an eighth and then hitting he
again<00:01:17.620> for<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> 16<00:01:18.340> then<00:01:18.880> g<00:01:19.210> 4<00:01:19.540> 16<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.260> then<00:01:20.560> a<00:01:20.800> so

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
again for a 16 then g 4 16 and then a so

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140 
again for a 16 then g 4 16 and then a so
you've<00:01:21.820> got

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.249 

and<00:01:26.720> then<00:01:26.870> mix<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.260> she<00:01:27.380> goes

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.310 

so<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.409> got<00:01:34.850> to<00:01:35.850> be<00:01:35.909> playing<00:01:36.180> G<00:01:36.479> sharp<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.259> an

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
so you got to be playing G sharp for an

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.399 
so you got to be playing G sharp for an
eighth<00:01:37.500> plane<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:39.360> an<00:01:39.450> eighth<00:01:39.659> then<00:01:40.290> your

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
eighth plane a for an eighth then your

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.460 
eighth plane a for an eighth then your
plan<00:01:40.649> B<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.310> an<00:01:42.270> eighth<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> then<00:01:43.320> you're

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
plan B for an eighth and then you're

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.370 
plan B for an eighth and then you're
bending<00:01:43.680> be<00:01:44.130> half<00:01:45.030> a<00:01:45.210> step<00:01:45.390> up<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> see<00:01:46.020> within

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
bending be half a step up to see within

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.550 
bending be half a step up to see within
an<00:01:46.619> eighth<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.600> when<00:01:48.600> you're<00:01:48.750> releasing<00:01:49.110> that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
an eighth so when you're releasing that

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.460 
an eighth so when you're releasing that
that<00:01:49.890> Delta<00:01:50.310> being<00:01:50.580> with<00:01:50.789> earth<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that Delta being with earth and you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
that Delta being with earth and you
carry<00:01:52.740> on<00:01:52.830> holding<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.759> not<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.210> an<00:01:54.270> extra

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
carry on holding that not for an extra

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.610 
carry on holding that not for an extra
16th<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.560> go

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.969 

but<00:02:01.610> after<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:01.970> goes

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.210 

and<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.820> playing<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.329> for<00:02:07.600> a<00:02:07.630> 16<00:02:08.080> B<00:02:08.860> for<00:02:09.160> an

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
and that you playing a for a 16 B for an

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.339 
and that you playing a for a 16 B for an
eighth<00:02:09.459> and<00:02:09.789> then<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> next<00:02:10.660> three<00:02:10.989> not<00:02:11.170> to

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
eighth and then the next three not to

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.350 
eighth and then the next three not to
make<00:02:11.530> up<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.800> triplet<00:02:12.250> within<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.760> quarter<00:02:13.120> time

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
make up a triplet within a quarter time

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.720 
make up a triplet within a quarter time
value<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.860> you<00:02:14.920> got<00:02:15.720> si<00:02:16.720> ay<00:02:17.019> ay<00:02:17.730> so

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
value and that so you got si ay ay so

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.960 
value and that so you got si ay ay so
that<00:02:18.910> whole<00:02:19.090> second<00:02:19.480> section<00:02:19.870> goes

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.430 

and<00:02:25.010> then<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.280> got<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:30.390> he<00:02:30.450> doing<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.110> series

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
and then you got now he doing a series

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830 
and then you got now he doing a series
of<00:02:31.470> beans<00:02:31.830> but<00:02:32.640> only<00:02:33.090> hitting<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.450> root<00:02:33.630> note

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
of beans but only hitting the root note

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.190 
of beans but only hitting the root note
once<00:02:34.140> see<00:02:34.740> only<00:02:35.130> hitting<00:02:35.400> see<00:02:35.850> hitting<00:02:36.150> D<00:02:36.360> and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
once see only hitting see hitting D and

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.340 
once see only hitting see hitting D and
then<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.710> bending<00:02:38.040> up<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.370> e<00:02:38.900> more<00:02:39.900> than<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.140> ate

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
then you bending up to e more than I ate

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.470 
then you bending up to e more than I ate
then<00:02:41.040> you're<00:02:41.190> releasing<00:02:41.460> back<00:02:41.820> down<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.240> deal

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
then you're releasing back down to deal

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.510 
then you're releasing back down to deal
with<00:02:42.870> an<00:02:43.020> eighth<00:02:43.320> then<00:02:44.190> you're<00:02:44.370> bending

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
with an eighth then you're bending

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.820 
with an eighth then you're bending
straight<00:02:44.910> back<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.270> to<00:02:45.420> e<00:02:45.740> within<00:02:46.740> our

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
straight back up to e within our

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860
