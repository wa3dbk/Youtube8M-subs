00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.610
 cooking we end up for the recipe 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.590
 of a dessert that is right now 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.969
 at mcdonald's and i speak good 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.580
 obviously of the very perfect he we 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.060
 will need a bowl of strawberries cream 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.670
 fresh 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 so to convince with the sugar and 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.750
 especially ice cream you sleep cream 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.550
 of vanilla so why am I showing you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 this one was not the pub but 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.449
 really it's the ice that looks 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.579
 more to ice marc fleury 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.680
 she is very very white she has the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.460
 same taste and now I'm showing you 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.950
 how to do 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 the very perfect then you started 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 by cleaning the strawberries and now 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.140
 we come to mix them so be with a little 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.050
 shy sisters are the ways with everything 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.879
 just a little pass is then 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.590
 once you have mixed your press 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.930
 you will add a little bit of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.989
 lime or lemon that's that 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.289
 really depends on your taste and then 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.399
 you will add a 1/2 spoon to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.399
 sugar coffee 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.900
 we mix well 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.520
 then you have them up one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.740
 construction site so that's very simple 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.470
 you take a very fresh container of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 the fresh cream and a whip and 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.180
 is once whipped and well 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.580
 do we come there sugar is very 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.070
 slightly and for my part I decided 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.049
 to put the whipped cream in a pocket 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.420
 reviewed to make you really beautiful decor 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 for dressage it's very simple you 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.159
 come and put parcels at the bottom of a glass 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.140
 and then you add the ice cream so 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.439
 I decided to go to the pocket 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 socket 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.850
 but you can do it with a spoon 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
 there is no problem so in the beginning you have to be 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.290
 pretty delicate then we come back to put 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:51.810
 parcel from above and there we become 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.990
 just added the cream 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990
 chantilly 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.020
 we really have a bad start 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.789
 now I'm going to taste all that and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.359
 I think it's going to be a big 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.280
 kill you while you say apart ben 

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:10.200
 that it was really very very good the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.849
 Homemade strawberry coulis is delicious 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.129
 it's good for you know that 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.970
 that you put in the ice is very 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.129
 good too 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.150
 talking about the ice I wanted to know 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.340

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.920

 red makes the video I have left 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.879
 still a test of my bts but I 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.069
 think when you look at it and 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.750
 Well, I would have finished that it will be really 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.180

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.579
