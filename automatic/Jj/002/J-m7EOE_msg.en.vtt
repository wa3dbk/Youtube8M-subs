pretty interesting all right so you kind

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.850 
pretty interesting all right so you kind
of<00:00:55.180> measures<00:00:55.570> I<00:00:55.720> guess<00:00:56.339> alright<00:00:57.339> alright

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
of measures I guess alright alright

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.500 
of measures I guess alright alright
alright<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.070> basically<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.640> same<00:01:00.790> controls<00:01:01.239> I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
alright so basically the same controls I

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.070 
alright so basically the same controls I

12<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.980> AI<00:02:59.159> would<00:02:59.519> literally<00:02:59.790> just<00:03:00.060> try<00:03:00.480> and

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
12 the AI would literally just try and

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.119 
12 the AI would literally just try and
rim<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:00.840> around<00:03:00.989> the<00:03:01.109> boards<00:03:01.379> every<00:03:01.709> time<00:03:01.920> they

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
rim it around the boards every time they

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.940 
rim it around the boards every time they
do<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.819> stupid<00:03:03.209> board<00:03:03.450> play<00:03:03.769> which<00:03:04.769> was

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
itself is okay like when you pin

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.699 
itself is okay like when you pin
somebody<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.810> when<00:03:09.930> they<00:03:10.019> just<00:03:10.230> go<00:03:10.409> into<00:03:10.590> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
somebody but when they just go into the

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
I thought the AI was better all right

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.370 
I thought the AI was better all right
all<00:03:57.090> right<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.780> guys<00:03:57.900> should

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.670

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
totally thought the AO is better like

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.910 
totally thought the AO is better like
the<00:04:05.210> goalie<00:04:05.450> itself<00:04:05.930> seems<00:04:06.320> like<00:04:06.470> a<00:04:06.500> lot<00:04:06.740> more

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
the goalie itself seems like a lot more

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.670 
the goalie itself seems like a lot more
fluid<00:04:07.340> or<00:04:08.060> maybe<00:04:08.210> it's<00:04:08.330> just<00:04:08.390> more<00:04:08.630> respondent
