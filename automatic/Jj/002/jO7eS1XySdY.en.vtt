00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
what I think is well the flat-out best

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.650 
what I think is well the flat-out best
dog<00:00:24.410> fighter<00:00:24.710> in<00:00:24.860> the<00:00:24.949> game<00:00:25.270> not<00:00:26.270> the<00:00:26.329> best

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:26.660 
dog fighter in the game not the best

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.470 
dog fighter in the game not the best
aircraft<00:00:27.169> but<00:00:27.439> the<00:00:27.619> best<00:00:27.829> dog<00:00:28.820> fighter<00:00:29.180> and

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
aircraft but the best dog fighter and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.160 
aircraft but the best dog fighter and
that's<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.080> a6<00:00:30.500> m30<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:32.419> planes<00:00:32.629> extremely

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
that's the a6 m30 this planes extremely

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.020 
that's the a6 m30 this planes extremely
agile<00:00:33.620> has<00:00:33.860> a<00:00:33.890> very<00:00:34.400> tight<00:00:34.670> turning<00:00:35.000> circle

agile has a very tight turning circle

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.430 
agile has a very tight turning circle
climbs<00:00:35.750> really<00:00:36.050> well

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
climbs really well

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.259 
climbs really well
not<00:00:36.800> to<00:00:36.949> mention<00:00:37.129> maintains<00:00:37.760> its<00:00:37.970> momentum

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
not to mention maintains its momentum

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.600 
not to mention maintains its momentum
through<00:00:38.780> these<00:00:38.930> maneuvers<00:00:39.460> extremely<00:00:40.460> well

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
through these maneuvers extremely well

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.210 
through these maneuvers extremely well
now<00:00:41.510> here<00:00:41.750> I'm<00:00:41.839> flying<00:00:42.079> it<00:00:42.260> in<00:00:42.440> the<00:00:42.680> historical

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
now here I'm flying it in the historical

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.760 
now here I'm flying it in the historical
event<00:00:43.489> Battle<00:00:43.879> of<00:00:43.970> Midway<00:00:44.150> and<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:45.350> use<00:00:45.620> this

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
event Battle of Midway and I use this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.350 
event Battle of Midway and I use this
footage<00:00:46.129> because<00:00:46.309> I<00:00:46.550> really<00:00:46.789> think<00:00:47.000> it<00:00:47.120> shows

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
footage because I really think it shows

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.920 
footage because I really think it shows
both<00:00:48.039> how<00:00:49.039> amazingly<00:00:49.879> well<00:00:50.180> this<00:00:50.480> plane<00:00:50.719> is

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
both how amazingly well this plane is

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.049 
both how amazingly well this plane is
suited<00:00:51.559> for<00:00:51.590> dogfighting<00:00:52.280> but<00:00:52.820> it<00:00:52.910> also

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
suited for dogfighting but it also

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.540 
suited for dogfighting but it also
really<00:00:53.480> highlights<00:00:53.989> its<00:00:54.320> major<00:00:54.739> weakness<00:00:55.280> and

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
really highlights its major weakness and

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.389 
really highlights its major weakness and
that<00:00:55.760> is<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.120> our<00:00:56.329> member<00:00:56.829> now<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.890> zero<00:00:58.219> was

not<00:02:08.090> really<00:02:08.300> heating<00:02:08.629> that<00:02:08.720> warning<00:02:09.110> they<00:02:09.259> saw

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
not really heating that warning they saw

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.729 
not really heating that warning they saw
me<00:02:09.649> shooting<00:02:10.720> there<00:02:11.720> buddy<00:02:11.959> initially<00:02:12.530> and

those shells bouncing off aircraft and

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.390 
those shells bouncing off aircraft and
that<00:04:06.909> could<00:04:07.090> be<00:04:07.180> pretty<00:04:07.569> frustrating<00:04:08.400> now

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
that could be pretty frustrating now

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.490 
that could be pretty frustrating now

the ki-61 I don't think I would have

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.640

made<00:04:15.400> it<00:04:15.519> out<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.699> this<00:04:15.760> dog<00:04:16.000> but<00:04:16.269> I<00:04:16.539> got<00:04:17.500> myself

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
made it out of this dog but I got myself

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.189 
made it out of this dog but I got myself
a<00:04:17.889> new<00:04:17.979> situation<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.759> and<00:04:19.150> pretty<00:04:19.389> much<00:04:19.570> any

a new situation that and pretty much any

a new situation that and pretty much any
other<00:04:20.440> fighter<00:04:20.739> means<00:04:21.370> death<00:04:21.759> you're<00:04:22.630> on

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
other fighter means death you're on

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.080 
other fighter means death you're on
enemy's<00:04:23.110> tail<00:04:23.380> you<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.800> lured<00:04:24.099> back<00:04:24.580> you're

enemy's tail you get lured back you're

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.200 
enemy's tail you get lured back you're
slow<00:04:25.389> you're<00:04:25.419> turning<00:04:26.169> and<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:27.639> get<00:04:27.820> pounced

slow you're turning and you get pounced

on by two three four enemy fighters
that<00:04:31.539> usually<00:04:31.870> means<00:04:32.080> that<00:04:32.200> you're<00:04:32.409> gonna<00:04:32.529> die

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
that usually means that you're gonna die

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.320 
that usually means that you're gonna die

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
but with this planes maneuverability I

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.720 
but with this planes maneuverability I
was<00:04:37.330> able<00:04:37.450> to<00:04:37.630> to<00:04:38.260> fight<00:04:38.530> off<00:04:38.740> counter<00:04:39.460> enemy

to see I've at this point I've a really

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.680 
to see I've at this point I've a really
low<00:05:08.410> in<00:05:08.530> ammo<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.040> I'm<00:05:09.430> trying<00:05:09.730> to<00:05:09.790> run<00:05:10.000> run

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
for home to do the perilous carrier

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.780 
for home to do the perilous carrier
landing<00:05:13.300> but<00:05:14.200> I've<00:05:14.800> been<00:05:15.040> intercepted<00:05:15.610> by<00:05:15.760> a

landing but I've been intercepted by a

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.060 
landing but I've been intercepted by a
couple<00:05:16.030> more<00:05:16.270> planes<00:05:16.570> and<00:05:16.930> I'm<00:05:17.770> going<00:05:17.890> to<00:05:17.920> have

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
couple more planes and I'm going to have

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.670 
couple more planes and I'm going to have
to<00:05:18.160> fight<00:05:18.370> my<00:05:18.520> way<00:05:18.670> out<00:05:18.700> of<00:05:18.850> this<00:05:19.030> situation

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
to fight my way out of this situation

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.750 
to fight my way out of this situation
and<00:05:20.680> again<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:21.040> maneuverability<00:05:21.610> this

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
and again the maneuverability this

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.670 
and again the maneuverability this
aircrafts<00:05:22.210> going<00:05:22.360> to<00:05:22.450> save<00:05:22.630> me<00:05:22.810> in<00:05:23.380> this

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
aircrafts going to save me in this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.400 
aircrafts going to save me in this
engagement<00:05:24.010> as<00:05:24.430> well<00:05:24.700> but<00:05:25.630> but<00:05:25.930> another<00:05:26.170> thing

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
engagement as well but but another thing

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.290 
engagement as well but but another thing
is<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.890> it's<00:05:27.520> actually<00:05:27.610> going<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:27.940> highlight

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
is that it's actually going to highlight

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.510 
is that it's actually going to highlight
again<00:05:28.960> the<00:05:29.170> weakness<00:05:29.530> of<00:05:29.770> the<00:05:29.980> aircraft's

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
again the weakness of the aircraft's

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.480 
again the weakness of the aircraft's
armament<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.600> Kitty<00:05:31.840> Hawk<00:05:32.050> has<00:05:32.500> gotten

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
armament this Kitty Hawk has gotten

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:36.480 
armament this Kitty Hawk has gotten
himself<00:05:33.690> extremely<00:05:34.690> slow<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.260> I'm<00:05:36.250> just

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
himself extremely slow and I'm just

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.760 
himself extremely slow and I'm just
going<00:05:36.610> to<00:05:36.700> easily<00:05:36.880> turn<00:05:37.270> inside<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.750> them<00:05:37.900> I'm

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
going to easily turn inside of them I'm

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.350 
going to easily turn inside of them I'm
gonna<00:05:38.860> pepper<00:05:39.190> on<00:05:39.370> with<00:05:39.550> a<00:05:39.580> few<00:05:39.880> thirty

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
got another plane on my tail and if I

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.130 
got another plane on my tail and if I
sit<00:06:06.610> there<00:06:06.700> and<00:06:06.820> try<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.030> rip<00:06:07.990> them<00:06:08.110> apart

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:08.140

with<00:06:08.500> those<00:06:08.620> thirty<00:06:08.890> Cal's<00:06:09.190> I'm<00:06:09.520> just<00:06:09.970> gonna

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:10.060 
with those thirty Cal's I'm just gonna

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.560 
with those thirty Cal's I'm just gonna
get<00:06:10.240> myself<00:06:10.420> shot<00:06:10.630> down<00:06:11.520> so<00:06:12.520> again<00:06:12.760> I<00:06:12.790> mean<00:06:13.030> if

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:13.570 
get myself shot down so again I mean if

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.010 
get myself shot down so again I mean if
I<00:06:14.080> had<00:06:14.430> perhaps<00:06:15.430> faster<00:06:15.970> firing<00:06:16.210> machine<00:06:16.690> guns

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
I had perhaps faster firing machine guns

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.800 
I had perhaps faster firing machine guns
or<00:06:17.670> more<00:06:18.670> cannon<00:06:19.030> ammo<00:06:19.270> I<00:06:19.300> would<00:06:19.600> have<00:06:19.720> been

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:19.810 
or more cannon ammo I would have been

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:22.800 
or more cannon ammo I would have been
able<00:06:19.960> to<00:06:20.050> shoot<00:06:20.260> him<00:06:20.410> down<00:06:20.940> or<00:06:21.940> maybe<00:06:22.390> even<00:06:22.510> a

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
able to shoot him down or maybe even a

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.110 
able to shoot him down or maybe even a
different<00:06:23.050> loadout<00:06:23.470> all<00:06:23.590> together<00:06:23.770> just<00:06:24.120> for

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 
different loadout all together just for

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.120 
different loadout all together just for

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.130 
50 Cal machine guns I think I would have

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:39.940 
damage to an aircraft and if you don't

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:41.040 
damage to an aircraft and if you don't
shoot<00:06:40.120> them<00:06:40.240> down<00:06:40.420> you're<00:06:40.660> going<00:06:40.780> to<00:06:40.870> take

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:48.360 
you make it back home on damage alone

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.719 
you make it back home on damage alone
now<00:06:48.569> obviously<00:06:49.349> the<00:06:49.949> combat<00:06:50.310> warthunder

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
now obviously the combat warthunder

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:53.420 
now obviously the combat warthunder
differs<00:06:51.180> because<00:06:51.710> most<00:06:52.710> pilots<00:06:53.069> don't<00:06:53.189> really

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
differs because most pilots don't really

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.920 
differs because most pilots don't really
care<00:06:53.610> about<00:06:53.819> getting<00:06:54.030> home<00:06:54.240> they<00:06:54.539> just<00:06:54.569> want

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
care about getting home they just want

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.499 
care about getting home they just want
to<00:06:55.020> get<00:06:55.139> as<00:06:55.349> many<00:06:55.530> kills<00:06:55.830> as<00:06:56.009> they<00:06:56.129> can<00:06:56.509> before

00:06:57.499 --> 00:06:57.509 
to get as many kills as they can before

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.649 
to get as many kills as they can before
getting<00:06:57.930> shot<00:06:58.110> down<00:06:58.289> themselves<00:06:59.360> so<00:07:00.360> how<00:07:00.509> well

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659 
getting shot down themselves so how well

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:02.119 
getting shot down themselves so how well
does<00:07:00.840> this<00:07:00.960> plane<00:07:01.199> translate<00:07:01.650> to<00:07:01.800> Arcade<00:07:02.099> Mode

00:07:02.119 --> 00:07:02.129 
does this plane translate to Arcade Mode

00:07:02.129 --> 00:07:04.159 
does this plane translate to Arcade Mode
well<00:07:02.729> my<00:07:02.879> opinion<00:07:03.150> is<00:07:03.360> pretty<00:07:03.599> much<00:07:03.810> the<00:07:03.960> same

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
well my opinion is pretty much the same

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:06.439 
well my opinion is pretty much the same
you<00:07:05.159> get<00:07:05.280> out<00:07:05.370> turning<00:07:05.729> out<00:07:05.819> maneuver<00:07:06.180> it<00:07:06.240> just

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:06.449 
you get out turning out maneuver it just

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.839 
you get out turning out maneuver it just
about<00:07:06.569> everyone<00:07:07.080> but<00:07:07.770> the<00:07:08.039> lack<00:07:08.250> of<00:07:08.280> can<00:07:08.639> and

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:08.849 
about everyone but the lack of can and

00:07:08.849 --> 00:07:11.659 
about everyone but the lack of can and
ammunition<00:07:09.060> really<00:07:09.719> is<00:07:09.960> a<00:07:10.770> big<00:07:11.069> hindrance<00:07:11.310> in

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669 
ammunition really is a big hindrance in

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.330 
ammunition really is a big hindrance in
arcade<00:07:12.030> mode<00:07:12.210> you<00:07:13.020> can<00:07:13.289> typically<00:07:13.740> only<00:07:13.979> shoot

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:14.340 
arcade mode you can typically only shoot

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.279 
arcade mode you can typically only shoot
down<00:07:14.550> a<00:07:14.580> plane<00:07:14.849> maybe<00:07:15.389> two<00:07:15.659> before<00:07:16.199> you're

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:16.289 
down a plane maybe two before you're

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:18.860 
down a plane maybe two before you're
going<00:07:16.379> to<00:07:16.469> have<00:07:16.530> to<00:07:16.740> reload<00:07:17.129> and<00:07:17.659> even<00:07:18.659> with<00:07:18.840> a

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:18.870 
going to have to reload and even with a

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.270 
going to have to reload and even with a
fully<00:07:19.139> upgraded<00:07:19.229> reload<00:07:19.860> you<00:07:19.979> still<00:07:20.159> gotta

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
fully upgraded reload you still gotta

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.920 
fully upgraded reload you still gotta
wait<00:07:20.430> 15<00:07:20.879> seconds<00:07:21.360> now<00:07:21.569> if<00:07:21.690> you're<00:07:21.810> in<00:07:21.870> the

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:21.930 
wait 15 seconds now if you're in the

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.290 
wait 15 seconds now if you're in the
middle<00:07:22.110> of<00:07:22.289> a<00:07:22.349> swirling<00:07:22.800> dog<00:07:23.009> but<00:07:23.310> that's<00:07:23.879> you

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:24.300 
middle of a swirling dog but that's you

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.809 
middle of a swirling dog but that's you
know<00:07:24.360> 15<00:07:24.810> seconds<00:07:25.229> of<00:07:25.319> you<00:07:25.490> trying<00:07:26.490> to<00:07:26.639> turn

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 
know 15 seconds of you trying to turn

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.629 
know 15 seconds of you trying to turn
and<00:07:27.090> not<00:07:27.240> get<00:07:27.449> shot<00:07:27.479> down<00:07:28.069> but<00:07:29.069> even<00:07:29.280> so<00:07:29.460> I've

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 
and not get shot down but even so I've

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.740 
and not get shot down but even so I've

managed to get myself into those

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.959 
managed to get myself into those
situations<00:07:31.409> and<00:07:31.680> swirling<00:07:32.520> masses<00:07:32.699> of
