00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone you wandered back to ours 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 non-standard channel where there is no or almost 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.559
 no local routine 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.200
 Hiroshi as I put it so here I open 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.269
 new heading so here I open a new one 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.980
 heading which is the first 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 impression of any anime without 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.990
 impromptu but exactly what I will try 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.130
 first impression give out what is today 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.820
 we have anime 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.820
 gangsta 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.500
 first some facts original manga 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.989
 It seems written already so far 2010 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.780
 year and that's all my lazy ass 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.790
 I could find except for the author but I think 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.100
 someone is interested oh well not the manga 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.949
 the truth is that we understand that the show so 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.780
 tell him animeshka waited strongly with 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.329
 the first trailer pulled so not bad 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.110
 crispy fried black 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.720
 lagoons 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.729
 and I love this thing very much 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.500
 in our time for some reason this is not much 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.329
 are eager to do, given that 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.519
 Original manka four years ago 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.799
 gotta go see these guys don't 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.650
 God hastily judge them 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.799
 good though came out on this main thanks 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.170
 heroes we have here damn well that's how I am 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.600
 love a couple of thugs survive as 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.180
 may be moderately similar to each other but 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.130
 differ in order and most importantly 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.000
 3g fortune teller do not you like them 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.890
 met backbori flashback whose 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
 2 series already began to begin well such 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.150
 hints on them well and the moment with the language 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.930
 gestures of course fresh looks 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.400
 not bad 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.990
 currencies only the main thing do not forget 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.299
 include subtitle and then I have more than once 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.090
 appeared on this voiced everything pretty 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:40.299
 They try very hard not to overplay 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.700
 but select at least someone other than they 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.469
 Nicholas mentioned to the night I can not but 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 the old woman is probably still funny but it 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:49.689
 it always happens without any frills in general 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.210
 I advise Russian Orthodox tandem 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.219
 jam and trina dubovitskaya but this is a sign 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.139
 qualities jim as usual excellent 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.840
 voiced by this kind of characters 

00:01:56.139 --> 00:02:01.719
 born praised him now probably 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.880
 like a bit of a bandyuk if you hurry the tournament 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:05.590
 also not bad especially as something to me 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.929
 suggests that female characters 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.300
 there will be not very much but the second series in 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:13.440
 principle, this time convinced but while 2 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.319
 ok enough so think guys 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.069
 think naturalistic as if with 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.410
 first frames 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.380
 we are openly told dude look 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.569
 reality 20 pahari you get used to this 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.240
 reality bang once again there are prostitutes 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.709
 and causing doing what they do 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.490
 prostitutes nice that you immediately 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.440
 honest plus the plot our heroes in general 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:36.960
 strange so even 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.790
 backwater shorter know this girl and already 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.280
 surely nobody breaks from the very first seconds 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 to save her mu see she is so in the form 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.090
 well, to a certain point, of course 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.310
 then everything is standard 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.260
 and there already usual atom usually for 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.930
 such a serial permanent fornicators 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.990
 However, the girl is gorgeous so I would 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.300
 here any excuse came up like this on 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:00.000
 surprise inappropriate humor is missing 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.430
 that just strikes exactly how and then 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.730
 that you can laugh straight strongly 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.920
 I'll smile maybe up to 2 series again 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.580
 you can, in principle, not even understanding but 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.080
 manga let's say no one was famous for his very 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.860
 specific humor waiting for him with 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.870
 looking forward 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.690
 how where are the episodes left to wear in each 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.150
 will joke action well yet unclear good 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.920
 animation does not let us down at all decent 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.920
 second series again 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.590
 better than 1 surprisingly but somehow not 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.770
 I donâ€™t want to know the level of 2015 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.690
 somehow more moments like a screensaver 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.430
 Generally more such moments well 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.320
 thank you static frame mail is not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.120
 prevailing amount don't get it 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.400
 wrong i appreciate a competent pause 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.500
 especially when it is needed when around 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.450
 it is arranged exposure to certain 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.070
 way in general when on to the place here 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.980
 there are such moments too 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.610
 yes it pleases but I want from this 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.709
 anime 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.390
 for more action remember black 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.050
 lagoon there all this waiting firstly 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.770
 paid off 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:02.220
 and secondly not so long but it was 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.640
 the result is a really catchy pilot episode 2 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:08.489
 definitely advise you to check out if further 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.830
 It will be at least no worse than the precise inspection 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.420
 the more promise only a dozen of the series so 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.760
 what time to spend it is not much 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:18.630
 get a lot yes and it will come out already faster 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.690
 than any 26 serial 24 or 20 + series 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.120
 in general, you understand and again the final 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.130
 I advise as well as advise to subscribe 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.650
 on the channel to be aware of anything not 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.790
 power you format no other way 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.790
 do see you 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.950
 we do 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.950
 but
