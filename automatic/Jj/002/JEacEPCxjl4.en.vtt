00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.789 
when you save it and refresh it it
should<00:01:50.880> pop<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.229> some<00:01:52.409> text

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
should pop up so now we have some text

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.200 
should pop up so now we have some text
in<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> body<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.369> says<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.820> am<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.710> body<00:01:56.280> so

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
in the body it says I am in the body so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.109 
in the body it says I am in the body so
that<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:58.500> how<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:58.710> put<00:01:59.009> text<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> body<00:01:59.790> but

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that is how we put text in the body but

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.359 
that is how we put text in the body but
if<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.810> knew<00:02:01.020> how<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> do<00:02:01.439> was<00:02:01.890> put<00:02:02.100> Domo

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
if all we knew how to do was put Domo

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.450 
if all we knew how to do was put Domo
text<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.659> body<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.710> know<00:02:04.829> we<00:02:05.399> are

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
text in the body then you know we are

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.880 
text in the body then you know we are
not<00:02:05.670> very<00:02:05.969> far<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.479> our<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.810> opening<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.680> web

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
not very far on our way to opening a web

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.749 
not very far on our way to opening a web
design<00:02:08.190> business<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.879> we<00:02:09.390> need

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
design business so we need

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.910 
design business so we need
learn<00:02:10.000> something<00:02:10.689> else<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.200> what<00:02:11.590> I'm<00:02:11.680> going

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
learn something else and what I'm going

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.649 
learn something else and what I'm going
to<00:02:11.950> teach<00:02:12.099> you<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.489> one<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:12.909> most<00:02:13.060> basic

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:13.659 
to teach you is one of the most basic

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.470 
to teach you is one of the most basic
concepts<00:02:14.170> whenever<00:02:14.829> you<00:02:15.069> write<00:02:15.400> articles<00:02:16.030> or

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
concepts whenever you write articles or

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.589 
concepts whenever you write articles or
you<00:02:16.510> make<00:02:17.500> titles<00:02:18.040> for<00:02:18.400> your<00:02:18.610> website<00:02:19.360> and

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
you make titles for your website and

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.280 
you make titles for your website and
that<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.560> how<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.280> create<00:02:21.700> a<00:02:21.879> header<00:02:22.209> now<00:02:22.900> if

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
that is how to create a header now if

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.319 
that is how to create a header now if
you're<00:02:23.709> saying<00:02:23.890> all<00:02:24.099> right<00:02:24.129> what<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.879> heck<00:02:25.120> is

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:25.329 
you're saying all right what the heck is

00:02:25.329 --> 00:02:27.180 
you're saying all right what the heck is
a<00:02:25.360> header<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.959> header<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.500> totally<00:02:27.010> different

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
a header a header is totally different

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.970 
a header a header is totally different
from<00:02:27.970> the<00:02:28.239> head<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:29.200> don't<00:02:29.379> even<00:02:29.530> you<00:02:29.829> know

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
from the head it so don't even you know

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.410 
from the head it so don't even you know
I<00:02:30.190> shouldn't<00:02:30.610> have<00:02:30.700> even<00:02:30.819> pointed<00:02:31.269> that<00:02:31.360> out

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
I shouldn't have even pointed that out

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.210 
I shouldn't have even pointed that out
because<00:02:31.599> it's<00:02:32.560> probably<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:33.010> going<00:02:33.159> to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
because it's probably just going to

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
because it's probably just going to
confuse<00:02:33.400> me<00:02:33.760> now<00:02:33.909> but<00:02:34.150> a<00:02:34.390> header<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.349> pretty

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
confuse me now but a header is pretty

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.819 
confuse me now but a header is pretty
much<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:37.090> title<00:02:37.569> think<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.170> like<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.560> header

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
much the title think of like the header

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.089 
much the title think of like the header
on<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.189> newspaper<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.060> says<00:02:40.299> like<00:02:40.890> the<00:02:41.890> world

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
on a newspaper that says like the world

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.520 
on a newspaper that says like the world
is<00:02:42.340> going<00:02:42.519> to<00:02:42.579> end<00:02:42.760> in<00:02:42.940> 2012<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:44.079> pretty<00:02:44.379> much

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
is going to end in 2012 it's pretty much

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.589 
is going to end in 2012 it's pretty much
the<00:02:45.069> title<00:02:45.549> that<00:02:45.700> you<00:02:45.819> would<00:02:45.970> put<00:02:46.150> above<00:02:46.480> a

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
the title that you would put above a

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.050 
the title that you would put above a
paragraph<00:02:47.109> so<00:02:47.319> let's<00:02:47.769> go<00:02:47.920> ahead<00:02:48.040> and<00:02:48.519> we'll

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
paragraph so let's go ahead and we'll

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.539 
paragraph so let's go ahead and we'll
keep<00:02:49.269> that<00:02:49.329> I'm<00:02:49.690> in<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:49.989> body<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:50.500> above<00:02:51.310> it

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
keep that I'm in the body but above it

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.640 
keep that I'm in the body but above it
but<00:02:51.970> still<00:02:52.239> in<00:02:52.420> your<00:02:52.569> body<00:02:52.750> we're<00:02:53.440> going<00:02:53.560> to

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
but still in your body we're going to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.470 
but still in your body we're going to
add<00:02:53.769> something<00:02:54.069> like<00:02:54.579> I<00:02:54.700> said<00:02:54.940> called<00:02:55.329> a

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
add something like I said called a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.920 
add something like I said called a
header<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.909> let<00:02:57.909> me<00:02:58.030> reiterate<00:02:58.329> this<00:02:58.750> one

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
header now let me reiterate this one

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.020 
header now let me reiterate this one
more<00:02:59.079> time<00:02:59.230> a<00:02:59.409> header<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.889> basically<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.519> bold

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
more time a header is basically a bold

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.710 
more time a header is basically a bold
big<00:03:01.870> title<00:03:02.620> now<00:03:03.129> by<00:03:03.639> default<00:03:03.700> they<00:03:04.389> come<00:03:04.569> in

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
big title now by default they come in

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.020 
big title now by default they come in
six<00:03:05.019> different<00:03:05.230> sizes<00:03:05.590> header<00:03:06.129> one<00:03:06.459> header

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030

header two is a little bit smaller and
they<00:03:15.069> keep<00:03:15.280> getting<00:03:15.430> smaller<00:03:15.790> all<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:16.209> way

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
an example before I you know before I

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.210 
an example before I you know before I
confuse<00:03:22.750> it<00:03:22.900> too<00:03:22.989> much<00:03:23.139> so<00:03:23.199> in<00:03:23.560> order<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.069> make

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
confuse it too much so in order to make

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.780 
confuse it too much so in order to make
a<00:03:24.250> header<00:03:24.489> go<00:03:25.150> ahead<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.629> in<00:03:25.780> your<00:03:25.930> tags<00:03:26.139> tape

the header now let's go ahead and make

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:35.819 
the header now let's go ahead and make
our<00:03:32.980> ending<00:03:33.459> tag<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:34.060> we'll<00:03:34.780> name<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.139> h1

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
body right here is we have a big header

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.930 
body right here is we have a big header
a<00:04:33.530> header<00:04:34.530> under<00:04:34.979> it<00:04:35.160> that's<00:04:35.400> slightly

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
a header under it that's slightly

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.659 
a header under it that's slightly
smaller<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.690> we<00:04:37.470> have<00:04:37.650> just<00:04:37.889> a<00:04:37.949> regular<00:04:38.070> text

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:38.669 
smaller and we have just a regular text

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:40.010 
smaller and we have just a regular text
so<00:04:38.760> let<00:04:39.000> me<00:04:39.090> show<00:04:39.270> you<00:04:39.360> guys<00:04:39.419> the<00:04:39.660> difference

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
so let me show you guys the difference

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.230 
so let me show you guys the difference
between<00:04:40.260> header<00:04:40.650> one<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.160> header<00:04:41.370> two<00:04:41.639> let's

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
between header one and header two let's

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.750 
between header one and header two let's
go<00:04:42.389> ahead<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.780> save<00:04:43.020> this<00:04:43.260> and<00:04:43.590> refresh<00:04:44.520> our

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
go ahead and save this and refresh our

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.689 
go ahead and save this and refresh our
web<00:04:45.060> page<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.570> it<00:04:45.990> says<00:04:46.169> BAM<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:47.100> world<00:04:47.340> ends

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
web page and it says BAM the world ends

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:48.680 
web page and it says BAM the world ends
in<00:04:47.820> 2012

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
in 2012

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.219 
in 2012
this<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.080> header<00:04:49.320> 1<00:04:50.000> this<00:04:51.000> is<00:04:51.240> header<00:04:51.479> 2<00:04:51.870> and

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
this is header 1 this is header 2 and

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:55.100 
this is header 1 this is header 2 and
this<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.340> the<00:04:53.430> regular<00:04:53.880> plain<00:04:54.510> old<00:04:54.539> text<00:04:55.020> that

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
this is the regular plain old text that

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.680 
this is the regular plain old text that
isn't<00:04:55.410> surrounded<00:04:55.830> by<00:04:55.979> any<00:04:56.220> tags<00:04:56.639> at<00:04:56.940> all<00:04:57.090> so

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
isn't surrounded by any tags at all so

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.659 
isn't surrounded by any tags at all so
now<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:57.990> can<00:04:58.289> see<00:04:58.530> the<00:04:58.740> difference<00:04:59.220> a<00:04:59.430> header

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
now you can see the difference a header

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.270 
now you can see the difference a header
makes<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:01.169> different<00:05:01.530> sizes<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.039> get

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
makes and the different sizes you get

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.370 
makes and the different sizes you get
from<00:05:02.580> having<00:05:02.970> one<00:05:03.210> two<00:05:03.810> and<00:05:04.110> they<00:05:04.199> keep

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
from having one two and they keep

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.159 
from having one two and they keep
getting<00:05:04.590> smaller<00:05:05.010> all<00:05:05.370> the<00:05:05.550> way<00:05:05.639> down<00:05:05.880> to<00:05:06.060> 6<00:05:06.330> so

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
getting smaller all the way down to 6 so

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.590 
getting smaller all the way down to 6 so
anyways<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:08.190> is<00:05:08.220> how<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:08.610> create<00:05:08.940> a<00:05:09.030> basic

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
anyways that is how you create a basic

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.379 
anyways that is how you create a basic
header<00:05:09.870> and<00:05:10.199> also<00:05:10.919> add<00:05:11.100> basic<00:05:11.610> text<00:05:12.090> in<00:05:12.240> your

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
header and also add basic text in your

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.920 
header and also add basic text in your
body<00:05:12.600> so<00:05:13.380> pretty<00:05:13.919> simple<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.460> know<00:05:14.490> but<00:05:15.000> hey<00:05:15.240> we

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
body so pretty simple I know but hey we

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.900 
body so pretty simple I know but hey we
need<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.440> you<00:05:16.979> know<00:05:17.100> a<00:05:17.340> good<00:05:17.669> foundation

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
need this you know a good foundation

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.850 
need this you know a good foundation
before<00:05:18.510> we<00:05:18.840> can<00:05:19.020> you<00:05:19.169> know<00:05:19.289> start<00:05:19.530> adding

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
before we can you know start adding

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.850 
before we can you know start adding
images<00:05:20.370> and<00:05:20.760> making<00:05:21.419> cool<00:05:22.020> games<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.680> stuff

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
images and making cool games and stuff

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.680 
images and making cool games and stuff
like<00:05:23.010> that<00:05:23.220> I<00:05:23.250> mean<00:05:23.370> start<00:05:24.060> with<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.270> basics

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
like that I mean start with the basics

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.420 
like that I mean start with the basics
and<00:05:24.840> eventually<00:05:25.710> by<00:05:26.010> the<00:05:26.070> end<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.340> these

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
and eventually by the end of these
