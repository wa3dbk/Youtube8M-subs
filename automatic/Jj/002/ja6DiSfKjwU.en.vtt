00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 5 mistakes in skin care that 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.259
 they make you look older update your 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.260
 Hair color is a quick way to 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.230
 change your appearance as the woman 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.020
 Your hair ages and your style should 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.869
 change according to your maturity what 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.520
 It's flattering for a teenager 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.730
 normally it is not appropriate for a 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.920
 middle-aged woman create a contrast 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
 subtle and flattering color shades 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.570
 for mature skin the goal of the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.289
 Choice of color that will make you look more 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 young boys 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.750
 ultimately flattering to your skin 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 there are chestnut tones that are 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.149
 favorable to almost everyone among the 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.000
 dark brown chocolate and chestnut 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.000
 clear golden sure there's a tone to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.460
 each one a secondary bar effect of 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.489
 aging is the loss of pigment 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.280
 of the skin is therefore better 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.699
 rinse the hair one or two shades a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.739
 lighter color will make you look younger 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.730
 avoid dark brown or black tones 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.190
 in stead of 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.950
 I said a medium chocolate brown or a 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.170
 light brown sand blonde hair 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 Blonde is an ideal option for 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.080
 mature women since it adds life to their 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.540
 skin while hiding gray hair 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.119
 If you are blonde or you are going to transform into 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.180
 blonde chooses a blonde honey color with 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:28.240
 golden highlights this tone of blonde 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.119
 adds a pink touch to the skin prevents 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.380
 the blond ash or the platinum these 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:36.520
 colors could make you look older 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.979
 multidimensional a combination of 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.440
 Multidimensional hair colors creates 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.350
 a young and natural aspect that will enhance 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.960
 your natural beauty the best way to 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.899
 create this style is to make reflections tone 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.820
 on tone this consists of placing a 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:55.149
 mixture of light and dark reflections 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.479
 about your base color these reflections 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.220
 they must be subtle too much contrast 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.220
 can produce an effect of 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.289
 aging the clear reflexes are 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.929
 must do within two more shades 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.039
 clear that your natural color 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.200
 Dark reflections should be 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.900
 two shades darker your hair 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.540
 natural makeup can do 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.689
 miracles for you as well as ruining 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.489
 totally your image in this post you 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:24.890
 I comment what are the errors of 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.230
 most common makeup that add up years 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.230
 and they make you look much older than 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.510
 that you're really a lot of mistakes 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.760
 of makeup that make you look older 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.970
 too much base or too little product 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.980
 can have an undesirable effect the use 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.799
 of a thick base layer will make you 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.049
 look older at any age and if 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.269
 you apply very little you may not cover 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.790
 irregularities of the skin and neither 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.620
 Ok makeup mistakes 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.109
 make up makeup mistakes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.419
 makeup that make you look older and 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:59.659
 choosing the wrong base base 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:01.939
 incorrect also gives you problems by 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.879
 example the powder base goes well for 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:07.069
 oily and young skins while 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.799
 dry or mature skin should use the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.049
 liquid bases one of the largest 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.359
 make-up mistakes that add up years 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.210
 use a base that is too light 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.370
 for your skin tone since it tends to 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.520
 the lines of expression that you can have 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.140
 the wrong corrector the thickness of the 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.590
 corrector has the same effect 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.990
 harmful find a good concealer 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.900
 for dark circles is essential since one of 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.210
 long duration that is very dry will last 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.060
 well but at the same time it will mark all the 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.220
 wrinkles by applying a 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.070
 Illuminator corrector in the corners 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.830
 inside of the eyes you'll get to have 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:48.980
 a lighter look rather than a 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.900
 heavy that makes you look older not to use 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.210
 lip liner do not use the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.430
 Lip liner is undoubtedly one of 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:58.070
 Makeup mistakes that add up 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.650
 to your look but in turn you have to have 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.470
 Be very careful with the color if it is 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.440
 too dark the eyeliner will make 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.070
 your lips look thinner and that's the 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.840
 last thing you want to achieve since 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.970
 naturally the lips thin out to 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.340
 as one ages 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.860
 Ideally, use it in a lighter shade 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.710
 and at the same time prevent the lipstick from running 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:23.930
 peribial wrinkle lip 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:27.050
 too dark a lipstick 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:29.270
 with cold metallic finishes is not what 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.310
 more recommended because it adds years to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.949
 whoever takes it elsewhere 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.660
 application also counts the lipstick should 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:37.820
 apply with a brush and not 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.250
 directly from the bar since a 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.160
 excess product and color never remains 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.710
 well blushed badly applied the ideal is no 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.380
 use dark flushes if you do not know 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.780
 apply well and always spread it on the 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.750
 highest part of the cheekbones in order 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.060
 to achieve a much more jovial image the 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:58.610
 blush should match the color of the 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.949
 lips so it's better to limit the 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.050
 use of blue tonality lipstick inem 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:07.720
 the finish because they can do that in 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.720
 set looks a little graceful skin
