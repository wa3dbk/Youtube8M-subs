that's<00:01:41.659> 1435<00:01:42.659> meg<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.170> give<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.409> an<00:01:43.649> idea<00:01:43.770> of

that's 1435 meg to give you an idea of

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
that's 1435 meg to give you an idea of
size<00:01:44.250> it's<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:44.820> three<00:01:45.210> times<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.689> size<00:01:45.720> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
size it's about three times the size of

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
megabytes so let's go for the review

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.330 
megabytes so let's go for the review
card<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.450> top<00:01:51.720> for<00:01:52.049> master<00:01:52.770> storm<00:01:53.009> see<00:01:53.220> how

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
card at the top for master storm see how

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.550 
card at the top for master storm see how
we<00:01:53.399> get<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.640> with<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.030> as<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.840> say<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.140> Wi-Fi

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
we get on with that as I say our Wi-Fi

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.429 
we get on with that as I say our Wi-Fi
network<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.100> fairly<00:01:56.399> fast<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.810> hopefully<00:01:58.020> what

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
network is fairly fast so hopefully what

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.380 
network is fairly fast so hopefully what
if<00:01:58.560> shouldn't<00:01:58.890> take<00:01:59.070> too<00:01:59.100> long<00:01:59.280> just<00:02:00.210> as<00:02:00.360> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
if shouldn't take too long just as a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.620 
if shouldn't take too long just as a
comparison<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:01.259> did<00:02:01.579> download<00:02:02.579> motorstorm<00:02:03.390> for

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
comparison I did download motorstorm for

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.749 
comparison I did download motorstorm for
this<00:02:03.750> as<00:02:03.899> well<00:02:03.930> for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.290> PSP<00:02:04.530> 3000<00:02:05.369> we're

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
this as well for the PSP 3000 we're

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.889 
this as well for the PSP 3000 we're
going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> try<00:02:06.060> both<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.450> them<00:02:06.540> out<00:02:06.659> side<00:02:06.869> by

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
going to try both of them out side by

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.719 
going to try both of them out side by
side<00:02:07.229> later<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.829> see<00:02:07.979> how<00:02:08.160> how<00:02:08.610> they

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
side later so you can see how how they

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
side later so you can see how how they
stack<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:08.940> but<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.750> took<00:02:09.959> about<00:02:10.080> 15<00:02:10.590> minutes

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
stack up but that took about 15 minutes

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.940 
stack up but that took about 15 minutes
yep<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.580> we'll<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.879> how<00:02:11.910> this<00:02:12.060> compares

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
yep so we'll see how this compares

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
yep so we'll see how this compares
so<00:02:13.950> where<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.700> installed<00:02:15.170> motorstorm<00:02:16.170> arctic

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
so where we installed motorstorm arctic

I've<00:02:31.709> been<00:02:31.890> playing<00:02:32.069> a<00:02:32.159> little<00:02:32.250> bit<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.549> this

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
I've been playing a little bit of this

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:34.940 
I've been playing a little bit of this
on<00:02:32.730> there<00:02:33.180> on<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.599> PSP<00:02:33.840> 3000<00:02:34.530> it's<00:02:34.620> my<00:02:34.739> first

on there on the PSP 3000 it's my first

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
go on the PSP go and their blood seems

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.929 
go on the PSP go and their blood seems
to<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.709> identical<00:02:38.310> in<00:02:38.459> terms<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:40.430> gameplay<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
to be identical in terms of gameplay and

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.990 
to be identical in terms of gameplay and
graphics<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:42.629> speed<00:02:43.549> there's<00:02:44.549> not<00:02:44.730> slow<00:02:44.970> down

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
graphics and speed there's not slow down

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.410 
graphics and speed there's not slow down
on<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.480> at<00:02:45.629> all<00:02:46.190> which<00:02:47.190> is<00:02:47.340> good<00:02:50.239> other<00:02:51.239> than

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
on this at all which is good other than

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.390 
on this at all which is good other than
that<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.690> think<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> screen<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.530> is<00:02:52.920> is

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
that I think that the screen is is is

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.449 
that I think that the screen is is is
less<00:02:53.760> shiny<00:02:54.120> on<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.540> PSP<00:02:54.810> girl<00:02:55.200> ya<00:02:55.590> think<00:02:56.250> our

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
less shiny on the PSP girl ya think our

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.330 
less shiny on the PSP girl ya think our
cameras<00:02:56.879> having<00:02:57.379> more<00:02:58.379> luck<00:02:58.409> picking<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.189> up

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
cameras having more luck picking it up

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.460 
cameras having more luck picking it up
picking<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.359> PSP<00:03:00.689> girl<00:03:00.870> screen<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.379> that

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
picking up the PSP girl screen is that

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.520 
picking up the PSP girl screen is that
right<00:03:01.939> and<00:03:02.939> did<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.090> agree<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.450> because<00:03:04.349> the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
right and did we agree that because the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.190 
right and did we agree that because the
because<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.689> others<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:06.750> same<00:03:06.930> amount<00:03:07.019> of

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
because the others the same amount of

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720 
because the others the same amount of
pixels<00:03:07.319> with<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.709> screens<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.010> bit<00:03:08.129> smaller<00:03:08.459> it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
pixels with the screens a bit smaller it

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.550 
pixels with the screens a bit smaller it
looks<00:03:09.060> a<00:03:09.209> little<00:03:09.299> bit<00:03:09.480> crisper<00:03:09.870> I<00:03:10.139> think<00:03:10.500> it

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
looks a little bit crisper I think it

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.629 
looks a little bit crisper I think it
does<00:03:10.650> look<00:03:10.859> a<00:03:10.920> little<00:03:11.040> bit<00:03:11.220> crisper<00:03:11.489> on<00:03:11.549> the

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
does look a little bit crisper on the

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.059 
does look a little bit crisper on the
PSP<00:03:11.879> go<00:03:12.150> yeah<00:03:12.359> one<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.379> cool<00:03:13.530> features<00:03:13.590> of

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
PSP go yeah one of the cool features of

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.470 
PSP go yeah one of the cool features of
the<00:03:14.159> PSP<00:03:14.489> girl<00:03:14.670> that<00:03:14.790> we've<00:03:14.909> noticed<00:03:15.239> already

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the PSP girl that we've noticed already

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.930 
the PSP girl that we've noticed already
is<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> fact<00:03:16.439> that<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.709> can<00:03:16.980> pause<00:03:17.310> games<00:03:17.669> if

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
is the fact that you can pause games if

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.189 
is the fact that you can pause games if
you<00:03:18.030> want<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.359> can<00:03:18.510> actually<00:03:18.660> store<00:03:19.139> the

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
you want so you can actually store the

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.319 
you want so you can actually store the
the<00:03:20.010> state<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.459> it<00:03:20.549> was<00:03:20.669> in<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.000> go<00:03:21.090> and<00:03:21.239> do

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
the state that it was in and go and do
