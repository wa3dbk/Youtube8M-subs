the Dhabi and the box contains so let's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.590 
the Dhabi and the box contains so let's
pull<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.080> out<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:17.460> what<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.150> is

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
pull that out so what we have here is

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
pull that out so what we have here is
the<00:01:18.840> black<00:01:19.200> metallic<00:01:19.860> black<00:01:20.220> variant<00:01:20.700> and<00:01:22.100> yes

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the black metallic black variant and yes

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.380 
the black metallic black variant and yes
it's<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.880> covered<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:25.580> a<00:01:26.580> protective<00:01:27.119> cover

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
it's it's covered in a protective cover

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.749 
it's it's covered in a protective cover
so<00:01:27.990> let's<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.619> out<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.310> tablet<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
so let's take that out the tablet is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
so let's take that out the tablet is
actually<00:01:29.909> quite<00:01:30.360> heavy<00:01:30.680> from<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.799> first

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
actually quite heavy from the first

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
actually quite heavy from the first
impressions<00:01:32.579> we<00:01:32.700> can<00:01:32.880> say<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
impressions we can say that this is a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.170 
impressions we can say that this is a
really<00:01:35.220> heavy<00:01:35.430> tablet<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.150> 490<00:01:37.049> grams<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.180> 9.6

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
really heavy tablet at 490 grams and 9.6

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.810 
really heavy tablet at 490 grams and 9.6
inch<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:40.020> glass<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.650> everything<00:01:41.340> feels

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
inch the glass and everything feels

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.389 
inch the glass and everything feels
heavy<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.290> called<00:01:43.619> metallic<00:01:43.979> black

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
heavy so this is called metallic black

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.179 
heavy so this is called metallic black
but<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.240> device<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.899> obviously<00:01:46.890> fully

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
but the device is obviously fully

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.039 
but the device is obviously fully
plastic<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.149> good<00:01:48.299> thing<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.630> it's<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.020> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
plastic the good thing is it's got a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.410 
plastic the good thing is it's got a
really<00:01:49.320> nice<00:01:49.649> texture<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.850> back<00:01:51.060> which

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
really nice texture at the back which

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.230 
really nice texture at the back which
you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.930> up<00:01:52.170> close<00:01:52.229> here<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.240> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
you can see up close here and this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.789 
you can see up close here and this
definitely<00:01:54.630> improves<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.259> grip<00:01:55.470> and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
definitely improves the grip and

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.310 
definitely improves the grip and
mitigate<00:01:56.520> some<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> weight<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.840> basically

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
mitigate some of the weight so basically

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.959 
mitigate some of the weight so basically
if<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.590> are<00:01:58.619> holding<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.280> won't<00:01:59.520> lose<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
if you are holding it you won't lose it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.130 
if you are holding it you won't lose it
because<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.329> weight<00:02:00.450> because<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.899> grip

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
because of the weight because the grip

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.280 
because of the weight because the grip
is<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.740> better<00:02:02.009> now<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.930> front<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.229> can

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
is much better now to the front you can

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.100 
is much better now to the front you can
see<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.219> sixteen<00:02:05.729> by<00:02:05.759> ten<00:02:06.390> nine

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
see that it has a sixteen by ten nine

and<00:04:13.549> this<00:04:13.849> is<00:04:14.169> 9.6<00:04:15.169> inches<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.519> that's<00:04:16.700> the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
and this is 9.6 inches so that's the

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.209 
and this is 9.6 inches so that's the
major<00:04:17.150> difference<00:04:17.329> in<00:04:17.840> screen<00:04:18.169> size<00:04:18.500> and<00:04:18.769> one

major difference in screen size and one

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:20.560 
major difference in screen size and one
of<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.400> difference<00:04:19.760> is<00:04:19.940> that<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.329> runs

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
of the difference is that this runs

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.420 
of the difference is that this runs
lollipop<00:04:21.169> well<00:04:21.650> this<00:04:21.859> runs<00:04:22.159> Android<00:04:23.150> for

random<00:04:26.550> touches<00:04:27.240> are<00:04:27.360> happening<00:04:27.780> mainly

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
random touches are happening mainly

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.140 
random touches are happening mainly
because<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.470> large<00:04:28.650> screen<00:04:28.979> now<00:04:29.820> going

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
because of the large screen now going

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.510 
because of the large screen now going
into<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.389> settings<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.740> can<00:04:31.919> see<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.310> it's

kitkat<00:04:41.570> so<00:04:42.570> that's<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.110> UI<00:04:43.380> not<00:04:43.830> entirely

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
kitkat so that's the UI not entirely

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.390 
kitkat so that's the UI not entirely
impressive<00:04:45.180> considering<00:04:45.539> that<00:04:45.810> 5.0<00:04:46.770> has<00:04:47.100> made

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
impressive considering that 5.0 has made

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.790 
impressive considering that 5.0 has made
a<00:04:47.430> lot<00:04:47.699> of<00:04:47.759> improvements<00:04:48.419> in<00:04:48.509> touch<00:04:48.720> with<00:04:48.960> we

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
a lot of improvements in touch with we

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.159 
a lot of improvements in touch with we
will<00:04:50.130> probably<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.850> that<00:04:51.000> here<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:51.539> I'm<00:04:51.960> not

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
will probably see that here but I'm not

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.350 
will probably see that here but I'm not
hopeful<00:04:52.620> the<00:04:53.130> front-facing<00:04:53.520> camera<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.120> 2

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
hopeful the front-facing camera is a 2

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.969 
hopeful the front-facing camera is a 2
megapixel<00:04:54.630> unit<00:04:54.960> which<00:04:55.320> I<00:04:55.440> forgot<00:04:55.740> to<00:04:55.860> mention

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
megapixel unit which I forgot to mention

megapixel unit which I forgot to mention
earlier<00:04:56.220> and<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.660> yeah<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:57.900> is<00:04:58.320> the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
earlier and so yeah that is the

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.360 
earlier and so yeah that is the
configuration<00:04:59.639> of<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.750> tablet<00:05:01.169> the<00:05:02.099> app

configuration of this tablet the app

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.700 
configuration of this tablet the app
looks<00:05:02.729> weird<00:05:03.150> because<00:05:03.419> it's<00:05:03.810> not<00:05:04.080> properly

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
looks weird because it's not properly

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:08.870 
looks weird because it's not properly
scaled<00:05:05.009> for<00:05:05.400> this<00:05:05.750> screen<00:05:06.979> 9.6<00:05:07.979> inches<00:05:08.310> and<00:05:08.490> 20

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
by 800 resolution is also not so great

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.159
