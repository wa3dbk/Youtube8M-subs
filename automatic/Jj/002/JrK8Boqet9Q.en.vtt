the<00:00:20.730> ironic<00:00:21.119> thing<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.900> filly<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.500> 13

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the ironic thing is that the filly of 13

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.519 
the ironic thing is that the filly of 13
actually<00:00:23.580> weighs<00:00:23.910> more<00:00:24.570> than<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:25.199> thing<00:00:25.350> that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
actually weighs more than the thing that

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.480 
actually weighs more than the thing that
x<00:00:25.800> 220

however<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.980> thickness<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.880> quite<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> bit

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
however the thickness is quite a bit

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.580 
however the thickness is quite a bit
different

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
different

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.270 
different
the<00:00:31.710> x2<00:00:32.309> 20<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:34.040> quite<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> bit

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
the x2 20 that I have is quite a bit

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.420 
the x2 20 that I have is quite a bit
thicker<00:00:35.579> than<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.090> burly<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.230> 13<00:00:37.739> which<00:00:38.399> is

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
thicker than the burly of 13 which is

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.190 
thicker than the burly of 13 which is
where<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> really<00:00:39.090> kind<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:39.960> get<00:00:40.079> the

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
where you really kind of get the

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.950 
where you really kind of get the
difference<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.800> portability<00:00:41.520> factor<00:00:41.960> that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
difference of portability factor that

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590 
difference of portability factor that
said<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.860> footprint<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> filly<00:00:45.030> of<00:00:45.210> 13

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
said the footprint of the filly of 13

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.529 
said the footprint of the filly of 13
since<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.710> 13-inch<00:00:47.219> notebook<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
since it's a 13-inch notebook it is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.880 
since it's a 13-inch notebook it is
actually<00:00:49.020> larger<00:00:49.829> than<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:50.160> ThinkPad<00:00:50.550> x<00:00:50.789> 220

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
actually larger than the ThinkPad x 220

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.580 
actually larger than the ThinkPad x 220
the<00:00:52.890> screen<00:00:53.399> resolutions<00:00:53.940> are<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.239> same<00:00:54.590> 1366

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the screen resolutions are the same 1366

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410 
the screen resolutions are the same 1366
by<00:00:55.710> 768<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.820> gonna<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> same

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
by 768 so you're gonna get the same

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.959 
by 768 so you're gonna get the same
amount<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:58.109> real<00:00:59.010> estate<00:00:59.160> there<00:00:59.640> on<00:00:59.789> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
amount of real estate there on the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.619 
amount of real estate there on the
screen<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.710> like<00:01:01.710> both<00:01:02.190> laptops<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.120> lot<00:01:03.329> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
screen I like both laptops a lot and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.929 
screen I like both laptops a lot and
they<00:01:04.199> are<00:01:04.260> both<00:01:04.500> technically<00:01:05.489> business

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
they are both technically business

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.960 
they are both technically business
laptops<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:07.200> x2<00:01:07.920> 20<00:01:08.280> though<00:01:08.400> because<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.850> is

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
laptops the x2 20 though because it is

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.429 
laptops the x2 20 though because it is
not<00:01:09.210> an<00:01:09.360> ultrabook<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> lot<00:01:10.290> more

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
not an ultrabook is a lot more

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.010 
not an ultrabook is a lot more

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
you can put in an SSD there if you want

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.270 
you can put in an SSD there if you want
to<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:21.060> port<00:01:21.330> selection<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.110> slightly<00:01:23.100> better

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
to the port selection is slightly better

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.219 
to the port selection is slightly better
on<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> X<00:01:23.850> 220<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:25.860> battery<00:01:26.759> life<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
on the X 220 and the battery life is

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.490 
on the X 220 and the battery life is
well<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.560> put<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.430> 9<00:01:30.090> sub<00:01:30.420> battery<00:01:30.780> could

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
well if you put in a 9 sub battery could

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.920 
well if you put in a 9 sub battery could
equal<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> fill<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.369> 13<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.540> advantage

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
equal the fill your 13 but the advantage

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
equal the fill your 13 but the advantage
would<00:01:34.049> have<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.439> ThinkPad<00:01:34.829> X<00:01:35.009> 220<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
would have with the ThinkPad X 220 is

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.270 
would have with the ThinkPad X 220 is
that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> can<00:01:36.320> carry<00:01:37.320> an<00:01:37.470> extra<00:01:37.560> battery<00:01:37.860> long

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that you can carry an extra battery long

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.690 
that you can carry an extra battery long
and<00:01:38.549> put<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:40.280> primary<00:01:41.280> battery

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
and put it in if the primary battery

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.660 
and put it in if the primary battery
dies<00:01:43.100> hmm<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.579> open<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:46.250> we<00:01:47.250> kind<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
dies hmm we open them up here we kind of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
dies hmm we open them up here we kind of
see<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.570> how<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.869> design<00:01:49.350> compares<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
see the how the design compares the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.620 
see the how the design compares the
folio<00:01:50.310> 13<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:50.970> certainly<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.329> better-looking

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
folio 13 is certainly a better-looking

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710 
folio 13 is certainly a better-looking
laptop<00:01:52.409> but<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.159> has<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.610> glossy<00:01:53.909> screen<00:01:54.210> so

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
laptop but it has a glossy screen so

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
laptop but it has a glossy screen so
you'll<00:01:54.899> see<00:01:55.140> immediately<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.880> the

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
you'll see immediately that the

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
you'll see immediately that the
reflection<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> screen<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.590> be

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
reflection you get in the screen can be

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.950 
reflection you get in the screen can be
kind<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> annoying<00:01:59.369> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.180> have<00:02:00.390> strong

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
kind of annoying if you have strong

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.490 
kind of annoying if you have strong
backlight<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.469> whereas<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> X<00:02:02.670> 220<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
backlight and whereas the X 220 is a

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.590 
backlight and whereas the X 220 is a
matte<00:02:04.979> screen<00:02:05.310> so<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.939> get<00:02:06.270> any<00:02:06.450> of
