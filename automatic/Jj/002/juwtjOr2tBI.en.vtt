 she the new emergency we already start 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.700
 we will begin to rely on mass 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.379
 off for this you will need medium 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.850
 Athenix kilo of potatoes who are these 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.559
 pink potatoes 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.329
 all you have to do is put 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.550
 the potatoes in a pan with water and 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.070
 to boil over high to boil after 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.250
 boil against the 20 minutes 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.219
 and turn off you will drain the water and 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.140
 removing the shell carefully is cool 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.910
 pass from potatoes to a squeezer but 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.980
 if you had not won at home 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.019
 I loved the killer as I did 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.070
 here until you get a light 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.909
 consisting of the following sequence: 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 yolk half a cup of flour 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.009
 wheat a teaspoon of salt and a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.900
 coffee spoon of black pepper 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.729
 you should mix the ingredients 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.680
 gently with your hands and in sequence 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.909
 all to a clean surface and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.950

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.950
 under the forest making circular movements 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.660
 make a big ball and roll slowly 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.790
 by the table 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
 this way mass will be soft to 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.390

 small pieces with two fingers of 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.650
 width each 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.650
 before you start calling remember to 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.300
