what<00:02:06.190> what<00:02:06.550> is<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.880> whoa<00:02:07.210> how<00:02:07.600> dangerous<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
what what is that whoa how dangerous is

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.290 
what what is that whoa how dangerous is
the<00:02:08.470> other<00:02:08.649> I<00:02:08.920> guess<00:02:09.190> is<00:02:09.369> my<00:02:09.399> question<00:02:09.550> well

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
the other I guess is my question well

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.680 
the other I guess is my question well
there<00:02:10.869> are<00:02:10.899> some<00:02:11.320> some<00:02:11.860> good<00:02:12.420> general<00:02:13.420> gums

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
there are some some good general gums

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.540 
there are some some good general gums
out<00:02:13.960> there<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.860> are<00:02:14.890> starting<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> put

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
out there that are starting to put

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.060 
out there that are starting to put
xylitol<00:02:16.090> in<00:02:16.330> it<00:02:16.510> okay<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.170> thing<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.410> that<00:02:17.680> the

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
xylitol in it okay the thing is that the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.250 
xylitol in it okay the thing is that the
research<00:02:18.730> has<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.120> been<00:02:19.240> done<00:02:19.450> on<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.930> hundred

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
research has all been done on a hundred

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.560 
research has all been done on a hundred
percent<00:02:20.530> in<00:02:20.830> style<00:02:21.010> at<00:02:21.160> all<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.580> so<00:02:22.120> that's

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
percent in style at all and so that's

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.500 
percent in style at all and so that's
where<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.140> know<00:02:23.350> if<00:02:23.590> you're<00:02:23.740> chewing<00:02:24.100> or<00:02:24.510> using

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
where we know if you're chewing or using

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.570 
where we know if you're chewing or using
a<00:02:25.570> mint<00:02:25.780> that's<00:02:25.990> 100%<00:02:26.380> xylitol<00:02:27.010> you're<00:02:27.430> going

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
a mint that's 100% xylitol you're going

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.640 
a mint that's 100% xylitol you're going
to<00:02:27.640> lower<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.180> cavity<00:02:28.600> risk<00:02:28.810> forty<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.410> sixty

to lower your cavity risk forty to sixty

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.400 
to lower your cavity risk forty to sixty
percent<00:02:29.980> that's<00:02:30.970> significant<00:02:31.660> savings<00:02:32.140> over

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
percent that's significant savings over

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.460 
percent that's significant savings over
the<00:02:32.500> course<00:02:32.710> of<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.920> lifetime<00:02:34.020> plain<00:02:35.020> old<00:02:35.230> gum

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
the course of a lifetime plain old gum

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.870 
the course of a lifetime plain old gum
is<00:02:35.770> still<00:02:35.980> going<00:02:36.130> to<00:02:36.190> be<00:02:36.250> somewhat<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.820> a

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
is still going to be somewhat of a

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.210 
is still going to be somewhat of a
benefit<00:02:37.210> unless<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.990> has<00:02:38.170> sugar<00:02:38.410> in<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.800> I've

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
benefit unless it has sugar in it I've

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.920 
benefit unless it has sugar in it I've
gotta<00:02:39.460> have<00:02:39.640> sugar-free<00:02:39.940> at<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.630> bare

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
gotta have sugar-free at the bare

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.230 
gotta have sugar-free at the bare
minimum<00:02:41.110> okay<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.490> know<00:02:42.550> if<00:02:42.790> you're<00:02:42.940> if
