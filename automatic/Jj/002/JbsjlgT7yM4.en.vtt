00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.240
 Ola and skepticism and I welcome you to my channel as I am new 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.860
 here on 'youtube' I decided to make my first video for everyone to notice 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.210
 of my existence 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.900
 so let's set aside this and put monkeys on the subject the most important thing that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.339
 I have to say in this video is to give the 'ok' January 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.900
 yes one more of the thousands that there is in this web 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.580
 but not one more of the psoe heap and with 100 that deco and hypocrisy 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.380
 pride, fanaticism and intolerance 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.469
 they made the first and big what numbers that popularized the what 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.890
 When they will make the decision to withdraw from you tube 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.770
 and all because of a few users 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.190
 that did not do more than bother those of all the forms had and for having 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.620
 and that despite the support of many these also closed their accounts 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.460
 However, this was not the only reason for his withdrawals 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.879
 of the story for all kinds of stupid things and nonsense 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.659
 ignorance and hypocrisy of those who at that time were new what 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.630
 numbers that did nothing but denigrate and discredit the fact of 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.590
 be a shopkeeper 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.960
 the censorship changes and new restrictions of youtube what would come 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.270
 later it was too predictable it was only a matter of time before the 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 image of what to see us coming down many thought that only 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.649
 to be it that nero should use the story but that was a serious mistake 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.460
 an error that leaves us a very clear message and is that being what in summer is 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.030
 easy 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.010
 at this moment be what in summer means the same as a while ago 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.090
 but on second thought we are still in time to reverse this 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.060
 they will ask 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.329
 it is obvious that the new and current what numbers we should have goals 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.819
 larger than just expressing our ideas on specific issues 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.950
 I consider my first objective 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.390
 teach and learn 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.240
 perhaps from this moment learn more things than probably 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.630
 teach in addition to ending fanaticism 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.850
 of which many are already fed up 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.990
 and thus be able to call for objectivity and discernment of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.740
 things 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.819
 also make them reflect on some issues 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.130
 motivate learning and fight against ignorance 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 possibly this is very difficult maybe at this time many of you 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.760
 think 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.380
 that I am a very enlightened child who live in dreams totally 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.230
 and logical 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.769
 and it is understandable 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.569
 I know it's not easy to change people's minds 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.500
 we all know the way of thinking of current societies that sometimes 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:34.810
 the fact of not reasoning 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.639
 act and be like them 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:41.260
 It is frowned upon becoming a reason for your scorn to earn you 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.969
 hate and even exclusion 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:47.480
 maybe I did not make it but at least I'll do my best and use all the means 

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:51.919
 possible and available resources that count to get as close as possible 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.689
 possible of that 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:54.629
 i do not lie 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.870
 speak only with the truth avoiding deceiving people for profit or 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.130
 personal interest 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.439
 so I think the January sherlock 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.489
 it is not only 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.329
 express ideas and points of view through a program 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.389
 is much more than that the whole block is someone who with information 

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:12.680
 reliable and valid 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.889
 performs a deep reflection analysis 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:17.329
 and legal judgment 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.670
 resulting in an elaborate production in which it is 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.260
 disposition of others 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.799
 personal opinion experiences 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.400
 different perspectives and questions related to the subject 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.799
 as long as they are not exposed for the purpose of provoking 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:34.799
 to others 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.269
 If not the opposite 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.889
 that this serves as something for others 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:39.689
 because otherwise 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:44.309
 why do it better to save us the time and trouble for this simple 

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.429
 reason is that the black block must be a tolerant person 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.400
 not proud at all 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.279
 determined to listen to different opinions 

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.620
 and under no circumstances have a violent reaction 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.030
 no matter how wrong the arguments or premises of the other are 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.669
 person 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.129
 but mainly a person willing to admit their mistakes 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.310
 because of that I do not take negative criticism but rather critical 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.000
 constructive and in-depth analysis so I do not know about you but I think it's 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.949
 the moment that what what numbers 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:20.250
 we take our jobs more seriously and in this way dig up 

00:04:20.249 --> 00:04:24.909
 that image that they all had of what they had in their beginnings in this 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:29.020
 form finished my first video and I will start thinking about what will 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.200
 my second video 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.780
 so they comment subscribe sheen 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.389
 etc. Skepticism is dismissed
