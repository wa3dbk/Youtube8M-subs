 human dunduk this addon adds us 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.779
 abilities from the famous game krayzis 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.630

 This menu appears 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.649

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.510
 low speed such a middle class 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.190
 tell when we turn first 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:50.309
 ability we can run very fast 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 but very quickly so next 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.809
 ability 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.809
 this is our maximum strength we can 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:04.680
 jump high like this yet we will 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:11.630
 fighting ability is not visible 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.630

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:23.400

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.110
 use this ability all we do not 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:37.829

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:51.990
 ability we have it or just as well 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.229
 I do n't know, I still don't know when 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:02.430
 you approach the enemy you can weapons 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:09.989
 let's give 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:12.060
 This protection she you simply m breaststroke 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.120
 tell you just rises like 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.879
 to tell 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:21.569
 protecting you for less damage 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:29.590

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:40.750

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:53.099
 I have such a model for our character 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.099
 I think such a traced good if 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.540
 the combination blends well this model with 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.120
 this mod even goes well 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.810
 the game is already then he with friends servers 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:16.480
 friends were shocked why did I become boundaries 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:21.329
 but it doesnâ€™t matter but it's all motes 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.329
