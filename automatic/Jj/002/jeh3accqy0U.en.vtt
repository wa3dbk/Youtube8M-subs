00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.850
 you remember that the other day we were 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.860
 talking about the bodily forms that 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.660
 there were five ways the pear shape the 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.270
 apple shape triangle shape 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.670
 inverted the rectangular and the clock 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.590
 of sand you remember well then today 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.740
 I'm going to tell you a little bit what clothes 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.630
 use to empower let's say with 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.240
 your bodily forms our 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.339
 better parts and disguise the ones that good 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.369
 We would like you to spend a little 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.829
 most unnoticed girls you have 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.570
 this bodily form you have a luck os 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.120
 you can empower in a way that does not 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.190
 you can imagine it good the way of 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.720
 hourglass obviously if you put on 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.330
 in front of a mirror you will notice 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.450
 that the top corresponds more or 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.550
 less with the bottom but also 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.060
 we have an important definition in 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 waist hourglass always enhance 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.950
 what is the part of the neckline with good 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.500
 bras girls, I'll tell you again 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 a lot no and I do not want to insist too much 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.580
 I do not want you to wear those 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.740
 fillings that somehow well no no 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.229
 They are elegant but they enhance a 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.220
 nice neckline if enhance the part of the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.440
 chest 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:15.800
 the dresses adjusted to have this 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.570
 form this form so enviable because the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.820
 tight dresses you are left to death 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.530
 you are phenomenal or they come together 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.830
 mark waist marks in the part 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 superior that is a part very let's say 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.790
 very in harmony with the bottom and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.360
 tight dresses favor you 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.130
 very much you have to use belts though 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.530
 we have although we have already that waist 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.690
 well marked the fact of marking it 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.820
 still a little bit more always helps us 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.970
 not always like we boost 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.970
 that virtue of which you have that waist 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.119
 so small the size skirts 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.240
 high as well to show for 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.460
 show hip sizes, high waist 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.140
 would always come in what is the part of 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.440
 the bottom 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.830
 after the chest they keep coming together 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.640
 also there if we add and so 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.280
 we strengthen the part of the waist 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 any skirt that we put on though 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.340
 be basic even if it is narrow hip 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.440
 power us that way we have 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 because having that waist 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.340
 let's try to take advantage of it 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.349
 powering the not the tight jeans 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.060
 is that you can afford anything 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.260
 and the straight legs that is the leg 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.800
 straight I mean the leg of the 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.080
 trousers 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.239
 you can allow anything girls 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.099
 I the only thing that I always tell you is that 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.959
 even if we have those little ones 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.269
 We have the body shape 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.049
 that we have, we can always get 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:43.330
 match with colors with visual effects 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.440
 with even an attitude that is 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.440
 very important that you have a good week
