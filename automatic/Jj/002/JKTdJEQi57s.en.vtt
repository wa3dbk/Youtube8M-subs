00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.330
 very cross 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.460
 Welcome to the live here I bring you 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.830
 another tutorial on mechanisms this time 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.150
 it would be chapter 4 the second part 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.830
 ok because we're going to keep talking about 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:18.680
 the issues we talked about in chapter 4 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.660
 that were repeaters and as you already 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.070
 I taught we made this circuit worth 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.110
 I wanted to comment a couple more details 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.570
 if we are going to see an alternative way of 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.239
 use a circuit much like this 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 and that will serve us for the same thing 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.530
 as I mentioned in the tutorial 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.390
 earlier this is circuitry serves us 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.609
 to activate and deactivate an object 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.969
 many times and with the sideburns 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:43.070
 we regulate the time with which it happens 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.809
 that activation is worth just the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.969
 door is active faster now because 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.210
 the pins are closest worth if 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.370
 we separate it again 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:55.180
 and the circuit will take longer and therefore 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.399
 the door will take longer to activate it 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.260
 what are we going to do in this tutorial and what 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.850
 what I'm going to try is a way of doing it 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.530
 with a circuit a little easier for 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.089
 that people who do not drive 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.800
 both the mechanisms and to do 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.780
 this circuit 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.370
 and we are going to see another alternative way that 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.920
 I tell you it 's much easier that if 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.890
 as you have seen this circuit is 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.540
 circuitry yes yes that is adjustable or 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 you can regulate the times in the 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.070
 that the object is activated and in this 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.170
 circuit can not be worth what we're going to 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.180
 need is to put two blocks of 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.860
 any material and put red stone 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.520
 how are you going to have put it here is in 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.460
 cross shape voucher 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.950
 there we put another and there in front another 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 and what we are going to put to expose 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.640
 reddish-brown antennae in those 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.009
 lateral and would already be mounted worth that 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 it's the complete circuit and they do like 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.860
 interference the antennae of stones 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.149
 reddish each other with what with what 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.439
 they do like a kind of short circuit 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.200
 and it helps us to activate and deactivate 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.329
 any kind of mechanism the circuit 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.649
 it's much easier to manufacture so 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.209
 as you see 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.770
 It can be done practically in a 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:00.959
 second and having no idea just 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.989
 placing the blocks in the way that you 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.239
 I just mentioned everything would work 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:08.179
 correctly the only thing that as I say 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:10.860
 it is not adjustable and good simply 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.829
 activates and deactivates one thing many times 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.329
 in a very short period of time and by 

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.010
 example for use with a dispenser 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.480
 could serve us in plan to make a 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.090
 kind of submachine gun or something by the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.130
 style so good I wanted to bring you 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.959
 this circuitry so you can use it 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.819
 also in your homes for the subject of 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.720
 lights and things like that too 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.430
 would be worth in plan to make a bar or 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.800
 so, well, I hope it's from 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 useful and good I wanted to send a 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.180
 I welcome a subscriber who knows 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.790
 I will leave in the description because in your 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.590
 house I saw this circuit and it reminded me that 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.450
 you could do it this way so 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.040
 Well, I'll send you a little treat 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.740
 in the description and well I will tell you 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.120
 What do you always share? 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.430
 this video with your friends that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.320
 They will thank and good to like you if you 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.720
 liked and su for more videos you know 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.150
 I will continue uploading videos of mechanisms and 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.370
 we will see more advanced things like that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.140
 How good with this I say goodbye and we 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.140
 We will see in future videos until later
