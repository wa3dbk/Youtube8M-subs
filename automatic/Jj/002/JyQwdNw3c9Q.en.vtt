00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
down a little bit so that if somebody

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.910 
down a little bit so that if somebody
saw<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.459> from<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.790> back<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:10.590> would<00:03:10.769> look<00:03:10.859> just

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
saw it from the back it would look just

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.310 
saw it from the back it would look just
as<00:03:11.220> nice<00:03:11.400> and<00:03:11.579> you<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.850> see<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:12.209> with<00:03:12.450> really

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
as nice and you can see that with really

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.750 
as nice and you can see that with really
gorgeous<00:03:13.680> open<00:03:15.470> more<00:03:16.470> expensive<00:03:17.040> blooms<00:03:17.340> it

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
gorgeous open more expensive blooms it

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.349 
gorgeous open more expensive blooms it
still<00:03:18.450> looks<00:03:19.579> even<00:03:20.579> though<00:03:20.700> we've<00:03:20.850> only<00:03:21.030> used

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
still looks even though we've only used

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.120 
still looks even though we've only used
about<00:03:21.480> ten<00:03:21.930> of<00:03:22.109> them<00:03:22.260> still<00:03:22.799> looks<00:03:22.980> pretty

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
about ten of them still looks pretty

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.550 
about ten of them still looks pretty
substantial<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.030> so<00:03:24.600> that's<00:03:24.780> how<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.049> make<00:03:25.320> a

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
substantial and so that's how you make a

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.080 
substantial and so that's how you make a
floral<00:03:26.190> arrangement<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.760> not<00:03:26.940> too

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
floral arrangement that's not too

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.420 
floral arrangement that's not too
expensive
