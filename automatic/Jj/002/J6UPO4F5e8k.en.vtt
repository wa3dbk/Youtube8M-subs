00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.520
 maybe you can get dusty boxes of Super 8 in your loft 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.690
 or VHS counting the players have probably already long ago 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.480
 Ghost abandoned and Thursday before an impairment in the brands before 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.949
 Fortunately there is a lot of money Martin Schneider enjoys 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 one sees the films but the beautiful memories are preserved 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:24.199
 when Martin Schneider looks closely 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.089
 at least he looks at the past on old treasures and special ones 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.179
 adventures 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.089
 For us that's just scary emotional thing people come for 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:36.230
 with their memories, trust us 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.870
 and we would actually have the broadcast before the decay that now it's a nice one 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 It's fun this is a profession that you enjoy doing 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.050
 One who has entrusted to her memories is Gertrud Schiffbauer 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 In 1975, she was married for 35 years, her wedding film was in the drawer 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 soon she can watch with her husband on DVD again 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.400
 That's 35 years ago 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.750
 a girl Aya 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 By now, even adult women has been throwing 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.680
 Impressions of a mother with the colorful clothes 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.450
 very different then 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.220
 but Munich 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 my husband with his blog 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.860
 the blond-haired lions appear to Essberger 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 then it works a bit changed but I think we have clear 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.110
 all changed 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.290
 The idea to become self-employed as a movie rescuer was born during the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.299
 a-team by his father the now 71-year-old Dietmar Schneider 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:39.280
 was an avid amateur filmmaker he can still strip the old Fischer Leut 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.650
 to cut 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.650
 and restore it with a so-called glue 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.800
 for me personally it is 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.210
 to see that it is still needed 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.579
 and what can be useful to me only on the bear how we used for use 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.500
 with his can is rather the big capital of the family business 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.220
 I also just know how to stick this film "I can not do that 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.450
 Hardly anyone can feel that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.870
 insofar makes a valuable contribution Pfronten and down for him 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.540
 It's also a confirmation that knowing what's worth and nothing 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.409
 continue 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.689
 for example, in the reconstruction of these pictures from neunkirchen-seelscheid 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.429
 the old herb factory in the 1970s 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.449
 here were pressed and bottled 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:31.449
 the tailors get everything 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:34.430
 the citizens could have 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.399
 and in front 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:36.249
 Easter 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.559
 Measuring Christmas is a nightmare 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:41.689
 when all people try 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:47.309
 by candlelight to movies is not a typical African plate at all 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:50.659
 and it is not terrible that at this only is offered 

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.740
 there is a happy ending here 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.340
 The movie savior does not simply pass a landslide DVD but a DVD 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.820
 three minutes of happiness in a handy format
