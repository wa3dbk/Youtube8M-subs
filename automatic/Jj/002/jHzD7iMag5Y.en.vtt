a<00:00:30.900> lot<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.080> stuff<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.650> they're<00:00:31.859> not<00:00:31.980> really

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
a lot of stuff so they're not really

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's mamegoma one and then this is what

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's mamegoma one and then this is what
the<00:02:16.110> back<00:02:16.290> looks<00:02:16.320> like<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:18.060> yeah<00:02:18.330> um<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.260> had<00:02:19.650> a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the back looks like so yeah um I had a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.850 
the back looks like so yeah um I had a
lot<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.920> fun<00:02:20.190> doing<00:02:20.460> on<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.060> they<00:02:21.900> are<00:02:22.500> like

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
lot of fun doing on and they are like

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.420 
lot of fun doing on and they are like
pretty<00:02:23.520> much<00:02:23.610> simplest<00:02:24.510> little<00:02:24.990> things<00:02:25.430> you

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
pretty much simplest little things you

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.070 
pretty much simplest little things you
could<00:02:26.640> ever<00:02:26.670> think<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.630> think<00:02:27.780> it

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
could ever think of but I think it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.590 
could ever think of but I think it
really<00:02:28.290> adds<00:02:28.650> like<00:02:31.340> like<00:02:32.340> a<00:02:32.370> personal<00:02:33.330> touch

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
really adds like like a personal touch

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.360 
really adds like like a personal touch
to<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:34.160> so<00:02:35.160> I<00:02:35.190> think<00:02:35.370> they're<00:02:35.760> cute<00:02:36.530> um<00:02:37.530> if<00:02:38.220> you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370

one for you but like i said it's really

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.770 
one for you but like i said it's really
pretty<00:02:44.520> much<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> simplest<00:02:45.330> thing<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
pretty much the simplest thing in the

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.630 
pretty much the simplest thing in the
world<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:46.380> cut<00:02:46.860> apart<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.250> folder

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
world you just cut apart the folder

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.500 
world you just cut apart the folder
until<00:02:48.150> there's<00:02:48.930> nothing<00:02:49.110> left<00:02:49.320> except<00:02:50.510> the

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
until there's nothing left except the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.690 
until there's nothing left except the
outside<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:52.800> you<00:02:52.980> just<00:02:53.190> stick<00:02:53.430> into<00:02:53.580> the

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
outside and then you just stick into the

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.700 
outside and then you just stick into the
little<00:02:53.940> plastic<00:02:54.120> sleeve<00:02:54.660> measure<00:02:55.290> out<00:02:55.440> the

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
little plastic sleeve measure out the

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.220 
little plastic sleeve measure out the
construction<00:02:56.580> paper<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.600> make<00:02:57.630> sure<00:02:57.960> it'll

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
construction paper to make sure it'll

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.170 
construction paper to make sure it'll
fit<00:02:58.260> in<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.800> space<00:02:59.100> between<00:03:00.260> the

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
fit in that little space between the

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.900 
fit in that little space between the
what<00:03:03.180> do<00:03:03.240> you<00:03:03.270> call<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.450> binding<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
what do you call it binding and the

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.760 
what do you call it binding and the
plastic<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.360> then<00:03:06.930> just<00:03:07.140> slide<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.500> on<00:03:07.590> in

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
plastic and then just slide it on in

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.980 
plastic and then just slide it on in
there<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.490> pretty<00:03:08.820> much<00:03:08.940> all<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.300> did<00:03:09.660> but<00:03:09.870> if
