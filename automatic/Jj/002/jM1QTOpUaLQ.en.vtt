00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.850
 Y 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.970
 Y 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.800
 and that the YouTube band as they are 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.710
 welcome another video of your channel 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.750
 planet x this time I bring you a 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.510
 video of how to change the color of the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.920
 our device's interface here 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.520
 we show a little of what they 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.680
 I want to talk 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.060
 I hope you can notice this effect 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.700
 I'm going to zoom in on what the device is 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.500
 so you can see it better myself 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.270
 for example I have what it is and the other 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.330
 color I will increase what is the brightness 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.060
 so they can appreciate it better I do not 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.800
 I have a blue color in the remainder of 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.140
 Similarly what is the color of 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.320
 notification center or the center 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.809
 control among other various options like 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.810
 is the spotlight and even what is the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.540
 keyboard or what is the keyboard 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.880
 to have static we're going to go to what 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.410
 is to go already so we have to have 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.410
 our device with jailbreak 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 here we are going to go to the handle tab 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.859
 and in sources here we are going to add a 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.229
 new we fail to give it in edit and 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.229
 add and here we're going to put the new 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.020
 repo called report dot hard 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.390
 drive font point or heretical here I am going to 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.429
 leave also the name in I want what 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.790
 is the screen for you to 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.670
 put it well 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 once we have this network we are going to 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.390
 give it in add source and add two 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.540
 modes here will start to download 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.500
 these are the sources of the two packages 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.500
 sorry for this answer 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.500
 here we are going to give you back to Libya 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.600
 and let's go now to what is the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.909
 search tab 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.909
 and here we are going to put fancy 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.800
 here I will also leave you what is 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.230
 the name so they can put it well 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.850
 and I recommend that they are going to 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.710
 appear several options but I would 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.660
 I recommend the one I did capture iphone 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.360
 because it is the one that has had less 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.220
 problems for me as it is all the 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.750
 device system 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.010
 here we are only going to give you 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.010
 install and confirm 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.680
 here is going to be a satec installation 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.600
 so it will restart what is the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.870
 We will give you a device between the start 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.870
 the device 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.920
 and once you have restarted what is the 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:48.490
 device let's go into what is 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:51.250
 adjustments and here it will show us what 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.590
 is an option called fancy as the 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.960
 tui that we install does not change what it is 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.480
 the name and good is going to explain a 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.400
 little of what this tweet is about since if 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.470
 we want a global color 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.360
 we can activate a color 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.270
 general for all functions that 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.740
 has by default and is clicked as 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.960
 you could realize what 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.720
 I had it in blue but likewise if 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.730
 you want to change or leave more 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.680
 below shows us several options that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.080
 we can change in particular 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.420
 I for example, given that I do not have it 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.270
 in blue I have it as in gray 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.340
 let's go into what is the dock and 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.350
 you can change the different 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.750
 options that you want and even 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.090
 you can bring the icons so that you 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.920
 can guide what each one means 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.780
 I'm going to go in as I was telling you what 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.090
 is the dow and you default to it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.459
 have it off as they activate it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.430
 putting what is the little dove that is the 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.040
 top right you have to 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.990
 put in unasur so that it is activated and 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.600
 well here we change what is the color 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:58.760
 and you are given in sepsis or saving changes 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.880
 and if we go to the Home screen 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.580
 here already changes what is the dock we are going to 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.280
 put a stronger color so that 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.720
 you can see this color and if 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.060
 you can appreciate it here is already 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.530
 in red in the same way with 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.160
 any one of the different 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.700
 options 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:21.720
 here change according to the color that we 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.720
 for example also we want them 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.580
 I will comment on the keyboard at the beginning 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.190
 here I'm going to put it in a red color I'm going 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.870
 to activate the keyboard the keyboard and 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.540
 you can give an account is already in 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.390
 red in the same way with the 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.790
 different options that appear here if 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.180
 I want to leave the global color 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.710
 I'm just going to deactivate the popcorn and 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.930
 here as you can see it is 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.730
 in blue color and good friends I hope you
