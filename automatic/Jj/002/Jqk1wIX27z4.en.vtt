00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.380
 hello today we are going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.799
 bat for halloween for it 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:15.240
 recycle we have a cardboard tube and 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:18.570
 we will also need a white sheet one 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.949
 black cardboard some mobile eyes 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.500
 scissors a pencil a pencil a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.050
 Brush 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.250
 black acrylic paint 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.250
 and white tail 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.430
 we will start painting the cardboard with a lot 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.360
 careful not to stain 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.360
 in black 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.030
 until everything is well covered 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.250
 once our roll has dried 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.770
 We will use it as a cardboard for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.610
 draw on our black cardboard 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.610
 the wings of the bat 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.850
 of course not have to be neither 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.850
 the same or perfect 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.330
 we will raise 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.970
 and we will join both parties 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.450
 since we're going to hit it behind the roll 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.450
 of cardboard 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.020
 like our scissors 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.530
 and remember them 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.910
 then we will take our tube and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.910
 we will close it in this way 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.189
 we will throw in the back 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.290
 a little white tail 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.730
 and we will stick 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.730
 the wings of a bat 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.410
 let dry a few minutes before 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.070
 continue 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.970
 we will draw on our white sheet a 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.970
 pair of fangs 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.080
 that is, a pair of triangles 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.610
 and we will cut it to paste it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.610
 in our new carton 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:21.670
 the last step would be to paste the 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.670
 eyes and fangs 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.520
 to form 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.520
 the face of our bat 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.560
 do not worry because you get out of the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.560
 White glue 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.840
 as it is colorless when dry and no 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.840
 it will be noticed 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.030
 and here you have the final result if you 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.250

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.079
