00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hi saÃ¯ki video site test.com 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.029
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.150
 accessory that was loaned to me by fitness 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.150
 shop so here it is 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 it's the late world and strong body 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.480
 so you see it's a shape that's 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.570
 so that's the plastic enough 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.090
 quite rigid and actually this accessory 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.090
 will help you protect yourself at the level 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.039
 neck when you go squat 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.920
 among other things, its part but also 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 name that the site finesse boutique that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.800
 allows you to divide 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.050
 uniform the weight of the bar at the level 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.430
 back so that's how it works 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.550
 it's very simple so you have a 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.379
 times here or there put under the bar you 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.739
 press hard for his sister 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.910
 sincere here and there it moves more 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.570
 then you can a little unfair 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.620
 and one according to your morphology 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.860
 so here we have to make sure that 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.600
 it's put fabien way in the middle in 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.620
 do the bar to avoid balance 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.960
 and here we are we will you we will you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 show a little bit so I have a friend 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.420
 with me who will explain a little 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.090
 little is his feeling by testing this 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.330
 dance and accessories is good I would like 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:19.140
 right now so that's new so 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.430
 with my friend a kit is good miss though 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.799
 this is to show you a little bit 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.560
 so there you see at the bar compresses 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.540
 the cervical ones we have a little bit and a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.840
 small imbalance between the right and the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.820
 left 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.979
 and it's also due to bad 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.890
 distribution of the strength of the bar 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.479
 especially at the back so he 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.220
 just do not have good cladding etc 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.270
 it's not practical so here we go 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.729
 show a little what it gives 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 with the manta ray milland place that of 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.119
 after 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.950
 so here we have put there the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.720
 the accessory that senses and therefore protect 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.070
 the nape and spread the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.020
 the weight of the bar evenly 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.660
 at the level of the back so there you see 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.490
 when I get closer it pushes them 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.630
 so perfectly the end of the back 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.620
 actually that's it and so then what 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.510
 how you feel the job to start 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.179
 it pushes them very well back by 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:14.790
 against to get out of the smith machine 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.790
 I feel that at the level of rotations 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.510
 so actually because in fact so 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.980
 his species china sent calabar here 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.070
 I invite you to visit 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.310
 finally review my test on the move your 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.150
 so to put the lah protect either 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.270
 are there down here that needs to be twisted and in 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.380
 did this accessory there we went 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.310
 that he is not suitable at all 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.350
 for this type of machine 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.940
 when you train alone at home 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.200
 since at the front it's kind of 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.000
 little did a little bit a little punctured a little 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.590
 hook and it hurts you makes you 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.870
 it prevents you from doing the maneuver 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.940
 correctly so here we are actually going 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.120
 show you the caf to small 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.470
 movements already to see a little bit 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:03:01.350
 and then you feel new distribution of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:01.350
 the force so how stable yeah 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.440
 yeah well after that maybe it's due 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:10.480
 as a technical or what it finally 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.830
 after that will be me for myself when 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.030
 I tried I found 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.900
 that I could do 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.900
 some additional rules 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.189
 because it's going to be pretty good 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.230
 to fight against pain and have 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.280
 actually at the neck so there 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.459
 we will show you now with a 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.099
 unguided bar so that's back 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.450
 so we took there for once a 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:36.659
 free bar so here we have arranged 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.709
 as the author so the accessory to 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.209
 neck level and that's a lot more 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.099
 adapted because actually go for it 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.790
 proposes the bar on the hairs on the 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.680
 protections 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.150
 here is there is no need to switch 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.989
 elaborate forwards or backwards as 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.859
 swiss miss china 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:55.500
 it's just enough of the break and 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:57.810
 so the accessory makes perfect sense 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.909
 this level and so you can tell me 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.000
 so you'll work so a little 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:13.019
 little with this bar is this accessory 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:34.770
 that you felt against the 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:36.990
 exercises of me you see by cons gj 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.270
 also especially for those responsible 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.310
 for those who do not know when 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.360
 so you have voreppe effects 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.250
 and then you want to make one or two 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:47.070
 additional so you stay in 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.110
 pause in water so stand up and so there this 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.330
 accessory makes it possible to stay in 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.530
 pause without much pain but 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.599
 actually be careful you have to 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.040
 always keep some success at 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:58.330
 arm level finally arms 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.030
 for not just that the bar 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.890
 opposes too sure are on the back and 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.590
 so then suddenly you can rest a 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.860
 raptor tired of the blow you kill to 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.910
 consider or not then this accessory 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.660
 I considered because at the level 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.310
 stability 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.130
 it's nice enough after 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.740
 at the level too I think of efforts on 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.810
 can do a little more series at 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.840
 shoulder level so we compensate for a 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.700
 soon after it's just do not forget 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.500
 to be doing the exercise and 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.620
 respect a little the enamels of the squat 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.270
 really agree that actually 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.850
 anyway when I always say info 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.320
 this always be framed by a 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.630
 professional at first if we start 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.620
 So here and now realize that I 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.520
 confirm to this accessory is 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.620
 actually help 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.820
 it's interesting I show them and 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.460
 different people in a room 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.870
 weight including the gym on ron 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.460
 orleans and people are already they are 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.570
 they are faulty questioned they say to themselves 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.760
 but what is it for 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.050
 and once they try they are they 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.150
 are rather pleased because actually 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.260
 some but towels or so 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.730
 foam protectors 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.530
 but there you really have something 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.550
 ergonomics that a contribution employ this 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.730
 term just now but it's really 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:10.170
 suitable for all body types 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:12.750
 I had little ones try 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.460
 big fat and pretty people 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.280
 muscular with trapezes quite pronounced 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:20.310
 and they are they are rather satisfied 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.270
 accessories now for 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.570
 very very heavy loads 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:27.540
 so here we are talking about between 150 200 kg 

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:30.630
 we could not give it a try for our 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.810
 share but to see if actually that 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.360
 also resists his stars game there my 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.440

 Hi
