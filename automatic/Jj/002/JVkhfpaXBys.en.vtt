output this particular boat with the new
LED<00:00:41.730> lights<00:00:42.050> now<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.320> doing<00:00:43.379> that<00:00:43.860> combine<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
LED lights now by doing that combine it

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.340 
LED lights now by doing that combine it
with<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> Edinburgh<00:00:45.120> 115<00:00:45.750> he<00:00:45.899> technically

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
with the Edinburgh 115 he technically

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.290 
with the Edinburgh 115 he technically
put<00:00:46.649> on<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> boat<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.460> will<00:00:47.670> not<00:00:47.850> have<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.149> run

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
put on the boat we will not have to run

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.630 
put on the boat we will not have to run
a<00:00:48.329> generator<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.200> boat<00:00:49.500> that's<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.460> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
a generator in this boat that's going to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.850 
a generator in this boat that's going to
make<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.570> quieter<00:00:52.140> inside<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.680> boat

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
make it much quieter inside the boat

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
make it much quieter inside the boat
that's<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> make<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.000> lighter

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that's going to make it a lot lighter

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
that's going to make it a lot lighter
than<00:00:54.480> having<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.020> carry<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> generator

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
than having to carry the generator

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.580 
than having to carry the generator
around<00:00:56.420> because<00:00:57.420> our<00:00:57.629> Evinrude<00:00:58.050> e-tec<00:00:58.379> is

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
around because our Evinrude e-tec is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.660 
around because our Evinrude e-tec is
putting<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.010> one<00:00:59.160> hundred<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.460> thirty

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
putting out a one hundred and thirty

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.700 
putting out a one hundred and thirty
three<00:00:59.879> amps<00:01:00.329> off<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> alternator<00:01:00.989> system<00:01:01.530> so

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
three amps off the alternator system so

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.500 
three amps off the alternator system so
we<00:01:01.859> will<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.280> need<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.520> generator<00:01:03.090> once<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.420> get

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
we will not need a generator once we get

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.929 
we will not need a generator once we get
the<00:01:03.629> lights<00:01:03.809> on<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.199> boat<00:01:04.549> now<00:01:05.549> this<00:01:05.729> isn't

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
the lights on this boat now this isn't

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.149 
the lights on this boat now this isn't
going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.350> bow<00:01:07.799> fishing

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
going to be just a a bow fishing

platform this is going to be a boat
that's<00:01:10.290> going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.470> be<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.830> convertible<00:01:11.549> into

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
that's going to be very convertible into

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
that's going to be very convertible into
a<00:01:11.850> backbone<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> fishing<00:01:13.080> boat<00:01:13.290> or

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
pontoons the hydraulic jack plate allow

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.930 
pontoons the hydraulic jack plate allow
us<00:04:09.550> to<00:04:09.730> do<00:04:10.200> when<00:04:11.200> we<00:04:11.380> jack<00:04:11.800> that<00:04:12.100> motor<00:04:12.430> all<00:04:12.730> the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
us to do when we jack that motor all the

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.540 
us to do when we jack that motor all the
way<00:04:13.090> up<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:14.560> we<00:04:14.680> have<00:04:14.800> the<00:04:14.890> contents<00:04:15.460> on

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
way up then we have the contents on

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.910 
way up then we have the contents on
there<00:04:15.760> this<00:04:16.450> boat<00:04:16.720> does<00:04:16.959> not<00:04:17.170> squawk<00:04:17.530> when<00:04:17.769> we

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
there this boat does not squawk when we

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.550 
there this boat does not squawk when we
take<00:04:18.130> off<00:04:18.400> this<00:04:18.850> boat<00:04:19.180> will<00:04:19.420> easily<00:04:19.690> take<00:04:20.290> off

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
take off this boat will easily take off

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.040 
take off this boat will easily take off
in<00:04:20.950> ten<00:04:21.220> inches<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.670> water<00:04:21.910> which<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:22.900> very

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
in ten inches of water which is very

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.170 
in ten inches of water which is very
shallow<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.070> some<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.310> our<00:04:24.490> jet<00:04:24.730> boats<00:04:24.970> would

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
shallow and some of our jet boats would

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.790 
shallow and some of our jet boats would
struggle<00:04:25.450> doing<00:04:25.840> that<00:04:26.020> without<00:04:26.320> pontoons

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
struggle doing that without pontoons

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.160 
struggle doing that without pontoons
over<00:04:27.100> so<00:04:28.030> it's<00:04:28.240> gonna<00:04:28.360> be<00:04:28.510> a<00:04:28.540> very<00:04:28.870> shallow

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
over so it's gonna be a very shallow

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.900 
over so it's gonna be a very shallow
water<00:04:29.350> ready<00:04:29.860> to<00:04:29.980> boat<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.190> mean<00:04:30.370> this<00:04:30.670> boat

water ready to boat I mean this boat

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.670 
water ready to boat I mean this boat
will<00:04:31.150> handle<00:04:31.540> ten<00:04:31.720> inches<00:04:31.990> water<00:04:32.230> even<00:04:32.590> though

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
will handle ten inches water even though

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.580 
will handle ten inches water even though
it's<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.860> prop<00:04:33.130> motor<00:04:34.080> but<00:04:35.080> that's<00:04:35.260> just<00:04:35.440> some

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
it's a prop motor but that's just some
