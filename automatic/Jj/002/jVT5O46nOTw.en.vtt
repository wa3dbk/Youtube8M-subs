00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.460
 and we are putting a little salt 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.610
 so that it goes grabbing the flavor as it 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.610
 is starting to cook and not be 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 tasteless 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.420
 and let's put now a little bit of 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.420
 onion in the corn 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.230

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.230
 the green pepper 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:34.830
 and we're going to give it a little bit more later and 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.830
 we're going to put the tomato 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.480
 and now if I support the tomato 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.659
 and s 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.530
 and we are putting him approximately 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.530
 two water coffees and the stew 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.700
 to release its boil and in a 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.539
 shortly after it is cooked is a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.299
 we're going to put the zucchini 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.450
 we let the lotus and the vegetables cook 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.969
 for about 10 minutes and now 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.470
 if we already have the zucchini very well 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.960
 minced 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.530
 and we will also be throwing the 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.530
 stew 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.560
 I was making some puree from 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.010
 tomato so he's grabbing a little 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.220
 more color 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 we put a little more salt salt 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.209
 always goes to taste 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.180
 and we return them well to mix 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.340
 very good salt with the rest of the 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.590
 ingredients 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.480
 and prayer is adding cilantro 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.459
 up all the stew we're going to 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.770
 be letting rest also together 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.960
 channeled 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.330
 we are about to boil for about 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:02.160
 20 minutes 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.420
 our stew that takes as around 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:08.310
 of about five or six minutes boiling and 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.830
 as you can see the zucchini go 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.450
 releasing more juice because it does not 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.470
 add more water apart from the two 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.470
 little cups that we already put 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.370
 this is how it was chosen after 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.470
 we turn it off and let it rest 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.470
 now and if you are ready to serve 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:28.290
