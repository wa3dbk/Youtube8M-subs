eight-fifteen right now that like i said
before<00:04:39.740> this<00:04:40.040> clocks<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.400> little<00:04:40.580> fast<00:04:40.760> like

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
before this clocks a little fast like

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.400 
before this clocks a little fast like
five<00:04:41.300> to<00:04:41.450> ten<00:04:41.600> minutes<00:04:41.630> past<00:04:41.900> so<00:04:42.260> it's

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
five to ten minutes past so it's

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.250 
five to ten minutes past so it's
actually<00:04:42.560> probably<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.520> 25<00:04:44.270> so<00:04:44.660> they're

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
actually probably a 25 so they're

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.600 
actually probably a 25 so they're
waiting<00:04:45.530> for<00:04:45.710> me<00:04:45.800> I<00:04:45.830> got<00:04:46.040> five<00:04:46.220> minutes<00:04:46.460> to

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610
