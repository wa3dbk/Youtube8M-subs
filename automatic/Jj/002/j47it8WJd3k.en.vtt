00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.960
 Hall together and welcome to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.340
 a new video from me and for today 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.070
 is there again a do it yourself 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.540
 instructions for a mainboard that you can 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.590
 you either hang in the kitchen 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.740
 or maybe over that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
 desk just where it's most 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.100
 needed and then you can just 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.600
 different reminders shopping list 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.640
 photos something on it depends what you 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.010
 we want it on our 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.320
 mainboard give some options for 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.120
 and yes you need so many 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
 The materials that I now extra in the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.450
 Basta bought the link 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.520
 I also like to see you under the video 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 in the infobox 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.530
 and yes, let's just put it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.750
 you have fun first you need one 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.670
 underlay which can become dirty too 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
 a chipboard for example 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.590
 in the basteladen or in the Baumarkt then 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.140
 you need acrylic colors of your choice 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.050
 piece of fabric clothespins something 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.120
 Packet tape was also a different string 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.160
 maybe something for a deco one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 Swim and brush as well as one 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 hot glue gun the whole step for 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.799
 I will guide you 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.150
 also on my blog again 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.140
 write and I linked you 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.760
 then under the video in the infobox 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.650
 first you have to paint a color to the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.820
 you like and regardless of whether you 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.070
 now different colors together 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.869
 mixes or not you need now 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.350
 Some water around the attack 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.350
 dilute 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.840
 if you like the color result paints 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.100
 with it your wooden board and 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.020
 the color passes in between 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.360
 every now and again with some water 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 that saves you some color and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.720
 We can then immediately the color 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.720
 distribute more evenly with the sponge 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.140
 when the whole board is painted 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.820
 brush some water over here again 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.740
 the wood and then pull with the sponge 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.140
 straight from left to right and with 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.820
 little pressure off the color again so leave 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.710
 you then completely dry the plate 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.430
 and actually the bayer has got it 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.430
 always very fast 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.330
 it continues with the clothespins 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.130
 can also paint here if you want 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.540
 and that's what you mean by everyone 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.310
 sides evenly 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.110
 to the back as we the 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.240
 cling to the back of our board 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.930
 stick and then the marriage is no color 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.930
 be visible 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.780
 then you also leave the clinging 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.519
 Dry and open after drying 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.560
 you her a few times because the pages something 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.120
 stick together and therefore opens 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.380
 Just tell her before you 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 not have to do that if they already 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.269
 stick on the board if then that 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.100
 bed has dried you grab 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.630
 your fabric and looks first how much 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.560
 covered with the fabric from her board 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.880
 should be 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.320
 then you cut the fabric 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.450
 then rightly that they to the 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.220
 margins only about 3 cm square 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.510
 have 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.950
 and then you can do this on yours 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.790
 board with a normal glue 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.530
 fix 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.090
 that does not have to be mandatory now 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.620
 but then the material does not slip 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.890
 because we're turning it over now 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 have to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.750
 the protruding edges you can with 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.280
 stick a hot glue gun and there 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
 you have to take care because you are 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.150
 also very nice the fingers 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.710
 Therefore you can burn yourself 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.510
 best still a piece of cardboard at hand 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.460
 so that you pass the glue something 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.110
 you can and thereby you tighten the fabric 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.430
 in addition and there is not so 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.430
 loo around the board 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.640
 if you have stuck all pages 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.680
 can you give the corners something else 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.810
 improve or stand out 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.480
 glue the remainders on again and then 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.800
 Let it dry well on the whole 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.690
 front must now still the 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.490
 clothespins are glued and 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.739
 you just put them on before 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:54.810
 positions so you see this 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.280
 the distance and the height so like and 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.590
 so that's the whole thing, of course 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.930
 then you can cling 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.010
 also with the hot glue gun 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.010
 stick and allow to dry briefly 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.190
 Now I have my package here 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.930
 not only bought the board with it 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.479
 should be decorated but something else 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.479
 space for krams will provide where you then 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.759
 something between the bands at the front 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.410
 I could save it on everyone 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.830
 fall right at the end again see how 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.830
 I mean that 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.669
 you turn the board again for a short time 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.500
 um and you should remember that that 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.449
 package tied only with the area 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.160
 the fabric is wrapped and then 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.080
 placed here on the back first 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.930
 put a drop of hot glue on it 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.300
 board and then put on tape read 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.770
 that dry briefly and then you can 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.900
 again a little glue on it 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:59.400
 make the band so casually wrapped up 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:01.139
 when the adhesive is dried rotates 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.360
 you cross the board again around developed 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.550
 and across the band around the fabric-related 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.169
 you should also do the building authority 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.000
 always taut pull so the crane 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:12.919
 was later really behind it 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.919
 can hold on and not slip down 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.449
 the end then sticks the same way as well 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.190
 the beginning on the back and so on 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.229
 the whole also a very safe stop 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.630
 you can get the band on another 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.889
 still stick so stick with it 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.330
 So a few punctures of hot glue on 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.830
 I also wanted the left side 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:34.050
 a few more stringent from the paketband 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.080
 just do not tie it up that way 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.740
 looks and somehow more coherent 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:41.630
 and the guys doing really 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.630
 just like on the other side 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.009
 I continue with a little more decoration 

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.809
 have so small wooden heart 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.399
 bought the color too great for 

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:56.929
 paketband have fit 

00:05:55.399 --> 00:06:00.519
 and then I just got to the 

00:05:56.929 --> 00:06:00.519
 Lace of clothespins stuck in place 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.569
 Finally we need one more 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.939
 Suspension for we again something 

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:15.559
 Need package tape and you have to 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.989
 first of all the middle of 

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:20.089
 your board marks this with a 

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:22.309
 pen and sometimes left and right still 

00:06:20.089 --> 00:06:25.339
 times more marks here too 

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:27.740
 can put down a bit further and 

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:29.809
 At these points below you will then 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.580
 The ends of your package tape again with 

00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:33.580
 stick the hot glue gun 

00:06:34.179 --> 00:06:38.839
 the measures for the distance are actually 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:39.529
 no matter and come to the size of yours 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:41.929
 board 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:44.869
 I had for example 10 cm distance from 

00:06:41.929 --> 00:06:45.679
 the middle and from the top edge important 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:47.899
 It's only that that's her really 

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:49.639
 symmetrically designed from the middle 

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:52.719
 So that the mainboard in the end straight 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.719
 can be hung 

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:58.970
 if you do then tied tightly centered 

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.800
 So it's almost simulated 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.630
 collar runs when the mainboard 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.160
 The wall can hang the line 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.410
 along the band again with something 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:11.180
 Glue hot glue gun that gives 

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:12.800
 then again very safe stop that 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:19.580
 Let it harden well again and 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:21.080
 then your board is already finished 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.120
 her love that was the waveboard now 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.010
 I made that depends on the moment 

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.380
 still in my living room was free 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:28.820
 had hang around but that was supposed to 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.070
 afterwards in the church and then 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:33.590
 I would like to buy lists in the future 

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.810
 tuned am because as I always 

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.690
 always forget half when shopping 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:40.580
 if I do not write that down and 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.740
 yes postcards you can hang what 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.690
 you want and I hope you very much 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.100
 the guide would have liked if so 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.610
 I myself a little village up 

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:48.470
 looking forward 

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.210
 and if you do not miss any more videos 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.250
 Just subscribe to my channel 

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:55.690
 and then we'll see each other in the next video 

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.690
 bye bye again
