00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:14.639
 so we 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:16.369
 picked up the tube here to 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.220
 she 's here 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.490
 fit tight we shall let 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.369
 heat up on speech and hammer this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.470
 tubule 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.040
 welded inside that's welding can be seen 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 inside therefore the duct was welded on 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:40.399
 center of this billet billet 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:44.219
 thick 14 millimeters here we have 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:49.469
 Sofa already machined machines will treat 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.730
 here and there is no ledge here it is three three with 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.430
 half millimeter 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:00.750
 height of 36 diameter can be 40 millimeters 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:06.270
 here but he must get up 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.409
 right here this boy will prepare 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.820
 Minami that is, its size is enough for 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.970
 the size she hugs us billet 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.369
 ours is this one from this side 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:26.130
 here is a plate with different meters and this one 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.390
 so now we are for this tube in 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.150
 the machine will clamp 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.390
 and process this flange that is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.560
 first we butt him with him so he was 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.049
 perpendicular to this surface and 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.990
 then bore inside 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.930
 where does this groove go here this groove 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.189
 sapphic here and when he goes down with us 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.590
 plump we will drill a hole 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:59.579
 here are 4 hole already its standard here 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.310
 constructive and in this flange thick 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.140
 we will cut the thread sharpen bolts 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:14.590
 the length we need here 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.590
 click on it do further aberration
