00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:07.370
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.800
 technology guide with wolfgang rudolph 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.809
 Hello and welcome to watch tv 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.590
 always and everywhere the everywhere television 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.150
 So dvb t is already introduced 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.310
 in germany not only in germany 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.470
 in many European countries, too 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 means we can with a small 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.310
 television set with an antenna everywhere 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.019
 Watching TV in some areas 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.340
 it's still not really there's 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.779
 not yet developed maybe 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 not there then you need a 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 outdoor antenna but it works 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.780
 but if you are on the way 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.520
 you want in televisions 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.020
 Take it easy without a TV 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.719
 you do not look but there is a whole 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.469
 Ingenious idea of ​​auvisio I have 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.660
 something found look for the iphone 4s 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.570
 That's why it's this small part 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.399
 this is a complete tv 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.670
 infected with the iphone 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.789
 and then they have television here the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.640
 everything in it search memory the 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.619
 Program switching is easy without 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.369
 Problems is taking moment now he has 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.470
 the stream must first buffer next 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 program so no problem at all 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.490
 Recording playback is equal to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.110
 in the beginning with it in there 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.830
 Image quality is beyond any doubt 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.970
 sublime and there is a battery installed 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.100
 in this little tv receiver with it 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.689
 not necessarily electricity from the iphone 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.350
 they can pull over that 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.189
 Charge the supplied USB cable and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.990
 then it would have been for about six hours 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.479
 Received upright then he goes 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.450
 he nibbles the battery of the iphone 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.500
 here there is an antenna that is 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.229
 delivered with 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.119
 with an adapter this antenna you can 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.060
 with reception conditions not so good 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.729
 are here instead of these others 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.250
 The antenna will be infected easily 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.590
 just exchanged 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.450
 there will be infected here at this point 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.240
 So just exchanged and then 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.770
 Do you have a better reception performance 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 Above all things you can do the antennas 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.819
 a little further away 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.400
 So I have to honestly say that 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.250
 solution from auvisio here i find 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.830
 real 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:19.880
 and now we had her like that 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:22.570
 It's a fun thing to do quickly 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.840
 is really fun makes great solution 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.840
 and conclusion
