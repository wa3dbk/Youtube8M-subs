one point where he tried to get the shot
off<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:29.880> he<00:03:29.970> couldn't<00:03:30.239> get<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.570> shot<00:03:30.750> off

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
off but he couldn't get the shot off

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.270 
off but he couldn't get the shot off
because<00:03:31.230> he<00:03:31.260> was<00:03:31.440> either<00:03:31.590> being<00:03:31.799> shoved<00:03:32.160> in

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
because he was either being shoved in

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.949 
because he was either being shoved in
the<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.430> or<00:03:32.880> there<00:03:33.239> was<00:03:33.360> a<00:03:33.390> stick<00:03:33.750> in<00:03:33.900> the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
the back or there was a stick in the

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.530 
the back or there was a stick in the
lane<00:03:34.320> which<00:03:34.620> couldn't<00:03:35.489> allow<00:03:35.850> him<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.299> get<00:03:36.510> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
lane which couldn't allow him to get a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.780 
lane which couldn't allow him to get a
proper<00:03:36.930> shot<00:03:37.320> off<00:03:37.560> which<00:03:38.100> i<00:03:38.280> think<00:03:38.310> is<00:03:38.579> going

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
proper shot off which i think is going

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.060 
proper shot off which i think is going
to<00:03:38.880> be<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.180> pretty<00:03:39.540> awesome<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.079> see<00:03:40.290> if<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.860> see

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
to be a pretty awesome to see if you see

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.310 
to be a pretty awesome to see if you see
an<00:03:41.190> opportunity<00:03:41.489> and<00:03:41.910> NHL<00:03:42.329> 16<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.870> take<00:03:43.019> a<00:03:43.049> shot

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
an opportunity and NHL 16 to take a shot

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.870 
an opportunity and NHL 16 to take a shot
you<00:03:43.500> might<00:03:43.739> as<00:03:43.890> well<00:03:44.070> take<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.310> damn<00:03:44.579> shot

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:44.880 
you might as well take a damn shot

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.240 
you might as well take a damn shot
because<00:03:45.120> your<00:03:45.840> shot<00:03:46.110> opportunities<00:03:46.890> might<00:03:47.070> be

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
because your shot opportunities might be

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.370 
because your shot opportunities might be
very<00:03:47.459> limited<00:03:47.820> but<00:03:48.239> overall<00:03:48.810> from<00:03:49.170> this

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
very limited but overall from this

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.490 
very limited but overall from this

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
guys a lot of people were saying that

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.910 
guys a lot of people were saying that
the<00:03:56.400> gameplay<00:03:56.910> did<00:03:57.150> look<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:57.450> bit<00:03:57.900> slower<00:03:58.350> but

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
the gameplay did look a bit slower but

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.910 
the gameplay did look a bit slower but
that's<00:03:59.130> what<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.760> online<00:04:00.650> versus<00:04:01.650> play

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
that's what I online versus play

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.009 
that's what I online versus play
gameplay<00:04:02.610> is<00:04:02.820> this<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.150> online<00:04:03.329> versus<00:04:03.840> play

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
gameplay is this is online versus play

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.750 
gameplay is this is online versus play
guys<00:04:04.230> by<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.860> isn't<00:04:05.190> Hut<00:04:05.340> gameplay

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
guys by the way this isn't Hut gameplay

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.710 
guys by the way this isn't Hut gameplay
number<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.480> hut<00:04:06.769> settings<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.720> guess

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
number the hut settings and I guess

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.870 
number the hut settings and I guess
rules<00:04:10.560> not<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.070> rules<00:04:11.310> but<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.610> know<00:04:11.730> the

hockey ultimate team does look like in a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.800 
hockey ultimate team does look like in a
sense<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.729> know<00:04:26.850> it's<00:04:27.090> still<00:04:27.300> going<00:04:27.690> to

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
sense but you know it's still going to

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.930 
sense but you know it's still going to
be<00:04:27.900> roughly<00:04:28.800> around<00:04:28.979> the<00:04:29.340> same<00:04:29.460> thing<00:04:29.789> but

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
