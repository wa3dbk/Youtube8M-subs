00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:55.129 
coming to North America to play you have

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.519 
coming to North America to play you have
to<00:05:55.189> adapt<00:05:55.550> your<00:05:55.729> game<00:05:55.969> at<00:05:56.180> all<00:05:56.270> yeah<00:05:57.110> it's<00:05:57.439> a

00:05:57.519 --> 00:05:57.529 
to adapt your game at all yeah it's a

00:05:57.529 --> 00:06:00.219 
to adapt your game at all yeah it's a
big<00:05:57.710> different<00:05:58.129> but<00:05:58.370> I<00:05:58.909> like<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.629> a<00:05:59.719> lot<00:05:59.750> I

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
big different but I like it a lot I

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:04.510 
big different but I like it a lot I
think<00:06:00.589> the<00:06:01.310> North<00:06:01.629> American<00:06:02.629> rink<00:06:02.900> is<00:06:03.520> more

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
think the North American rink is more

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.790 
think the North American rink is more
action<00:06:04.969> and<00:06:05.150> you<00:06:05.180> can<00:06:05.659> shoot<00:06:05.839> everyone<00:06:06.439> tanned

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
action and you can shoot everyone tanned

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.670 
action and you can shoot everyone tanned
more<00:06:07.580> physical<00:06:08.569> playing<00:06:08.839> and<00:06:09.139> more<00:06:09.379> skating

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
more physical playing and more skating

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.510 
more physical playing and more skating
and<00:06:09.979> I<00:06:10.399> like<00:06:11.029> it<00:06:11.180> more<00:06:11.360> than<00:06:11.419> a<00:06:11.629> European<00:06:12.560> rink

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
and I like it more than a European rink

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.240 
and I like it more than a European rink
yeah

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.210 

as<00:06:17.250> a<00:06:17.580> buceta<00:06:18.030> I<00:06:18.300> think<00:06:18.600> the<00:06:19.380> small<00:06:19.620> rings<00:06:19.920> and

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
as a buceta I think the small rings and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.330 
as a buceta I think the small rings and
all<00:06:20.430> that<00:06:20.640> just<00:06:21.030> suits<00:06:21.630> me<00:06:21.830> nothin<00:06:22.830> much

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
all that just suits me nothin much

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.860 
all that just suits me nothin much
better<00:06:23.640> and<00:06:23.970> I<00:06:24.330> think<00:06:26.480> you<00:06:27.480> get<00:06:27.630> a<00:06:27.660> lot<00:06:27.840> more

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
better and I think you get a lot more

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.960 
better and I think you get a lot more
ultimate<00:06:28.470> situations<00:06:29.100> and<00:06:29.340> a<00:06:29.730> lot<00:06:29.940> more

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:29.970 
ultimate situations and a lot more

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.630

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:32.640 
rushes and it goes a lot faster and I

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.930 
rushes and it goes a lot faster and I
