00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I think it's the perfect size I actually

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.170 
I think it's the perfect size I actually
like<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:26.010> better<00:00:26.039> than<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.519> bigger<00:00:26.730> iPad

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
like it much better than the bigger iPad

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.810 
like it much better than the bigger iPad
air<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.630> bigger<00:00:27.900> iPads<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:29.490> they<00:00:29.670> added

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
air or bigger iPads and now they added

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.370 
air or bigger iPads and now they added
the<00:00:30.000> Retina<00:00:30.300> display<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.929> upgraded

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
the Retina display and the upgraded

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
the Retina display and the upgraded
processors<00:00:31.949> inside<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.820> just<00:00:32.969> makes<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.239> even

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
processors inside it just makes it even

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
processors inside it just makes it even
better<00:00:33.510> now<00:00:34.110> as<00:00:34.230> far<00:00:34.410> as<00:00:34.469> which<00:00:34.680> color<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.100> go

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
better now as far as which color to go

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.920 
better now as far as which color to go
with<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.610> would<00:00:35.820> personally<00:00:36.059> choose<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> Space

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
with I would personally choose the Space

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.110 
with I would personally choose the Space
Gray<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> think<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.739> looks<00:00:37.890> much<00:00:38.129> better<00:00:38.399> but<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
Gray I think it looks much better but of

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.190 
Gray I think it looks much better but of
course<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.809> your<00:00:39.930> personal

in my opinion a partly black glass bezel

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
in my opinion a partly black glass bezel
around<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.699> iPad<00:00:54.030> Mini<00:00:54.210> screen<00:00:54.629> rather<00:00:55.140> than

the white a lot of other tech youtubers

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
the white a lot of other tech youtubers
agree<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.870> kind<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.170> like<00:00:58.530> makes

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
agree on this it just kind of like makes

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.979 
agree on this it just kind of like makes
it<00:00:59.070> blend<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.579> better<00:00:59.730> at<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> screen<00:01:00.390> whereas

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it blend in better at the screen whereas

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.660 
it blend in better at the screen whereas
the<00:01:01.109> white<00:01:01.320> makes<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.829> like<00:01:01.980> stand<00:01:02.280> out<00:01:02.460> more

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.369 
the white makes it like stand out more
and<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:02.879> kind<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.120> distracting<00:01:03.480> also

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
and it's kind of distracting also

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.200 
and it's kind of distracting also
looking<00:01:04.619> at<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.799> rim<00:01:04.949> around<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.460> device<00:01:05.700> you

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
looking at the rim around the device you

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
looking at the rim around the device you
see<00:01:06.330> on<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.510> face<00:01:06.720> gray<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.260> actually<00:01:07.680> gray

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
see on this face gray it's actually gray

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.620 
see on this face gray it's actually gray
around<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.670> then<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.270> one<00:01:09.330> it's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
around it and then on this one it's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
around it and then on this one it's
actually<00:01:09.720> silver<00:01:10.320> around<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.680> which<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.979> again

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
actually silver around it which I again

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.039 
actually silver around it which I again
prefer<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.030> Space<00:01:12.210> Gray<00:01:12.479> model<00:01:12.810> because<00:01:12.990> I

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
prefer the Space Gray model because I

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.960 
prefer the Space Gray model because I
think<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.920> gray<00:01:14.220> looks<00:01:14.490> better<00:01:14.700> than

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
think the the gray looks better than

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.760 
think the the gray looks better than
that<00:01:15.150> shiny<00:01:15.390> silver<00:01:15.869> taking<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> look<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.680> the

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
that shiny silver taking a look at the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
that shiny silver taking a look at the
back<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> iPad<00:01:17.369> minis<00:01:17.640> you'll<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.060> they

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
back of the iPad minis you'll see they

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.960 
back of the iPad minis you'll see they
designed<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.840> thing<00:01:19.340> fantastically<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
designed this thing fantastically it's a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
designed this thing fantastically it's a
