00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.229 
little bit right here so make that
pretty<00:03:57.290> dark<00:03:57.590> now<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:59.209> lighthouse<00:03:59.750> you<00:04:00.620> just

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
pretty dark now the lighthouse you just

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.069 
pretty dark now the lighthouse you just
make<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:03.200> shape<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:05.510> feel<00:04:05.840> comfortable

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
make the shape that you feel comfortable

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.289 
make the shape that you feel comfortable
with<00:04:06.469> and<00:04:06.920> I<00:04:07.010> think<00:04:07.069> that<00:04:07.370> lighthouse<00:04:07.700> should

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
with and I think that lighthouse should

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.000 
with and I think that lighthouse should
look<00:04:09.280> about<00:04:10.280> like<00:04:10.549> that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.170 

and<00:04:13.459> you're<00:04:14.209> gonna<00:04:14.330> have<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.840> top<00:04:15.910> area<00:04:16.910> where

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 
and you're gonna have the top area where

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.159 
and you're gonna have the top area where
the<00:04:17.299> light<00:04:17.540> is<00:04:17.870> you're<00:04:18.769> gonna<00:04:19.780> maybe<00:04:20.780> make<00:04:21.139> it

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
the light is you're gonna maybe make it

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:31.790 
the light is you're gonna maybe make it
like<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.130> then<00:04:23.440> cap<00:04:24.440> it

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.059 

alrighty<00:04:32.580> you're<00:04:32.759> starting<00:04:33.150> to<00:04:33.210> see<00:04:34.069> make

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069 
alrighty you're starting to see make

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:37.210 
alrighty you're starting to see make
this<00:04:35.280> area<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.699> little<00:04:35.940> darker<00:04:36.449> because<00:04:36.840> it's

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
this area a little darker because it's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.580 
this area a little darker because it's
away<00:04:38.220> from<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.610> Sun

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.129 

and<00:04:41.800> then<00:04:41.980> again

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.770 

then<00:04:46.770> it's<00:04:46.979> going<00:04:47.159> to<00:04:47.219> look<00:04:47.460> maybe<00:04:48.270> our

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
then it's going to look maybe our

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.189 
then it's going to look maybe our
lighthouse<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.499> going<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> be<00:04:49.949> rocky<00:04:51.199> there's

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 
lighthouse is going to be rocky there's

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.600 
lighthouse is going to be rocky there's
a<00:04:52.289> window<00:04:52.710> set<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.520> there<00:04:55.009> so<00:04:56.009> the<00:04:56.129> rock<00:04:56.310> look

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
a window set in there so the rock look

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.920 
a window set in there so the rock look
just<00:04:56.939> make<00:04:57.180> it<00:04:57.210> look

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
just make it look

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.880 
just make it look
sketchy<00:04:59.530> and

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:08.380 

rockean<00:05:04.000> this<00:05:05.000> is<00:05:05.210> gonna<00:05:05.330> be<00:05:05.420> your<00:05:06.010> fence<00:05:07.390> up

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
rockean this is gonna be your fence up

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.460 
rockean this is gonna be your fence up
fence<00:05:08.810> but<00:05:09.260> rail<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.560> mean<00:05:11.050> so

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.160 

and<00:05:14.830> build<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.310> in<00:05:15.520> kind<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.450> hard<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.750> draw<00:05:16.930> up

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
and build it in kind of hard to draw up

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.280 
and build it in kind of hard to draw up
and<00:05:17.380> down<00:05:17.560> instead<00:05:18.040> of<00:05:18.220> flat<00:05:18.460> on<00:05:18.730> the<00:05:18.880> table

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
and down instead of flat on the table

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.660 
and down instead of flat on the table
but<00:05:20.290> this<00:05:20.500> will<00:05:20.710> give<00:05:20.860> you<00:05:20.980> an<00:05:21.070> idea

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
but this will give you an idea

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.640 
but this will give you an idea

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
light and then we're gonna have a door

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.090 
light and then we're gonna have a door
here

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.100 

the<00:05:35.580> bottom<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.150> maybe<00:05:36.330> another<00:05:36.510> little

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
the bottom and maybe another little
