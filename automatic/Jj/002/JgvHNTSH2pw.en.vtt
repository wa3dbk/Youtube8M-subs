00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.779
 i 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.039
 OK 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 here is like that 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.920
 once the terms of the software 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.920
 thieves still vague the gate 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.840
 this form of production was very expensive and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.940
 so they started to do with the challenges 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:56.769
 of the state from oil refining 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.350
 It all starts with a pump base 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.570
 the substance that makes chewing gum 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.350
 traditionally the base came from resin 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.320
 of trees 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 today it is made of synthetic plastics 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.170
 and rubbers based on rome poured into 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:20.500
 a blender are then added to 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:22.780
 and the mouth when it begins to mix 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.509
 the glucose syrup is dumped to 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.880
 sweeten the recipe for being liquid 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.880
 it helps to maintain the coma base but ia 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.030
 then related to oil to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.069
 powdered blood 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.149
 the ingredients are mixed for 20 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:42.789
 minutes 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.660
 the action of stirring increases the heat pilet 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:45.660
 book of everything 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.790
 the mixture is ready when it reaches the 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.440
 consistency of dough was 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.440
 transferred by a cart to a 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.209
 machine called by the instructor to 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.489
 machine squeezes mixture through a 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.950
 narrow aperture is like the first 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.299
 toothpaste of the tube becomes 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.910
 bulky pasta into thin strips 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:41.060
 that can then and for the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:43.220
 structures and face squeeze structures 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.510
 the time of a piece of 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.239
 chew 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.430
 She left the flow not to continue to be. 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.630
 cut after and pieces of ideal metal 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.630
 to be punished 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.100
 this process of instruction warms some 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.660
 scene was cut and packed now pro 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.340
 would give in the packaging 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.220
 so the next step is the camera 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.950
 historian the water is there for about 15 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.950
 minutes between three and seven degrees celsius 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.090
 when the ball too much kassai is cold the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.850
 enough for what he calls cutting and 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.040
 packing a machine does both 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:31.140
 in a fraction of a second in slow motion 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.700
 to see the continuous flow of gum 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.459
 chewing by going into one end 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.130
 while the machine cuts into pieces 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.780
 the cast machine to each piece for a 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.910
 wax paper wrapping machine 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.420
 then twist two ends closing 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.420
 packing 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:02.700
 they were going to make delivery mco2 and the flashes 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:08.310
 takes more than how many more company 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.800
 I can go back, because many countries 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.540
 still does not know how this chart will 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.950
 that it is deposited in the trash 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.230
 I was put in mourning 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.610
 material and can no longer be equal to 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:24.350
 a plastic child paper was stronger 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.540
 than anticipated with the annoyance of the 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.870
 gum thrown in the long streets 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:32.060
 Israel was very created an exchange that is 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.419
 nothing else that originates for disposal 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.729
 transport and, moreover, this 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:41.200
 team will be deposited in this trash will 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.200
 a work had for tectoy 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.160
 now 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.139
 we enjoy and come back with a factory 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.000
 bicycles do not focus on the 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.150
 future of what is the right water and 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.150
 energy 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:42.570
 It's shameful and who goes away.
