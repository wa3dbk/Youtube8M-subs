let's take a look at a few of the models
here<00:03:42.709> this<00:03:42.920> is<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.420> ECMWF<00:03:44.420> going<00:03:44.780> into<00:03:45.140> rain

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
here this is the ECMWF going into rain

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.250 
here this is the ECMWF going into rain
around<00:03:45.890> a<00:03:46.190> 5<00:03:46.670> p.m.<00:03:47.180> hong<00:03:47.420> kong<00:03:47.690> standard<00:03:48.080> time

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
around a 5 p.m. hong kong standard time

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.110 
around a 5 p.m. hong kong standard time
and<00:03:48.530> really<00:03:49.280> you<00:03:49.430> can<00:03:49.459> start<00:03:49.700> to<00:03:49.760> see<00:03:49.880> those

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
and really you can start to see those

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120 
and really you can start to see those
tighter<00:03:50.720> gradient<00:03:51.380> these<00:03:51.500> lines<00:03:51.800> in<00:03:52.040> the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
tighter gradient these lines in the

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.680 
tighter gradient these lines in the
light<00:03:52.310> blue<00:03:52.580> and<00:03:52.610> now<00:03:52.910> once<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.450> get<00:03:53.600> these

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
light blue and now once you get these

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.720 
light blue and now once you get these
lines<00:03:53.959> closer<00:03:54.350> and<00:03:54.620> closer<00:03:54.769> together<00:03:55.040> as<00:03:55.430> a

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
lines closer and closer together as a

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.600 
lines closer and closer together as a
storm<00:03:56.180> pushes<00:03:56.420> closer<00:03:56.780> to<00:03:56.989> shore<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:58.340> means

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
storm pushes closer to shore that means

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.100 
storm pushes closer to shore that means
the<00:03:58.760> winds<00:03:58.970> are<00:03:59.180> going<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.450> be<00:03:59.540> dramatically

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
the winds are going to be dramatically

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.900 
the winds are going to be dramatically
picking<00:04:00.620> up<00:04:00.800> and<00:04:00.950> we<00:04:01.010> can<00:04:01.130> show<00:04:01.370> this<00:04:01.550> same

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
picking up and we can show this same

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.940 
picking up and we can show this same
time<00:04:02.269> period<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:02.930> pull<00:04:03.110> up<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.410> winds<00:04:03.800> in

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
time period but pull up the winds in

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.520 
time period but pull up the winds in
knots<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.730> well<00:04:05.510> those<00:04:05.840> areas<00:04:06.260> where<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
knots and well those areas where the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.690 
knots and well those areas where the
lines<00:04:06.680> get<00:04:06.860> closer<00:04:07.070> together<00:04:07.280> that's<00:04:07.550> where

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
lines get closer together that's where

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.460 
lines get closer together that's where
you<00:04:07.760> see<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:07.940> dramatic<00:04:08.450> increase<00:04:08.959> up<00:04:09.170> here

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
you see that dramatic increase up here

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.110 
you see that dramatic increase up here
into<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.739> darker<00:04:10.130> pink<00:04:10.489> sand<00:04:10.790> into<00:04:10.880> the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
purples those lighter purple is actually

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.910 
purples those lighter purple is actually
indicating<00:04:14.390> up<00:04:14.480> for<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.720> about<00:04:14.870> 75<00:04:15.410> knots<00:04:15.709> or

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
indicating up for is about 75 knots or

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.320 
indicating up for is about 75 knots or
greater<00:04:16.160> so<00:04:16.310> we're<00:04:16.609> talking<00:04:16.850> about<00:04:16.910> strong

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
greater so we're talking about strong

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:19.800

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
similar picture as we look ahead this is

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.809 
similar picture as we look ahead this is
a<00:04:51.949> rate<00:04:52.340> around<00:04:52.509> actually<00:04:53.560> 3<00:04:54.560> a.m.<00:04:54.979> and<00:04:55.340> it's

00:04:55.809 --> 00:04:55.819 
a rate around actually 3 a.m. and it's

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.909 
a rate around actually 3 a.m. and it's
right<00:04:56.270> overhead<00:04:56.689> here<00:04:57.169> and<00:04:57.379> we<00:04:57.530> are<00:04:57.680> seeing

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
right overhead here and we are seeing

00:04:57.919 --> 00:04:59.830 
right overhead here and we are seeing
these<00:04:58.099> winds<00:04:58.370> come<00:04:58.639> directly<00:04:59.120> on<00:04:59.330> shore<00:04:59.659> in

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
these winds come directly on shore in

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.439 
these winds come directly on shore in
this<00:05:00.469> gfs<00:05:01.159> scenario<00:05:01.699> actually<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.330> most

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
this gfs scenario actually the most

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.129 
this gfs scenario actually the most
recent<00:05:03.020> run<00:05:03.199> run<00:05:03.680> they<00:05:04.430> don't<00:05:04.940> track<00:05:05.509> it<00:05:05.719> north

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:06.139 
recent run run they don't track it north

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.010 
recent run run they don't track it north
of<00:05:06.349> the<00:05:06.469> island<00:05:06.949> as<00:05:07.099> per<00:05:07.909> the<00:05:08.120> JMA<00:05:08.509> track<00:05:08.810> they

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
of the island as per the JMA track they

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.800 
of the island as per the JMA track they
take<00:05:09.199> it<00:05:09.349> just<00:05:09.680> south<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:10.490> i<00:05:10.669> think<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.240> is<00:05:11.539> a

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
take it just south and i think that is a

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.170 
take it just south and i think that is a
big<00:05:12.620> difference<00:05:12.949> because<00:05:13.310> if<00:05:13.400> it<00:05:13.490> goes<00:05:13.639> here

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
big difference because if it goes here

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.339 
big difference because if it goes here
we're<00:05:14.750> going<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.930> be<00:05:14.990> seeing<00:05:15.199> as<00:05:15.289> the

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
we're going to be seeing as the

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:16.689 
we're going to be seeing as the
strongest<00:05:15.800> winds<00:05:16.039> along<00:05:16.400> the<00:05:16.520> northern

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
strongest winds along the northern

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.149 
strongest winds along the northern
periphery<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:17.330> if<00:05:17.419> it<00:05:17.539> goes<00:05:17.690> here<00:05:18.440> it's<00:05:19.009> going

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
periphery but if it goes here it's going

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:20.920 
periphery but if it goes here it's going
to<00:05:19.219> be<00:05:19.279> wrapping<00:05:19.729> around<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.180> funneling

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
to be wrapping around and funneling

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.170 
to be wrapping around and funneling

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:33.979 
up there into one of the top these

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:35.980 
up there into one of the top these
skyscrapers<00:05:34.490> the<00:05:35.180> winds<00:05:35.360> very<00:05:35.599> well<00:05:35.810> could<00:05:35.960> be

skyscrapers the winds very well could be

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.050

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
than they are at the surface so if

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.499 
than they are at the surface so if
you're<00:05:40.009> getting<00:05:40.129> 100<00:05:40.699> knot<00:05:40.849> winds<00:05:41.210> for
