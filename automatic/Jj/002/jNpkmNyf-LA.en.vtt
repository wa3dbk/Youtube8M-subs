were<00:00:56.290> big<00:00:56.890> major<00:00:57.100> ones<00:00:57.460> and<00:00:58.560> it<00:00:59.560> was<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.890> a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920

so<00:01:03.309> what<00:01:04.309> we<00:01:04.430> have<00:01:04.640> here<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:05.150> we<00:01:05.540> have<00:01:06.140> a<00:01:06.320> camera

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
so what we have here is we have a camera

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.840 
so what we have here is we have a camera
that's<00:01:07.550> small<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:08.030> compact<00:01:08.270> which<00:01:09.140> is<00:01:09.290> nice

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.080 

but<00:01:12.510> what<00:01:13.260> what<00:01:13.530> it's<00:01:13.680> what<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> kodak<00:01:14.400> d<00:01:14.610> 57

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but what what it's what the kodak d 57

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.710 
but what what it's what the kodak d 57
these<00:01:15.180> advantages<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.340> has<00:01:17.520> an<00:01:17.850> ultra

the<00:01:26.460> better<00:01:30.049> but<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.080> just<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.860> importantly

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
the better but just just as importantly

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.830 
the better but just just as importantly
this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> important<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.530> lens<00:01:35.840> the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840

automatically<00:05:25.900> turn<00:05:26.199> off<00:05:26.229> after<00:05:26.860> say<00:05:27.639> a

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
automatically turn off after say a

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.040 
automatically turn off after say a
minute<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.860> recording<00:05:29.860> footage<00:05:30.300> to<00:05:31.300> save<00:05:31.539> the

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
minute of recording footage to save the

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.779 
minute of recording footage to save the
battery<00:05:32.080> life<00:05:32.650> to<00:05:32.860> say<00:05:33.069> to<00:05:33.310> extend<00:05:33.639> the

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
battery life to say to extend the

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:36.540 
battery life to say to extend the
battery<00:05:33.940> life<00:05:34.150> that<00:05:34.810> would<00:05:34.990> be<00:05:35.139> awesome<00:05:35.550> you

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
battery life that would be awesome you

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.790 
battery life that would be awesome you
see<00:05:36.729> right<00:05:36.759> now<00:05:37.000> on<00:05:37.780> one<00:05:38.080> battery<00:05:38.440> charge<00:05:38.650> i

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
see right now on one battery charge i

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.320 
see right now on one battery charge i
get<00:05:38.949> sixty<00:05:39.190> eight<00:05:39.430> minutes<00:05:39.789> of<00:05:39.879> continuous

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
get sixty eight minutes of continuous

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.249 
get sixty eight minutes of continuous
footage<00:05:40.780> so<00:05:41.710> if<00:05:42.300> i<00:05:43.300> would<00:05:43.659> imagine<00:05:43.780> if<00:05:44.169> you

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
footage so if i would imagine if you

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.189 
footage so if i would imagine if you
turn<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.590> LCD<00:05:45.069> off<00:05:45.280> you<00:05:46.030> would<00:05:46.210> maybe<00:05:46.449> perhaps

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 
turn the LCD off you would maybe perhaps

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:51.480 
turn the LCD off you would maybe perhaps
get<00:05:48.150> 100<00:05:49.150> minutes<00:05:49.419> whatever<00:05:50.409> that<00:05:50.680> may<00:05:50.979> be<00:05:51.009> if

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
get 100 minutes whatever that may be if

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.119 
get 100 minutes whatever that may be if
a<00:05:52.300> feature<00:05:52.599> could<00:05:52.930> be<00:05:53.050> built<00:05:53.319> into<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.860> camera

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:54.129 
a feature could be built into the camera

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:56.580 
a feature could be built into the camera
you<00:05:54.729> know<00:05:54.819> it<00:05:54.969> could<00:05:55.090> be<00:05:55.270> maybe<00:05:55.479> soft<00:05:55.870> software

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
you know it could be maybe soft software

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.149 
you know it could be maybe soft software
driven<00:05:56.800> or<00:05:57.190> a<00:05:57.520> hardware<00:05:58.030> switch<00:05:59.020> that<00:05:59.889> would

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:00.159 
driven or a hardware switch that would

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:02.550 
driven or a hardware switch that would
turn<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.550> battery<00:06:00.849> off<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:01.659> would<00:06:01.870> be<00:06:01.930> that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
turn the battery off that would be that

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.580 
turn the battery off that would be that
would<00:06:02.620> be<00:06:02.889> the<00:06:03.039> one<00:06:03.250> feature<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.669> would<00:06:04.030> just

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
would be the one feature that would just

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.159 
would be the one feature that would just
just<00:06:05.849> just<00:06:06.849> blow<00:06:07.180> everything<00:06:07.360> all<00:06:07.780> the<00:06:07.930> water

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.169 
just just blow everything all the water

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:12.860 
just just blow everything all the water
and<00:06:08.610> so<00:06:09.610> far<00:06:09.849> right<00:06:10.060> now<00:06:10.270> the<00:06:10.930> v<00:06:11.080> 570<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.889> V<00:06:12.130> 705

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
and so far right now the v 570 and V 705

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.350 
and so far right now the v 570 and V 705
already<00:06:13.870> already<00:06:14.759> there<00:06:15.759> already<00:06:16.090> awesome

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
already already there already awesome

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.550

the telephoto and zoom zoom range it's

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.420 
the telephoto and zoom zoom range it's
the<00:06:36.969> wide<00:06:37.270> angle<00:06:37.509> that<00:06:37.870> really<00:06:38.529> makes<00:06:38.860> the

the wide angle that really makes the

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.550 
the wide angle that really makes the
video<00:06:39.819> a<00:06:40.060> bit<00:06:40.750> more<00:06:40.960> exciting<00:06:41.349> and
