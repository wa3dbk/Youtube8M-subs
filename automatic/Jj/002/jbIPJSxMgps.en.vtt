00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
get the peaks on your biceps now I have

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.919 
get the peaks on your biceps now I have
to<00:00:28.029> say<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.509> think<00:00:28.990> a<00:00:29.289> little<00:00:29.439> bit<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.740> that<00:00:29.919> is

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
to say I think a little bit of that is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.270 
to say I think a little bit of that is
god-given<00:00:31.929> a<00:00:32.169> little<00:00:32.410> bit<00:00:32.560> because<00:00:32.950> we<00:00:33.160> all

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
god-given a little bit because we all

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.209 
god-given a little bit because we all
have<00:00:33.490> different<00:00:33.880> shapes<00:00:33.910> of<00:00:34.210> our<00:00:34.360> muscles

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
have different shapes of our muscles

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.279 
have different shapes of our muscles
some<00:00:36.219> of<00:00:36.340> us<00:00:36.489> have<00:00:36.820> longer<00:00:37.629> leaner<00:00:37.809> muscle

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:38.289 
some of us have longer leaner muscle

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.860 
some of us have longer leaner muscle
some<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.590> us<00:00:38.680> have<00:00:38.860> have<00:00:39.219> shorter<00:00:39.730> muscles<00:00:40.120> but

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
some of us have have shorter muscles but

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.990 
some of us have have shorter muscles but
I<00:00:41.170> think<00:00:41.980> that<00:00:42.129> there's<00:00:42.340> something<00:00:42.550> you<00:00:42.820> can

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
I think that there's something you can

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.910 
I think that there's something you can
do<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.210> influence<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.989> in<00:00:44.230> your<00:00:44.440> training<00:00:44.829> I

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
do to influence that in your training I

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.830 
do to influence that in your training I
want<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.160> show<00:00:45.340> you<00:00:45.399> that<00:00:45.609> today<00:00:45.840> basically

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
want to show you that today basically

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.529 
want to show you that today basically
what<00:00:47.079> I<00:00:47.109> think<00:00:47.590> is<00:00:47.769> that<00:00:48.090> it's<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.300> way<00:00:49.480> you

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
what I think is that it's the way you

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:54.150 
what I think is that it's the way you
grip<00:00:50.109> your<00:00:50.699> grip<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.850> barbell<00:00:52.660> or<00:00:53.140> the<00:00:53.320> bar<00:00:53.559> or

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
grip your grip the barbell or the bar or

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.590 
grip your grip the barbell or the bar or
the<00:00:54.219> dumbbells<00:00:54.850> when<00:00:55.120> you<00:00:55.239> do<00:00:55.390> bicep

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
the dumbbells when you do bicep

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.709 
the dumbbells when you do bicep
