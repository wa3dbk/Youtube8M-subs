just it's only six mill six millimeter
drill<00:02:23.230> that's<00:02:24.230> all<00:02:24.440> there<00:02:24.739> is

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
drill that's all there is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.120 
drill that's all there is
my<00:02:26.150> what<00:02:26.630> big<00:02:27.640> pieces<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.760> pate<00:02:29.060> anyway<00:02:29.480> so

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
my what big pieces of pate anyway so

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.530 
my what big pieces of pate anyway so
when<00:02:31.130> you<00:02:31.220> getting<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.459> good<00:02:31.580> stuff<00:02:31.610> it's<00:02:32.120> got

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
when you getting the good stuff it's got

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.880 
when you getting the good stuff it's got
worse<00:02:32.720> much<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.260> I'll<00:02:33.350> just<00:02:33.470> show<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.680> this

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
worse much and I'll just show you this

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.650 
worse much and I'll just show you this
finish<00:02:34.430> result<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:34.970> he's<00:02:35.060> going<00:02:35.209> to<00:02:35.269> do<00:02:35.420> that

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
finish result but he's going to do that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.110 
finish result but he's going to do that
in<00:02:36.530> through<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.890> sieve<00:02:39.280> that's<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.610> fine<00:02:40.880> as

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
in through the sieve that's it's fine as

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.390 
in through the sieve that's it's fine as
anything<00:02:42.550> really<00:02:43.550> really<00:02:43.760> fine<00:02:43.970> stuff<00:02:45.310> so<00:02:46.310> at

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
anything really really fine stuff so at

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.710 
anything really really fine stuff so at
the<00:02:46.549> ideal<00:02:46.880> for<00:02:47.060> carrots<00:02:47.390> there'll<00:02:47.540> be<00:02:47.569> no

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the ideal for carrots there'll be no

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.180 
the ideal for carrots there'll be no
chance<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.110> them<00:02:48.170> hitting<00:02:48.380> anything<00:02:48.590> hard<00:02:48.920> and

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
chance of them hitting anything hard and

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.360 
chance of them hitting anything hard and
going<00:02:49.400> off<00:02:49.489> at<00:02:49.610> an<00:02:49.700> angle<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:50.180> fork<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.110> know

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
going off at an angle and fork you know

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.800 
going off at an angle and fork you know
being<00:02:52.370> bent<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:53.090> that's<00:02:53.239> the<00:02:53.360> idea<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.690> this

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
being bent so that's the idea with this

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.640 
being bent so that's the idea with this
so<00:02:54.019> I'll<00:02:54.110> get<00:02:54.260> on

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
so I'll get on

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.229 
so I'll get on
I've<00:02:55.160> got<00:02:55.310> about<00:02:55.370> three<00:02:55.610> hundred<00:02:55.730> liters<00:02:56.150> of

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
I've got about three hundred liters of

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.220 
I've got about three hundred liters of
this<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.450> do<00:02:56.569> and<00:02:56.690> then<00:02:56.780> I'll<00:02:56.900> show<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.110> what

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
this to do and then I'll show you what

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.949 
this to do and then I'll show you what
else<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:57.530> add<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.830> it

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.140 

well<00:03:02.959> rightly<00:03:03.230> Foxx<00:03:03.530> as<00:03:03.860> you<00:03:03.980> can<00:03:04.100> see<00:03:04.340> mmm<00:03:05.030> I

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
well rightly Foxx as you can see mmm I

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.059 
well rightly Foxx as you can see mmm I
put<00:03:05.720> three<00:03:05.930> bucks<00:03:06.170> through<00:03:06.380> now<00:03:06.620> that's<00:03:06.860> two

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
put three bucks through now that's two

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.550 
put three bucks through now that's two
hundred<00:03:07.130> liters<00:03:07.790> about<00:03:08.360> 225<00:03:09.110> like<00:03:09.350> this

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
hundred liters about 225 like this

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.520 
hundred liters about 225 like this
through<00:03:10.400> miss<00:03:10.549> sieve<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:11.900> all<00:03:12.170> the

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
through miss sieve and that's all the

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.900 
through miss sieve and that's all the
rubbish<00:03:12.950> you<00:03:12.980> got<00:03:13.160> out<00:03:13.280> of<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.519> and<00:03:13.670> they're

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
rubbish you got out of it and they're

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.610 
rubbish you got out of it and they're
only<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.060> little<00:03:14.150> bits<00:03:14.329> of<00:03:14.420> peak<00:03:14.630> so<00:03:15.320> as<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.530> can

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
only a little bits of peak so as you can

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.990 
only a little bits of peak so as you can
see<00:03:15.799> it's<00:03:15.920> cracking<00:03:16.250> stuff<00:03:16.430> anywhere<00:03:16.730> but

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
see it's cracking stuff anywhere but

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.430 
see it's cracking stuff anywhere but
just<00:03:17.359> wait<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.570> get<00:03:17.660> all<00:03:17.810> these<00:03:17.930> little<00:03:18.079> bumps

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
just wait to get all these little bumps

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.509 
just wait to get all these little bumps
out<00:03:18.709> and<00:03:18.859> stuff<00:03:19.209> so<00:03:20.209> it's<00:03:20.359> nice<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.570> fine<00:03:21.519> so

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
out and stuff so it's nice and fine so

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.449 
out and stuff so it's nice and fine so
the<00:03:22.579> next<00:03:22.760> thing<00:03:22.970> is<00:03:23.120> to<00:03:23.709> get<00:03:24.709> on<00:03:24.859> and<00:03:25.010> mix<00:03:25.190> that

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
the next thing is to get on and mix that

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.000 
the next thing is to get on and mix that
mix<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.380> ingredient<00:03:27.380> into<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:27.829> only

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
mix the ingredient into it the only

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.310 
mix the ingredient into it the only
thing<00:03:28.160> I'm<00:03:28.250> going<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> mix<00:03:28.579> into<00:03:28.790> it<00:03:29.109> is<00:03:30.109> this

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
thing I'm going to mix into it is this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.289 
thing I'm going to mix into it is this
stuff<00:03:30.500> called<00:03:30.680> calcified<00:03:31.220> seaweed<00:03:31.700> ground<00:03:32.060> is

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
stuff called calcified seaweed ground is

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.229 
stuff called calcified seaweed ground is
ground<00:03:32.600> up<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.019> I'm<00:03:33.829> gonna<00:03:33.950> put<00:03:34.310> five<00:03:34.700> ounces

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
ground up and I'm gonna put five ounces

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.690 
ground up and I'm gonna put five ounces
of<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:36.200> every<00:03:36.440> 30<00:03:36.769> liters<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.489> the

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
of this to every 30 liters of the

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.080 
of this to every 30 liters of the
compost<00:03:38.690> and<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:40.040> stuff's<00:03:40.250> actually<00:03:40.400> it's

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
compost and this stuff's actually it's

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.120 
compost and this stuff's actually it's
got<00:03:41.239> quite<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.540> lot<00:03:41.720> of<00:03:41.750> trace<00:03:42.470> elements<00:03:43.040> and

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
got quite a lot of trace elements and

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.440 
got quite a lot of trace elements and
minerals<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.820> things<00:03:43.970> like<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.209> a<00:03:44.239> lot<00:03:44.390> of

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
minerals and things like that a lot of

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.110 
minerals and things like that a lot of
magnesium<00:03:45.079> in<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.290> carrots<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.850> and<00:03:46.850> also

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
magnesium in that carrots like and also

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.670 
magnesium in that carrots like and also
because<00:03:47.359> it's<00:03:47.510> got<00:03:47.690> because<00:03:48.019> it's<00:03:48.140> calcified

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
because it's got because it's calcified

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.430 
because it's got because it's calcified
it<00:03:48.799> actually<00:03:49.070> raises<00:03:49.250> the<00:03:49.519> pH<00:03:50.440> because

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
it actually raises the pH because

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.920 
it actually raises the pH because
because<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:51.890> being<00:03:52.220> peat<00:03:52.579> the<00:03:53.000> compost<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.750> can

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
because it being peat the compost it can

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.390 
because it being peat the compost it can
be<00:03:54.019> quite<00:03:54.260> acidic<00:03:54.560> sometimes<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.280> this

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
be quite acidic sometimes so this

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.490 
be quite acidic sometimes so this
actually<00:03:55.670> just<00:03:55.700> buffers<00:03:56.150> that<00:03:56.470> so<00:03:57.470> I

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
actually just buffers that so I

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.949 
actually just buffers that so I
basically<00:03:57.950> like<00:03:58.220> there's<00:03:58.640> 30<00:03:59.150> litres<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.840> the

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
basically like there's 30 litres of the

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.819 
basically like there's 30 litres of the
compost<00:04:00.730> to<00:04:02.170> 5<00:04:03.170> ounces<00:04:03.530> of<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:04.569> so<00:04:05.769> when<00:04:06.769> you

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:06.829 
compost to 5 ounces of that so when you

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:08.319 
compost to 5 ounces of that so when you
make<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.040> bucket<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:07.609> almost<00:04:07.850> makes<00:04:08.120> two<00:04:08.299> of

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
make the bucket it's almost makes two of

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:15.390 
make the bucket it's almost makes two of
us

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:41.480 

to<00:04:15.970> me<00:04:16.060> five<00:04:16.269> ounces<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:17.609> stop

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.060 

took<00:04:42.490> me<00:04:42.640> calcified<00:04:43.240> see<00:04:43.450> we<00:04:43.630> did<00:04:43.950> nice

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
took me calcified see we did nice
