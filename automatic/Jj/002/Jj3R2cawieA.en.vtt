we'll<00:00:59.520> go<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.820> our<00:01:00.000> switch<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.739> flip<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:01.890> from

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
we'll go to our switch and flip it from

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.899 
we'll go to our switch and flip it from
the<00:01:02.309> closed<00:01:02.579> position<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> on<00:01:04.140> position

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
the closed position to the on position

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
the closed position to the on position
you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.060> see<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.630> flipped<00:01:06.900> open<00:01:07.110> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you can see now it's flipped open and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.859 
you can see now it's flipped open and
you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.619> hear<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:07.920> motor<00:01:08.070> start<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.670> work<00:01:08.880> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you can hear the motor start to work it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.920 
you can hear the motor start to work it
starting<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.260> turn<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.070> ball<00:01:11.400> inside

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
starting to turn that little ball inside

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.929 
starting to turn that little ball inside
if<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.590> turning<00:01:13.860> pretty<00:01:14.280> slowly

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
if you see it's turning pretty slowly

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.660 
if you see it's turning pretty slowly
because<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.720> a<00:01:15.750> slow<00:01:16.080> closed<00:01:16.380> valve<00:01:16.799> for

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
because this is a slow closed valve for

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.899 
because this is a slow closed valve for
safety<00:01:18.060> reasons<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:19.250> right<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.490> can't
