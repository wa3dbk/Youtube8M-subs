ago<00:03:51.099> it's<00:03:52.099> basically<00:03:52.489> two<00:03:52.760> walls<00:03:53.060> of

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479 
ago it's basically two walls of

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.649 
ago it's basically two walls of
skateboards<00:03:54.849> patterned<00:03:55.849> like<00:03:56.060> fish<00:03:56.540> scales

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:56.659 
skateboards patterned like fish scales

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.069 
skateboards patterned like fish scales
and<00:03:57.579> they're<00:03:58.579> on<00:03:58.699> a<00:03:58.729> transition<00:03:59.299> so<00:03:59.479> you'll

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:00.079 
and they're on a transition so you'll

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:01.960 
and they're on a transition so you'll
walk<00:04:00.560> into<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.859> bathroom<00:04:00.979> and<00:04:01.250> see<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.699> wall

kind<00:04:02.359> of<00:04:02.479> transitions<00:04:02.989> out<00:04:03.489> so<00:04:04.489> it's<00:04:04.639> like<00:04:04.760> a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
kind of transitions out so it's like a

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:12.540 
kind of transitions out so it's like a
quarter<00:04:05.449> pipe<00:04:05.629> being<00:04:05.840> attached<00:04:06.139> to<00:04:06.319> the<00:04:06.500> wall

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:12.550 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.629 

we<00:04:13.550> did<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.760> brief<00:04:14.860> run-through<00:04:15.860> of<00:04:16.130> the<00:04:16.370> space

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
we did a brief run-through of the space

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.640 
we did a brief run-through of the space
before<00:04:17.000> we<00:04:17.299> started<00:04:17.660> actually<00:04:18.200> putting<00:04:18.530> it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
before we started actually putting it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.159 
before we started actually putting it
together<00:04:18.799> we<00:04:19.459> had<00:04:19.609> our<00:04:19.639> intricate<00:04:20.480> design<00:04:20.810> all

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
together we had our intricate design all

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.830 
together we had our intricate design all
ready<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.590> go<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.829> by<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.340> time<00:04:22.400> we<00:04:22.700> we<00:04:23.540> got<00:04:23.720> it
