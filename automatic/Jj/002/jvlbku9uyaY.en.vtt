I<00:02:09.160> just<00:02:09.880> grew<00:02:10.090> up<00:02:10.180> in<00:02:10.390> a<00:02:10.480> generation<00:02:10.660> which

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
I just grew up in a generation which

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.350 
I just grew up in a generation which
thought<00:02:11.500> Jimmy<00:02:11.920> was<00:02:11.950> magical<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:13.000> know

and<00:02:13.510> perversely<00:02:14.080> we<00:02:14.320> always<00:02:14.650> wanted<00:02:15.100> him<00:02:15.220> to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
and perversely we always wanted him to

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.460 
and perversely we always wanted him to
be<00:02:15.460> beaten<00:02:15.880> but<00:02:16.390> not<00:02:16.570> we'd<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.140> didn't

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
be beaten but not we'd really didn't

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.890 
be beaten but not we'd really didn't
want<00:02:17.680> him<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:17.980> P<00:02:18.310> was<00:02:18.670> very<00:02:18.940> odd<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.450> actually

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
want him to be P was very odd I actually

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.100 
want him to be P was very odd I actually
used<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.490> sport<00:02:21.490> Graham<00:02:22.150> Hill<00:02:22.450> against<00:02:22.960> Jim

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.080 
Clarke it was really because Jim Clarke
was<00:02:25.660> by<00:02:26.020> far<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> better<00:02:26.620> and<00:02:27.310> dominant<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
was by far the better and dominant and

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.480 
was by far the better and dominant and
others<00:02:28.450> naturally<00:02:28.900> supported<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.980> underdog

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
others naturally supported the underdog

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.010
