reader should be able to use fix up
strategies<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.290> student

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
strategies and this is when a student

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.440 
strategies and this is when a student
comes<00:01:55.890> across<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.520> word<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.790> they're

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
comes across a word that they're

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.289 
comes across a word that they're
unfamiliar<00:01:58.020> with<00:01:58.290> for<00:01:58.860> example<00:01:58.950> if<00:01:59.670> they<00:02:00.240> were

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
unfamiliar with for example if they were

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
unfamiliar with for example if they were
unfamiliar<00:02:00.869> with<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.170> word<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.619> sin<00:02:01.920> they

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
unfamiliar with the word the sin they

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.609 
unfamiliar with the word the sin they
can<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:03.000> context<00:02:03.570> clues<00:02:03.780> which<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.409> words

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can use context clues which are words

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.190 
can use context clues which are words
that<00:02:04.829> surround<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> word<00:02:05.640> or<00:02:06.390> maybe<00:02:07.049> even

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
that surround the word or maybe even

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.350 
that surround the word or maybe even
break<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.009> word<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.459> its<00:02:08.729> parts

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
break down the word in its parts

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.510 
break down the word in its parts
looking<00:02:09.660> at<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:09.899> prefix<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.739> root<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
looking at the prefix the root and the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.500 
looking at the prefix the root and the
suffix

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
suffix

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.509 
suffix
lastly<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:13.140> student<00:02:13.739> should<00:02:13.920> be<00:02:13.950> able<00:02:14.069> to

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
lastly a student should be able to

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.940 
lastly a student should be able to
synthesize<00:02:15.180> any<00:02:15.900> good<00:02:16.140> reader<00:02:16.379> should<00:02:16.829> be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
synthesize any good reader should be

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.830 
synthesize any good reader should be
able<00:02:17.069> to<00:02:17.310> synthesize<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.689> where

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
able to synthesize and this is where

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.690 
able to synthesize and this is where
they<00:02:18.959> take<00:02:19.230> information<00:02:20.010> they<00:02:20.159> already<00:02:20.430> knew

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
they take information they already knew

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.360 
they take information they already knew
add<00:02:20.909> it<00:02:21.629> to<00:02:21.780> new<00:02:22.019> information<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.920> come<00:02:23.250> up

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
add it to new information and come up

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.220 
add it to new information and come up
with<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.549> new<00:02:23.790> perspective<00:02:24.510> we<00:02:24.840> call<00:02:25.049> that

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
with a new perspective we call that

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.220 
with a new perspective we call that
putting<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.980> pieces<00:02:26.250> together<00:02:26.849> so<00:02:27.689> these<00:02:27.930> are

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
putting the pieces together so these are

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.250 
putting the pieces together so these are
the<00:02:28.470> seven<00:02:28.799> habits<00:02:29.159> of<00:02:29.250> a<00:02:29.459> good<00:02:29.640> reader

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
the seven habits of a good reader

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
showed you some reading strategies for

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.730 
showed you some reading strategies for
struggling<00:02:35.190> middle<00:02:35.489> school<00:02:35.730> readers

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740
