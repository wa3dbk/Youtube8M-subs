when you have got it on you want to then

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.310 
when you have got it on you want to then
just<00:01:04.350> create<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> fold<00:01:05.280> with<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> excess<00:01:06.630> which

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
just create a fold with the excess which

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.050 
just create a fold with the excess which

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
then you just fold over if you've got

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.570 
then you just fold over if you've got
slightly<00:01:09.360> shorter<00:01:09.869> carps<00:01:10.229> feel<00:01:10.770> free<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.130> fold

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
slightly shorter carps feel free to fold

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
slightly shorter carps feel free to fold
it<00:01:11.790> double<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.930> kind<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> map<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
it double time that kind of map time to

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.429 
it double time that kind of map time to
do<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.640> double<00:01:14.909> but<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.750> make<00:01:15.900> sure<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
do it double but just make sure that

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
do it double but just make sure that
this<00:01:16.770> ribbed<00:01:17.189> edge<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> bit<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
this ribbed edge is the bit that's the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
this ribbed edge is the bit that's the
fold<00:01:19.110> over<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.680> if<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.950> have<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.220> turn<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.580> down

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
fold over so if you have to turn it down

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.789 
fold over so if you have to turn it down
internally<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.170> pull<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.500> over<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
internally and then pull this over the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.850 
internally and then pull this over the
top<00:01:22.979> that's<00:01:23.220> absolutely<00:01:23.729> fine<00:01:24.259> also<00:01:25.259> I'd<00:01:25.590> say

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
top that's absolutely fine also I'd say

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.170 
top that's absolutely fine also I'd say
when<00:01:26.400> you're<00:01:26.549> thinking<00:01:26.759> about<00:01:26.970> what

when you're thinking about what

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.660 
when you're thinking about what
knee-high<00:01:27.960> socks<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.470> pick<00:01:28.680> think<00:01:29.310> about<00:01:29.549> the

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
knee-high socks to pick think about the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.460 
knee-high socks to pick think about the
outfits<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.479> your<00:01:30.570> wardrobe<00:01:30.810> so
