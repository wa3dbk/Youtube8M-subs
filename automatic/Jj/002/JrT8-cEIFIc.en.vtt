making a new layer or a new adjustment
layer<00:00:18.779> these<00:00:19.529> are<00:00:19.800> two<00:00:20.070> different<00:00:20.490> types<00:00:20.609> of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
layer these are two different types of

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.120 
layer these are two different types of
ways<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.100> making<00:00:23.430> flexible<00:00:24.269> adjustments<00:00:25.130> each

of them have the ability to be masking
each<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.349> them<00:00:28.500> has<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.949> blend<00:00:29.310> mode<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:30.090> when

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
each of them has a blend mode so when

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.700 
each of them has a blend mode so when
you<00:00:30.300> make<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.480> new<00:00:30.720> layer<00:00:30.990> you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.529> actually

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
you make a new layer you can actually

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
you make a new layer you can actually
change<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.369> blend<00:00:32.610> mode<00:00:32.700> upon<00:00:33.120> making<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> or

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
change the blend mode upon making it or

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.920 
change the blend mode upon making it or
after<00:00:34.500> making<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.980> any<00:00:35.160> time<00:00:35.399> in<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> future

essential ones down below are the ones

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
essential ones down below are the ones
that<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.050> use<00:00:43.260> again<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.680> again<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> again

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that I use again and again and again

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.639 
that I use again and again and again
again<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.360> mentioned<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.809> multiply<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.379> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
again I mentioned that multiply is like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.080 
again I mentioned that multiply is like
taking<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.070> transparencies<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> light

density<00:00:49.860> screen<00:00:50.399> is<00:00:50.579> like<00:00:50.730> taking<00:00:50.940> two<00:00:51.440> slides

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
density screen is like taking two slides

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.979 
density screen is like taking two slides
projecting<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.430> same<00:00:53.699> point<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
projecting the same point on the on a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.830 
projecting the same point on the on a
wall<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> having<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.760> entire<00:00:57.030> image<00:00:57.360> lighten

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.260 
up
particularly<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> highlights<00:00:59.270> overlay

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
particularly in the highlights overlay

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
particularly in the highlights overlay
is<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.870> combination<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.649> these<00:01:01.770> two<00:01:02.270> soft

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
is really combination of these two soft

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
is really combination of these two soft
light<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.510> hard<00:01:03.809> light<00:01:03.989> functions<00:01:04.409> similarly

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
light and hard light functions similarly

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.260 
light and hard light functions similarly
but<00:01:05.100> they<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.280> different<00:01:05.460> side<00:01:05.760> effects<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
but they have different side effects and

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.580 
but they have different side effects and
for<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.540> reason<00:01:06.600> I'll<00:01:07.049> show<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.320> why<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.470> have

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
for that reason I'll show you why I have

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.710 
for that reason I'll show you why I have
favored<00:01:07.830> overlay<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.549> these<00:01:09.119> down<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.390> are

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
favored overlay and these down here are

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.490 
favored overlay and these down here are
very<00:01:10.140> often<00:01:11.600> underestimated<00:01:12.600> these<00:01:13.140> allow

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
very often underestimated these allow

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
very often underestimated these allow
you<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.710> target<00:01:14.159> specific<00:01:14.820> components<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you to target specific components of

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
you to target specific components of
color<00:01:15.740> luminosity<00:01:16.740> hue<00:01:17.250> saturation<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
this type of adjustment it can also tell

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.639 
this type of adjustment it can also tell
you<00:02:05.790> that<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.649> industrial-strength

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
you that this industrial-strength

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.190 
you that this industrial-strength
technique<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.489> easily<00:02:09.149> cause<00:02:09.420> problems<00:02:10.020> in

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
technique can easily cause problems in

the opposite end of the tonal scale this

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.970 
the opposite end of the tonal scale this
is<00:02:13.020> very<00:02:13.230> intensive<00:02:13.709> fact

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
is very intensive fact

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.619 
is very intensive fact
you<00:02:14.069> want<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.280> keep<00:02:14.430> it<00:02:14.580> away<00:02:14.670> from<00:02:14.879> shadows<00:02:15.480> or

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
you want to keep it away from shadows or

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.490 
you want to keep it away from shadows or
you<00:02:15.659> can<00:02:15.720> quickly<00:02:16.110> clip<00:02:16.620> values<00:02:17.159> and<00:02:18.500> produce

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
you can quickly clip values and produce

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250 
you can quickly clip values and produce
adverse<00:02:19.769> effects<00:02:20.580> rather<00:02:21.420> than<00:02:21.629> beneficial

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
adverse effects rather than beneficial

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.170 
adverse effects rather than beneficial
effects<00:02:22.640> let's<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:23.819> look<00:02:24.030> at<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
effects let's take a look at the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.199 
effects let's take a look at the
difference<00:02:24.450> between<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.840> and<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:26.280> white<00:02:26.819> spot

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.039 

which<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.330> might<00:02:30.540> add<00:02:31.250> initially<00:02:32.250> inside<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
which I might add initially inside the

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:35.930 
which I might add initially inside the
shadows<00:02:34.470> notice<00:02:34.950> how<00:02:35.069> much<00:02:35.220> that<00:02:35.430> opens<00:02:35.819> up

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
shadows notice how much that opens up

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.420 
shadows notice how much that opens up
the<00:02:36.030> shadows<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.569> we'll<00:02:37.410> use<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:38.010> move<00:02:38.190> tool

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
the shadows and we'll use the move tool

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.390 
the shadows and we'll use the move tool
again<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.140> scan<00:02:40.140> through<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.680> image<00:02:40.920> notice

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
again to scan through the image notice

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.580 
again to scan through the image notice
it<00:02:41.489> produces<00:02:44.150> big<00:02:45.150> problems<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:46.379> the

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
it produces big problems in the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.289 
it produces big problems in the
highlights<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.519> really<00:02:47.790> want<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.000> use<00:02:48.150> this

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
highlights you really want to use this

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.600 
highlights you really want to use this
technique<00:02:48.930> very<00:02:49.200> carefully<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.340> scan

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
technique very carefully as I scan

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.220 
technique very carefully as I scan
through<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:50.940> shadows<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.450> can<00:02:51.629> see<00:02:51.900> how<00:02:52.079> much

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
through the shadows I can see how much

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.410 
through the shadows I can see how much
shadow<00:02:52.470> detail<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.879> this<00:02:54.090> crack

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
shadow detail is there in this crack

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.330 
shadow detail is there in this crack
there's<00:02:54.870> something<00:02:55.200> useful<00:02:55.560> going<00:02:55.739> after<00:02:56.190> in

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
there's something useful going after in

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.500 
there's something useful going after in
this<00:02:56.459> darker<00:02:56.790> shadow<00:02:57.030> I've<00:02:57.180> got<00:02:57.299> a<00:02:57.329> lot<00:02:57.480> of

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
this darker shadow I've got a lot of

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.080 
this darker shadow I've got a lot of
detail<00:02:57.900> up<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.950> much<00:02:59.519> less<00:02:59.849> information

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
detail up in here much less information

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.119 
detail up in here much less information
so<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.079> are<00:03:01.200> areas<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.650> I<00:03:01.859> can<00:03:02.010> quickly

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
so there are areas that I can quickly

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.309 
so there are areas that I can quickly
see<00:03:02.370> that<00:03:03.090> may<00:03:03.359> not<00:03:03.569> benefit<00:03:04.019> from<00:03:04.170> this

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
see that may not benefit from this

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.990 
see that may not benefit from this
technique<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.129> quickly<00:03:05.310> scan<00:03:05.700> through

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
technique and I can quickly scan through

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.460 
technique and I can quickly scan through
and<00:03:06.180> decide<00:03:06.569> where<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.109> also<00:03:13.260> as

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
and decide where to go this is also as

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.259 
and decide where to go this is also as
an<00:03:13.560> important<00:03:14.040> concept<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:14.879> think<00:03:15.000> about

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
an important concept to think about

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.379 
an important concept to think about
before<00:03:15.660> committing<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.349> solutions<00:03:17.389> research

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
before committing to solutions research

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.059 
before committing to solutions research
the<00:03:18.840> possibilities<00:03:19.530> within<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.950> image

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
the possibilities within the image

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.220 
the possibilities within the image
explore<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> little<00:03:20.970> bit<00:03:21.209> don't<00:03:21.900> try<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.139> get

explore a little bit don't try and get

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.740 
explore a little bit don't try and get
it<00:03:22.380> perfect<00:03:23.030> find<00:03:24.030> out<00:03:24.209> what<00:03:24.419> your<00:03:24.569> options
