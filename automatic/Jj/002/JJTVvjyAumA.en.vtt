00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the chance double block first that would

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
the chance double block first that would
be<00:01:45.720> fun<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.829> then<00:01:47.009> i<00:01:47.100> can<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.610> just

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
both these guys the obvious block is to

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.560 
both these guys the obvious block is to
just<00:02:00.689> double<00:02:00.990> block<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> guy<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.570> obviously

just double block that guy and obviously
i<00:02:03.869> am<00:02:04.200> not<00:02:04.380> bad<00:02:04.649> at<00:02:04.799> magic<00:02:05.250> or<00:02:05.579> i<00:02:05.790> don't<00:02:05.909> know

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
i am not bad at magic or i don't know

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.119 
i am not bad at magic or i don't know
how<00:02:06.240> obvious<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.259> I'm<00:02:07.530> not<00:02:07.710> terrible

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
how obvious that is but I'm not terrible

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:11.420 
how obvious that is but I'm not terrible
at<00:02:08.250> Magic<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:09.229> I'm<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.440> gonna<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.370> to

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
at Magic so I'm just gonna just going to

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.040 
at Magic so I'm just gonna just going to
fix<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.700> obviously<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.720> you're<00:02:12.900> not

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
fix that obviously that you're not

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.920 
fix that obviously that you're not
playing<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.410> says<00:02:13.590> no

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
playing it says no

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.160 
playing it says no
idea<00:02:14.400> how<00:02:15.400> I<00:02:15.430> play<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:15.849> it<00:02:16.599> was<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:16.959> was<00:02:17.049> the

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
idea how I play so it was it was the

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.470 
idea how I play so it was it was the
correct<00:02:17.409> block<00:02:17.799> but<00:02:18.670> it<00:02:19.090> was<00:02:19.239> a<00:02:19.269> little

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
correct block but it was a little

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.899 
correct block but it was a little
obvious<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.349> that<00:02:21.340> I<00:02:21.400> had<00:02:21.609> a<00:02:21.640> trick

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
obvious that that I had a trick

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.539 
obvious that that I had a trick
otherwise<00:02:22.209> I<00:02:22.359> would<00:02:22.480> not<00:02:22.510> swing<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.140> with<00:02:23.290> my

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
otherwise I would not swing in with my

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:25.500 
otherwise I would not swing in with my
argue<00:02:24.549> ibly<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> best<00:02:25.030> card<00:02:25.209> in<00:02:25.269> the<00:02:25.359> deck

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
argue ibly the best card in the deck

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.399 
argue ibly the best card in the deck
maybe<00:02:26.349> not<00:02:26.560> but<00:02:26.829> it's<00:02:27.250> definitely<00:02:28.409> arguable

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
maybe not but it's definitely arguable

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.039 
maybe not but it's definitely arguable
that<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:30.040> is<00:02:30.189> so<00:02:30.909> right<00:02:31.450> here<00:02:31.629> I<00:02:31.659> don't<00:02:31.840> think

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
that it is so right here I don't think

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.030 
that it is so right here I don't think
we're<00:02:32.170> going<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.349> do<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.530> same<00:02:32.560> thing<00:02:32.920> i'll

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
we're going to do the same thing i'll

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.300 
we're going to do the same thing i'll
probably<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.459> swing<00:02:33.879> 45<00:02:34.389> in<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:34.599> air<00:02:35.310> with

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
probably just swing 45 in the air with

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.000 
probably just swing 45 in the air with
my<00:02:36.340> crusader<00:02:37.030> i'll<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:38.079> swing<00:02:38.260> for<00:02:38.379> 4<00:02:38.799> in<00:02:38.829> the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
my crusader i'll just swing for 4 in the

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.280 
my crusader i'll just swing for 4 in the
air<00:02:39.159> with<00:02:39.370> my<00:02:39.400> crusader<00:02:39.909> may<00:02:40.150> as<00:02:40.209> well<00:02:40.420> give

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
air with my crusader may as well give

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.580 
air with my crusader may as well give
him<00:02:41.439> some<00:02:41.680> wings<00:02:42.010> right<00:02:42.340> now<00:02:42.609> and<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:44.530> don't

guys didn't know the way an HDPVR works
is<00:04:09.449> it<00:04:10.449> basically<00:04:10.629> hooks<00:04:11.079> up<00:04:11.229> to<00:04:11.259> your

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
is it basically hooks up to your

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.409 
is it basically hooks up to your
computer<00:04:11.560> and<00:04:12.069> that's<00:04:12.729> that's<00:04:13.030> where<00:04:13.269> you<00:04:13.329> get

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
computer and that's that's where you get

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.569 
computer and that's that's where you get
the<00:04:13.540> recording<00:04:13.930> from<00:04:14.139> but<00:04:14.439> the<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:15.400> part

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
the recording from but the the part

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.240 
the recording from but the the part
that's<00:04:15.759> relevant<00:04:16.120> here<00:04:16.570> is<00:04:16.690> the<00:04:17.349> fact<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.799> it

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
that's relevant here is the fact that it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.890 
that's relevant here is the fact that it
shows<00:04:18.549> a<00:04:18.579> preview<00:04:18.970> screen<00:04:19.389> so<00:04:19.570> right<00:04:19.720> now<00:04:19.750> I'm

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
shows a preview screen so right now I'm

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.089 
shows a preview screen so right now I'm
looking<00:04:20.019> on<00:04:20.259> the<00:04:20.320> preview<00:04:20.590> screen<00:04:20.829> so<00:04:20.979> it's

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:21.099 
looking on the preview screen so it's

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:23.399 
looking on the preview screen so it's
like<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.220> second<00:04:21.549> or<00:04:21.639> two<00:04:21.669> delayed<00:04:22.029> so<00:04:22.539> of
