story<00:01:51.930> where<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.890> aren't<00:01:53.280> quite<00:01:53.460> sure<00:01:53.490> what's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
story where you aren't quite sure what's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.950 
story where you aren't quite sure what's
happening<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.390> it's<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
happening it's like it's like this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.160 
happening it's like it's like this
really<00:01:55.170> messy<00:01:55.740> time<00:01:56.450> time<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.810> Star<00:01:58.140> Trek

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
really messy time time with in Star Trek

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.639 
really messy time time with in Star Trek
and<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:58.799> we're<00:01:58.979> trying<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.310> figure<00:01:59.490> out<00:02:00.649> just

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
and so we're trying to figure out just

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.170 
and so we're trying to figure out just
where<00:02:01.829> things<00:02:02.070> are<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.219> who's<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.149> charge

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
where things are going who's in charge

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.539 
where things are going who's in charge
whether<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.170> should<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:04.770> who's<00:02:05.399> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
whether they should be or not who's the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.980 
whether they should be or not who's the
good<00:02:05.700> guy<00:02:05.820> who's<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> bad<00:02:06.299> guy<00:02:06.329> kind<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> thing

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
good guy who's the bad guy kind of thing

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.590 
good guy who's the bad guy kind of thing
so<00:02:07.680> I'm<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.610> sort<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.879> long<00:02:09.060> for<00:02:09.420> the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
so I'm just sort of a long for the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.020 
so I'm just sort of a long for the
with<00:02:10.110> all<00:02:10.260> of<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.440> mix<00:02:10.830> but<00:02:11.130> it's<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.730> me<00:02:11.850> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
with all of that mix but it's to me that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.190 
with all of that mix but it's to me that
makes<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> most<00:02:12.450> fascinating<00:02:12.720> because

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
makes it the most fascinating because

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.440 
makes it the most fascinating because
you<00:02:13.350> don't<00:02:13.560> know<00:02:13.710> what<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.010> expect<00:02:14.450> what's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
you don't know what to expect what's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.940 
you don't know what to expect what's

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
into a crowdfunded model like how do you

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.190 
into a crowdfunded model like how do you
feel<00:02:46.950> this<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> does<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.390> affect<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.960> does

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
feel this is a does this affect you does

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.340 
feel this is a does this affect you does
it<00:02:49.290> affect<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.650> industry<00:02:50.250> would<00:02:51.350> well

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
it affect the industry would well

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.900 
it affect the industry would well
certainly<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.680> industry<00:02:53.130> is<00:02:53.220> infected<00:02:53.520> but<00:02:53.850> I

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
certainly the industry is infected but I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.840 
certainly the industry is infected but I
think<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:56.010> know<00:02:56.130> for<00:02:56.160> an<00:02:56.400> industry<00:02:56.820> that's

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
think you know for an industry that's

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.080 
think you know for an industry that's
been<00:02:57.150> around<00:02:57.270> for<00:02:58.020> nearly<00:02:58.370> 100<00:02:59.370> years<00:02:59.400> it's

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
been around for nearly 100 years it's

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.030 
been around for nearly 100 years it's
interesting<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:00.990> right<00:03:01.290> now<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.710> kind<00:03:01.950> of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
interesting that right now it kind of

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.880 
interesting that right now it kind of
feels<00:03:02.160> like<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.490> Wild<00:03:02.730> West<00:03:02.910> all<00:03:03.120> over<00:03:03.360> again

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
feels like the Wild West all over again

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
feels like the Wild West all over again
no<00:03:04.890> one<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.250> knows<00:03:05.400> what's<00:03:05.700> going<00:03:05.850> to

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
no one really knows what's going to

happen mmm there you know it's a tough

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.340 
happen mmm there you know it's a tough
tough<00:03:08.910> nut<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.180> crack<00:03:09.330> everybody's<00:03:10.020> trying<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
tough nut to crack everybody's trying to

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.490 
tough nut to crack everybody's trying to
figure<00:03:10.620> out<00:03:10.770> how<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:12.050> because<00:03:13.050> you<00:03:13.350> know<00:03:13.470> I

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
figure out how you because you know I

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.900 
figure out how you because you know I
mean<00:03:13.680> raising<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.190> money<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.520> only<00:03:14.640> half<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
mean raising the money is only half the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.060 
mean raising the money is only half the
battle<00:03:15.150> it's<00:03:15.660> trying<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.500> raise<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.980> money

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
battle it's trying to raise the money

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.640 
battle it's trying to raise the money
and<00:03:17.370> be<00:03:17.580> profitable<00:03:17.760> afterwards<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.320> it's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
and be profitable afterwards so it's

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.290 
and be profitable afterwards so it's
this<00:03:19.920> equation<00:03:20.460> that<00:03:20.580> everybody's<00:03:21.000> trying<00:03:21.180> to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
this equation that everybody's trying to

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.140 
this equation that everybody's trying to
figure<00:03:21.570> out<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:22.020> how<00:03:22.320> do<00:03:22.380> you<00:03:22.880> have<00:03:23.880> enough

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
i mean you know it's that sort of thing

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.770 
i mean you know it's that sort of thing
where<00:04:44.480> it's<00:04:45.139> definitely<00:04:45.680> a<00:04:45.710> great

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
where it's definitely a great

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.450 
where it's definitely a great
thermometer<00:04:47.780> for<00:04:48.260> for<00:04:48.680> your<00:04:48.800> fan<00:04:49.010> base<00:04:49.040> and

thermometer for for your fan base and

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.680 
thermometer for for your fan base and
what<00:04:49.639> it<00:04:49.730> is<00:04:49.820> that<00:04:50.000> they're<00:04:50.090> interested<00:04:50.360> in

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
what it is that they're interested in

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.800 
what it is that they're interested in
but<00:04:51.440> it's<00:04:51.680> still<00:04:52.400> only<00:04:52.639> half<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.120> battle<00:04:53.360> it's

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
but it's still only half the battle it's

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.070 
but it's still only half the battle it's
I<00:04:54.050> feel<00:04:54.650> like<00:04:54.770> five<00:04:55.010> years<00:04:55.160> from<00:04:55.280> now<00:04:55.430> the

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
I feel like five years from now the

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.760 
I feel like five years from now the
industry<00:04:57.080> will<00:04:57.230> look<00:04:57.350> completely<00:04:57.440> different

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
industry will look completely different

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.070 
industry will look completely different
and<00:04:58.340> for<00:04:59.120> that<00:04:59.210> matter<00:04:59.360> I<00:04:59.540> mean<00:04:59.720> I<00:04:59.810> think

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
and for that matter I mean I think

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.440 
and for that matter I mean I think
because<00:05:00.710> it's<00:05:01.040> a<00:05:01.130> gradual<00:05:01.640> change<00:05:02.030> we<00:05:02.270> don't

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
because it's a gradual change we don't

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.960 
because it's a gradual change we don't
see<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.690> as<00:05:02.780> much<00:05:02.930> but<00:05:03.410> without<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.280> doubt<00:05:04.580> it's

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
see it as much but without a doubt it's

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.670 
see it as much but without a doubt it's
completely<00:05:05.930> different<00:05:06.020> than<00:05:06.200> it<00:05:06.350> was<00:05:06.380> five

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
completely different than it was five

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.400 
completely different than it was five
years<00:05:06.800> ago<00:05:07.000> so<00:05:08.000> we're<00:05:08.480> all<00:05:08.630> trying<00:05:08.840> to<00:05:08.960> figure

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
years ago so we're all trying to figure

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.690 
years ago so we're all trying to figure
it<00:05:09.470> out<00:05:09.680> we're<00:05:09.980> all<00:05:10.040> trying<00:05:10.250> to<00:05:10.400> figure<00:05:10.640> out

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700
