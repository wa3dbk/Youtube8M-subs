which<00:04:12.330> I<00:04:12.510> think<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.930> kind<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.320> cheap<00:04:13.560> but<00:04:13.830> I

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
which I think it's kind of cheap but I

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.200 
which I think it's kind of cheap but I
probably<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.490> have<00:04:14.550> done<00:04:14.700> it<00:04:14.820> anyway<00:04:14.940> even

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
probably would have done it anyway even

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.720 
probably would have done it anyway even
though<00:04:15.630> I'm<00:04:15.780> already<00:04:16.080> level<00:04:16.470> 55<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:17.280> probably

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
though I'm already level 55 I probably

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.070 
though I'm already level 55 I probably
would<00:04:18.030> have<00:04:18.090> done<00:04:18.239> it<00:04:18.359> on<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.540> secondary

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
would have done it on a secondary

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.960 
would have done it on a secondary
account<00:04:19.380> but<00:04:19.650> too<00:04:19.979> bad<00:04:20.010> it's<00:04:20.400> not<00:04:20.520> even<00:04:20.580> for

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
account but too bad it's not even for

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.230 
account but too bad it's not even for
ps3<00:04:21.270> but<00:04:21.690> um<00:04:22.020> Treyarch<00:04:22.890> is<00:04:23.100> shutting<00:04:24.060> it<00:04:24.210> down

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
ps3 but um Treyarch is shutting it down

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.290 
ps3 but um Treyarch is shutting it down
i<00:04:24.479> guess<00:04:24.900> or

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
i guess or

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.809 
i guess or
they<00:04:25.509> shut<00:04:25.780> down<00:04:25.810> theater<00:04:26.379> mode<00:04:26.530> on<00:04:27.009> fur<00:04:27.789> I

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:27.819 
they shut down theater mode on fur I

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:30.059 
they shut down theater mode on fur I
guess<00:04:28.210> a<00:04:28.509> day<00:04:28.900> or<00:04:29.050> two<00:04:29.259> until<00:04:29.470> they<00:04:29.770> can<00:04:29.919> get

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:30.069 
guess a day or two until they can get

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:32.700 
guess a day or two until they can get
this<00:04:30.250> theater<00:04:31.030> mode<00:04:31.150> glitch<00:04:31.539> wrapped<00:04:31.930> up<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:32.229> I
