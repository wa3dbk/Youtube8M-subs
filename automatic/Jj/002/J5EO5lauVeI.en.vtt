00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
an amazing fully functional garden now

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.049 
an amazing fully functional garden now
as<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.480> can<00:00:36.660> see<00:00:37.190> I've<00:00:38.190> dug<00:00:38.489> up<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.850> whole

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
as you can see I've dug up this whole

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.209 
as you can see I've dug up this whole
little<00:00:39.300> section<00:00:39.870> here<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.920> is<00:00:40.980> what

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
little section here and this is what

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.650 
little section here and this is what
we're<00:00:41.399> going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.610> using<00:00:41.700> one<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> most

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
we're going to be using one of the most

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.930 
we're going to be using one of the most
important<00:00:43.590> factors<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.340> permaculture

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
important factors of permaculture

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
important factors of permaculture
gardening<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.390> fact<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.719> we<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
gardening is the fact that we need to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.090 
gardening is the fact that we need to
keep<00:00:49.350> moisture<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.340> soil<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> how<00:00:52.829> we<00:00:52.890> do

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
keep moisture in the soil so how we do

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.090 
keep moisture in the soil so how we do
that<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.539> I've<00:00:54.539> cut<00:00:55.050> up<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.260> whole<00:00:55.469> lot<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.739> grass

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that is I've cut up a whole lot of grass

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.139 
that is I've cut up a whole lot of grass
over<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:57.140> this<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.289> what<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.530> looks<00:00:58.710> like<00:00:59.149> dry

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over here this is what it looks like dry

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.689 
over here this is what it looks like dry
grass<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.840> it's<00:01:01.680> wet<00:01:01.949> then<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.460> going<00:01:02.609> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
grass if it's wet then it's going to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.340 
grass if it's wet then it's going to
grow<00:01:02.850> roots<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> we<00:01:03.600> don't<00:01:03.719> want<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.080> so

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
grow roots and we don't want that so

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.800 
grow roots and we don't want that so
take<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> grant<00:01:07.860> dry<00:01:08.220> grass<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
take this grant dry grass and you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:23.170 
take this grant dry grass and you
sprinkle<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> over<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:11.189> entire<00:01:11.430> patch

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.250 

so<00:01:24.770> as<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.950> can<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:26.430> I've<00:01:27.140> covered<00:01:28.140> this

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
so as you can see I've covered this

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.080 
so as you can see I've covered this
entire<00:01:28.830> spot<00:01:29.630> with<00:01:30.630> dry<00:01:30.930> grass<00:01:31.260> and<00:01:31.940> this<00:01:32.940> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
entire spot with dry grass and this is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.670 
entire spot with dry grass and this is
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.300> keep<00:01:33.510> all<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.840> moisture<00:01:34.020> into<00:01:34.590> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
going to keep all the moisture into the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580 
going to keep all the moisture into the
soil<00:01:35.360> which<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.690> main<00:01:36.870> thing<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.320> need<00:01:37.560> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
soil which is the main thing we need for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.420 
soil which is the main thing we need for
growing<00:01:38.070> plants<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> over<00:01:40.920> here<00:01:40.950> we're<00:01:41.310> going

growing plants so over here we're going
to<00:01:41.520> grow<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.700> couple<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.150> vegetables<00:01:42.660> and<00:01:42.960> a

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
to grow a couple of vegetables and a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
for our everyday living and over the

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.969 
for our everyday living and over the
next<00:01:52.890> couple<00:01:53.760> of<00:01:53.940> blogs<00:01:54.260> I'm<00:01:55.260> going<00:01:55.890> to

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
next couple of blogs I'm going to

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.830 
next couple of blogs I'm going to
explain<00:01:56.400> all<00:01:57.229> about<00:01:58.820> how<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.880> get<00:02:00.150> this<00:02:00.390> garden

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
explain all about how to get this garden

explain all about how to get this garden
going<00:02:02.150> like<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> super<00:02:03.810> jungle<00:02:04.880> ground<00:02:05.880> cover

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
going like a super jungle ground cover

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.160 
going like a super jungle ground cover
the<00:02:07.170> reason<00:02:07.650> why<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.850> use<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> lot<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.360> grass<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the reason why we use a lot of grass to

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.520 
the reason why we use a lot of grass to
cover<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.550> top<00:02:11.820> is<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.720> keep<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.990> moisture<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
cover the top is to keep the moisture in

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.910 
cover the top is to keep the moisture in
and<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:16.140> place<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.709> live

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
and as you can see the place that I live

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.470 
and as you can see the place that I live
in<00:02:17.070> is<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.340> very<00:02:17.820> dry<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:19.190> barren<00:02:20.190> kind<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.880> area

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
in is a very dry and barren kind of area

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.990 
in is a very dry and barren kind of area
so<00:02:22.470> we<00:02:22.860> need<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.130> try<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.519> keep<00:02:23.610> as<00:02:23.820> much

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
so we need to try and keep as much

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.300 
so we need to try and keep as much
moisture<00:02:24.300> in<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> soil<00:02:25.080> as<00:02:25.440> possible<00:02:26.010> and

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
moisture in the soil as possible and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.470 
moisture in the soil as possible and
that<00:02:26.670> mulching<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.410> soil<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:29.010> what<00:02:29.790> feeds

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that mulching of the soil is what feeds

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.290 
that mulching of the soil is what feeds
the<00:02:30.750> soil<00:02:31.019> over<00:02:31.410> time<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.950> will<00:02:32.880> eventually

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
the soil over time and will eventually

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.550 
the soil over time and will eventually
become<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.680> next<00:02:35.100> layer<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.390> composting<00:02:36.560> now

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
become the next layer of composting now

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.410 
become the next layer of composting now
this<00:02:37.769> little<00:02:37.950> permaculture<00:02:38.580> project<00:02:39.239> I'm

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
doing forms part of a bigger concept

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.009 
doing forms part of a bigger concept
that<00:02:43.110> I'm<00:02:43.260> working<00:02:43.470> on<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.660> to<00:02:45.810> show
