00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.230
 to 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.950
 with our friends are we going to 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.930
 teach to do something super traditional 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.029
 from here in Mexico we forgot a 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.220
 little halloween we're going to start this 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.640
 recipe as you know is a bread 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.039
 of dead with the ingredients like 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:37.510
 you know the main ingredient 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:41.290
 from his dead we started the first 250 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.930
 grams of flour 240 grams of 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.450
 butter and 40 grams of margarine 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.760
 they have to know these their things are 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.739
 different and they are achieved in the same 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.750
 place but with different price be more 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.940
 expensive and cheaper but it's different and 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.399
 good in any store where they come 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.890
 seeds of species this kind of thing 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.500
 random seed will not have to put 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.920
 a spoonful they will have to put 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.830
 in front of 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.110
 that will be 30 minutillos 20 minutes that 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.560
 boil the water a spoonful if it's going to 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.040
 something like this 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.190
 to install what is 50 grams of sugar 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.500
 three oranges 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.050
 here in this case we are dealing with radio 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.270
 the zest of the orange if you do not 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.950
 like or not to whom to have the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.560
 Taste transit and ccoo of the orange 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 you can get this concentrate 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.130
 artificial that they sell it also where 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.530
 Seeing the seeds and good makes us see 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:41.230
 a little more chilies a teaspoon 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:44.680
 of yeast the eggs the people and 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.660
 give them pot mole well there are two ways 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.940
 for doing this was a pan de muerto the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.070
 first is to use the blender with this 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.110
 hook or else do it the most 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.340
 traditional that would be with hands on 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.750
 my case I am going to do it with a 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.030
 blender as you can see to do it 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.310
 faster and more richer then we are going to 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.310
 have to put the 250 grams of flour 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.450
 and the 40 grams of margarine 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.490
 and half the sugar we said that 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.300
 they were 50 grams we're going to have to 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.930
 use 25 2 pinches of salt that I already counted 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.510
 all 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.330
 one teaspoon of yeast 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.660
 and 30 milliliters of roasting 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.700
 and now if we start Friday this is 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.700
 a medium speed something like that 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.099
 we have to wait a few 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:39.540
 seconds for all 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:42.749
 after it looks like this 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.709
 style as well as has shattered to have 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:45.709
 that add the eggs 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.830
 so that they are removed for me 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.830
 be the whole engine 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.090
 and let's stop the mix a little and 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680
 let's I have to add the 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.280
 missing ingredients that are being 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.390
 the 25 grams of sugar that were missing 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:11.450
 the other 40 grams of butter and the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.100
 artificial orange concentrate in 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.170
 this case is going to have to add a 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.670
 cap 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.420
 we see the same thing will have to return 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.790
 to learn from a mixer to your shake 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.319
 and to give equal the average speed little 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.319
 to little as andy the best talents 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.890
 I already shouted at them without their moment in 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.430
 the village 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.430
 Y 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:45.450
 little flour put it in the hands 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.450
 and we're going to have to bring everything 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.460
 and we're going to have you put in a 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.950
 container 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.010
 ready 100 million between herbs should 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.590
 cover your container with the mixture to 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.950
 you can not leave that hard and if we 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.870
 they knew it was hard 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.640
 let's put it for 20 to 25 minutes 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.080
 to double its volume and ferment 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.760
 well more Milanese after 25 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.800
 minutes that happened as you can see now 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.660
 our dough is sponged and we are going to 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.660
 proceed next step that is to open it 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.450
 sprinkle some sand on the 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:24.260
 table so that our 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.920
 mass and we proceed to grab a chunk 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.720
 and we are going to give a way 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:33.460
 as if it were from a 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.139
 we do not hurt another dog 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.509
 for humanities as you can see here 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.310
 we have our dead but strong 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:41.020
 one thing the bones to do the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.729
 bones of our bread we will have 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.870
 to repeat the same steps let's collaborate 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:49.630
 on the table flour little by little and 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.860
 we started with the fun now in your 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.810
 fingers so to give you have to see that they 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.900
 It was a little bigger bone that 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:02.500
 its the ball we go because at the moment of 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:04.990
 put it like that and when you take it to the oven this 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.729
 he's going to get up and start jacks 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.160
 end apron anecdote to create a 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.169
 little ball ready good mandilones as proof 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.460
 already have our plans dead and 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.810
 level program we are not going to have to 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.570
 put in the oven to work their 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:18.130
 your loaves of death volumes 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.720
 please come with me the sea does not have 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.699
 to be at 40 degrees million 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.969
 this to double its volume our 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.829
 dead 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:27.749
 well let's check how our 

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:29.339
 parents of dead 

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:31.409
 well as you can see, they already talked about it 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:32.549
 volume these loaves of dead now what 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.829
 what are we going to have to do is going to be 

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:37.159
 increase our temperature to 180 

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:37.159
 degrees 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.490
 well millions what follows is to melt 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:51.960
 butter in a pan since it's 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:54.460
 we asked our fans about dead 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.520
 the next step to 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:59.669
 sprinkle sugar I've done too much 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.669
 sugar 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.740
 you have to give something like this 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.300
 style and being able to obey you we've seen in 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.280
 our recipe and do not forget to leave your 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.199
 finished comments subscribe give 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.879
 hand up to be on facebook and in 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.590
 twitter send your photos of how they 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:19.699
 degrees the counts of dead they hopefully 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.699
 and see how
