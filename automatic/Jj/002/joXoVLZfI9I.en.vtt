00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:13.470
 hi people youtube as well as subscribers 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.000
 channel in this video, I'll show you 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:19.320
 what was asked 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.400
 many subscribers but few some 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:27.480
 asked whether you can pvm or mppt 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.999
 i.e. a solar charge device 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.960
 batteries 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:34.890
 use charger for 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.330
 battery charging using the unit 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:44.490
 power supply 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:50.360
 self-made business itself 10 years ago 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:54.900
 if not more here and start in the role 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.260
 experiment we will have a pvm battery 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:02.640
 12 volts 12 people almost charged 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 therefore, almost and already charged no 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 time to discharge until there is no need well 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.090
 main principle 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:16.770
 show whether you can start first 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:23.759
 turn the battery connects what we 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:27.590
 and do not get there got hit 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:32.179
 We look at the battery shows that it is charged 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:36.889
 that's on and off and loads and and 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:42.539
 turn off i.e. lighting bulb is 

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:44.749
 all show green background blinking if 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.749
 blinking 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:56.270
 a hole let's not say so here and red in 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.430
 normal and minimum charge it flashes 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:09.020
 red this show judging by the mean 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:11.740
 then my battery means we have 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.930
 shows 12 9 volts this is basically 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.390
 charged batteries 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.709
 Well, the main principle I repeat 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:25.280
 very much turn on the power supply and submit to 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:28.160
 there is no voltage 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:33.070
 need for battery in this case 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.470
 13 volt wind the charge current 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:43.910
 we rated on the basis of 12 amps 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:47.239
 hours it is 1 and 2 amperes wind here 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:51.140
 we see that here you may not 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:56.200
 apparently the backlight did not do so we let's 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:02.780
 here so 9 volts it is already visible that 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.430
 the battery is working it is written that it is solar 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.390
 battery in light mode that is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.260
 not enough yet 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.680
 voltage twist on 12 volts already 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:20.660
 Glows steadily ie voltage 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.470
 already go far enough here with us 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.860
 current 0 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.780
 and here I also have a current 0 I have here before 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 2 amps and a half amps already 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:35.739
 protection is triggered but I will give one amp 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:40.880
 here we see already 700 600 milliamps 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.450
 charging current visible blinking blinking 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.010
 battery indicator says that 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:52.080
 charging goes on continues here I have 12 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.840
 penny well, that's it in principle 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.800
 voltage but there are 13 4 can be turned 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.500
 attention to 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:08.220
 not visible but I'll do it now 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:14.370
 he works a pulse on the load takes 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:22.890
 now she is building that's giving focus on 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:25.520
 Russian from the floor of an amp, but I do not want a dumper 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:31.260
 can knock out ie see yes 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.070
 the indicator is not just worth it and he staggers 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.560
 left to right so to say that is 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.540
 Charger 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.520
 solar pvn it is not easy 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.500
 voltage gives impetus to gives that is 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:53.010
 it is convenient for charging 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:57.540
 batteries so something happened he 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.930
 turned off yes he turned off he stopped 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.340
 take 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:06.570
 because same 13 2 volts go up on 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.150
 battery that's basically principle 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:12.690
 probably all I wanted to say 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:17.030
 I think I answered your question 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:20.100
 you can charge and even better with 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.740
 pvm and let's charge than just 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.820
 using power supply burden for 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:30.120
 rechargeable batteries are much better 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:34.860
 when he charging current goes pulsed they 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:37.140
 all the time 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.350
 I will try to ask questions 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:42.900
 answer if I can thank you all for 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.320
 view and see you all yet 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.320
 until
