00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.399 
do is build one two three four five six
seven<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.000> then<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> want<00:01:43.229> to

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
seven and then we're going to want to

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
seven and then we're going to want to
encase<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.340> reason<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:44.850> is

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
encase this and the reason for this is

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.130 
encase this and the reason for this is
we're<00:01:45.119> actually<00:01:45.180> gonna<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.600> running<00:01:45.960> some

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
we're actually gonna be running some

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.260 
we're actually gonna be running some
water<00:01:46.439> inside<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.729> we're<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.030> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
water inside of this so we're going to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.920 
water inside of this so we're going to
encase<00:01:48.840> this<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> recap<00:01:51.869> we

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
encase this just like so so to recap we

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.560 
encase this just like so so to recap we
got<00:01:52.200> one<00:01:52.500> two<00:01:52.799> three<00:01:53.040> four<00:01:53.280> five<00:01:53.939> six<00:01:54.270> seven

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
got one two three four five six seven

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.080 
got one two three four five six seven
that's<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:54.990> that's<00:01:55.290> how<00:01:55.799> much<00:01:56.520> this<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.909> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
that's how that's how much this is and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.940 
that's how that's how much this is and
then<00:01:57.450> what<00:01:57.659> you're<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:57.840> want<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.680> put

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
then what you're gonna want to do is put

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.319 
then what you're gonna want to do is put
a<00:01:59.100> sticky<00:01:59.640> piston<00:01:59.939> here<00:02:00.259> here<00:02:01.640> dig<00:02:02.640> down<00:02:02.820> go<00:02:03.210> in

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
a sticky piston here here dig down go in

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.440 
a sticky piston here here dig down go in
here<00:02:03.600> go<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.020> hole<00:02:04.259> right<00:02:04.469> here<00:02:04.670> sheep<00:02:05.670> you

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
here go to hole right here sheep you

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.300 
here go to hole right here sheep you
were<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.780> up<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.079> my<00:02:07.140> tutorial<00:02:07.770> today<00:02:07.890> what's

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
were all up in my tutorial today what's

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.680 
were all up in my tutorial today what's
wrong<00:02:08.520> with<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.599> gonna

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
wrong with you and then you're gonna

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
wrong with you and then you're gonna
want<00:02:09.989> to<00:02:10.050> build<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.679> block<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.250> gold<00:02:11.489> right<00:02:11.700> he

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
want to build a block of gold right he

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.810 
want to build a block of gold right he
and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:12.660> put<00:02:13.050> a<00:02:13.500> block<00:02:14.130> here<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.400> here<00:02:14.670> and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
and then put a block here and here and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.980 
and then put a block here and here and
by<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.210> guys<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.420> doesn't<00:02:15.900> actually

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
by the way guys this doesn't actually

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.540 
by the way guys this doesn't actually
have<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> made<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.710> of<00:02:16.950> gold<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.310> can<00:02:17.460> make

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
have to be made out of gold you can make

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.530 
have to be made out of gold you can make
it<00:02:17.640> out<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.790> whatever<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.180> want<00:02:18.330> if<00:02:18.420> you're

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
it out of whatever you want if you're

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.850 
it out of whatever you want if you're
doing<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.810> in<00:02:18.870> survival<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.650> make<00:02:19.740> it

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
doing this in survival you can make it

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
doing this in survival you can make it
out<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:19.980> cobblestone<00:02:20.430> but<00:02:21.240> one<00:02:21.840> big<00:02:22.200> thing<00:02:22.470> that

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
out a cobblestone but one big thing that

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.530 
out a cobblestone but one big thing that
actually<00:02:22.800> almost<00:02:23.580> left<00:02:23.880> out<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:24.330> can't

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
actually almost left out and I can't

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.390 
actually almost left out and I can't
believe<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.810> almost<00:02:24.900> did<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.320> you<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.250> be

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
believe I almost did this you have to be

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.320 
believe I almost did this you have to be
facing<00:02:26.990> towards<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.200> bottom<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.680> map<00:02:28.950> or

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
facing towards the bottom of the map or

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.300 
facing towards the bottom of the map or
towards<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.450> right<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.710> map<00:02:31.920> whenever

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
towards the right of the map whenever

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.740 
towards the right of the map whenever
you're<00:02:32.460> making<00:02:32.550> this<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> when

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you're making this so you have to when

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.640 
you're making this so you have to when
you're<00:02:33.840> looking<00:02:34.110> at<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.320> front<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
you're looking at the front of the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.140 
you're looking at the front of the
machine<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.670> need<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.910> be<00:02:35.940> looking

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
machine like this you need to be looking

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.390 
machine like this you need to be looking
straight<00:02:36.450> down<00:02:36.630> or<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> right<00:02:38.070> if<00:02:38.280> you're

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
straight down or to the right if you're

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.950 
straight down or to the right if you're
doing<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.760> at<00:02:38.850> any<00:02:39.060> other<00:02:39.240> direction<00:02:39.660> this

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
doing it at any other direction this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.650 
doing it at any other direction this
machine<00:02:40.320> simply<00:02:40.590> will<00:02:40.890> not<00:02:40.920> work<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.660> next

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
machine simply will not work so next

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.090 
machine simply will not work so next
thing<00:02:42.750> you're<00:02:42.930> gonna<00:02:43.020> want<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.350> do<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.680> put<00:02:43.950> a

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
thing you're gonna want to do is put a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.790 
thing you're gonna want to do is put a
piece<00:02:44.400> of<00:02:44.690> redstone<00:02:45.690> torch<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.620> then

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
piece of redstone torch there and then

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.580 
piece of redstone torch there and then
put<00:02:47.490> four<00:02:47.820> pieces<00:02:48.120> of<00:02:48.300> redstone<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.320> so

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
put four pieces of redstone just like so

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.350 
put four pieces of redstone just like so
and<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:51.180> is<00:02:51.390> our<00:02:51.720> entire<00:02:52.140> machine<00:02:52.590> made<00:02:53.400> this

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
and this is our entire machine made this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.640 
and this is our entire machine made this
is<00:02:54.510> our<00:02:54.630> glitch<00:02:54.930> machine<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.410> don't<00:02:55.560> know

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
is our glitch machine I don't know

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.810 
is our glitch machine I don't know
exactly<00:02:56.040> what<00:02:56.220> you<00:02:56.280> would<00:02:56.400> call<00:02:56.490> I<00:02:56.550> would<00:02:56.670> just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
exactly what you would call I would just

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.100 
exactly what you would call I would just
call<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> glitch<00:02:57.420> machine<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:57.959> what

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
call it the glitch machine and what

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.150 
call it the glitch machine and what
we're<00:02:58.230> gonna<00:02:58.320> do<00:02:58.530> for<00:02:58.740> this<00:02:58.830> is<00:02:59.010> we're

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
we're gonna do for this is we're

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.890 
we're gonna do for this is we're
actually<00:02:59.220> gonna<00:02:59.430> shorten<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.180> water<00:03:00.450> but<00:03:00.720> of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
actually gonna shorten the water but of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.230 
actually gonna shorten the water but of
this<00:03:01.230> by<00:03:01.709> two<00:03:01.770> now<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.520> reason<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.910> said<00:03:03.120> go

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
this by two now the reason I said go

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.430 
this by two now the reason I said go
ahead<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.480> build<00:03:03.720> it<00:03:03.810> out<00:03:03.900> by<00:03:04.020> seven<00:03:04.350> is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
ahead and build it out by seven is

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.600 
ahead and build it out by seven is
because<00:03:04.590> you<00:03:04.709> can<00:03:04.860> actually<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.430> this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
because you can actually use this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.160 
because you can actually use this
machine<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:06.000> glitch<00:03:06.450> multiple<00:03:06.990> different

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
machine to glitch multiple different

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.230 
machine to glitch multiple different
blocks<00:03:07.500> but<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.010> is<00:03:08.130> by<00:03:08.370> far<00:03:08.610> definitely<00:03:09.120> the

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
blocks but this is by far definitely the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.580 
blocks but this is by far definitely the
coolest<00:03:09.540> block<00:03:09.870> I've<00:03:10.020> ever<00:03:10.170> seen<00:03:10.470> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
coolest block I've ever seen in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.230 
coolest block I've ever seen in
Minecraft<00:03:11.010> so<00:03:11.459> you're<00:03:11.550> gonna<00:03:11.670> have<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> canal

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
Minecraft so you're gonna have a canal

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.009 
Minecraft so you're gonna have a canal
up<00:03:12.390> one<00:03:12.750> two<00:03:13.350> three<00:03:14.070> four<00:03:14.670> five<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.720> then

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
up one two three four five and then

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.990 
up one two three four five and then
you're<00:03:16.140> just<00:03:16.290> going<00:03:16.470> to<00:03:16.680> run<00:03:17.040> water<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:17.820> so

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
you're just going to run water in it so

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.850 
you're just going to run water in it so
why<00:03:18.900> this<00:03:18.959> time<00:03:19.320> this<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:19.620> should<00:03:19.800> be

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
why this time this this should be

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.530 
why this time this this should be
exactly<00:03:20.489> what<00:03:20.730> you<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:20.970> keep<00:03:21.180> in<00:03:21.239> mind<00:03:21.420> these

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
exactly what you have keep in mind these

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.590 
exactly what you have keep in mind these
are<00:03:21.600> sticky<00:03:22.110> pistons<00:03:22.500> and<00:03:22.590> then<00:03:23.070> very<00:03:24.000> simply

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
are sticky pistons and then very simply

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.540 
are sticky pistons and then very simply
let's<00:03:25.260> go<00:03:25.410> ahead<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.620> put<00:03:25.739> our<00:03:25.769> map<00:03:26.070> up<00:03:26.340> let's

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
let's go ahead and put our map up let's

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.850 
let's go ahead and put our map up let's
grab<00:03:26.760> our<00:03:26.820> PC<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.360> oak<00:03:28.050> wood<00:03:28.080> and<00:03:28.680> you're<00:03:28.739> just

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
grab our PC of oak wood and you're just

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.080 
grab our PC of oak wood and you're just
gonna<00:03:29.040> place<00:03:29.280> a<00:03:29.310> piece<00:03:29.580> of<00:03:29.730> wood<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.030> it

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
gonna place a piece of wood here it

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.750 
gonna place a piece of wood here it
doesn't<00:03:30.239> have<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.630> be<00:03:30.720> oak<00:03:30.900> wood<00:03:31.140> but<00:03:31.830> consider

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
doesn't have to be oak wood but consider

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.370 
doesn't have to be oak wood but consider
it's<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:32.970> most<00:03:33.209> abundant<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.840> most<00:03:34.140> cases

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
it's the most abundant in most cases

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.960 
it's the most abundant in most cases
just<00:03:34.680> go<00:03:35.040> ahead<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.250> put<00:03:35.370> a<00:03:35.400> piece<00:03:35.580> of<00:03:35.610> oak

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
just go ahead and put a piece of oak

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.759 
just go ahead and put a piece of oak
wood<00:03:36.000> there<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:36.570> then<00:03:36.690> put<00:03:36.930> a<00:03:36.959> redstone<00:03:37.320> torch

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
wood there and then put a redstone torch

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.190 
wood there and then put a redstone torch
on<00:03:37.890> top<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:38.280> it<00:03:38.370> will<00:03:38.459> immediately<00:03:38.880> turn<00:03:39.810> into

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
on top and it will immediately turn into

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.560 
on top and it will immediately turn into
this<00:03:40.380> glitched<00:03:40.739> block<00:03:41.070> and<00:03:41.850> now<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.030> actually

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
this glitched block and now to actually

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.180 
this glitched block and now to actually
mind<00:03:42.840> this<00:03:43.019> you're<00:03:43.170> gonna<00:03:43.290> want<00:03:43.530> to<00:03:43.680> hop<00:03:43.890> into

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
mind this you're gonna want to hop into

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.699 
mind this you're gonna want to hop into
survival<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.480> actually<00:03:46.140> cut<00:03:46.320> it<00:03:46.410> down<00:03:46.500> just

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
survival and actually cut it down just

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.590 
survival and actually cut it down just
like<00:03:46.799> you<00:03:46.920> would<00:03:47.070> a<00:03:47.100> normal<00:03:47.190> piece<00:03:47.670> of<00:03:47.910> wood

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
like you would a normal piece of wood

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.600 
like you would a normal piece of wood
you're<00:03:48.959> gonna<00:03:49.080> hit<00:03:49.290> it<00:03:49.350> with<00:03:49.560> an<00:03:49.680> axe<00:03:49.709> or<00:03:50.190> even

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
you're gonna hit it with an axe or even

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.650 
you're gonna hit it with an axe or even
if<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.150> can<00:03:51.299> break<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.570> with

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
if you want to you can break it with

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.170 
if you want to you can break it with
your<00:03:51.780> hands<00:03:52.110> or<00:03:52.170> even<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.799> whatever<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.820> you

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
your hands or even just whatever but you

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.640 
your hands or even just whatever but you
have<00:03:54.330> to<00:03:54.450> be<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.630> survival<00:03:54.900> or<00:03:55.170> else<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.530> would

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
have to be in survival or else it would

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.740 
have to be in survival or else it would
just<00:03:55.920> simply<00:03:56.070> disappear<00:03:56.700> just<00:03:56.730> like<00:03:56.910> that<00:03:57.030> so

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
just simply disappear just like that so

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.430 
just simply disappear just like that so
go<00:03:58.019> into<00:03:58.170> survival<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.980> mind<00:03:59.640> this<00:03:59.910> and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
go into survival and mind this and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.449 
go into survival and mind this and
actually<00:04:01.440> most<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.799> you<00:04:01.890> guys<00:04:01.950> I'm<00:04:02.130> assuming

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
actually most of you guys I'm assuming

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:03.800 
actually most of you guys I'm assuming
will<00:04:02.580> already<00:04:02.790> be<00:04:02.910> in<00:04:03.120> survival<00:04:03.420> whenever

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
will already be in survival whenever

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.660 
will already be in survival whenever
you're<00:04:03.900> playing<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.290> but<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:05.250> you<00:04:05.459> want<00:04:05.610> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
you're playing this but if you want to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.460 
you're playing this but if you want to
mine<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:05.970> go<00:04:06.060> into<00:04:06.209> creative<00:04:06.690> and<00:04:06.900> mine<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.380> and

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
mine it go into creative and mine it and

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.600 
mine it go into creative and mine it and
then<00:04:07.680> you<00:04:07.769> will<00:04:07.920> be<00:04:08.010> able<00:04:08.100> to<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.430> this

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
then you will be able to have this

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.670 
then you will be able to have this
awesome<00:04:09.450> freaking<00:04:09.900> awesome<00:04:10.110> thing<00:04:10.530> right

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
awesome freaking awesome thing right

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.870 
awesome freaking awesome thing right
here<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:11.010> can<00:04:11.160> make<00:04:11.310> this<00:04:11.489> literally

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
here and you can make this literally

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.930 
here and you can make this literally
however<00:04:12.480> big<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:12.959> want<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:14.010> don't<00:04:14.580> see<00:04:14.730> any

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
however big you want I don't see any

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.270 
however big you want I don't see any
lagging<00:04:15.330> issues<00:04:15.930> with<00:04:16.109> this<00:04:16.260> so<00:04:16.410> I'm<00:04:16.530> assuming

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
lagging issues with this so I'm assuming

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.250 
lagging issues with this so I'm assuming
you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.700> make<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.570> however<00:04:18.690> big<00:04:19.140> you

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
you can just make just however big you

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.560 
you can just make just however big you
want<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.709> also<00:04:20.070> keep<00:04:20.520> in<00:04:20.609> mind<00:04:20.669> if<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.270> place

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
want and also keep in mind if you place

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.020 
want and also keep in mind if you place
it<00:04:21.810> above<00:04:22.200> something<00:04:22.530> let's<00:04:22.800> say

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
it above something let's say

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.740 
it above something let's say
this<00:04:24.210> piece<00:04:24.390> of<00:04:24.540> grass<00:04:24.720> will<00:04:25.700> like<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:26.940> it'll

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
this piece of grass will like this it'll

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.030 
this piece of grass will like this it'll
find<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.260> nearest<00:04:28.910> block<00:04:29.910> so<00:04:30.420> right<00:04:30.630> here<00:04:31.040> it

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
find the nearest block so right here it

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.770 
find the nearest block so right here it
finds<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.640> grass<00:04:32.880> because<00:04:33.240> there's<00:04:33.420> space

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
finds this grass because there's space

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.270 
finds this grass because there's space
right<00:04:34.050> here<00:04:34.260> but<00:04:34.680> if<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.860> were<00:04:34.950> to<00:04:35.040> put<00:04:35.190> it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
right here but if you were to put it

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.090 
right here but if you were to put it
right<00:04:35.370> here<00:04:35.730> it<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.210> look<00:04:36.450> down<00:04:36.690> for<00:04:37.100> the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
right here it will look down for the

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.010 
right here it will look down for the
nearest<00:04:38.400> blocks<00:04:38.790> or<00:04:38.940> whatever<00:04:39.150> so<00:04:39.450> hope<00:04:39.900> you

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
nearest blocks or whatever so hope you

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.080 
nearest blocks or whatever so hope you
