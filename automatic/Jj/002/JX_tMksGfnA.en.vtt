will<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.660> doing<00:00:48.930> it

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.300 

okay<00:01:19.840> now<00:01:20.840> I<00:01:20.900> tried<00:01:21.259> to<00:01:21.470> luncheon<00:01:21.860> I<00:01:22.100> was

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
okay now I tried to luncheon I was

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.280 
okay now I tried to luncheon I was
trying<00:01:22.520> to<00:01:22.549> watch<00:01:22.729> it<00:01:22.759> on<00:01:23.150> top<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.360> that's<00:01:23.750> but

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
trying to watch it on top of that's but

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.620 
trying to watch it on top of that's but
he<00:01:25.280> doesn't<00:01:25.670> have<00:01:25.759> matched<00:01:25.970> by<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.299> rubber

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
he doesn't have matched by the rubber

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.270 
he doesn't have matched by the rubber
because<00:01:26.899> the<00:01:27.080> rubber<00:01:27.290> is<00:01:27.470> strong<00:01:27.799> and<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.159> can

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
because the rubber is strong and it can

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.590 
because the rubber is strong and it can
maybe<00:01:28.460> deflect<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.390> best<00:01:29.689> thing<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.450> don't
