00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.950
 hello al marri credit media 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.940
 we will do today 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.879
 two things with the year 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.920
 cuckoo coconut tai chi 7 m 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.859
 very special coconut is white 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.660
 buy it in Asian stores 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.140
 they cost me they cost me 90 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.520
 coin centimes to buy them check 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.259
 they are very white especially not 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.230
 brown below because in this case 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:36.190
 there you but not buy it so for 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.710
 open it first you have to remove a 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.180
 part of the party finally a little bit 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:47.070
 of the white part that is here 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:50.879
 so for that in France we have a big knife 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.960
 is actually walking his arm muscles 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.089
 here we do in tickets until 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.420
 we can see the brown part of 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:57.420
 above 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:08.560
 here and after he'll have to cut the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:13.180
 up to seven months of rest and for that we 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.100
 see the man will put her to sleep 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.430
 little not quite and we give a 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.730
 rap and finally beheaded the 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.730
 coconut 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:36.659
 so here I feel that she is the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.479
 on and off here so now 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.429
 she is open and in she is 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.429
 filled with a liquid that is kg of coconut 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.729
 and delicious so I pour it into my 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.469
 dish I always put a colander because 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.729
 that I sometimes look at it is small 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.469
 piece of wood like that because 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.960
 I had wood left, so you have to 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.950
 that if we do not drink it we must always 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.319
 the snack that is to say that the other 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.209
 wrathful delicious but she's not 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.079
 always edible so olharan the 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:07.500
 drop is very very good though 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.590
 I have a little red if she is not 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.349
 limpid in this case where you have it 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.450
 said to prefer not to drink it at all 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.040
 after the part of ten zanaco eyes 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:23.549
 it's called the flesh of 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:24.780
 Coconut mode that is here and we go there 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.450
 is a little coconut water that has 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.389
 spread my language very little 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.130
 so here they do with a spatula 

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:34.109
 we remove the game so we do not 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.140
 can be a little hard we remove the part 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:40.190
 white who in the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:46.180
 here I take my spatulas to and play it 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.180
 school is surrounded 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.760
 it comes off more or less well 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.520
 really depends also on the coconut 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:02.819
 you had the coconut flesh that was 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.930
 find there and must be very white 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.400
 well white I come white then 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.280
 sometimes small sailing pieces that 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.890
 rest 2 Corsican you really need them 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.890
 also remove that and 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:27.010
 this is coconut fashion is absolutely 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:32.550
 delicious like that you can do it 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.650
 little thongs like that you 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.640
 put in your salad 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.760
 So you have to know that the coconut 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.300
 it's a food to gr so it will be the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.820
 part thanks for your salad and then if 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:50.830
 you want otherwise it's very 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.360
 very good, that is to say that the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.240
 difference with our cocoon seats we 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.680
 buy a sequel to this one has more than 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.990
 taste is supple she is really 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.210
 really this other thing you have it 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.820
 tasted once because it is and then 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.310
 otherwise you mix the coconut of a 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.780
 or coconut with for example 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.060
 blueberries 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.830
 in this case you take the walnut 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.170
 coconut is the fruit though if you 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.860
 want to worry you take a little 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.100
