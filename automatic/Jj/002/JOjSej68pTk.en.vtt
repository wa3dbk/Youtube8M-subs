in my backyard still and I got a real
faint<00:05:27.099> signal<00:05:27.520> I<00:05:27.729> haven't<00:05:28.479> even<00:05:28.599> found<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.990> yet

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
faint signal I haven't even found it yet

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:36.390 
faint signal I haven't even found it yet
it<00:05:30.159> was<00:05:30.280> showing<00:05:30.430> up<00:05:30.580> in<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.759> 70s<00:05:31.180> and<00:05:35.250> dug<00:05:36.250> up

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
it was showing up in the 70s and dug up

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:42.659 
it was showing up in the 70s and dug up
a<00:05:36.520> fuse<00:05:37.710> and<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:40.300> got<00:05:41.229> a<00:05:41.259> marble<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.919> the<00:05:42.490> hole

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
a fuse and I got a marble in the hole

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:53.850 
a fuse and I got a marble in the hole
there<00:05:45.900> nice<00:05:47.490> lots<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.639> marbles<00:05:48.970> out<00:05:49.060> here

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.309 

I<00:05:53.979> think<00:05:54.699> that's<00:05:54.879> all<00:05:56.039> we'll<00:05:57.039> see<00:05:57.340> what<00:05:57.460> we<00:05:57.550> got

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
I think that's all we'll see what we got

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:04.700 
I think that's all we'll see what we got
I'm<00:05:59.319> into<00:05:59.590> something

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.570 

I<00:06:04.800> thought<00:06:05.580> that<00:06:05.640> was<00:06:05.790> Marlo<00:06:06.240> but<00:06:06.390> it's<00:06:06.510> not

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
I thought that was Marlo but it's not

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.490 
I thought that was Marlo but it's not
that's<00:06:08.580> about<00:06:08.880> all<00:06:09.050> I'll<00:06:10.050> get<00:06:10.170> back<00:06:10.290> to<00:06:10.350> you

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
that's about all I'll get back to you

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.600 
that's about all I'll get back to you
when<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.650> finally<00:06:10.860> look<00:06:11.100> like<00:06:11.220> a<00:06:11.250> butter<00:06:11.520> knife

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
when I finally look like a butter knife

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.410 
when I finally look like a butter knife
here<00:06:12.440> you<00:06:13.440> don't<00:06:13.590> look<00:06:13.680> very<00:06:13.740> old<00:06:14.010> I<00:06:14.460> could

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
here you don't look very old I could

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.910 
here you don't look very old I could
have<00:06:15.510> dropped<00:06:15.690> it<00:06:15.900> but<00:06:16.020> I<00:06:16.200> don't<00:06:16.380> think<00:06:16.530> I<00:06:16.680> did

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
have dropped it but I don't think I did

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.120 
have dropped it but I don't think I did
it<00:06:17.640> looks<00:06:17.820> like<00:06:18.000> they<00:06:18.120> painted<00:06:18.720> it<00:06:18.780> green

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.470 

pretty<00:06:23.130> rusty<00:06:23.520> so<00:06:23.760> I<00:06:23.790> don't<00:06:23.940> think<00:06:24.120> I<00:06:24.210> dropped

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:24.480 
pretty rusty so I don't think I dropped

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.730 
pretty rusty so I don't think I dropped
that<00:06:25.670> it's<00:06:26.670> still<00:06:26.880> cool<00:06:27.030> fine<00:06:27.470> here<00:06:28.470> one

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 
that it's still cool fine here one

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:31.160 
that it's still cool fine here one

good<00:06:31.260> for<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.710> hunted<00:06:31.950> out<00:06:32.010> site<00:06:32.280> how's<00:06:32.670> my

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
good for that hunted out site how's my

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:37.130 
good for that hunted out site how's my
18th<00:06:33.240> time<00:06:33.450> they're<00:06:33.690> not<00:06:34.760> a<00:06:35.760> spoon<00:06:36.090> moves<00:06:37.050> in

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
18th time they're not a spoon moves in

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.610 
18th time they're not a spoon moves in
between<00:06:37.380> two<00:06:37.530> trees<00:06:37.740> that's<00:06:38.400> why<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.580> missed<00:06:38.820> it

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:39.620
