00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.339
 Well, just all these are my 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:09.200
 firecrackers for Christmas 2013-2014 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:13.460
 for subscribers how everything goes in total 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:17.650
 76 euros with 50 was enough for me and we have 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.650
 I will explain it from the smallest 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.650
 but of the smallest there is 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:31.520
 or pretty good very cheap by the way 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.670
 that's why I buy less every year 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.460
 then we go to the us come 14 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.440
 in a box 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.840
 one figure minus the ice creams normally 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.680
 it is very small 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.950
 compare it here with my very small hand 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.890
 a lot of tail 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.560
 quite comfortable and good, despite 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.350
 be small enough 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:01.359
 then the 64 have 20 minutes 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:04.070
 what you do what you turn on sparks 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.140
 and then it exploits a little less than 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.790
 the other one is pretty good 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.790
 then it starts 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.670
 the box is a garbage and here is all 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.670
 bent is fatal 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.630
 you do not understand 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.370
 big enough that you turn it on 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.140
 until the end 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.370
 pulls out as a kind of suit as if 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.880
 it was a source and then it explodes 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.050
 pretty strong I like them a lot if I do not 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.440
 out of the box that they dug 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.440
 quite 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.649
 after his older brother 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.380
 the atomic 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.070
 instead of taking off as a kind of 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.950
 traca pulls out a red light and then they explode 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.380
 similar to the car that could 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.590
 say that it is much better 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.719
 I love come 10 in a box 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.350
 instead of taking out a green yolk like 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.350
 they said the atomic 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.750
 pull out a green flame 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:18.220
 that is if you have a green flame and 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.220
 it explodes very very strongly exaggerated a lot 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.099
 after 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.120
 look at this is a terminator 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.640
 which are very expensive, the truth is that they are 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.900
 very expensive in each box come 10 and these 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.940
 they are some valencianes 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.930
 it's the same market 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.930
 although the difference 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.710
 valencia- net 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 and I finish 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:55.400
 now we are going to look at the box of the 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:58.280
 terminillo because he is looking at it 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.269
 around here behind you see good 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 valencians 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.549
 terminator tell you it's the same 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:07.870
 firecracker but also in the terminator 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:10.760
 more expensive than the valencianistas 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.690
 then the little bullets but 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.970
 thugs 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.650
 this is very kid has no tail 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:20.170
 because it's supposed to be like a bullet 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.840
 they're pretty good pulls yesterday one and you 're 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.030
 fairly good 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.530
 the bad thing is that it comes in four in one 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.099
 everyone is caught we see as they like 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.550
 much has three liters of meter 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.640
 but the flames 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.680
 pretty good big but big that's 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:42.170
 what make us think because in 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.210
 you just take the paper off 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.680
 that I just took the paper from him I do not know anything 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:50.500
 plus 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.500
 if something changes completely 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.790
 completely 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:05.080
 then 18 behind 20 Americans 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.650
 very cheap for three euros eighteen 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.799
 topics after two flares that have 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.799
 given 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:17.940
 four goals that we need to specify the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.940
 favorites i will say 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.270
 it's pretty big, very big, what 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.450
 what I like the most is the mixture that is 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.550
 brutal to compare the wick in my body is 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.060
 that explain that the goal to see is 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.260
 that does not bend 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.500
 ok but this I 'm going to leave here 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:45.500
 after supposedly fatter than 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:50.690
 they explode more than the cat 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:52.130
 very very very fat very fat does not seem 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.630
 but now we put it next to the 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.660
 Valencian prophets that is already on board 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.360
 in and of itself and is that look is that is the 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.930
 double is a man that you do not believe 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.860
 that the sound or change a lot because to me 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.690
 I really like to interpret 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.020
 Valencian has it counting from the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.020
 first year 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.750
 he has only thrown one 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:17.400
 let's see if it convinces me so much that the 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:22.140
 Valencia could say that 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:26.010
 impute the favorites and in total I have 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:27.330
 said I spent 76 euros with 50 and me 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.710
 I think it's pretty good price 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:32.080
 for everything they buy me 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:36.250
 if they complain about a schubert massacre 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.680
 very cheap in total 37 euros for 12 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.260
 boxes because this drop in this cable 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.920
 as the party needed another box and 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.920
 Well I hope you liked it and goodbye
