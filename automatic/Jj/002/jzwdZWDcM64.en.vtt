or<00:00:16.720> garry's<00:00:17.109> mod<00:00:17.189> both<00:00:18.189> have<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.640> exact<00:00:18.970> same

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
or garry's mod both have the exact same

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.109 
or garry's mod both have the exact same
concept<00:00:19.869> so<00:00:20.140> hopefully<00:00:21.099> guys<00:00:21.220> are<00:00:21.460> ready<00:00:21.640> to

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
concept so hopefully guys are ready to

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.960 
concept so hopefully guys are ready to
be<00:00:22.659> helped<00:00:22.960> because<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:24.460> guys<00:00:24.609> might<00:00:24.939> think

be helped because you guys might think
be<00:00:25.449> hopping<00:00:25.839> is<00:00:25.960> very<00:00:26.199> very<00:00:26.409> difficult<00:00:26.730> but

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
be hopping is very very difficult but

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.630 
be hopping is very very difficult but
guess<00:00:27.909> what<00:00:28.119> its<00:00:28.329> most<00:00:28.569> easiest<00:00:29.019> thing<00:00:29.640> people

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
guess what its most easiest thing people

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.050 
guess what its most easiest thing people
just<00:00:30.909> get<00:00:31.539> confused<00:00:32.110> and<00:00:32.940> hopefully<00:00:33.940> I<00:00:34.000> can

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
just get confused and hopefully I can

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.770 
just get confused and hopefully I can

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
recommendation by the way it's not

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:47.939 
recommendation by the way it's not
required<00:00:43.030> but<00:00:43.420> recommended<00:00:43.690> by<00:00:44.620> me<00:00:46.859> so<00:00:47.859> you

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
required but recommended by me so you

wheel my sound very very weird you can

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.919 
wheel my sound very very weird you can
change<00:00:53.350> it<00:00:53.469> back<00:00:53.620> anyways<00:00:54.280> so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.780> you're

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
change it back anyways so if you're

change it back anyways so if you're
playing<00:00:56.170> on<00:00:56.289> garry's<00:00:56.589> mod<00:00:56.649> change<00:00:57.100> to<00:00:57.280> mouse

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
playing on garry's mod change to mouse

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.860 
playing on garry's mod change to mouse
wheel<00:00:57.699> if<00:00:57.789> you're<00:00:57.879> playing<00:00:57.999> CS<00:00:58.329> go<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.780> the

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
wheel if you're playing CS go to the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.610 
wheel if you're playing CS go to the
same<00:00:59.100> but<00:01:00.239> what<00:01:01.239> this<00:01:01.390> will<00:01:01.570> do<00:01:01.780> it<00:01:02.199> will<00:01:02.379> fill

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
same but what this will do it will fill

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.540 
same but what this will do it will fill
a<00:01:02.649> lot<00:01:03.039> more<00:01:03.420> smoother<00:01:04.420> because<00:01:04.690> yet<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.830> put

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
a lot more smoother because yet the put

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.120 
a lot more smoother because yet the put
your<00:01:06.730> hand<00:01:06.880> in<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:07.000> weird<00:01:07.180> position<00:01:07.710> but<00:01:08.710> you

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
your hand in a weird position but you

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.830 
your hand in a weird position but you
only<00:01:09.250> need<00:01:09.430> to<00:01:09.700> use<00:01:09.730> your<00:01:10.060> left<00:01:10.270> hand<00:01:10.390> for<00:01:10.810> a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
only need to use your left hand for a

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.810 
only need to use your left hand for a
and<00:01:11.140> d<00:01:11.320> it's<00:01:11.860> all<00:01:12.010> you<00:01:12.100> have<00:01:12.220> to<00:01:12.340> do<00:01:12.460> for<00:01:12.670> be

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
and d it's all you have to do for be

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.230 
and d it's all you have to do for be
hopping<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:13.930> D<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.400> W<00:01:15.400> at<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.580> start<00:01:15.850> to

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
hopping a and D and W at the start to

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
hopping a and D and W at the start to
get<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> boost<00:01:16.660> so<00:01:17.320> you<00:01:17.410> can<00:01:17.530> gain<00:01:18.210> acceleration

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260 
get a boost so you can gain acceleration

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.660 
get a boost so you can gain acceleration
but<00:01:20.520> again<00:01:21.520> off<00:01:21.640> topic<00:01:22.410> because<00:01:23.460> it's<00:01:24.460> going

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
but again off topic because it's going

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.190 
but again off topic because it's going
to<00:01:24.730> feel<00:01:24.910> a<00:01:24.940> lot<00:01:25.210> more<00:01:25.240> better<00:01:25.570> if<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:25.960> change

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
to feel a lot more better if you change

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.990 
to feel a lot more better if you change
it<00:01:26.320> to<00:01:26.380> mouse<00:01:26.530> wheel<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:27.010> you'll<00:01:27.280> feel<00:01:27.670> like

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
it to mouse wheel and you'll feel like

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.850 
it to mouse wheel and you'll feel like
you<00:01:28.150> have<00:01:28.270> more<00:01:28.540> control<00:01:28.750> with<00:01:29.500> your<00:01:29.680> mouse

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
you have more control with your mouse

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.520 
you have more control with your mouse
wheel<00:01:29.890> then<00:01:30.460> your<00:01:30.760> jump<00:01:31.330> key<00:01:31.510> so<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:32.170> recommend

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
wheel then your jump key so I recommend

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.340 
wheel then your jump key so I recommend
that<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.310> first<00:01:33.670> off<00:01:33.910> on<00:01:34.150> how<00:01:34.330> you<00:01:34.390> be<00:01:34.750> hop<00:01:34.960> so

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
that so first off on how you be hop so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.750 
that so first off on how you be hop so
what<00:01:35.590> you<00:01:35.740> want<00:01:35.920> to<00:01:36.010> do<00:01:36.160> you<00:01:36.280> wanna<00:01:36.430> find<00:01:36.610> a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
what you want to do you wanna find a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.150 
what you want to do you wanna find a
server<00:01:37.060> which<00:01:37.330> you<00:01:37.360> can<00:01:37.570> be<00:01:37.750> hop<00:01:37.930> in

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
server which you can be hop in

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.740 
server which you can be hop in
especially<00:01:39.160> csgo<00:01:39.730> ones<00:01:40.000> because<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.480> cannot

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
especially csgo ones because you cannot

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.230 
especially csgo ones because you cannot
be<00:01:40.990> hop<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.680> private<00:01:42.010> server<00:01:42.190> besides<00:01:42.790> using

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
be hop in a private server besides using

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.600 
be hop in a private server besides using
some<00:01:43.540> commands<00:01:44.020> but<00:01:44.350> go<00:01:44.710> find<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.980> server<00:01:45.220> which

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
some commands but go find a server which

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.120 
some commands but go find a server which
has<00:01:45.820> an<00:01:46.150> auto<00:01:46.510> hop<00:01:46.870> which<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.650> going<00:01:47.920> to<00:01:48.040> allow

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
has an auto hop which is going to allow

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.890 
has an auto hop which is going to allow
you<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.490> jump<00:01:48.880> several<00:01:49.450> times<00:01:49.690> without

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
you to jump several times without

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.830 
you to jump several times without
pressing<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:50.950> it'll<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.490> continuously<00:01:52.120> jump

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
pressing it it'll just continuously jump

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.780 
pressing it it'll just continuously jump
you<00:01:53.230> hold<00:01:53.440> down<00:01:53.560> the<00:01:53.800> jump<00:01:54.040> key<00:01:54.220> so<00:01:54.580> for

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
you hold down the jump key so for

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.180 
you hold down the jump key so for
example<00:01:54.850> if<00:01:55.330> you're<00:01:55.540> if<00:01:55.990> it's<00:01:56.200> a<00:01:56.410> spacebar

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
example if you're if it's a spacebar

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.950 
example if you're if it's a spacebar
these<00:01:57.520> hold<00:01:57.850> it<00:01:57.970> down<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.300> jumps<00:01:58.540> for<00:01:58.720> you<00:01:58.810> it's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
these hold it down it jumps for you it's

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.290 
these hold it down it jumps for you it's
probando<00:01:59.530> be<00:01:59.710> up<00:01:59.890> means<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.310> go<00:02:01.060> on<00:02:01.180> the

probando be up means and go on the

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
the two games that listed so if you guys

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.449 
the two games that listed so if you guys

still<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.560> understand<00:03:02.950> there's<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.459> very<00:03:03.760> very

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
still to understand there's a very very

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.449 
still to understand there's a very very
basic<00:03:04.420> way<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.629> game<00:03:04.930> speed<00:03:05.170> all<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.040> do<00:03:06.250> is

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
basic way to game speed all you do is

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.150 
basic way to game speed all you do is
hold<00:03:07.420> down<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.780> your<00:03:08.349> spacebar<00:03:08.650> or<00:03:08.890> mouse

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
hold down this your spacebar or mouse

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.800 
hold down this your spacebar or mouse
wheel<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.790> look<00:03:09.970> to<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> certain

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
wheel and you look to a certain

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.539 
wheel and you look to a certain
direction<00:03:10.930> like<00:03:11.379> right<00:03:11.680> for<00:03:11.980> example<00:03:12.370> and

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
direction like right for example and

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.369 
direction like right for example and
hold<00:03:12.670> down<00:03:12.760> d<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.209> you<00:03:13.450> keep<00:03:13.629> turning<00:03:13.930> your

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:14.379 
hold down d and you keep turning your

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.380 
hold down d and you keep turning your
mouse<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.099> right<00:03:15.190> so<00:03:15.670> therefore<00:03:16.150> you're

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
mouse to the right so therefore you're

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.880 
mouse to the right so therefore you're
going<00:03:16.629> to<00:03:16.690> getting<00:03:16.870> speed<00:03:17.200> from<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.590> but

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
going to getting speed from that but

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.009 
going to getting speed from that but
you're<00:03:18.010> not<00:03:18.099> using<00:03:18.340> the<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.940> button<00:03:19.329> which<00:03:19.900> is

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
you're not using the a button which is

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.599 
you're not using the a button which is
going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.230> allow<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.470> to<00:03:20.680> any<00:03:20.920> more<00:03:21.160> speed<00:03:21.430> and

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
going to allow you to any more speed and

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.300 
going to allow you to any more speed and
go<00:03:21.940> forward<00:03:22.359> most<00:03:23.019> people<00:03:23.290> think<00:03:23.560> that<00:03:23.919> you

obstacles because I'm trying to land on

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.180 
obstacles because I'm trying to land on
it<00:04:27.640> precisely<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:29.440> still<00:04:29.740> Kings<00:04:29.950> to<00:04:30.099> be

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
it precisely and but still Kings to be

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.110

the<00:04:30.280> same<00:04:30.490> time

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
the same time

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.510 
the same time
that's<00:04:31.270> what<00:04:32.169> you<00:04:32.320> call<00:04:32.500> strating<00:04:33.130> which

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:33.520 
that's what you call strating which

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.659 
that's what you call strating which
strafing<00:04:34.180> which<00:04:34.510> allow<00:04:34.870> you<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:35.169> move<00:04:36.130> or<00:04:36.610> jump

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
strafing which allow you to move or jump

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.300 
strafing which allow you to move or jump
farther<00:04:37.479> in<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.169> distance<00:04:38.680> than<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.100> can

farther in a distance than you can

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.670 
farther in a distance than you can
whichever<00:04:39.669> can<00:04:40.000> and<00:04:40.270> that's<00:04:40.930> all<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.530> to

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
whichever can and that's all you have to

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.010 
whichever can and that's all you have to
be<00:04:41.800> up<00:04:42.010> it's<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:43.210> ruin<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:43.479> the<00:04:43.540> basics

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020
