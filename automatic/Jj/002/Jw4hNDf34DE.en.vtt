camera with an LED flash let's check out
the<00:00:27.660> body<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> design<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:29.460> actually<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> very

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the body in design it is actually a very

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.310 
the body in design it is actually a very
big<00:00:30.240> device<00:00:30.779> if<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.250> 5.5<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.279> 720p<00:00:33.059> display

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.750 
but to be very honest it's one of the
slimmest<00:00:36.570> device<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> we've<00:00:37.290> seen<00:00:37.760> even

round power button the volume control

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.439 
round power button the volume control
they<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.370> also<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> camera

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
they have also are going to camera

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.340 
they have also are going to camera
shutter<00:01:03.750> key<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:05.939> can't<00:01:06.210> see<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.869> they

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
shutter key and you can't see but they

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.190 
shutter key and you can't see but they
have<00:01:07.380> cleverly<00:01:08.280> put<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.760> flap<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
have cleverly put this flap for you to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.859 
have cleverly put this flap for you to
put<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.010> SIM<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.390> has<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:13.530> tray<00:01:14.220> inside<00:01:14.869> two

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
put the SIM so it has a tray inside two

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.289 
put the SIM so it has a tray inside two
micro<00:01:16.650> SIM<00:01:16.860> slots<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.549> yes<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.850> is<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> dual

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
micro SIM slots so yes this is a dual

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.719 
micro SIM slots so yes this is a dual
SIM<00:01:18.659> device<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> overall<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
SIM device so overall I think it's a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.580 
SIM device so overall I think it's a
very<00:01:21.030> good<00:01:21.330> looking<00:01:21.630> device<00:01:21.780> even<00:01:22.320> though

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
very good looking device even though

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.310 
very good looking device even though
it's<00:01:22.740> quite<00:01:23.280> big<00:01:23.610> there's<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.689> micro<00:01:25.110> SD

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
it's quite big there's also a micro SD

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.830 
it's quite big there's also a micro SD
card<00:01:25.560> expansion<00:01:26.189> that's<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.030> micro<00:01:27.360> USB<00:01:27.390> port

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
card expansion that's the micro USB port

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.240 
card expansion that's the micro USB port
on<00:01:28.560> top<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:29.880> only<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> 3.5<00:01:30.780> mm<00:01:30.990> jack

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
on top but there's only the 3.5 mm jack

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
on top but there's only the 3.5 mm jack
you<00:01:32.250> cannot<00:01:32.820> remove<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.540> back<00:01:33.750> panel<00:01:33.960> so<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
you cannot remove the back panel so it

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.730 
you cannot remove the back panel so it
is<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.070> unibody<00:01:35.640> design<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
is a unibody design but I think it is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.890 
is a unibody design but I think it is
very<00:01:38.189> done<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:38.850> even<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.329> plastics

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
very done you know even the plastics

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.840 
very done you know even the plastics
they<00:01:40.079> don't<00:01:40.290> look<00:01:40.470> all<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:41.189> know<00:01:41.310> cheap

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
they don't look all that you know cheap

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.170 
they don't look all that you know cheap
although<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.530> slightly<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:44.340> does<00:01:44.579> take<00:01:44.820> up<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
although it's slightly it does take up a

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
although it's slightly it does take up a
bit<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.990> things<00:01:46.649> onto<00:01:46.950> dirt<00:01:47.369> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
bit of you know it things onto dirt and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.950 
bit of you know it things onto dirt and
all<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.270> gets<00:01:48.479> a<00:01:48.600> little<00:01:48.720> bit<00:01:48.869> of

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
all that so it gets a little bit of

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.620 
all that so it gets a little bit of
dirty<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.130> think<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.460> design<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.030> good<00:01:51.299> and

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
dirty all I think the design is good and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
dirty all I think the design is good and
you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.020> it's<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.369> bad<00:01:53.729> something<00:01:54.450> is

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
you know it's not so bad something is

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.270 
you know it's not so bad something is
always<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.259> said<00:01:55.470> no<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.799> good<00:01:56.040> bit

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
always like I said no the good bit

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.969 
always like I said no the good bit
design<00:01:56.610> at<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> front<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.930> have<00:01:57.960> big<00:01:58.619> glass

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
design at the front you have big glass

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.639 
design at the front you have big glass
panels<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.579> with<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> 5.5<00:02:00.750> inch<00:02:00.780> 720p<00:02:01.259> display

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.280 
panels but with a 5.5 inch 720p display
it<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.729> you<00:02:03.090> know<00:02:03.210> crisper<00:02:03.750> although<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
it is you know crisper although the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.319 
it is you know crisper although the
pixel<00:02:04.710> density<00:02:04.890> goes<00:02:05.399> down<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:06.090> of<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
pixel density goes down because of the

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.540 
pixel density goes down because of the
large<00:02:06.540> size<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:07.500> still<00:02:07.829> looks<00:02:08.039> pretty<00:02:08.220> good

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
large size it still looks pretty good

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.660 
large size it still looks pretty good

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you know triluminos display technologies

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.920 
you know triluminos display technologies
which<00:02:14.040> do<00:02:14.340> boost<00:02:14.640> up<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.030> colors<00:02:15.360> as<00:02:15.630> well<00:02:15.780> as

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
which do boost up the colors as well as

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.890 
which do boost up the colors as well as
you<00:02:16.050> know<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> sharpness<00:02:16.620> on<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.250> display<00:02:17.900> if

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
you know the sharpness on on display if

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.470 
you know the sharpness on on display if
I<00:02:19.050> look<00:02:19.290> at<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> front<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.970> our<00:02:21.210> two

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
I look at the front you see our two

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.410 
I look at the front you see our two
slots<00:02:22.080> kind<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.740> thing<00:02:22.920> these<00:02:23.460> are<00:02:23.520> not<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
slots kind of a thing these are not the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.150 
slots kind of a thing these are not the
loud<00:02:24.600> speaker<00:02:25.050> or<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.380> stereo<00:02:25.860> speaker

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
loud speaker or the stereo speaker

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.130 
loud speaker or the stereo speaker
systems<00:02:26.520> apparently<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.990> the

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
systems apparently this is the

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.650 
systems apparently this is the
microphone<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> earpiece

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
microphone and this is the earpiece

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.330 
microphone and this is the earpiece
loudspeaker<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:31.200> at<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.530> back<00:02:31.740> so

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
loudspeaker is actually at the back so

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.950 
loudspeaker is actually at the back so
yes<00:02:32.550> if<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.360> you<00:02:33.480> know<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:33.930> a

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
yes if you think you know you get a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.980 
yes if you think you know you get a
stereo<00:02:34.730> speaker<00:02:35.730> experience<00:02:36.480> on<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.720> front

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
stereo speaker experience on the front

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.880 
stereo speaker experience on the front
it<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.230> not<00:02:37.710> that<00:02:37.950> there<00:02:38.820> is<00:02:39.000> a<00:02:39.030> small<00:02:39.390> LED

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
it is not that there is a small LED

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.160 
it is not that there is a small LED
indicator<00:02:40.890> over<00:02:41.100> here<00:02:41.280> plus<00:02:41.580> some<00:02:41.880> sensors<00:02:42.720> of

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
indicator over here plus some sensors of

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.230 
indicator over here plus some sensors of
course<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.010> said<00:02:44.040> there's<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.700> front<00:02:44.940> cam

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
course like I said there's the front cam

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.890 
course like I said there's the front cam
and<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.660> small<00:02:46.820> soft<00:02:47.820> LED<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.480> you<00:02:48.540> know<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
and a small soft LED so you know you can

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.980 
and a small soft LED so you know you can
take<00:02:49.080> good<00:02:49.610> selfies<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:51.510> overall<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.870> think

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
take good selfies so overall I think

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.520 
take good selfies so overall I think
fits<00:02:52.890> well<00:02:53.130> in<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.310> hand<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.240> very<00:02:55.050> slim

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
fits well in the hand it is very slim

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.110 
fits well in the hand it is very slim
like<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.040> said<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:57.210> big<00:02:58.170> size<00:02:58.460> not<00:02:59.460> be<00:02:59.700> not<00:02:59.880> you

these huge size devices but I think you

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.860 
these huge size devices but I think you
know<00:03:05.070> for<00:03:05.490> something<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:05.970> 20<00:03:06.420> something<00:03:06.690> in

know for something like 20 something in
a<00:03:06.930> 20<00:03:07.200> mm<00:03:07.770> budget<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.220> is<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.430> very

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
a 20 mm budget this is a very

cool-looking device the overall
dimensions<00:03:11.940> are<00:03:12.120> code<00:03:12.420> it's<00:03:12.660> slim<00:03:13.080> yes<00:03:13.770> you
