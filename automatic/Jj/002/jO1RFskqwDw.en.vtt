sometimes you know these animals can get

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.790 
sometimes you know these animals can get
fractures<00:02:52.510> like<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.720> stress<00:02:53.050> fracture<00:02:53.350> it

about it right away can this type of

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.620 
about it right away can this type of

treatment help with older injuries as
well<00:03:01.810> well<00:03:02.230> that's<00:03:02.410> a<00:03:02.470> good<00:03:02.590> question<00:03:02.650> in<00:03:03.190> fact

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310

well well that's a good question in fact
there<00:03:03.730> are<00:03:03.880> limitations<00:03:04.780> just<00:03:04.990> like<00:03:05.170> with<00:03:05.350> any

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
research or medical treatment so no it

research or medical treatment so no it
cannot<00:03:07.420> be<00:03:07.630> used<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> treat<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.170> fracture<00:03:08.560> and

cannot be used to treat a fracture and
it<00:03:09.010> really<00:03:09.250> needs<00:03:09.460> to<00:03:09.610> be<00:03:09.700> used<00:03:10.030> within<00:03:10.240> weeks

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
it really needs to be used within weeks

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.390 
it really needs to be used within weeks
of<00:03:10.900> an<00:03:11.080> injury<00:03:11.380> so<00:03:11.530> you<00:03:11.560> can't<00:03:11.860> come<00:03:12.010> back<00:03:12.040> a
