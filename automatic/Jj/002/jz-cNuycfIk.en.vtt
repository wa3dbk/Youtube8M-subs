 of pregnancy 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.990
 you deliver the baby the necessary items 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.380
 for its rapid growth and further 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.350
 development 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.010
 I would like to know what is now 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.770
 no matter there is something that is and so is not 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.480
 must be a dragon 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.230
 should not be hungry gap 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.300
 more than three hours we have 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.610
 5 6 percent of meals are obtained 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550
 must be present but also 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.930
 leave only make up the system of utilities 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.060
 food should be simple and helpful 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.070
 diet should go fruit vegetables low-fat 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.670
 varieties of meat fish dairy products 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240
 and Natalya Yuryevna how to avoid recruitment 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.650
 overweight 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.580
 weight gain can be 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.159
 due to the fact that we just 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.539
 usually caloric intake is needed here 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:34.689
 just reconsider your diet 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.179
 opportunity to refuse 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.799
 of some 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.030
 flour confectionery 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.330
 Products percentage is very important 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.570
 make sure that the second place is normal 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.260
 this is due to the fact that lingers 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.200
 the liquid of this situation can already 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.179
 to be dangerous 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.429
 in this case you need 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:54.429
 consult with your doctor 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.190
 forget to give birth dynamo for a while 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.819
 framework of black and pickled 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.050
 now it is bad and you go 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.560
 limit salt intake 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.290

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.619
 very important for your body 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.609
 first you need to know what 

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:12.070
 one and a half liters 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.679
 clean day 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.669
 the body just needs 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:18.429
 and if we will not enough water 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.599
 just years 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.749
 the process here may already be broken 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.379
 digestion that you will not cause problem 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.040
 approach should be next year write 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.049
 need to correctly giving up 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.519
 carbonated drinks and socks from 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.139
 boxes where a lot of sugar pass 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.999
 coffee from some teas is desirable 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.550
 drink between meals bottoms kick food 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.859
 water or do not drink with her assessment 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:46.019
 cold water 2 5 and not to break 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.329
 digestion if we have suspicion 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.489
 on what appeared grated 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.019
 arch of cases 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:54.519
 it's about recommends 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.689
 count how many excuses per day 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.989
 fluids and no fluids are released 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:01.999
 besides balanced 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.539
 nutrition you need vitamins now 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.999
 what exactly check with your doctor 

00:03:07.999 --> 00:03:09.059
 starting in the second half 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.999
 pregnancy is especially important 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.459
 becomes iron with its lack of 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.459
 pregnant may develop they have 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 low hemoglobin 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:21.539
 country hemoglobin level during 

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:24.559
 pregnancy verses are reduced this is due 

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:26.920
 with a decrease in circulating blood volume 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.770
 with what I saw being built on 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.660
 property italy 1 1 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:33.140
 lower limit of a pregnant 110 grams 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.159
 per liter 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.980
 but still think about 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.949
 they mini emerged anyway need that is 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:41.689
 that it should turn on the streets 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.219
 pregnant women first of all this one 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.069
 housing for us meat and not refuse meat 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.589
 do not refuse animal protein further 

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:51.900
 buckwheat porridge 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.639
 necessarily include posture percentage 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.199
 buckwheat 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.689
 a lot of iron but 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:03:59.559
 glasses 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:01.739
 besides british it helps 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.179
 digestibility of iron, respectively, not 

00:04:04.179 --> 00:04:05.669
 refuse small 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:06.919
 amounts of citrus on 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.170
 Orange juice 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.010
 and black currant Kiev is all this also 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.959
 we are favorably affected by the level 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.689
 hemoglobin in the blood 

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:17.229
 another important element of the coalition is it now 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.129
 really need your baby for 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.699
 bone formation 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.999
 they say that a woman is paid by the same court for 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.999
 every child but this can be avoided 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.009
 contains calcium dairy products 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:30.580
 therefore we recommend including 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.770
 in the diet two three times a week in iraq i am 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.830
 smoothie necessarily 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.220
 and speaking of career 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.370
 in the number of consumed dairy products 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.300
 thats for example 2 4os cancel ahmad ac 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.930
 Saadi with half the daily norm 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:44.680
 calcium 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.059
 That's not a lot 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:49.439
 I have them most accessible 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.419
 necessary to take dairy 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:54.009
 foods three months before birth 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:55.830
 baby when the baby to 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.989
 formed bones eat rises 

00:04:57.989 --> 00:05:00.199
 calcium need 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.370
 proper nutrition does not mean that 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.870
 you must refuse in everything 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.880
 if suddenly I really wanted something 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.029
 delicious 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:09.580
 pamper yourself 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.580
 pregnancy should be a joy 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.159
 the next series of forty weeks

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:23.869
