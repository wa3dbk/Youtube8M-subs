September<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> 11<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.740> know<00:00:16.800> myself<00:00:17.010> I've

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
September the 11 and I know myself I've

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.120 
September the 11 and I know myself I've
been<00:00:17.550> trying<00:00:17.850> out<00:00:18.000> some<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> new<00:00:19.130> options

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
been trying out some of the new options

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.130 
been trying out some of the new options
and<00:00:20.400> new<00:00:20.779> vehicles<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.960> were<00:00:22.050> available

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and new vehicles that were available

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.920 
and new vehicles that were available
with<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> expansion<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.970> trying<00:00:24.869> to

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
with the expansion and trying to

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.200 
with the expansion and trying to
familiarize<00:00:25.470> myself<00:00:25.859> with<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> new<00:00:26.490> maps<00:00:26.670> but

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
familiarize myself with the new maps but

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.429 
familiarize myself with the new maps but
one<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.480> vehicles<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.810> wanted<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.199> into

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
one of the vehicles I wanted to go into

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.620 
one of the vehicles I wanted to go into
depth<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.980> video<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> ac-130<00:00:30.330> or

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
depth with this video was the ac-130 or

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.720 
depth with this video was the ac-130 or
the<00:00:30.750> gunship<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.470> why<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.130> believe<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
the gunship and why I believe this is

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
the gunship and why I believe this is
probably<00:00:32.940> one<00:00:33.210> of<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> big<00:00:34.140> determining

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
probably one of the big determining

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.290 
probably one of the big determining
factors<00:00:35.130> in<00:00:35.280> controlling<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.880> battlefield

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
factors in controlling the battlefield

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.319 
factors in controlling the battlefield
in<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.480> game<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.890> I<00:00:37.890> believe<00:00:38.280> dice<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:38.790> logic

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
in the game and I believe dice is logic

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.420 
in the game and I believe dice is logic
behind<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.930> ac-130<00:00:40.559> was<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.010> keep<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
behind the ac-130 was to keep it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.840 
behind the ac-130 was to keep it
balanced<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.800> because<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> such<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> dominant

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
balanced so because it's such a dominant

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.700 
balanced so because it's such a dominant
vehicle<00:00:45.480> night<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.079> think<00:00:46.320> they<00:00:46.440> knew<00:00:46.680> that

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
vehicle night and I think they knew that

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.130 
vehicle night and I think they knew that
if<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.149> right<00:00:48.329> hands<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.870> you<00:00:48.989> have

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
if it's in the right hands if you have

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.840 
if it's in the right hands if you have
the<00:00:49.289> right<00:00:49.469> teammates<00:00:50.070> using<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the right teammates using and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.910 
the right teammates using and
controlling<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.840> gunship<00:00:52.230> you're<00:00:52.770> basically

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
controlling the gunship you're basically

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.590 
controlling the gunship you're basically
going<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.430> destroy<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.969> battlefield<00:00:54.510> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
going to destroy the battlefield in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.450 
going to destroy the battlefield in
general<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.199> they<00:00:55.289> did<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.309> order

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
general so what they did was to in order

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.069 
general so what they did was to in order
to<00:00:56.610> balance<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.600> keep<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:57.989> on

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
to balance that out was to keep it on

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
to balance that out was to keep it on
autopilot<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.010> out<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> players

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
autopilot so it's out of the players

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
autopilot so it's out of the players
hands<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.660> control<00:01:00.989> flying<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
hands of actually control flying the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.950 
hands of actually control flying the
vehicle<00:01:01.980> also<00:01:02.820> making<00:01:03.149> it<00:01:03.390> very<00:01:03.510> easy<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
vehicle also making it very easy to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.690 
vehicle also making it very easy to
destroy<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.799> keeping<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> weapon<00:01:05.580> damage

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
destroy and keeping the weapon damage

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.550 
destroy and keeping the weapon damage
and<00:01:06.119> blast<00:01:06.330> radius<00:01:06.570> low<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.380> can't

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and blast radius low so that you can't

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.140 
and blast radius low so that you can't
just<00:01:07.710> spam<00:01:07.950> an<00:01:08.070> area<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.400> destroy<00:01:08.729> everything

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
just spam an area and destroy everything

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
just spam an area and destroy everything
in<00:01:09.270> its<00:01:09.360> site<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.229> see<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.470> trying<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.710> do

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
in its site as you see me trying to do

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.890 
in its site as you see me trying to do
here<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> video<00:01:11.430> other<00:01:12.299> than<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.570> I

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
here in this video other than that I

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.300 
here in this video other than that I
still<00:01:13.260> feel<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.159> it's<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.400> very<00:01:14.990> great

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
still feel that it's a very great

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
still feel that it's a very great
vehicle<00:01:17.310> in<00:01:17.490> general<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.650> one<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
vehicle in general and one of the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.070 
vehicle in general and one of the
breakdowns<00:01:20.759> on<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> works<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> game

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
breakdowns on how it works in the game

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
breakdowns on how it works in the game
is<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> only<00:01:22.680> have<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.070> people<00:01:23.280> spawn<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
is you can only have two people spawn in

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.990 
is you can only have two people spawn in
it<00:01:24.380> at<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.470> times<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.130> once<00:01:26.460> two<00:01:26.640> people<00:01:26.909> are

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
it at all times so once two people are

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.670 
it at all times so once two people are
inside<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.720> vehicle<00:01:28.110> they're<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.409> ones<00:01:28.590> who

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
inside the vehicle they're the ones who

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.590 
inside the vehicle they're the ones who
can<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.159> control<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> guns<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
can actually control the guns or the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.640 
can actually control the guns or the
weaponry<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.990> comes<00:01:31.259> along<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:31.500> it

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
weaponry that comes along with it

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.710 
weaponry that comes along with it
everyone<00:01:32.579> else<00:01:32.729> who<00:01:32.880> spawns<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.509> after

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
everyone else who spawns on it after

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.719 
everyone else who spawns on it after
that<00:01:34.079> if<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.860> our<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> two<00:01:35.460> slots

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that if it's our if the two slots

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.120 
that if it's our if the two slots
already<00:01:36.000> taken<00:01:36.360> they<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.140> pair<00:01:37.470> drop<00:01:37.740> inside

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
already taken they just pair drop inside

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.980 
already taken they just pair drop inside
on<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> map<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:39.509> one<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> big

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
on the map and that's one of the big

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.139 
on the map and that's one of the big
things<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:42.240> makes<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> vehicle

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
things that I think makes the vehicle

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
things that I think makes the vehicle
very<00:01:45.149> effective<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
very effective is that you can have it

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.310 
very effective is that you can have it
and<00:01:46.740> use<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.520> an<00:01:47.700> extra<00:01:48.000> spawn<00:01:48.270> point<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
and use it as an extra spawn point the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.950 
and use it as an extra spawn point the
other<00:01:49.439> thing<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:50.090> knowing<00:01:51.090> how<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.570> take

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
other thing is knowing how to take

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.060 
other thing is knowing how to take
control<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:52.799> you're<00:01:52.920> playing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
control of it now if you're playing

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.510 
control of it now if you're playing
conquest<00:01:54.049> there's<00:01:55.049> certain<00:01:55.320> maps<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:56.219> certain

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
conquest there's certain maps or certain

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.399 
conquest there's certain maps or certain
flags<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.210> on<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> map<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.899> it's<00:01:58.320> only

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
flags that are on the map and it's only

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.069 
flags that are on the map and it's only
one<00:01:58.680> flag<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.460> each<00:01:59.579> map<00:01:59.850> has<00:02:00.090> one<00:02:00.540> particular

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
one flag but each map has one particular

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.990 
one flag but each map has one particular
flag<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.560> has<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:02.040> symbol<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
flag and it has a little symbol of the

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.910 
flag and it has a little symbol of the
gunship<00:02:03.619> shown<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.340> on<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.509> flag<00:02:06.920> whoever

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
gunship shown on to on that flag whoever

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.309 
gunship shown on to on that flag whoever
has<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.190> flight<00:02:08.550> captured<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.780> determines

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
has that flight captured that determines

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.130 
has that flight captured that determines
which<00:02:10.440> side<00:02:10.679> gets<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.270> gunship

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
which side gets the gunship

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.230 
which side gets the gunship
and<00:02:13.260> as<00:02:13.860> long<00:02:13.980> as<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> can<00:02:14.370> hold<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.819> flag

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
and as long as you can hold that flag

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.930 
and as long as you can hold that flag
you<00:02:16.230> hold<00:02:16.980> the<00:02:17.069> gunship<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.490> now<00:02:17.670> this<00:02:17.790> is

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
you hold the gunship and now this is

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.080 
you hold the gunship and now this is
very<00:02:18.060> important<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.700> believe<00:02:20.700> as<00:02:20.880> soon

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
very important because I believe as soon

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.670 
very important because I believe as soon
as<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.300> game<00:02:21.480> would<00:02:21.630> start<00:02:21.930> if<00:02:22.110> depending<00:02:22.590> on

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
as the game would start if depending on

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.900 
as the game would start if depending on
the<00:02:22.770> type<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:22.950> conquest<00:02:23.490> mode<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.790> you're

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
the type of conquest mode if you're

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.250 
the type of conquest mode if you're
playing<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.270> conquest<00:02:24.720> assault<00:02:25.080> then

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
playing the conquest assault then

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
playing the conquest assault then
there's<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.680> certain<00:02:26.130> sides<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
there's going to be certain sides that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.670 
there's going to be certain sides that
are<00:02:27.360> going<00:02:27.569> to<00:02:27.630> already<00:02:27.990> have<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.410> flag

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
are going to already have that flag

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.580 
are going to already have that flag
capture<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:29.940> just<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.270> regular

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
capture but if it's just a regular

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.870 
capture but if it's just a regular
conquest<00:02:31.590> game<00:02:31.800> where<00:02:32.250> all<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> flags<00:02:32.700> are

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
conquest game where all the flags are

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.840 
conquest game where all the flags are
neutral<00:02:33.300> then<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.500> believe<00:02:35.340> if<00:02:35.490> you're<00:02:35.670> going

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
neutral then I believe if you're going

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.270 
neutral then I believe if you're going
to<00:02:36.080> try<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.110> take<00:02:37.560> over<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.890> battlefield

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
to try to take over the battlefield

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.699 
to try to take over the battlefield
quickly<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.940> want<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.270> get<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.780> flag<00:02:40.080> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
quickly you want to get to that flag the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.670 
quickly you want to get to that flag the
gunship<00:02:41.100> flag<00:02:41.370> as<00:02:41.520> fast<00:02:41.790> as<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.680> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
gunship flag as fast as you can and so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.360 
gunship flag as fast as you can and so
and<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:44.730> try<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:44.970> control<00:02:45.390> it<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:46.370> the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
and then try to control it and the

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
and then try to control it and the
reason<00:02:47.700> behind<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.150> because<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
reason behind that is because the

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.810 
reason behind that is because the
gunship<00:02:48.810> has<00:02:48.989> an<00:02:49.140> overall<00:02:49.440> look<00:02:49.860> over<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
gunship has an overall look over the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.220 
gunship has an overall look over the
playing<00:02:51.090> field<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.840> kind<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.080> get<00:02:52.200> an

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
playing field so you can kind of get an

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.290 
playing field so you can kind of get an
idea<00:02:52.380> when<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:53.250> have<00:02:53.370> people<00:02:53.519> spawn<00:02:53.970> in<00:02:54.120> there

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
idea when you have people spawn in there

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.710 
idea when you have people spawn in there
to<00:02:54.810> kind<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.410> give<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.800> coordinates<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.720> feed

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
to kind of give you coordinates and feed

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.600 
to kind of give you coordinates and feed
you<00:02:57.900> information<00:02:58.200> kind<00:02:58.830> of<00:02:58.890> like<00:02:59.040> Eagles<00:02:59.459> eyes

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
you information kind of like Eagles eyes

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.199 
you information kind of like Eagles eyes
as<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.690> what's<00:03:00.900> going<00:03:00.959> on<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.560> battlefield

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
as to what's going on in the battlefield

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.930 
as to what's going on in the battlefield
so<00:03:03.209> that's<00:03:03.570> one<00:03:03.900> one<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.530> big<00:03:04.769> things<00:03:04.800> I<00:03:05.220> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
so that's one one of the big things I I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.880 
so that's one one of the big things I I
think<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.600> holding<00:03:07.170> that<00:03:07.290> flag<00:03:07.560> is<00:03:07.709> very

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
think of holding that flag is very

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.860 
think of holding that flag is very
important<00:03:08.370> that<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.550> get<00:03:08.820> I'm<00:03:09.239> full<00:03:09.570> control

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
important that you get I'm full control

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.840 
important that you get I'm full control
over<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.230> gunship<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.709> that<00:03:11.280> allows<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:11.820> to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
over the gunship and that allows you to

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.320 
over the gunship and that allows you to
have<00:03:12.120> extra<00:03:12.510> artillery<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.470> help<00:03:13.800> you<00:03:13.980> win<00:03:14.730> the

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
have extra artillery to help you win the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.080 
have extra artillery to help you win the
battle<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:16.860> other<00:03:17.400> thing<00:03:17.459> I<00:03:17.730> mentioned

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
battle and the other thing I mentioned

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.330 
battle and the other thing I mentioned
was<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.510> extra<00:03:19.350> spawn<00:03:19.620> points<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.070> you<00:03:20.100> get

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
was the extra spawn points that you get

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.039 
was the extra spawn points that you get
in<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.549> game<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:20.940> third<00:03:21.570> thing<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.900> why<00:03:22.019> I

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
in the game and the third thing of why I

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.870 
in the game and the third thing of why I
also<00:03:22.260> think<00:03:22.500> it's<00:03:22.709> important<00:03:23.310> to<00:03:23.340> control<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
also think it's important to control the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.759 
also think it's important to control the
gunship<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.690> have<00:03:24.900> that<00:03:25.110> on<00:03:25.260> your<00:03:25.290> team<00:03:25.650> at

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
gunship and to have that on your team at

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.680 
gunship and to have that on your team at
all<00:03:25.799> times<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.370> that<00:03:26.850> it<00:03:26.940> acts<00:03:27.150> as<00:03:27.390> sort<00:03:27.420> of

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
all times is that it acts as sort of

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.850 
all times is that it acts as sort of
like<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> distraction<00:03:28.709> device<00:03:29.010> to<00:03:29.640> keep<00:03:29.850> Jets

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
like a distraction device to keep Jets

focused<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.070> the<00:03:32.190> gunship<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:32.790> out<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.269> the

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
focused on the gunship and out of the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.750 
focused on the gunship and out of the
way<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.870> trying<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.890> take<00:03:35.070> out<00:03:35.220> land<00:03:35.430> vehicles

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
way in trying to take out land vehicles

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
way in trying to take out land vehicles
so<00:03:35.880> your<00:03:36.000> land<00:03:36.150> vehicles<00:03:36.510> become<00:03:36.750> more<00:03:36.959> safe

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
so your land vehicles become more safe

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.210 
so your land vehicles become more safe
as<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.370> gunship<00:03:38.700> draws<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.150> attention<00:03:39.239> from

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
as the gunship draws the attention from

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.620 
as the gunship draws the attention from
destroying<00:03:41.220> land<00:03:41.519> vehicles<00:03:41.970> out<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.480> air

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
destroying land vehicles out of the air

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.030 
destroying land vehicles out of the air
as<00:03:43.940> usually<00:03:44.940> most<00:03:45.480> air<00:03:46.110> vehicles<00:03:46.590> will<00:03:46.829> be

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
as usually most air vehicles will be

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.710 
as usually most air vehicles will be
trying<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.400> focus<00:03:47.640> on<00:03:47.940> taking<00:03:48.090> that<00:03:48.360> gunship

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
trying to focus on taking that gunship

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.660 
trying to focus on taking that gunship
and<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.530> also<00:03:49.890> a<00:03:49.920> counter<00:03:50.340> thing<00:03:50.549> if

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
and that's also a counter thing if

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.069 
and that's also a counter thing if
you're<00:03:50.820> on<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.000> enemy<00:03:51.209> side<00:03:51.600> if<00:03:51.810> you're<00:03:51.930> on

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
you're on the enemy side if you're on

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.810 
you're on the enemy side if you're on
the<00:03:52.170> counter<00:03:52.470> side<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.829> attacking<00:03:53.610> the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
the counter side of attacking the

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.340 
the counter side of attacking the
gunship<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.600> know<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.049> gonna<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.320> a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
gunship you know that it's gonna be a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.190 
gunship you know that it's gonna be a
very<00:03:55.410> easy<00:03:55.829> vehicle<00:03:56.610> to<00:03:56.700> take<00:03:57.329> out<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:58.140> you

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
very easy vehicle to take out so you

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.780 
very easy vehicle to take out so you
could<00:03:58.440> take<00:03:58.470> out<00:03:58.769> that<00:03:58.950> vehicle<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.489> trying

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
could take out that vehicle but trying

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.330 
could take out that vehicle but trying
not<00:03:59.910> to<00:04:00.390> stay<00:04:00.570> too<00:04:00.600> focused<00:04:01.350> so<00:04:01.950> much<00:04:02.010> on

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
not to stay too focused so much on

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.940 
not to stay too focused so much on
honing<00:04:03.299> the<00:04:03.570> reason<00:04:03.959> why<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.170> have<00:04:04.560> any<00:04:04.769> air

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
honing the reason why you have any air

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.470 
honing the reason why you have any air

gunship<00:04:09.900> and<00:04:10.140> staying<00:04:10.829> more<00:04:11.010> focused<00:04:11.430> on<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
gunship and staying more focused on the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.009 
gunship and staying more focused on the
playing<00:04:12.120> field<00:04:12.390> actually<00:04:13.670> keeping<00:04:14.670> flags<00:04:15.570> you

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
playing field actually keeping flags you

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.210 
playing field actually keeping flags you
know<00:04:16.109> that's<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> whole<00:04:16.620> objective<00:04:16.769> of<00:04:17.160> the

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
know that's the whole objective of the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.800 
know that's the whole objective of the
game<00:04:17.250> is<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.579> hold<00:04:18.000> and<00:04:18.209> capture<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.780> hold

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
game is to hold and capture and hold

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.779 
game is to hold and capture and hold
flags<00:04:19.200> so<00:04:19.739> that's<00:04:19.919> on<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.130> conquest<00:04:20.519> side<00:04:20.640> if

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
flags so that's on the conquest side if

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.969 
flags so that's on the conquest side if
you're<00:04:20.880> playing<00:04:21.000> rush<00:04:21.349> it's<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.530> attackers

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
you're playing rush it's the attackers

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.050 
you're playing rush it's the attackers
that<00:04:23.130> get<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> gunships<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:23.910> that's

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
that get the gunships so that's

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.700 
that get the gunships so that's
something<00:04:24.240> to<00:04:24.360> keep<00:04:24.539> in<00:04:24.660> mind<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.080> that's<00:04:25.500> can

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
something to keep in mind and that's can

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.780 
something to keep in mind and that's can
be<00:04:25.830> a<00:04:25.860> very

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
be a very

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.300 
be a very
I<00:04:27.200> don't<00:04:28.200> know<00:04:28.260> if<00:04:28.350> it's<00:04:28.470> really<00:04:28.620> balanced<00:04:29.130> or

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
I don't know if it's really balanced or

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.430 
I don't know if it's really balanced or
not<00:04:29.580> because<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.150> the<00:04:30.240> sense<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.960> defenders

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
not because in the sense the defenders

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.320 
not because in the sense the defenders
are<00:04:31.560> going<00:04:31.680> to<00:04:31.740> always<00:04:31.860> be<00:04:32.010> under<00:04:32.340> attack<00:04:32.670> from

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
are going to always be under attack from

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.150 
are going to always be under attack from
the<00:04:33.420> gunship<00:04:33.810> at<00:04:33.960> all<00:04:34.050> times<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:34.800> they<00:04:34.920> have<00:04:35.040> to

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
the gunship at all times so they have to

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.640 
the gunship at all times so they have to
really<00:04:35.580> rely<00:04:35.910> if<00:04:36.240> you're<00:04:36.840> on<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.140> defensive

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
really rely if you're on the defensive

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
really rely if you're on the defensive
side<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:38.010> try<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> take<00:04:38.490> out<00:04:38.610> that<00:04:38.760> gunship<00:04:39.120> as

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
side to try to take out that gunship as

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.050 
side to try to take out that gunship as
it's<00:04:39.450> just<00:04:39.750> going<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.160> rain<00:04:41.160> havoc<00:04:41.640> on<00:04:41.820> the

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
it's just going to rain havoc on the

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.810 
it's just going to rain havoc on the
defensive<00:04:42.510> team<00:04:42.750> especially<00:04:43.590> since<00:04:44.430> the

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
defensive team especially since the

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.060 
defensive team especially since the
defensive<00:04:45.300> team<00:04:45.480> only<00:04:45.900> spawn<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.410> one<00:04:46.560> area<00:04:46.770> so

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
defensive team only spawn in one area so

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.840 
defensive team only spawn in one area so
the<00:04:47.460> gunship<00:04:47.790> always<00:04:48.090> has<00:04:48.800> has<00:04:49.800> sight<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.430> one

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
the gunship always has has sight of one

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.180 
the gunship always has has sight of one
area<00:04:51.210> where<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.420> can<00:04:51.660> keep<00:04:51.870> firing<00:04:52.320> on<00:04:52.410> them

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
area where you can keep firing on them

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.920 
area where you can keep firing on them
you<00:04:53.730> know<00:04:53.850> as<00:04:53.970> opposed<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.420> the<00:04:54.510> conquest

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
you know as opposed to the conquest

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.420 
you know as opposed to the conquest
where<00:04:55.080> people<00:04:55.380> are<00:04:55.470> just<00:04:55.620> spread<00:04:56.130> out

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
where people are just spread out

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.400 
where people are just spread out
throughout<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.940> entire<00:04:57.210> map<00:04:57.420> so<00:04:57.630> that's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
throughout the entire map so that's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.560 
throughout the entire map so that's
something<00:04:58.620> to<00:04:58.710> keep<00:04:58.920> in<00:04:59.040> mind<00:04:59.100> and<00:04:59.580> p.m.<00:05:00.150> you

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
something to keep in mind and p.m. you

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.480 
something to keep in mind and p.m. you
know<00:05:00.690> just<00:05:01.380> to<00:05:01.560> give<00:05:01.680> you<00:05:01.800> guys<00:05:01.890> a<00:05:01.950> heads<00:05:02.220> up<00:05:02.340> on

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
know just to give you guys a heads up on

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.180 
know just to give you guys a heads up on
how<00:05:02.730> that<00:05:02.790> works<00:05:03.300> for<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:04.350> vehicle<00:05:05.040> in<00:05:05.100> the

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
how that works for the vehicle in the

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.310 
how that works for the vehicle in the
game<00:05:05.310> but<00:05:05.640> yes<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.000> I<00:05:06.210> still<00:05:06.570> think<00:05:06.810> that<00:05:06.870> it's<00:05:07.110> a

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
game but yes I I still think that it's a

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.110 
game but yes I I still think that it's a
very<00:05:07.590> dominant<00:05:08.250> vehicle<00:05:08.640> that's<00:05:08.850> something

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
very dominant vehicle that's something

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.390 
very dominant vehicle that's something
that<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.360> want<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.630> control<00:05:09.960> immediately

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 
that you want to control immediately

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.080 
that you want to control immediately
when<00:05:11.400> you're<00:05:11.550> out<00:05:11.670> there<00:05:11.850> on<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.060> battlefield

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
when you're out there on the battlefield

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.380 
when you're out there on the battlefield
I<00:05:12.600> know<00:05:12.660> most<00:05:12.930> teams<00:05:13.200> tend<00:05:13.800> to<00:05:14.000> try<00:05:15.000> to<00:05:15.030> space

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
I know most teams tend to try to space

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:17.870 
I know most teams tend to try to space
themselves<00:05:15.960> out<00:05:16.110> but<00:05:17.070> if<00:05:17.160> you<00:05:17.250> have<00:05:17.370> one<00:05:17.580> squad

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
themselves out but if you have one squad

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.790 
themselves out but if you have one squad

and you see nobody's holding that flag
