00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.709
 segments of this solution could do equipped with glasses to see 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.219
 3d content and especially to present you a product signed LG 55 and 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:08.799
 quick 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.349
 9500 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.119
 aa it's the world record simply has the TV 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.919
 full web 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.150
 finally must be what does it mean 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.759
 I have a lot of people who make ultra slim TVs you have here 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.099
 petitclerc all images 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.449
 to gain finesse we put them on the periphery on the full lebda 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.650
 you have the lady 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.300
 hundreds and hundreds of letters that turn on and off 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.650
 according to the zones 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.780
 not only is it interesting for the power consumption that sign 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.980
 the black displayed but not immediately for the consumer 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.790
 but also those that I just have a little bit of white on the sidelines of the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.240
 maximum encounter the environment and energy is also 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.240
 so we come to a contrast 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.870
 relatively exceptional course a point produced 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.440
 I will not give you 5 million numbers for no or anything 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.250
 because it does not mean anything 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.430
 I can guarantee you that clutter goods produced by e-mail 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.880
 you are really doing it and wondering if you are as big as us 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.979
 plasma enthusiast 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.300
 how we managed to get an image of this quality 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.450
 with lcd technology 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.710
 as fine 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.190
 since most of them for deceased dlc like this 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.450
 finally still in the cities 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.539
 later to do 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.220
 from full there behind 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.690
 place really amazing 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.480
 next to that obviously a TV that is 3D compatible and of 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.450
 show them to my glasses 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.130
 obviously with liverpool added with an investment of 4 5 m 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 so we want quite a bit of ignition delay quite little remanence 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.660
 the departure of the level 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.800
 of the future bone in lodz where and plasma the streets 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.720
 really close very close 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.330
 it was a forced magic mochel remote control 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.830
 the new generation that remote controls with 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 no access to normal access to the meetings to behave like a 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:58.770
 wii 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.409
 you can move with the remote it's really really 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.480
 very very nice the casting technologies 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.480
 of grace 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.120
 at the collection 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.259
 which is integrated 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.129
 you want to appear 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.169
 look 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:15.040
 and sports internet content with quality louis or weather arras 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:18.479
 content at the request of his tsra 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.869
 also the dlna and integrate instead you can see it for the phone 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.129
 portable contents see on computer 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.260
 your video files of all discounts 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.869
 photo victory 

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:30.009
 it's really very very convenient 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:31.479
 I've also 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.470
 in back 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.329
 plethora 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:35.629
 input 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:36.989
 some outings 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.090
 two usb ports an input hdmi an input 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.289
 circulated component here you might not want good in tnt hd 

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:47.809
 here the hdmi takes decided to visit not buy hdmi cables 

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:50.849
 flexibility 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 to be able to paste this screen say that if we see here the cable passes 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.590
 that it can be a little embarrassing you have shackles in match that at the 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.529
 logic 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.889
 you have an entry into the eternal present that the antenna socket is here 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:05.819
 the composite input and if the quality it is there you have an entry 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.609
 a part throughout the eu the audio input for the pole of the countries where you are 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.829
 also an optical output that wanted to recover the sound of TV 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.819
 on your amplifier 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.299
 you see behind here hide 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.549
 a small speaker that is intended for low frequencies since 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.299
 from below we already have some speakers that reassures and 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.620
 mediamat and then it'll bounce back and go well you've heard but 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.729
 we also have an embarrassment for the drama 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.739
 flat screen TV fight that really works very very badly a 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.699
 aesthetic point of view 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.699
 this one aviva france we are very very good to the group 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.979
 the remote is very nice 

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:42.739
 the day quickly show small glasses signed alger that are provided 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.789
 of TVs unlike other brands I will not mention 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.299
 who are a little 

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.919
 how nice bakhit who asks you to buy glasses a year earlier 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.849
 but cissÃ© provided as standard very very simple glasses all 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.599
 days to show 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.139
 see a small housing with a button to turn on and could delay for 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.039
 change the batteries 

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:10.009
 the sympathy of the transmitter 3d glasses integrated on the TV I am really 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:11.519
 very very easily 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:14.519
 buddy buttons a part that are 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.650
 placed like these behind you we removed titi 2 what does 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.349
 what 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:22.349
 a simple one you are cooked like that you can light 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:25.779
 very appreciated of the day shows what it gives an image 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:26.840
 france alzheimer 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.000
 quick start small logo hosted 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.030
 always a design with a supporter I squatte action 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.010
 Algeria will also have that it would be very very good French justice almost 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.349
 five years says marc vidal of glass 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.129
 great for the foot a single worry to be done every time we have 

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:48.090
 black thing slammed like that we have a little bit of dust 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.249
 Charisteas 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.200
 I am looking to easily lifted the dream would not allow it 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.050
 a little more transparent also in plexi site 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.400
 very very pretty we learn that the TV floats 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.770
 the image yes I see it in what we have in store that is very very very 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.749
 very bright 

00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:04.920
 but apart from that 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.669
 an image that is very very important aspect 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.979
 very nice score reaches a very pretty design made a blunder 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.420
 but just a very fine one for you who is directly sent 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:15.300
 in the slab 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.300
 to have five products that are quite surprising 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:22.599
 for the finesse that is there 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.619
 for the claims that called him at the price at which he is sold since he is 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:27.400
 really very very interesting 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.919
 at the start of 2011, it's one of the best HD TVs on the market 

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:33.740
 and you can see that the press 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.620
 magazine or on the internet 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.580
 e 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.940
 totally agree it's probably one of the most 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.550
 TVs 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.159
 currently you can find it for sale at a very very attractive price 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.389
