00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
rear I doubt if they're going to go back

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
rear I doubt if they're going to go back
to<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:34.980> og<00:00:35.489> style<00:00:35.940> where<00:00:36.210> they<00:00:36.300> faced<00:00:36.510> our

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to the og style where they faced our

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
to the og style where they faced our
friend<00:00:36.960> but<00:00:37.200> you<00:00:37.380> know<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.710> guess<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.579> can<00:00:38.700> keep

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
friend but you know I guess you can keep

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.470 
friend but you know I guess you can keep
hoping<00:00:39.210> I<00:00:39.390> doubt<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:39.930> though<00:00:41.270> another<00:00:42.270> thing

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
hoping I doubt it though another thing

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.330 
hoping I doubt it though another thing
is<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:43.219> cushioning<00:00:44.219> on<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.850> 01<00:00:45.750> 11<00:00:46.050> s<00:00:46.530> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
is the cushioning on the 01 11 s is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
is the cushioning on the 01 11 s is
super<00:00:47.969> soft<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.260> kind<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> like<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
super soft it's like kind of like a I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.520 
super soft it's like kind of like a I
don't<00:00:50.489> know<00:00:50.579> it's<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.850> very<00:00:51.030> soft<00:00:51.530> opposed

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.100 
the past years they'd just been using
less<00:01:52.130> as<00:01:53.130> well<00:01:53.399> as<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.640> front<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.780> notice

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
less as well as the front if you notice

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.709 
less as well as the front if you notice
the<00:01:55.619> patent<00:01:56.189> leather<00:01:56.340> from<00:01:56.850> laces<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.600> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
the patent leather from laces to the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
the patent leather from laces to the
patent<00:01:58.020> leather<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.560> little<00:01:58.920> gap<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.969> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
patent leather it's a little gap but it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.450 
patent leather it's a little gap but it
gets<00:02:00.299> even<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.869> bigger<00:02:01.200> gap<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.950> know<00:02:02.009> from<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
gets even a bigger gap you know from the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
gets even a bigger gap you know from the
space<00:02:02.790> jams<00:02:03.030> even<00:02:03.390> cool<00:02:03.570> greys<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.110> fat<00:02:04.350> gap

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
space jams even cool greys the fat gap

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.889 
space jams even cool greys the fat gap
so<00:02:05.369> they<00:02:05.490> use<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> lot<00:02:05.790> less<00:02:06.090> patent<00:02:06.659> leather<00:02:06.780> in

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
so they use a lot less patent leather in

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.900 
so they use a lot less patent leather in
the<00:02:06.990> front<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.649> toe<00:02:07.829> box<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.520> can<00:02:08.670> kind<00:02:08.849> of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the front in the toe box you can kind of

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460 
the front in the toe box you can kind of
see

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470

gem in Jordan is it's two pieces for the
upper<00:02:31.920> nylon<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:33.330> looks<00:02:33.780> like<00:02:33.990> one<00:02:34.230> but<00:02:34.440> it's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
upper nylon it looks like one but it's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.380

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
guess to check out some one way they

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.630 
guess to check out some one way they
made<00:02:42.060> them<00:02:42.210> on<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> newer<00:02:43.470> retros<00:02:43.980> i<00:02:44.340> don't

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
made them on the newer retros i don't

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.760 
made them on the newer retros i don't
know<00:02:44.760> i<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:44.880> have<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.209> CDP<00:02:45.510> i<00:02:45.990> heard<00:02:46.650> their

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.020 
know i don't have the CDP i heard their
crap<00:02:47.070> so<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.430> didn't<00:02:47.640> even<00:02:47.790> get<00:02:47.910> them

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
crap so I just didn't even get them

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.880 
crap so I just didn't even get them
especially<00:02:48.840> since<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> had<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> desktop

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
especially since I had a desktop

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
especially since I had a desktop
parallel<00:02:50.220> ones<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.670> didn't<00:02:51.060> bother<00:02:51.180> but

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
parallel ones I just didn't bother but

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.949 
parallel ones I just didn't bother but
um<00:02:52.290> on<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.709> 2010<00:02:53.670> cool<00:02:54.090> greys<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.510> can<00:02:54.660> see

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
um on the 2010 cool greys you can see

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.449 
um on the 2010 cool greys you can see
more<00:02:55.260> drastic<00:02:55.680> because<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:55.980> lighter<00:02:56.190> color

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
more drastic because it's lighter color

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.610 
more drastic because it's lighter color
it's<00:02:57.150> two<00:02:57.390> pieces<00:02:57.540> stitched<00:02:57.959> together<00:02:58.110> but

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
it's two pieces stitched together but

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.970 
it's two pieces stitched together but
they<00:02:58.950> made<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.310> kind<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.610> flesh<00:03:00.770> so<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.830> looks

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
they made it kind of flesh so it looks

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.940 
they made it kind of flesh so it looks
like<00:03:02.070> it's<00:03:02.310> one<00:03:02.490> piece<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:02.970> it's<00:03:03.120> not<00:03:03.300> on<00:03:03.950> 2009

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
like it's one piece but it's not on 2009

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.240 
like it's one piece but it's not on 2009
space<00:03:05.310> jams<00:03:05.610> same<00:03:05.940> difference<00:03:06.350> it's<00:03:07.350> two

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
space jams same difference it's two

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.180 
space jams same difference it's two
pieces<00:03:08.550> they<00:03:09.000> just<00:03:09.270> made<00:03:09.510> it<00:03:09.540> look<00:03:09.660> flush<00:03:10.260> so

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190
