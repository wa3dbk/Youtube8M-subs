property<00:01:03.409> of<00:01:03.439> imaginary<00:01:03.979> numbers<00:01:04.430> is<00:01:04.640> that

property of imaginary numbers is that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.670 
property of imaginary numbers is that
since<00:01:05.269> the<00:01:05.479> square<00:01:05.750> root<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.020> negative<00:01:06.229> 1

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
since the square root of negative 1

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.100 
since the square root of negative 1
equals<00:01:06.860> I<00:01:07.490> if<00:01:07.790> we<00:01:07.939> square<00:01:08.420> both<00:01:08.450> sides<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.080> that

equals I if we square both sides of that

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.170 
equals I if we square both sides of that
equation<00:01:09.229> we<00:01:09.979> can<00:01:10.130> see<00:01:10.369> that<00:01:10.549> I<00:01:10.729> squared

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
equation we can see that I squared
