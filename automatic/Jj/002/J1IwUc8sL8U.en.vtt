00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.150
 the spare wheel 

00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:12.509
 one of the basic operations you should know how to perform 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.900
 if we have to perform this operation on the court 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 although Miss Rohan remembers Mendez 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.340
 make sure that the parking brake is applied 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 and the automobile well immobilized 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.820
 Every vehicle must have a spare wheel 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.670
 as of the necessary tools 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.180
 gat two subsidiaries 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.400
 it is also convenient 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.400
 moons 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.480
 we will start by removing the hubcap 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 and loosen the screws 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.800
 for this last operation 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.200
 wilder with the foot 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.200
 the screws are usually quite 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.090
 then place the jack under the car in the slots arranged 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.190
 for it 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.720
 before proceeding to lift the vehicle it is best to sing it 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.490
 Properly placing wedges 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 stones both sides of the wheel of amonal 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.050
 when hacking 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.630
 we will lift the car slowly 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.630
 watching that I did not feel 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.080
 once raised as a safety measure we will place the tripod 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.390
 Now we can extract the screws that we had previously occupied and take it out 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.130
 then we will place the spare in its place putting it back 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 and squeezing them 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.139
 at this moment we can 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:49.189
 cochilco 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:56.099
 once on the ground we will remove the cat and we will firmly attach the screws 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.179
 finally we will put the tapatÃ­o 

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:03.239
 Now it is convenient to check the pressure 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.859
 a manometer 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:06.429
 a station 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:09.429
 to inflate the income 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:12.319
 the rudeness
