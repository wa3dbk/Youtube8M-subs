00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.009 

I<00:02:20.290> think<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.439> support<00:02:21.830> role<00:02:22.629> matches<00:02:23.629> much

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
I think the support role matches much

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.220 
I think the support role matches much
more<00:02:24.349> to<00:02:24.769> me<00:02:24.920> than<00:02:24.980> being<00:02:25.180> imaginary<00:02:26.180> in<00:02:27.019> the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
more to me than being imaginary in the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.509 
more to me than being imaginary in the
in<00:02:27.439> the<00:02:27.500> long<00:02:27.620> run<00:02:27.829> it<00:02:27.920> really<00:02:27.950> worked<00:02:28.310> out

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
in the long run it really worked out

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.630 
in the long run it really worked out
perfectly<00:02:29.329> that<00:02:30.290> transition<00:02:30.829> was<00:02:31.010> hit<00:02:31.610> or

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
perfectly that transition was hit or

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.220 
perfectly that transition was hit or
miss<00:02:31.819> pretty<00:02:32.239> much<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.540> media<00:02:32.689> really<00:02:33.049> made

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
miss pretty much the media really made

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.800 
miss pretty much the media really made
it<00:02:33.349> hit<00:02:33.530> I<00:02:33.829> have<00:02:34.549> much<00:02:34.790> more<00:02:35.000> time<00:02:35.239> to<00:02:35.269> focus<00:02:35.569> on

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
it hit I have much more time to focus on

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.869 
it hit I have much more time to focus on
other<00:02:36.019> stuff<00:02:36.409> that<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.950> going<00:02:37.159> around<00:02:37.489> the<00:02:37.670> map
