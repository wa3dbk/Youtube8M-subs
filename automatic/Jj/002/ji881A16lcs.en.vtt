00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.170 
access to its battery see how we get to
the<00:02:11.400> battery

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
the battery

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.660 
the battery
a<00:02:12.209> good<00:02:12.420> question<00:02:13.159> so<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.250> looks<00:02:14.370> like<00:02:14.400> there's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
a good question so it looks like there's

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.369 
a good question so it looks like there's
a<00:02:14.730> slot<00:02:15.209> right<00:02:15.420> up<00:02:15.599> here<00:02:15.810> let's<00:02:16.140> pull<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.620> out

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
a slot right up here let's pull it out

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.800 
a slot right up here let's pull it out
there<00:02:19.379> we<00:02:19.530> go<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.609> we<00:02:20.879> have<00:02:21.090> access<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.689> the

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.050 
android 2.3 Gingerbread and it's powered
I'm<00:05:49.830> gonna<00:05:49.980> say<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.220> 1<00:05:50.520> gigahertz<00:05:50.820> processor

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
I'm gonna say a 1 gigahertz processor

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.330 
I'm gonna say a 1 gigahertz processor
I'll<00:05:51.900> take<00:05:52.530> a<00:05:52.560> look<00:05:52.800> at<00:05:52.890> that<00:05:52.980> here<00:05:53.190> in<00:05:53.280> a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
I'll take a look at that here in a

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.800 
I'll take a look at that here in a
moment<00:05:53.550> but<00:05:53.880> i'll<00:05:54.300> take<00:05:54.480> a<00:05:54.510> look<00:05:54.600> which

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:54.810 
moment but i'll take a look which

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.460 
moment but i'll take a look which
version<00:05:55.200> of<00:05:55.260> android<00:05:55.680> is<00:05:55.740> running<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.930> is

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
version of android is running it is

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.530 
version of android is running it is
running<00:06:00.560> Android<00:06:01.560> 2.3<00:06:02.130> points6<00:06:02.850> gingerbread

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
running Android 2.3 points6 gingerbread

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:05.840 
running Android 2.3 points6 gingerbread
so<00:06:03.750> gingerbread<00:06:04.170> other<00:06:04.350> box<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.980> word<00:06:05.610> if<00:06:05.670> it's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
so gingerbread other box a word if it's

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.090 
so gingerbread other box a word if it's
going<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.060> be<00:06:06.180> upgraded<00:06:06.450> to<00:06:06.780> Ice<00:06:07.740> Cream

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:08.100 
going to be upgraded to Ice Cream

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.220 
going to be upgraded to Ice Cream
Sandwich<00:06:08.130> and<00:06:08.910> believe<00:06:09.570> the<00:06:09.690> processor

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 
Sandwich and believe the processor

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.660 
Sandwich and believe the processor
should<00:06:10.410> probably<00:06:10.890> be<00:06:10.980> looks<00:06:11.160> like<00:06:11.280> might<00:06:11.520> be

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
should probably be looks like might be

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.650 
should probably be looks like might be
might<00:06:12.480> be<00:06:12.690> a<00:06:13.460> probably<00:06:14.460> same<00:06:15.060> processor<00:06:15.510> ease

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
might be a probably same processor ease

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.710 
might be a probably same processor ease

and let's see if we could see some other

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.040 
and let's see if we could see some other
applications<00:06:36.390> here<00:06:36.540> there<00:06:36.720> are<00:06:36.810> probably

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
applications here there are probably

we<00:06:39.490> mostly<00:06:40.270> apps<00:06:40.509> here<00:06:40.780> are<00:06:40.960> pretty<00:06:41.199> much<00:06:41.560> what

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
we mostly apps here are pretty much what

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.860 
we mostly apps here are pretty much what
you<00:06:42.070> find<00:06:42.190> another<00:06:42.550> samsung<00:06:42.970> smartphone<00:06:43.660> so
