00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
sport invented first it wasn't even cold

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.310 
sport invented first it wasn't even cold
football<00:03:13.490> vs.<00:03:13.910> people<00:03:14.510> already<00:03:14.720> using<00:03:15.200> the

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
different cards so we've already

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.949 
different cards so we've already
established<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:20.420> association

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
established that the that association

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.390 
established that the that association
football<00:03:21.230> was<00:03:21.350> not<00:03:21.590> the<00:03:21.709> first<00:03:21.890> sports<00:03:22.220> who

have been invented out of all the
football<00:03:23.720> codes<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.560> wasn't<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:24.950> first

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
football codes it wasn't the first

football codes it wasn't the first
football<00:03:25.370> code<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:26.270> use<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:26.810> term<00:03:26.989> football

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
football code to use the term football

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.100 
football code to use the term football
and<00:03:28.070> it<00:03:28.430> wasn't<00:03:28.940> even<00:03:29.000> and<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.989> that

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
and it wasn't even and it and that

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.229 
and it wasn't even and it and that
football<00:03:30.410> is<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:31.310> official<00:03:31.730> name<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.000> the

can be seen as a bit of a threat or an
insult<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:51.950> some<00:03:52.519> very<00:03:52.670> sensitive<00:03:53.060> 13<00:03:53.720> year

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
insult to some very sensitive 13 year

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.479 
insult to some very sensitive 13 year
old<00:03:53.989> children<00:03:54.200> or<00:03:54.470> people<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.190> just<00:03:55.400> at

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
old children or people that just at

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.220 
old children or people that just at
least<00:03:55.580> act<00:03:55.850> like<00:03:55.940> a<00:03:56.060> 13<00:03:56.480> year<00:03:56.570> old<00:03:56.660> child<00:03:56.810> or

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
least act like a 13 year old child or

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.660 
least act like a 13 year old child or
maybe<00:03:57.410> they're<00:03:57.590> just<00:03:57.650> massive<00:03:58.010> for<00:03:58.580> the

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
maybe they're just massive for the

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.400 
maybe they're just massive for the
football<00:03:59.060> fan<00:03:59.330> so<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.810> really<00:04:00.050> doesn't<00:04:00.290> matter

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
football fan so it really doesn't matter

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.100 
football fan so it really doesn't matter
but<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.709> fact<00:04:00.739> is<00:04:01.040> football<00:04:02.030> will<00:04:02.630> never<00:04:02.870> and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
but the fact is football will never and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.080 
but the fact is football will never and
this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> definitive<00:04:03.800> argument<00:04:04.519> my<00:04:04.730> my

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
this is the definitive argument my my

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.300 
this is the definitive argument my my
ending<00:04:05.450> point<00:04:05.690> if<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.900> want<00:04:06.110> of<00:04:06.260> my<00:04:06.890> little

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
ending point if you want of my little

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.910 
ending point if you want of my little
debate<00:04:07.880> and<00:04:08.120> that<00:04:08.300> is<00:04:08.450> the<00:04:08.600> fact<00:04:08.810> that

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
debate and that is the fact that

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.880 
debate and that is the fact that
football<00:04:09.940> can<00:04:10.940> never<00:04:11.239> be<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:12.050> name<00:04:12.320> of<00:04:12.500> just

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
football can never be the name of just

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.949 
football can never be the name of just
one<00:04:13.310> sport<00:04:13.790> in<00:04:13.940> the<00:04:14.060> world<00:04:14.090> or<00:04:14.450> at<00:04:14.570> least<00:04:14.600> not

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
one sport in the world or at least not

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.630 
one sport in the world or at least not
now<00:04:14.989> unless<00:04:15.650> all<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.980> other<00:04:16.130> codes<00:04:16.400> were<00:04:16.580> to

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
now unless all the other codes were to

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.210 
now unless all the other codes were to
die<00:04:16.790> then<00:04:17.090> maybe<00:04:17.299> but<00:04:17.810> that's<00:04:18.200> real<00:04:18.739> well<00:04:18.980> we

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
die then maybe but that's real well we

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.960 
die then maybe but that's real well we
