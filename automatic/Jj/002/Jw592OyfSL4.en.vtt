00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
side is is a little different it's both

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
at least doesn't have this app and so

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.260 
at least doesn't have this app and so
for<00:01:17.820> example<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.509> play<00:01:19.790> you<00:01:20.790> pass<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
for example I would play you pass it to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.350 
for example I would play you pass it to
it<00:01:21.450> off<00:01:21.780> they<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.590> play<00:01:23.119> then<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> got<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it off they would play then you got a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.550 
it off they would play then you got a
different<00:01:24.600> game<00:01:24.720> types<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.530> can

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
different game types that you can

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.460 
different game types that you can
explain<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> unlike<00:01:27.180> say<00:01:27.479> play<00:01:27.750> which

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
explain like that unlike say play which

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.740 
explain like that unlike say play which
is<00:01:28.650> fun<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:29.549> they<00:01:29.700> add<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.240> they're

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
is fun if they add of that is they're

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.030 
is fun if they add of that is they're
not<00:01:30.869> really<00:01:30.930> anything<00:01:31.350> too<00:01:31.619> special<00:01:31.860> but

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
not really anything too special but

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.920 
not really anything too special but
they're<00:01:32.640> nice<00:01:33.860> single-player<00:01:35.930> get

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
they're nice single-player get

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.420 
they're nice single-player get
challenges<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.650> stuff

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:51.680 

I<00:01:49.580> just<00:01:50.580> picked<00:01:50.760> a<00:01:50.850> random<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.270> here

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
I just picked a random on here

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.650 
I just picked a random on here
and<00:01:51.840> we'll<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.410> how<00:01:52.650> it<00:01:52.830> works<00:01:53.540> lots<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
and we'll see how it works lots of

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.969 
and we'll see how it works lots of
different<00:01:54.930> game<00:01:55.050> types<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.440> keep<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.800> game

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
different game types to keep the game

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.160 
different game types to keep the game
from<00:01:56.160> getting<00:01:56.460> scaled<00:01:56.760> back<00:01:57.150> for<00:01:57.450> obviously

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
from getting scaled back for obviously

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.590 
from getting scaled back for obviously
you<00:01:58.380> probably<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.920> getting<00:01:59.250> them<00:01:59.600> getting

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
you probably see getting them getting

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.240 
you probably see getting them getting
quite<00:02:00.810> boring<00:02:01.110> over<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.500> certain<00:02:01.860> period<00:02:02.070> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
quite boring over a certain period of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.430 
quite boring over a certain period of
time<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:03.090> we<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.240> um<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.170> just<00:02:04.290> a

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
time there we go um this is just a

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.250 
time there we go um this is just a
random<00:02:04.590> one<00:02:04.890> bomb<00:02:05.280> ship<00:02:05.640> bombs<00:02:06.000> blow<00:02:06.420> the

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:07.260 
random one bomb ship bombs blow the

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.050 
random one bomb ship bombs blow the
bombs<00:02:07.560> away<00:02:07.800> this<00:02:08.100> ship<00:02:08.340> blows<00:02:08.610> up<00:02:08.850> when

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
bombs away this ship blows up when

it in those place bombs were this place

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.570 
it in those place bombs were this place
at<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> start<00:02:22.770> they're<00:02:22.920> sitting<00:02:23.190> really<00:02:23.340> do

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
at the start they're sitting really do

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.900
