comm<00:00:17.359> the<00:00:18.359> sum<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:18.990> numbers<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.680> 16<00:00:21.170> one

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
comm the sum of two numbers is 16 one

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.570 
comm the sum of two numbers is 16 one
number<00:00:22.439> is<00:00:22.769> 4<00:00:23.160> less<00:00:23.189> than<00:00:23.490> 3<00:00:23.880> times<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.869> other

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
number is 4 less than 3 times the other

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.620 
number is 4 less than 3 times the other
find<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> numbers<00:00:28.070> let's<00:00:29.070> use<00:00:29.460> two<00:00:29.910> variables

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
find the numbers let's use two variables

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.639 
find the numbers let's use two variables
to<00:00:30.900> represent<00:00:31.439> our<00:00:31.590> numbers<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.340> problem

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
to represent our numbers in this problem

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.670 
to represent our numbers in this problem
x<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:36.020> y<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> if<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> sum<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> two<00:00:40.200> numbers<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
x and y so if the sum of two numbers is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.529 
x and y so if the sum of two numbers is
16<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.540> means<00:00:42.800> that<00:00:43.800> X<00:00:44.510> plus<00:00:45.510> y<00:00:46.280> equals<00:00:47.960> 16

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
16 that means that X plus y equals 16

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.090 
16 that means that X plus y equals 16
remember<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.719> solve<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.260> two<00:00:52.500> separate

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.920 
remember to solve for two separate
variables<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:54.059> need<00:00:54.140> two<00:00:55.140> separate<00:00:55.680> equations

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
variables we need two separate equations

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.529 
variables we need two separate equations
so<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> set<00:00:58.289> up<00:00:58.410> our<00:00:58.620> second<00:00:59.129> equation<00:00:59.539> let's

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so to set up our second equation let's

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
so to set up our second equation let's
read<00:01:00.840> through<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.770> second<00:01:02.309> sentence<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
substitution since x equals 3 y minus 4

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.630 
substitution since x equals 3 y minus 4
we<00:01:40.409> can<00:01:40.619> substitute<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.640> 3y<00:01:42.299> minus<00:01:42.840> 4<00:01:43.200> in<00:01:43.640> for

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
times parenthesis 5 minus 4 so X is 15

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.080 
times parenthesis 5 minus 4 so X is 15
minus<00:02:26.750> 4<00:02:27.110> or<00:02:28.040> X<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.670> 11<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:31.130> our<00:02:31.280> two<00:02:31.520> numbers<00:02:31.730> in

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
minus 4 or X is 11 so our two numbers in

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.920 
minus 4 or X is 11 so our two numbers in
this<00:02:32.270> problem<00:02:32.780> are<00:02:33.220> 11<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.920> 5
