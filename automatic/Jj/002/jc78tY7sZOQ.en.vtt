 supporter of juice just say I think

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.220
 detrimental to health consider apple 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.710
 green and more often enriched 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.570
 vitamins which is same as that on

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 initially useful and harmful products 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 power it all depends on the amount if i 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.219
 Now I drink a glass of this juice that 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.680
 happen inside my body 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:53.070
 interesting yes let's tell x-ray to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.739
 the studio can and so drinking 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.930
 a glass of any emphasize the juice of any 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.539
 freshly squeezed or packaged 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.480
 no matter the fructose that is contained there 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.189
 in the liquid phase you have now 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.310
 instantly begins to be absorbed into the blood 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.799
 and instantly wildly rises sharply 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.810
 the release of blood sugar to what reacts 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.600
 pancreas huge outburst 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.030
 hormones insulin and here in this glass 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.710
 juice approximately contains daily dose 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.960
 carbohydrates that is, you can do 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.210
 no carbohydrates any day eat it porridge 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.520
 the fruit has already received its dosage 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.329
 will say but there is at least Norman berner 2 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.100
 a glass of juice a day I sleep well if 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.540
 do you drink a glass of juice every day 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.250
 then you are almost guaranteed 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.420
 will develop type 2 diabetes 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.150
 for six years 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.490
 that refuse juices at all I would 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.930
 refused altogether but sometimes you can from 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.329
 better juice is mineral water 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.180
 generally ordinary water check should 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.610
 hammer into the water why bother squeeze 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.170
 some juice look anton apple 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:00.240
 on live a good yellowish yes from his 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.700
 vegetable garden or for your tree and red 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.610
 natural live product before sedge then in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.130
 Generally the blood of this apple 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.700
 that is, we drink with this volume the blood of these 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.270
 apples 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.130
 if you eat an apple then fructose 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.810
 gradually released insulin 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.030
 no explosion and no 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.430
 catastrophic things with your 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.400
 the body does not happen all that part 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.440
 thinks everything goes to the detriment of all that 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.870
 initially everything was for his benefit 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.330
 and the apple is still very useful for 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.980
 losing people why because about this 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.500
 few people write but apples contain 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.100
 amazing substance uranium cake 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.290
 acid 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.510
 which helps normalize 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.040
 lipid fat metabolism inside 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.480
 a person and me to my patients 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.720
 I recommend to insist on the use 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.390
 daily 4 apples where both measure 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.180
 happens to be high now with the pulp of it 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.910
 fiber is some kind if you knew 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.770
 what is often added to this place 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.330
 pulp and eat your favorite product 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.600
 guess from three times 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.520
 soy exactly late whole protein which 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.420
 very actively used in 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.420
 juice production 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.160
 how does the general juice get an apple 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 never mind orange and mandarin and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.630
 process with special enzymes 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.489
 which allows you to soften it all and 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.070
 get the maximum amount of juice 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.570
 then this is all wrung out is added 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.489
 certain preservative it all 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.980
 barrels canned here already 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.850
 gets divorced spreads and so on and here 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:31.700
 not only are these substances that 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.970
 dissolve this apple flesh they are still 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.280
 and contained in the same court may 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.310
 create 3 dissolve one so i think 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.720
 that venus is the probability of that oh 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.580
 Alexey now let's 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.340
 answer questions that came to us 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.470
 by mail of hope permin town 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.900
 Priozersk asks winter vitamins 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.670
 the body lacks the need to drink vitamins 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.519
 and whether they can replace the juice from the package 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.350
 apple juice example if i tell you there 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.890
 there are no vitamins to me many are not 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.780
 will believe 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.090
 but this is exactly the way I can bring simple 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.430
 example if you make natural juice 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.739
 it starts to get dark before your eyes 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.660
 there are oxidation processes in it and here 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.280
 exactly the same neutralization processes 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.410
 vitamins go juices because when 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.720
 contact with the park upon contact with metal 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.430
 and it all runs through the iron pipes 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.220
 and 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.680
 galvanized iron there or stainless steel 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.900
 virtually no vitamins more than that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.030
 many manufacturers specifically then 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.039
 add there vitamins to boost 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.780
 vitamin activity of these products but 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:30.009
 these are the same synthetic vitamins that 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.100
 buy in a pharmacy 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:34.630
 is it worth overpaying for juice oh alexey 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.820
 Vladimir watches are very interesting 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.280
 talk and very scary very 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.280
 scary but always waiting for you thanks
