00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:38.250 
help them drawing so suppose we choose a
triangle<00:00:35.260> just<00:00:35.469> have<00:00:36.370> them<00:00:36.609> draw<00:00:37.089> a<00:00:37.390> series<00:00:37.929> of

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.260 
triangle just have them draw a series of

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.709

again and try to stress to them that
it's<00:00:43.719> important<00:00:44.260> to<00:00:44.319> get<00:00:44.559> them<00:00:44.739> all<00:00:44.949> to<00:00:45.309> look

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
it's important to get them all to look

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.989 
it's important to get them all to look
the<00:00:45.729> same<00:00:46.109> this<00:00:47.109> is<00:00:47.319> a<00:00:47.350> great<00:00:47.859> great<00:00:48.309> tip<00:00:48.729> for

exercise<00:00:56.949> for<00:00:57.459> kids<00:00:57.729> is<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.739> experiment<00:00:59.739> with

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
exercise for kids is to experiment with

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:02.039 
exercise for kids is to experiment with
different<00:01:00.249> patterns<00:01:00.940> so<00:01:01.600> if<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.809> have<00:01:02.019> a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
different patterns so if you have a

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.060 
different patterns so if you have a
sheet<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.409> paper<00:01:02.559> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.609> divide<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.270> paper

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
sheet of paper you can divide the paper

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.420 
sheet of paper you can divide the paper
just<00:01:06.070> like<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.640> into<00:01:06.940> different<00:01:07.480> squares

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
just like this into different squares

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.070 
just like this into different squares
just<00:01:09.430> like<00:01:09.640> so<00:01:09.880> they<00:01:10.090> don't<00:01:10.300> have<00:01:10.480> to<00:01:10.660> be<00:01:10.810> all

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
just like so they don't have to be all

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.740 
just like so they don't have to be all
equal<00:01:11.590> or<00:01:11.740> even<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.610> once<00:01:13.240> you<00:01:13.360> have<00:01:13.600> your

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
equal or even and once you have your

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.230 
equal or even and once you have your
squares<00:01:14.220> encourage<00:01:15.220> them<00:01:15.460> to<00:01:15.490> try<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:15.910> work

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
squares encourage them to try and work

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.680 
squares encourage them to try and work
with<00:01:16.510> different<00:01:16.720> lines<00:01:17.110> such<00:01:17.830> as<00:01:17.860> raindrops

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
with different lines such as raindrops

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.490 
with different lines such as raindrops
just<00:01:19.690> like<00:01:19.930> so<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:21.270> fill<00:01:22.270> in<00:01:22.480> each<00:01:22.720> one<00:01:23.050> in<00:01:23.350> a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
just like so and fill in each one in a

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.580 
just like so and fill in each one in a
different<00:01:23.680> shape<00:01:24.190> and<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.550> different<00:01:24.880> pattern

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
different shape and a different pattern

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.720 
different shape and a different pattern
squiggly<00:01:26.590> lines<00:01:26.830> are<00:01:27.130> good<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.490> practice

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
squiggly lines are good to practice

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.500 
squiggly lines are good to practice
these<00:01:28.800> are<00:01:29.800> all<00:01:29.980> really<00:01:30.700> really<00:01:30.970> great<00:01:31.210> things

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
these are all really really great things

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.600 
these are all really really great things
for<00:01:31.750> kids<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:32.260> encourage<00:01:33.040> them<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.310> learn<00:01:33.550> how

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
for kids to encourage them to learn how

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.230 
for kids to encourage them to learn how
to<00:01:33.820> draw<00:01:34.180> and<00:01:34.510> use<00:01:34.720> their<00:01:34.960> imagination

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
to draw and use their imagination

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.150 
to draw and use their imagination
another<00:01:37.240> idea<00:01:37.660> is<00:01:37.750> just<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.260> bring<00:01:38.440> diagonal

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
another idea is just to bring diagonal

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
another idea is just to bring diagonal
lines<00:01:39.400> across<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.860> get<00:01:42.070> them<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> box<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:42.970> in

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
lines across and get them to box it in

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.360 
lines across and get them to box it in
and<00:01:43.510> then<00:01:43.930> they<00:01:44.080> can<00:01:44.260> go<00:01:44.409> back<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:44.860> color<00:01:45.100> in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
and then they can go back and color in

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.700 
and then they can go back and color in
all<00:01:45.670> these<00:01:45.850> different<00:01:46.120> shapes<00:01:46.630> and<00:01:47.409> this<00:01:47.530> is<00:01:47.680> a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
all these different shapes and this is a

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.320 
all these different shapes and this is a
really<00:01:48.100> really<00:01:48.460> fun<00:01:48.610> project<00:01:49.360> for<00:01:49.570> kids<00:01:51.330> the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:52.330 
really really fun project for kids the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.899 
really really fun project for kids the
last<00:01:52.510> tip<00:01:52.870> I<00:01:53.050> think<00:01:53.080> which<00:01:54.040> would<00:01:54.310> really<00:01:54.640> help

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
last tip I think which would really help

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:57.240 
last tip I think which would really help
kids<00:01:55.300> to<00:01:55.600> develop<00:01:55.690> their<00:01:56.080> imagination<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:57.010> to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
kids to develop their imagination is to

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.300 
kids to develop their imagination is to
learn<00:01:57.370> how<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.640> draw<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.630> using<00:01:59.080> points<00:01:59.680> and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
learn how to draw with using points and

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.430 
learn how to draw with using points and
an<00:02:00.520> example<00:02:01.030> of<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:01.330> would<00:02:01.570> be<00:02:01.630> let's

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
an example of this would be let's

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.980 
an example of this would be let's
suppose<00:02:02.710> they<00:02:02.920> had<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> circle<00:02:03.700> get<00:02:04.659> them<00:02:04.810> to

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
suppose they had a circle get them to

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.590 
suppose they had a circle get them to
try<00:02:05.290> to<00:02:05.320> visualize<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:06.100> circle<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.060> draw<00:02:07.540> it

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
try to visualize a circle and draw it

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.459 
try to visualize a circle and draw it
using<00:02:08.170> pointillism<00:02:09.450> just<00:02:10.450> little<00:02:10.840> dots<00:02:11.079> going

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
using pointillism just little dots going

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:13.680 
using pointillism just little dots going
around<00:02:11.799> in<00:02:12.040> a<00:02:12.099> circle<00:02:12.129> this<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
around in a circle this is

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.610 
around in a circle this is
really<00:02:13.930> also<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.890> great<00:02:15.520> exercise<00:02:16.030> and<00:02:16.720> once

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
really also a great exercise and once
