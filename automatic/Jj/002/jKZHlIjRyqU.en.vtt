00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:56.909 
skin felt now with a cleansing milk I
did<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.340> good<00:01:54.549> job<00:01:54.609> in<00:01:55.499> removing<00:01:56.499> makeup<00:01:56.649> as

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:56.919

did a good job in removing makeup as
well<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.279> impurities<00:01:57.789> but<00:01:58.060> this<00:01:58.359> one<00:01:58.599> did<00:01:58.869> a

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
well and impurities but this one did a

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.739

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
much better job and I think it's because

initial<00:04:59.650> thoughts<00:05:00.190> on<00:05:00.490> Clarence<00:05:01.450> as<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.840> as<00:05:02.590> a

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
initial thoughts on Clarence as a as a

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.070 
initial thoughts on Clarence as a as a
product<00:05:03.100> as<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.370> skincare<00:05:03.730> line<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.450> hope<00:05:04.900> that

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
product as a skincare line I hope that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.860 
product as a skincare line I hope that
was<00:05:05.320> not<00:05:05.520> really<00:05:06.520> too<00:05:07.270> all<00:05:07.690> over<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.320> place

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
was not really too all over the place

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.330 
was not really too all over the place
I've<00:05:10.870> only<00:05:11.140> had<00:05:11.320> them<00:05:11.500> for<00:05:11.530> two<00:05:11.740> weeks<00:05:12.130> but

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
I've only had them for two weeks but

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.000 
I've only had them for two weeks but
I've<00:05:12.520> really<00:05:13.060> been<00:05:13.270> extremely<00:05:14.140> impressed<00:05:14.740> and

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
I've really been extremely impressed and

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.390 
I've really been extremely impressed and
like<00:05:15.700> I<00:05:15.820> said<00:05:15.880> I've<00:05:16.450> tried<00:05:16.990> Chanel<00:05:17.980> and<00:05:18.190> your

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
like I said I've tried Chanel and your

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.950 
like I said I've tried Chanel and your
skin<00:05:18.760> care<00:05:18.940> products<00:05:19.420> which<00:05:19.570> I<00:05:19.660> think<00:05:19.870> are

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 
skin care products which I think are

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:25.140 
skin care products which I think are
great<00:05:20.110> as<00:05:20.350> well<00:05:20.380> but<00:05:20.920> um<00:05:22.770> Clarence<00:05:23.940> being<00:05:24.940> a

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
great as well but um Clarence being a

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.720 
great as well but um Clarence being a
brand<00:05:25.390> that<00:05:25.630> basis<00:05:26.620> most<00:05:26.830> of<00:05:27.070> their<00:05:27.220> products

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
brand that basis most of their products

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.620 
brand that basis most of their products
on<00:05:28.170> research<00:05:29.170> it<00:05:30.070> really<00:05:30.550> really<00:05:30.760> shows<00:05:31.150> you
