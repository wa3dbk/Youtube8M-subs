care center in Nashville Tennessee we

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.860 
care center in Nashville Tennessee we
have<00:00:05.279> a<00:00:05.310> question<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.790> what<00:00:06.420> are<00:00:06.540> different

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
have a question that what are different

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.080 
have a question that what are different
types<00:00:07.080> of<00:00:07.259> lenses<00:00:07.500> now<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:08.670> not<00:00:08.790> talking

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
types of lenses now we're not talking

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.910 
types of lenses now we're not talking
about<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.360> materials<00:00:09.870> we're<00:00:10.469> talking<00:00:10.740> about

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
about the materials we're talking about

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.330 
about the materials we're talking about
how<00:00:11.400> they<00:00:11.610> function<00:00:12.349> we<00:00:13.349> can<00:00:13.559> have<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> set<00:00:14.250> of

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
how they function we can have a set of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.700 
how they function we can have a set of
glasses<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.389> just<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.049> distance<00:00:16.440> seeing

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
glasses that is just for distance seeing

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.760 
glasses that is just for distance seeing
if<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.340> person<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.820> nearsighted<00:00:18.510> then<00:00:19.140> or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
if a person is nearsighted then or

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.980 
if a person is nearsighted then or
myopic<00:00:20.340> then<00:00:20.580> typically<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.510> person<00:00:21.840> can

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
myopic then typically that person can

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
myopic then typically that person can
read<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.320> close<00:00:22.529> without<00:00:22.769> any<00:00:22.920> problem<00:00:23.340> but

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
read up close without any problem but

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.279 
read up close without any problem but
the<00:00:23.609> far<00:00:23.820> away<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.119> blurring<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.660> that's

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
the far away is blurring and that's

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.560 
the far away is blurring and that's
called<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.529> single<00:00:25.830> vision<00:00:26.010> lens<00:00:26.359> because<00:00:27.359> it's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
called a single vision lens because it's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
called a single vision lens because it's
for<00:00:27.840> one<00:00:28.050> particular<00:00:28.260> distance<00:00:28.920> now<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
for one particular distance now the

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.580 
for one particular distance now the
opposite<00:00:30.090> is<00:00:30.330> when<00:00:30.720> somebody<00:00:31.170> has<00:00:31.349> good

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
opposite is when somebody has good

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.470 
opposite is when somebody has good
distance<00:00:32.369> vision<00:00:32.730> but<00:00:32.880> they<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.090> presbyopia

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
distance vision but they have presbyopia

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.700 
distance vision but they have presbyopia
and<00:00:34.579> they<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.910> past<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.570> age<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> 40<00:00:37.200> or<00:00:37.290> 45

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
and they are past the age of 40 or 45

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.020 
and they are past the age of 40 or 45
typically<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.399> they<00:00:38.460> have<00:00:38.610> difficulty

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
typically and they have difficulty

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.790 
typically and they have difficulty
seeing<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.329> close<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.680> have

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
seeing up close and so they can have

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.440 
seeing up close and so they can have
glasses<00:00:41.219> which<00:00:41.399> are<00:00:41.579> single<00:00:41.790> vision<00:00:42.210> for

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
glasses which are single vision for

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.100 
glasses which are single vision for
reading<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:44.250> they<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.940> them<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.690> they

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
reading if they have them on and they

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
reading if they have them on and they
look<00:00:46.590> far<00:00:46.829> away<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.160> will<00:00:47.250> be<00:00:47.430> blurry<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:48.239> if

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
look far away it will be blurry but if

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.139 
look far away it will be blurry but if
they<00:00:48.450> look<00:00:48.570> over<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> top<00:00:49.370> which<00:00:50.370> for

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
they look over the top which for

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.380 
they look over the top which for
instance<00:00:51.420> if<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.719> put<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:51.989> my<00:00:52.170> pair<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:54.180> go<00:00:54.210> over

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
instance if I put on my pair to go over

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.090 
instance if I put on my pair to go over
top<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.110> see<00:00:55.260> fine<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> then<00:00:55.980> if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
top like this you see fine and then if

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.220 
top like this you see fine and then if
you<00:00:56.219> have<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.399> whole<00:00:56.550> thing<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:56.850> reading

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
you have the whole thing for reading

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.540 
you have the whole thing for reading
everything<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.500> clear<00:00:58.829> through<00:00:59.010> here<00:00:59.250> but<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
everything is clear through here but the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.270 
everything is clear through here but the
far<00:00:59.760> away<00:00:59.879> is<00:01:00.480> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.899> blurring<00:01:01.280> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
far away is going to be blurring the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.490 
far away is going to be blurring the
other<00:01:02.430> type<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.699> lens<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.510> progressive<00:01:04.049> lens

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
other type of lens is a progressive lens

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.830 
other type of lens is a progressive lens
which<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.670> frequently<00:01:06.330> called<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.689> know

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
which is a frequently called to know

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
which is a frequently called to know
line<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.010> pair<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
line that is what this pair actually is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.170 
line that is what this pair actually is
where<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.500> top<00:01:10.710> part<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:11.760> distance

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
where the the top part is for distance

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
where the the top part is for distance
and<00:01:12.450> then<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.500> go<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
and then as you go down there's a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
and then as you go down there's a
channel<00:01:14.549> where<00:01:14.820> things<00:01:15.180> will<00:01:15.780> be<00:01:16.500> in<00:01:16.619> focus

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
channel where things will be in focus

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.260 
channel where things will be in focus
closer<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.340> closer<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.790> there's<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.000> bottom

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
closer and closer and there's a bottom

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.899 
closer and closer and there's a bottom
window<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:19.049> order<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.350> see<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.430> advantage<00:01:20.759> of

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
window in order to see the advantage of

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.289 
window in order to see the advantage of
this<00:01:21.060> type<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:23.189> no<00:01:23.340> line<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
this type is that there's no line that

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.120 
this type is that there's no line that
when<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> walk<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.990> don't<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> line<00:01:25.619> when

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
when you walk you don't see a line when

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.499 
when you walk you don't see a line when
you<00:01:26.220> drive<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.580> don't<00:01:26.670> see<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.000> line<00:01:27.180> and

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
you drive you don't see the line and

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.179 
you drive you don't see the line and
cosmetically<00:01:28.020> it's<00:01:28.259> more<00:01:28.530> appealing<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:29.040> look

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
cosmetically it's more appealing we look

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.490 
cosmetically it's more appealing we look
younger

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
younger

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
younger
it's<00:01:31.500> disadvantage<00:01:32.310> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.970> typically<00:01:33.930> you

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
it's disadvantage is that typically you

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.289 
it's disadvantage is that typically you
have<00:01:34.200> six<00:01:34.530> or<00:01:34.770> eight<00:01:35.130> inches<00:01:35.460> of<00:01:35.610> width<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:36.030> see

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
have six or eight inches of width to see

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.230 
have six or eight inches of width to see
and<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:37.350> have<00:01:37.530> maybe<00:01:37.740> five<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.850> seven<00:01:39.150> inches

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and you have maybe five to seven inches

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.590 
and you have maybe five to seven inches

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
which is this is called a flat top

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
which is this is called a flat top
bifocal<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.460> looks<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.880> a

bifocal it's the one that looks like a
Halfmoon<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.540> its<00:01:51.689> side<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.369> the<00:01:53.369> top<00:01:53.579> part<00:01:53.790> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
Halfmoon on its side and the top part is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.609 
Halfmoon on its side and the top part is
for<00:01:54.180> distance<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.140> bottom<00:01:55.439> window

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
for distance and in the bottom window

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.730 
for distance and in the bottom window
gives<00:01:56.520> me<00:01:56.759> about<00:01:56.969> 15<00:01:57.479> inches<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.869> width<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.500> see

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
gives me about 15 inches of width to see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.730 
gives me about 15 inches of width to see
which<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.880> which<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> better<00:02:01.140> range<00:02:01.500> of

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
which is which is a better range of

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.649 
which is which is a better range of
vision<00:02:01.920> on<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> up-close<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.729> more<00:02:03.420> depth

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
vision on the up-close and more depth

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.810 
vision on the up-close and more depth
and<00:02:04.140> then<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.460> thing<00:02:05.700> that's

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and then the other thing that's

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.119 
and then the other thing that's
different<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.509> type<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.780> glass<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.649> if

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
different about this type of glass is if

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.820 
different about this type of glass is if
I<00:02:08.220> get<00:02:08.369> outside<00:02:08.520> of<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:09.149> Halfmoon<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.560> floor

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
I get outside of that Halfmoon the floor

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.670 
I get outside of that Halfmoon the floor
is<00:02:10.950> clear<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.550> there's<00:02:11.970> no<00:02:12.090> distortion

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
is clear and there's no distortion

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
is clear and there's no distortion
with<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.159> type<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:14.849> progressive

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
with the type that is the progressive

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.899 
with the type that is the progressive
even<00:02:16.409> in<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.769> very<00:02:16.920> best<00:02:17.220> ones<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.549> we<00:02:17.730> have

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
even in the very best ones that we have

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.509 
even in the very best ones that we have
in<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.209> fourth<00:02:18.420> generation<00:02:18.450> today<00:02:19.519> because

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
in the fourth generation today because

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.940 
in the fourth generation today because
there's<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.819> steeper<00:02:21.569> grind<00:02:21.870> done<00:02:22.470> on<00:02:22.799> the

there's a steeper grind done on the

there's a steeper grind done on the
bottom<00:02:23.310> part<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:24.000> further<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.569> we<00:02:24.659> go

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
bottom part the further down there we go

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.350 
bottom part the further down there we go
where<00:02:25.530> my<00:02:25.650> hands<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.459> not<00:02:26.730> clear<00:02:27.090> it's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
where my hands are is not clear it's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.059 
where my hands are is not clear it's
it's<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.689> bit<00:02:27.900> blurry<00:02:28.110> and<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> nature

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
it's a bit blurry and that's the nature

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.619 
it's a bit blurry and that's the nature
of<00:02:29.220> progressives<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.269> don't<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.569> a

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
of progressives that you don't have a

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.170 
of progressives that you don't have a
clear<00:02:31.290> floor<00:02:33.379> that<00:02:34.379> being<00:02:34.590> said<00:02:34.829> if<00:02:35.519> someone

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
clear floor that being said if someone

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.059 
clear floor that being said if someone
truly<00:02:36.450> needs<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.780> bifocal<00:02:37.349> 90<00:02:37.680> percent<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.980> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
truly needs a bifocal 90 percent of the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.430 
truly needs a bifocal 90 percent of the
time<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.579> get<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> progressive<00:02:39.359> and<00:02:39.599> ten

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
time they get the progressive and ten

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.580 
time they get the progressive and ten
percent<00:02:40.709> of<00:02:40.829> time<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.579> get<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.879> line<00:02:42.090> type

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
percent of time they get the line type

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.649 
percent of time they get the line type
that<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.799> either<00:02:44.010> because<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:45.269> prefer<00:02:45.629> it

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:45.659 
that is either because they prefer it

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:46.160 
that is either because they prefer it
that<00:02:45.810> way

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
that way

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.619 
that way
one<00:02:46.709> way<00:02:46.859> or<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:46.980> other<00:02:47.069> or<00:02:47.579> you<00:02:48.450> know<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
one way or the other or you know the

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.379 
one way or the other or you know the
bifocal<00:02:49.019> with<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:49.799> line<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.370> certainly<00:02:50.730> more

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
bifocal with the line is certainly more

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.750 
bifocal with the line is certainly more
economical<00:02:52.019> so<00:02:52.739> those<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.400> three<00:02:53.609> types

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
economical so those are the three types

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.810 
economical so those are the three types
of<00:02:54.000> classes<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.510> we<00:02:54.629> have
