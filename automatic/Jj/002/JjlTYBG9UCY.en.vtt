00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
use has triple a batteries and the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.149 
use has triple a batteries and the
reason<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.570> wanted<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.290> larger<00:01:43.950> one

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
reason I wanted to get this larger one

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
reason I wanted to get this larger one
was<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.540> um<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.189> one<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.579> kitchen<00:01:47.909> my

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
was because um the one in the kitchen my

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.789 
was because um the one in the kitchen my
little<00:01:48.689> lantern<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.350> have<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.710> the

little lantern that I have in the
kitchen<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.060> larger<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.689> do

kitchen I think the larger one would do

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.100 
kitchen I think the larger one would do
better<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.229> there<00:01:52.409> so<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.610> sucks<00:01:54.210> now<00:01:55.020> I'm

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
sugars so this one says that it's all

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.500 
sugars so this one says that it's all
natural<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.459> great<00:02:20.640> taste<00:02:20.970> dissolves

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.570 
natural with a great taste dissolves
quickly<00:02:21.690> perfect<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.470> coffee<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.069> it's

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
quickly perfect and coffee and it's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.259

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
called Zoka pure cane sugar it's non-gmo

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.569 
called Zoka pure cane sugar it's non-gmo
project<00:02:27.540> verified<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:29.099> it<00:02:29.190> comes<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.489> a

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
project verified and it comes with a

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:32.330 
project verified and it comes with a
hundred<00:02:29.970> packets<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.049> the<00:02:31.829> sugar<00:02:32.069> in<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> raw

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
hundred packets so the sugar in the raw

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.420 
hundred packets so the sugar in the raw
I<00:02:32.730> think<00:02:33.060> comes<00:02:33.269> with<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.599> 25<00:02:34.379> packets<00:02:35.159> for<00:02:35.370> a

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
I think comes with like 25 packets for a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.640 
I think comes with like 25 packets for a
dollar<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:36.420> one<00:02:36.599> comes<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.989> hundred<00:02:37.349> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
dollar this one comes with a hundred and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.710 
dollar this one comes with a hundred and
if<00:02:37.980> it's<00:02:38.159> just<00:02:38.579> as<00:02:38.700> good<00:02:38.730> as<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.209> sugar<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.599> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
if it's just as good as the sugar in the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.960 
if it's just as good as the sugar in the
raw<00:02:39.750> then<00:02:40.319> I'm<00:02:41.040> really<00:02:41.400> excited<00:02:41.670> because
