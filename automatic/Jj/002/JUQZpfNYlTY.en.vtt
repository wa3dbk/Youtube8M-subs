00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.549 

what<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.399> interesting<00:00:47.640> about<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.530> sort<00:00:49.530> of

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
what is interesting about this sort of

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.189 
what is interesting about this sort of
collaboration<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:51.079> client<00:00:52.079> like

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
collaboration is that a client like

Louis Vuitton can get the most out of an
art<00:00:55.260> college<00:00:55.500> where<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.190> students<00:00:56.609> come<00:00:56.820> from

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940

something<00:01:03.120> different<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.480> bring<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.700 

this<00:01:12.930> year<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:13.260> want<00:01:13.410> to<00:01:13.500> do<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.620> a<00:01:13.650> little

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
this year we want to do it a little

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.500 
this year we want to do it a little
differently<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.880> rather<00:01:15.090> than<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
differently so rather than using the

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.330 
differently so rather than using the
same<00:01:15.750> formula<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.500> working<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.010> an<00:01:17.130> artist

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
same formula of working with an artist

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.730 
same formula of working with an artist
every<00:01:17.850> year<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.510> year<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.990> challenge<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
every year this year the challenge is to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.160 
every year this year the challenge is to
work<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.160> some<00:01:20.370> new<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:21.180> upcoming<00:01:21.420> talent

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
work with some new and upcoming talent

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.040 
work with some new and upcoming talent
we<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.130> there's<00:01:23.310> incredible<00:01:24.050> talents

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
we know that there's incredible talents

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.480 
we know that there's incredible talents
here<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.680> come<00:01:25.890> through<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.190> school

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
here that have come through this school

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.560 
here that have come through this school
that<00:01:27.210> are<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.720> school<00:01:27.990> today<00:01:29.420> we<00:01:30.420> also

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
that are in this school today we also

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.250 
that are in this school today we also
know<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.830> is<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.070> school<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.580> drains

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
know that it is a school that drains

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.680 
know that it is a school that drains
international<00:01:34.260> students<00:01:34.880> so<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.330> thought<00:01:36.510> it

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
international students so we thought it

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.150 
international students so we thought it
would<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.869> interesting<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.530> have<00:01:37.830> very

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
would be interesting to have very

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.270 
would be interesting to have very
different<00:01:38.550> points<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> views<00:01:39.860> looking<00:01:40.860> into

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
different points of views looking into

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.760 
different points of views looking into
the<00:01:42.090> design<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.540> windows<00:01:42.840> at<00:01:43.410> this<00:01:43.590> moment

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the design of the windows at this moment

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.469 
the design of the windows at this moment
in<00:01:43.950> time<00:01:43.979> we're<00:01:44.280> looking<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.670> one<00:01:44.910> student

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
in time we're looking for one student

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.210 
in time we're looking for one student
who<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:46.020> produce<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.500> windows<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:46.860> works

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
who will produce the windows that works

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.190 
who will produce the windows that works
around<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.640> world<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.540> could<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
around the world but it could be that

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.889 
around the world but it could be that
depending<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.770> what<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.160> see<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.970> we<00:01:51.090> choose

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
depending on what we see that we choose

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.380 
depending on what we see that we choose
more<00:01:52.170> than<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.380> idea<00:01:52.680> when<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.610> think<00:01:54.149> no<00:01:54.270> he

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
more than one idea when you think no he

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.840 
more than one idea when you think no he
was<00:01:54.509> only<00:01:54.600> definitely<00:01:55.140> seen<00:01:55.350> luxury<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.039> so

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
was only definitely seen luxury and so

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.639 
was only definitely seen luxury and so
that<00:01:57.479> was<00:01:57.600> very<00:01:57.660> interesting<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:58.350> us<00:01:58.440> because

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that was very interesting for us because

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.880 
that was very interesting for us because
it's<00:01:58.860> such<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> big<00:01:59.280> name<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.670> work<00:01:59.820> with

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
it's such a big name to work with

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.460 
it's such a big name to work with
it's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> big<00:02:02.160> symbol<00:02:02.539> it<00:02:03.539> does<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.110> don't<00:02:04.200> know

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470 
it's a big symbol it does I don't know

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's a big symbol it does I don't know
if<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.100> doesn't<00:02:05.280> mean<00:02:05.580> lots<00:02:05.880> for<00:02:06.090> me<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.270> mean<00:02:06.539> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
if it doesn't mean lots for me I mean it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
if it doesn't mean lots for me I mean it
means<00:02:07.080> graphically<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.950> know<00:02:08.070> the<00:02:08.220> monogram

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
means graphically you know the monogram

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:26.050 
means graphically you know the monogram
is<00:02:08.850> already<00:02:09.600> part<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.050> pop<00:02:10.320> culture

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.930 

but<00:02:27.060> it's<00:02:27.240> always<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.720> interesting<00:02:27.960> to

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
but it's always very interesting to

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.390 
but it's always very interesting to
explain<00:02:30.140> what<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> brand<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.680> about<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
explain what the brand is about and to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.050 
explain what the brand is about and to
see<00:02:32.700> what<00:02:33.270> other<00:02:33.510> people<00:02:34.580> think<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> brand

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
see what other people think of the brand

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
see what other people think of the brand
from<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.270> outside<00:02:36.720> so<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.320> always<00:02:37.590> throughout

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
from the outside so we always throughout

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.550 
from the outside so we always throughout
the<00:02:38.400> year<00:02:38.610> we<00:02:38.730> always<00:02:39.180> use<00:02:39.450> outside<00:02:39.780> freelance
