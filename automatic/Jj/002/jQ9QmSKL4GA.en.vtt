a<00:01:21.420> lot<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.810> my<00:01:22.020> students<00:01:22.470> get<00:01:22.650> confused<00:01:22.680> by

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
a lot of my students get confused by

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429 
a lot of my students get confused by
that<00:01:23.549> because<00:01:23.820> they<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.689> why<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.229> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
that because they say you know why is it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.219 
that because they say you know why is it
back<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> front<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:27.060> real<00:01:27.299> guitar<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.930> sixth

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
back to front on a real guitar the sixth

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.780 
back to front on a real guitar the sixth
string<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.590> at<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.799> top<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> first<00:01:29.579> rings

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
string is at the top and the first rings

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
string is at the top and the first rings
at<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.939> bottom<00:01:30.360> so<00:01:30.540> why<00:01:30.689> did<00:01:30.869> they<00:01:30.900> do<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
at the bottom so why did they do it the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.770 
at the bottom so why did they do it the
other<00:01:31.380> way<00:01:31.530> round<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.729> answer<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.720> don't

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
other way round and my answer is I don't

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.410 
other way round and my answer is I don't
know<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.229> didn't<00:01:34.710> design<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> system<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:36.030> what

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
know I didn't design the system but what

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.910 
know I didn't design the system but what
I<00:01:36.450> will<00:01:36.600> say<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:37.170> worry<00:01:37.409> about<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I will say is don't worry about it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
I will say is don't worry about it
