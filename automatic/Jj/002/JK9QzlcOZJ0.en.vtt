I was coming back from South America

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
I was coming back from South America
Central<00:00:21.240> America<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.900> was<00:00:22.560> on<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.710> plane<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.340> two

Central America I was on a plane for two

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.970 
Central America I was on a plane for two
and<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> half<00:00:23.699> episodes<00:00:24.529> that<00:00:25.529> didn't<00:00:25.800> work<00:00:25.949> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and a half episodes that didn't work so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.370 
and a half episodes that didn't work so
we<00:00:26.640> went<00:00:26.820> back<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.390> crashed<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.869> plane<00:00:28.140> and

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
we went back and crashed the plane and

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.470 
we went back and crashed the plane and
two<00:00:28.560> episodes<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:31.619> will<00:00:31.859> work<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.340> if<00:00:33.090> if

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.930 
one and I realized I have to go to Paris

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to get a suspect or a clue or a piece of

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
to get a suspect or a clue or a piece of
evidence<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:44.450> will<00:00:45.450> get<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.020> train<00:00:46.230> at<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
evidence I will get on the train at the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.770 
evidence I will get on the train at the
end<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.649> episode<00:00:46.739> one<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:48.329> get<00:00:48.480> off<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
end of episode one I will get off the

end of episode one I will get off the
train<00:00:48.989> at<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.170> beginning<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> episode<00:00:49.739> two

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
train at the beginning of episode two

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
train at the beginning of episode two
and<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:51.000> will<00:00:51.149> speed<00:00:51.420> up<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:52.440> all

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
and the time will speed up and then all

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.380 
and the time will speed up and then all
of<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.010> episodes<00:00:53.129> will<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.760> in<00:00:53.910> real<00:00:54.120> time

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
of the episodes will be in real time

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.959 
of the episodes will be in real time
just<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:54.930> they<00:00:55.079> were<00:00:55.199> before<00:00:55.550> but<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.670> allows

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
just like they were before but it allows

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.580 
just like they were before but it allows
the<00:00:57.270> writers<00:00:58.039> to<00:00:59.039> be<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.430> much<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.850> specific

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
the writers to be so much more specific

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.520 
the writers to be so much more specific
and<00:01:01.590> acute<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.399> their<00:01:02.670> writing<00:01:03.320> that<00:01:04.320> each

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and acute with their writing that each

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.950 
and acute with their writing that each
episode<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.220> we've<00:01:05.339> been<00:01:05.460> doing<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.570> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
episode that we've been doing now is so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420 
episode that we've been doing now is so
much<00:01:07.110> more<00:01:07.260> intense<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:07.979> much<00:01:08.100> stronger

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
much more intense and so much stronger

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.890 
much more intense and so much stronger
because<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.939> don't<00:01:09.119> have<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.600> all<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
because we don't have to do all the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.679 
because we don't have to do all the
legwork<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.530> set<00:01:10.830> up<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> next<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.600> do

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
legwork to set up the next one we can do

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.969 
legwork to set up the next one we can do
all<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> traveling<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.650> moving

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
all the traveling and all the moving

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
all the traveling and all the moving
around<00:01:15.619> in<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:17.340> gaps<00:01:17.520> between<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.030> episodes

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
around in the gaps between the episodes

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.480 
around in the gaps between the episodes
I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.710> challenge<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.310> always

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
I think the challenge is always

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.410 
I think the challenge is always
inherently<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.330> same<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:23.130> know<00:01:23.250> 24<00:01:24.000> was<00:01:24.180> very

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
inherently the same you know 24 was very

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
inherently the same you know 24 was very
successful<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.259> very<00:01:25.439> beginning<00:01:25.890> so

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
successful from the very beginning so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.649 
successful from the very beginning so
how<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> make<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> second<00:01:27.180> season<00:01:27.479> better

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
how do you make the second season better

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.539 
how do you make the second season better
than<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.960> first<00:01:28.170> how<00:01:28.920> do<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.070> make<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> third

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
than the first how do you make the third

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.600 
than the first how do you make the third
season<00:01:29.880> better<00:01:30.060> than<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> second<00:01:30.860> and<00:01:31.860> we've

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
season better than the second and we've

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
season better than the second and we've
been<00:01:32.790> successful<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.390> times<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.229> less

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
been successful at times and and less

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.580 
been successful at times and and less
successful<00:01:35.220> other<00:01:35.430> times<00:01:35.810> I've<00:01:36.810> never<00:01:37.350> felt

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
successful other times I've never felt

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.520 
successful other times I've never felt
we<00:01:37.740> made<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> bad<00:01:38.250> season<00:01:38.640> of<00:01:38.939> 24<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:40.350> there

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
we made a bad season of 24 but there

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.590 
we made a bad season of 24 but there
were<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:40.829> seasons<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.670> had<00:01:41.880> very

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
were some seasons that just had very

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.510 
were some seasons that just had very
special<00:01:42.899> ideas<00:01:43.439> from<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.890> writers<00:01:44.220> there

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
special ideas from the writers there

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.350 
special ideas from the writers there
were<00:01:44.640> extraordinary<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:46.200> having<00:01:46.500> the

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
were extraordinary I think having the

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.310 
were extraordinary I think having the
responsibility<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.390> doing<00:01:48.659> 12<00:01:48.869> episodes

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
responsibility of doing 12 episodes

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.460 
responsibility of doing 12 episodes
compared<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> 24<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.090> big<00:01:51.570> difference<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
compared to 24 is a big difference and a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.330 
compared to 24 is a big difference and a
huge<00:01:52.740> step<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.280> right<00:01:53.369> direction<00:01:55.340> we

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
huge step in the right direction we

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.920 
huge step in the right direction we
still<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> same<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.540> very<00:01:57.750> diverse

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
still have the same kind of very diverse

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.899 
still have the same kind of very diverse
political<00:01:58.590> discussions<00:01:59.100> within<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> context

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

of<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.430> story<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:01.140> so<00:03:01.440> for<00:03:01.650> all<00:03:01.769> of<00:03:01.799> these

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
of the story and so for all of these

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.030 
of the story and so for all of these
reasons<00:03:02.450> he's<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> much<00:03:03.720> harder<00:03:04.049> character<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
reasons he's a much harder character and

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.110 
reasons he's a much harder character and
as<00:03:05.280> he<00:03:05.459> begins<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:06.090> reenact<00:03:06.680> kind<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:08.120> starts

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
as he begins to reenact kind of starts

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.640 
as he begins to reenact kind of starts
to<00:03:09.209> deal<00:03:09.510> with<00:03:09.690> characters<00:03:10.230> that<00:03:10.380> are<00:03:10.470> more

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
to deal with characters that are more

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.949 
to deal with characters that are more
familiar<00:03:10.799> like<00:03:11.280> Chloe<00:03:13.849> Kim<00:03:14.849> ravers<00:03:15.209> character

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.069 

that<00:03:18.959> rock<00:03:19.319> that<00:03:19.620> he's<00:03:19.769> become<00:03:20.160> starts<00:03:20.639> to

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
that rock that he's become starts to

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.759 
that rock that he's become starts to
split<00:03:22.079> apart<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.910> so<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.299> I<00:03:25.019> think<00:03:25.680> the

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
split apart and so for that I think the

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.870 
split apart and so for that I think the
character<00:03:26.130> for<00:03:26.280> me<00:03:26.400> has<00:03:26.489> been<00:03:26.669> very

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
character for me has been very

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.250 
character for me has been very
interesting<00:03:27.389> to<00:03:27.419> play<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.900> hope<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.230> is

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
interesting to play and I hope it is

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.720 
interesting to play and I hope it is
interesting<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:28.980> an<00:03:29.099> audience<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.579> watch

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
interesting for an audience to watch

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.150 
interesting for an audience to watch
well<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.389> think<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:31.139> large<00:03:31.380> part<00:03:31.500> for<00:03:31.919> all<00:03:32.010> of

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
well I think in large part for all of

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.289 
well I think in large part for all of
the<00:03:32.250> reasons<00:03:32.400> I<00:03:32.669> just<00:03:32.730> described<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.980> know

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
the reasons I just described you know

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.860 
the reasons I just described you know
for<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.389> people<00:03:36.510> that<00:03:36.660> have<00:03:36.840> watched<00:03:37.019> 24<00:03:37.590> I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
for the people that have watched 24 I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.780 
for the people that have watched 24 I
believe<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:40.530> this<00:03:40.709> new<00:03:40.950> season<00:03:41.220> has<00:03:41.549> all<00:03:41.760> of

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
believe that this new season has all of

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.819 
believe that this new season has all of
the<00:03:42.000> potential<00:03:42.510> to<00:03:42.930> be<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.200> best<00:03:43.380> season<00:03:43.560> that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
the potential to be the best season that

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.589 
the potential to be the best season that
we've<00:03:43.950> ever<00:03:44.130> done<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.609> for<00:03:45.120> people<00:03:45.359> that

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
we've ever done and for people that

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.970 
we've ever done and for people that
haven't<00:03:45.810> watched<00:03:46.109> 24<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:47.190> think<00:03:48.980> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
haven't watched 24 I think the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.069 
haven't watched 24 I think the
characters<00:03:50.430> are<00:03:50.720> unbelievably<00:03:51.720> interesting

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
characters are unbelievably interesting

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.400 
characters are unbelievably interesting
