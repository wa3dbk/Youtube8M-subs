00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.970
 hello my name is ronaldo júnior esse 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.730
 episode number 22 of the bible blog was 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.769
 star and this week 's theme is a Christian 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.420
 can attend secular shows 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.340
 I sincerely thought that this matter 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.170
 had been exhausted even because I said one 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.910
 about the Christian's interaction with the 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.949
 music on video number 5 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.289
 but a lot of people have gone into 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.330
 contact so saying more about 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.590
 that the customer should be in the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.689
 rock in Rio 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 so here trying to talk a little 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.329
 more of what the word of God speaks 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:38.309
 about it when we talk about any 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.079
 thing that involves culture 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.420
 we have to understand that it is a precept 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.120
 that must be respected and this 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.440
 mayor is everything that does not come from 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.320
 faith is sin 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.320
 remembering that faith is the certainty about 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.730
 even if it is not possible to 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.280
 prove these facts in a visible way 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.020
 if a person has doubts about the 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 legitimacy of participating in a 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 determined event of a show then with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.559
 certainty should not participate 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.430
 we do not live under the law anymore 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.200
 it is not through obedience to a series of 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.340
 commandments that the salvation of God 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
 manifest in us 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 it is the exact opposite by 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.720
 oppression of God's salvation that is 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 manifest in us 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.939
 we are now slaves of Christ by the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.220
 law of freedom or we were freed 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.320
 to live all things without 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.750
 if we corrupt any of them 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.659
 salvation is no more for what we 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.409
 we do more for what we are one 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.939
 true Christian has the duty to 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.850
 manifest the values ​​of the kingdom of God 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.640
 that in everything he does is in everything 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.159
 he is but like the Christians who are the light 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.200
 of the world can enlighten those who 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 they are living in darkness if we are 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.970
 in cloistered data within ghettos 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.829
 trying to get away from all 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.619
 the things that could supposedly 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.990
 to contaminate does not make sense to light 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.090
 light and hide the lamp under the 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 bed and do not come with this 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.899
 that the Christian's duty would be to be 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.629
 certain places with a view to 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.970
 evangelize for the love of god people 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.540
 The duty of the Christian is to understand the maxim 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.420
 taught 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.260
 that it is enough for the disciple to be like 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.790
 your master 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.680
 then looking to our master to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.560
 people will realize that he was walking along 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.299
 of prostitutes with parties and 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.250
 people who consumed a lot of drink 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.290
 alcoholic and means that Jesus 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.359
 corrupted with any of these things of 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.700
 way, with the exception of the 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.709
 prostitutes obviously he even consumed 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.049
 of all other things and Jesus is 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.629
 becomes the light of the world when he teaches 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:42.599
 people how to live in for god 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.030
 within his own realities he 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.450
 did not create a rescue mission to the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.480
 lost but he visibly took the 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.459
 values ​​the lives of those people 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.470
 including Jesus did not allow many 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.269
 to follow them at that moment but he 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.099
 said that these people should now 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.769
 to share what they have received from God 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.260
 with other people within the 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.359
 where he always lived the mission 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.159
 of the Christian in the world is to teach inpi 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:10.620
 How to actually have fun 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.470
 we should teach people how to consume 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.970
 the drink without being consumed by it 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.280
 we must teach the world how to 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.659
 overflow with joy for the most 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.970
 simple of this life 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.489
 Our mission is to rescue what we 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.250
 lost on account of sin through 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.470
 manifestation of God's grace in us in 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.120
 pastor but if I'm a rock show 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.609
 in Rio, for example, I'm going to sin 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.889
 So my friend, do not go, I admire your 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.650
 sincerity and I think it very prudent 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:40.290
 you do not get too close to things that 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.500
 they do bad but do not make your limitation 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.229
 a rule for the other individuals who 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.479
 understand the grace of Jesus Christ 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:50.729
 better than you is not because you are 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:53.010
 weak that all people are weak 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.510
 it's not because you're an addict that all 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.790
 people will suffer the same way 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.260
 it's not because you're a pervert that all 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.540
 people should proceed from the same 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.609
 way you perceived the purpose of the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.739
 teaching of the gospel in the life of the Christian 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.780
 then it is to make all people 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.689
 learn to be free 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.560
 maybe you are not yet mature 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:12.720
 enough to attend certain 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.819
 environments but what if the gospel 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.609
 is producing in your life is not 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.669
 empowering you to be more and more 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.200
 light that illuminates the world without you 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.139
 as clothes with the things of this world 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.780
 so my friend you 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.270
 Stagnant in your faith do not go a show for 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.939
 evangelize people to be friends with 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.310
 people truly show with their 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:36.199
 own life what no pamphlet 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.449
 in this world is able to teach 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.499
 remember the prayer of Jesus for your 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.479
 disciples 

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:43.310
 he said that he would not look so father 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.349
 but to take them out of the world, 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.659
 get rid of the evil that this might be 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.860
 Our prayer is but I may like the 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.409
 a boy 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.060
 We'll let you I cant 

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:55.159
 I give more reasons to like Aero 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.840
 middle than from before the throne then 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:58.969
 Let's leave this chatter there. 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.580
 May God be glorified in all that 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:02.389
 we have in everything we are and in everything we 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.279
 We do
