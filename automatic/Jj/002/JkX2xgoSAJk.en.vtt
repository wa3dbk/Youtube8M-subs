00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
this end section goes inside the fabric

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.249 
this end section goes inside the fabric
with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> stick<00:01:35.299> once<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.509> gets<00:01:36.659> going<00:01:36.750> you

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
tube once you get to this point we go

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
out then hold the inside fabric with one

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.719

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
the other hand and the tube is now

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.050 
the other hand and the tube is now
right-side<00:02:08.720> out<00:02:09.020> it's<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:10.039> super<00:02:10.459> quick<00:02:10.700> trick

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
