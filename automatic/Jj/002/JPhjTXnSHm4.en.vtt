00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.710
 hello everyone tight where we find ourselves 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 today for a new concept of 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.839
 video 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 I have an idea that trots in my head 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.939
 for a few days so I'm going to you 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.260
 say I will offer you an idea you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.039
 then tell me what you 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 think if I continue or not so that's it 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.760
 he is coming 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.500
 I imagine as such admits right 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.270
 leave out beauty products 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.520
 makeup especially when one is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.590
 passionate about makeup or products 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.960
 of beauty that we accumulate a lot 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 months is actually time in 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.250
 time when you put away a drawer or 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.629
 a dresser or or what do I know 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.579
 you happen to come across a product 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.110
 to tell you but but of course 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.030
 I have it in our drawers why I do not 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.829
 do not use it and in fact what 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.570
 I would like to do now it's you 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 propose at the beginning of each month 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.199
 products that I promise myself in 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.719
 somehow use or finish 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.309
 for years over the month so if you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.659
 the idea please do not hesitate to 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 resume if you do if you are 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.990
 youtube an honest fact that eighteen of 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.090
 videos that the idea you like frankly 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.100
 do it that would make me very happy 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.299
 so I'm starting I'm going to really do 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.560
 a fairly short selection of product and 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.479
 every month i will try to you 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.299
 do that so products that I put 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.950
 aside and that I would like to use for 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.780
 this month so we start with 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.430
 but I called that but promised the month 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 if you have another name idea 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.720
 do not hesitate I pass how my 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 products of the month it's a bit weird 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.049
 but I found I did not find 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.570
 other names for this genre 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.420
 of videos so so this month aside 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.640
 care I would really like to finish a 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 sweet brand shampoo nature that 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.990
 I love who is very good but I have 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.439
 set aside for other shampoo 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.299
 mourning of the pond de2 at ayerbe and 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:56.100
 especially so that's the shampoo of his 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.619
 family with birch sap 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.210
 he is very sweet the only one small 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.520
 downside actually it's the smell that I do not 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.120
 not very foolish that it smells 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.350
 the plants but it's not very 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.300
 it's true that now I'm a little 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.880
 accustomed to the smell of coconut as 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.010
 the like shampoo to ours at co2 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.380
 meaning stops where the berry shampoo 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.710
 crowd of now solution that I use in 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.910
 this moment so here it is really necessary 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.800
 has been a year that he's in my room 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 bath this shampoo really must I 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.610
 mobilizes to use it is really to 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 try to finish it I will arrive 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.910
 maybe not finish it in a month 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.950
 but I think I'll put all 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.730
 the family on it and what am I going 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.260
 do I think I 'm going too 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.700
 use it as a shower gel because we 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.780
 can finally I think you know it 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.520
 but we can very well use a 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.870
 shampoo as a shower gel and 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.700
 vice versa then care side a balm 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.350
 for the body that I have in my room 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.260
 bath since the beginning of the winter of 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.870
 chandler farm with coconut and 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.010
 banana it smells good but 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.960
 when there is a threat and I am a 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.670
 fat lazy after the shower I 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.470
 often the first name woman I'm not a 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.090
 big pissy plague it's not that it's 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.370
 that in fact I do not really like to apply myself 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.120
 body milk there especially it's 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.010
 a cream not too greasy it's like a 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 body butter but it's not too fat 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.670
 neither does it smell super good the nut of 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.530
 coconut banana 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.239
 but that's it so it's in my room 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.860
 bath since say it since the beginning of 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.060
 winter so I'll have to be such as 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.420
 I finish it especially who has not 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.820
 a lot 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.550
 so this month I promise to use 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.350
 that good for the body so while doing the 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.630
 storage lately I fell back 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.520
 on this fabulous pallet from nyx 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.950
 nude in nude 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.300
 oh by the way against what I wanted to 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.709
 tell you is that knicks is a 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.510
 cruel mark that frieze ie 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.920
 that she does not test on animals so 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.170
 even if it is not natural and ben 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.150
 here at least does not test on animals 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.370
 so that's a very positive point for 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.260
 this brand that I love so here is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.840
 this palette is a marvel 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.269
 it's a bit like a necker one and 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.030
 two together you really have some 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.070
 matte colors iridescent colors of 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.540
 neutral tones and really need that I 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.130
 bring out this palette and that I 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.430
 use it in addition you even have a 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.010
 Part of you is where blood and gold 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.350
 you have some lipsticks that 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.300
 I have 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.350
 I never used so that would 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.990
 really a shame to leave this 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.250
 product there sleeping in a drawer especially 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.590
 what's more, it's colors 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.540
 that I wear everyday so I 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.370
 promise to use this palette for the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.560
 April 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.760
 so then another product then there 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.310
 it's an extra product that goes 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.760
 relatively expensive writers this is 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.050
 the famous laguna the bronze earl hamouna 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.390
 a lot of sons adore but then me 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.710
 I do not actually hang what's there 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.390
 that I find that the hue is too much 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.500
 cold 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.760
 I know there is another brother 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.110
 which is called casino that looks 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.310
 a lot more red I like them 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.600
 brothers a little redder 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.100
 so do not hesitate to tell me in 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.320
 comment for those who have both 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.270
 or who know the browser casino 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.440
 if it is so much better that 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.580
 I search because I like them 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.220
 good players a little redder 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.840
 So here then I need him 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.150
 use very little it's really a pity 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.500
 not to use this product there especially 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.600
 that at the level of the holding all that is 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.010
 excellent I will try to put myself 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.620
 and at least 2 that's it I'll leave it 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.300
 there almost near my on my table at 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.640
 makeup and I will try really 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.200
 to use this browser this month I 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.720
 finished with two products again for the 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:13.580
 dyed so it's a game starts with a 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:18.350
 voter forgive an actor of the mark 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:21.470
 milani called amber nectar that's 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.140
 very very pretty it's exactly the kind 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.810
 of product that I love bright not too much 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.850
 glittery but I never use it 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.620
 I had to can be used once and 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.740
 still I wonder because when I 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.760
 see the product it's not I do not want 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.470
 not if ever put your fingers in 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.790
 by the way I really have to 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.670
 use it because it's a pity 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:44.120
 to let sleep as good a product as 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.030
 this one and finally we'll finish 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:50.120
 by this blush if the max mark and the 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:52.220
 butter blush or one seg many sons 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.680
 adore and well I'm struggling with this 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:59.690
 bluff I do not know why but I 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.430
 find that I do not have the hue there 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.030
 not enchanted since it is nevertheless 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.710
 does it's nintendo and nintendo cold 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.730
 it's kind of 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.710
 I unable to describe sorry 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.990
 I can not describe this pink this 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.460
 bluff so I really have to 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.370
 the used because I do not use it 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.680
 never is there in my drawer a 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.600
 makeup for at least two years I 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.610
 had to put him twice so I have to 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.500
 make an effort that I find to how 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.380
 use it and how to marry this bluff 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.730
 here is this video is over I hope 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.460
 that you did not find the idea too 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.600
 weird so do not hesitate to tell me what 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.460
 that you thought 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.590
 I will leave all these 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.140
 products there at hand in order to 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.730
 use this month and we'll see if 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.380

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.700
 they will be in my favorites of the month is 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.640

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.050
 not I'll tell you but anyway I 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.550
 promise me to use these few 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:53.080
 products this month because that's 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.190
 pity of buying products not to 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.170
 use them I think it's 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.620
 really a huge mess 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.000
 so I'll see you again very soon 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.350
 I hope to read your comments 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.870
