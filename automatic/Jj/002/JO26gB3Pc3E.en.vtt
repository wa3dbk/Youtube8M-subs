00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680

tires

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
tires

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.790 
tires
it<00:01:27.600> had<00:01:28.080> four<00:01:28.470> wheel<00:01:28.979> drive<00:01:29.810> it<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:31.290> not<00:01:31.500> have

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
it had four wheel drive it did not have

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:41.870 
it had four wheel drive it did not have
lift<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:34.110> was<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:36.560> low<00:01:37.760> truck<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:40.700> we<00:01:41.700> got

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
lift up and it was a low truck so we got

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.570 
lift up and it was a low truck so we got
a<00:01:41.909> vehicle<00:01:42.260> but<00:01:43.260> it<00:01:43.650> wasn't<00:01:44.130> what<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:44.910> need<00:01:45.180> it

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
a vehicle but it wasn't what we need it

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.899 
a vehicle but it wasn't what we need it
so<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.900> problem<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.860> started<00:01:50.430> with<00:01:50.700> this

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
so the problem first started with this

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
so the problem first started with this
car<00:01:51.590> when<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:53.280> tried<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> bring<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:55.490> our
