00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.460
 hello and welcome my name 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.410
 is one owns 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.969
 bush 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.969
 we do not welcome them too often 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:22.550
 So these two closets are the same 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:25.190
 By the way, yes, that's me 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.970
 There would be no favorites here 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.970
 everything possible 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.980
 dollar 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.659
 a fantastic atmosphere in the stadium 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.269
 The fans are looking forward to this meeting 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.870
 and the players are, of course 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.559
 curious; excited 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.559
 sergio ramos 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.610
 And there is a possibility 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.610
 residence 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.840
 that will hopefully do it now 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.840
 that the knot burst 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.350
 We can hold on while you 're with 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.350
 leads to break 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.790
 so far 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.799
 quickly the free kick spends 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.270
 example 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.340
 warning 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.869
 more 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.180
 as a solo to say nothing at all 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.190
 possibilities for both teams in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.070
 passage two 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.350
 So, say nothing at all 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.750
 possibilities for both teams in 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.700
 passage two 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.490
 if there is a team to break 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.290
 that's how it 's been after the game has been played 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.840
 no extrapolation on the endstand 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.160
 Everything on land is way too balanced 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.150
 this is going to be really exciting 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.760
 matter 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.760
 and now could start the picture 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.939
 the distance at least there with the 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.150
 Baptist as in this case, apparently 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.260
 not at all so expect here 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.909
 again clearly visible so 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.900
 could even better calculated 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.310
 that he will pull off there 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 that for a distance 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.020
 marco reus 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:11.020
 it here 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.020
 now a convincing passing game 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.260
 good opportunity 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.240
 there is a corner for real 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.240
 red 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.760
 the defender almost a bit 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.760
 panic in the eyes 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.170
 the enemy on the ground and they kick 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.209
 Keep it going but it will be 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.980
 which also made it really easy 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:53.590
 it is not 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.590
 right under the latte I hold 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.390
 the pack the other no longer 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.390
 the leadership is clear 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.420
 was well intercepted the ground 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.070
 and again played respond 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.139
 who gets 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.220
 at the next game interruption will be 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.220
 the home team change 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.760
 berlin dpa lies yet 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.280
 direction 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.389
 if you defeat the goalkeeper image there 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.440
 you have to have a little something 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:41.440
 to come up with something else 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.270
 it can go on like this 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.800
 then you can now an account 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.180
 make up 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.180
 sure in the official 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.580
 collected 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.340
 what a 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.879
 the player puts the ball to the corner 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.879
 rightly 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.929
 fresh forces poker game it is 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.929
 substituted 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.399
 Attracting the industry optimism 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.500
 a ship the game is over 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.950
 there must be the case
