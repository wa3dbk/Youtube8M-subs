00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:34.040
 today's opponent his first goal 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.640
 February 15 is that 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.910
 That's right, February 15, 1997 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:01:00.340
 at 45 of the first half 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.340
 knew how to celebrate 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.260
 going to get older necker 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:12.240
 the driver's license joÃ£o diferencia 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:16.549
 just be pretty girl who is a hair 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.549
 I will not stay another galleon 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.909
 I think you remember deciding the jec 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.289
 We have long special that was the beginning of 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:28.130
 all right 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.979
 I trained a lot without training without 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.079
 absences per day for six months to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.490
 take this opportunity and muricy gave me 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:39.310
 this is your chance 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.100
 It was was memorable not even know where to 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.950
 because it was something unusual in the 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.860
 brazilian soccer then 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.560
 is a very special day is the beginning of 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.780
 everything would only reach that mark today 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.909
 with that goal because it was already mine 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.530
 third or fourth fault and I had 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.009
 The goalkeeper had already scored 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.810
 defended but I had not made good and 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.009
 she would take too long to do maybe 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.899
 and I would not have he would not have had the 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.690
 sequence that I had to beat later 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:14.569
 Did you imagine that when you did 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.010
 choose which one you could follow 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.959
 I'll make another 138 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.599
 I always imagined the next one was not 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.859
 closer to 12 are closer together and 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.019
 so on 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:28.249
 now after I was the first or 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.849
 I always imagined that I would have 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:33.409
 chances of sequencing this, then 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.180
 came the penalty shootouts too 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:41.090
 It's already a long way since it teaches me in 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.590
 number of balls but this 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.019
 was the goal that gave confidence that everything 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:50.000
 began to regard their way of 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:52.189
 Business came to stay here you 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.829
 like today's 9 game 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.980

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.980
