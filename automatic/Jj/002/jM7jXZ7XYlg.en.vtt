never before seen by anybody you know
video<00:01:44.189> like<00:01:44.520> that<00:01:44.570> so<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.960> know<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> i

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
video like that so I don't know I i

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.660 
video like that so I don't know I i
imagine<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> we're<00:01:47.070> gonna<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.340> some<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.579> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
imagine that we're gonna see some of the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.340 
imagine that we're gonna see some of the
driving<00:01:47.909> mechanics<00:01:48.240> probably<00:01:48.899> also<00:01:49.020> some<00:01:49.320> of

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
driving mechanics probably also some of

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.690 
driving mechanics probably also some of
the<00:01:49.409> shooting<00:01:49.680> mechanics<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:50.280> little<00:01:50.549> bit<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the shooting mechanics a little bit of

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.940 
the shooting mechanics a little bit of
the<00:01:50.759> map<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.090> course<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.689> maybe<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.590> flying

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
the map of course and maybe some flying

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.219 
the map of course and maybe some flying
planes<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> things<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.119> just<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.810> good

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
planes and things like that just a good

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
planes and things like that just a good
all-around<00:01:55.259> mix<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.310> things<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:56.969> nothing

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
all-around mix of things but nothing

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.760 
all-around mix of things but nothing
like<00:01:57.780> too<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.259> missions<00:01:58.619> because

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
like too much with missions because

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.170 
like too much with missions because
obviously<00:01:59.189> they're<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.820> going<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.000> want<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
obviously they're not going to want to

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.149 
obviously they're not going to want to
spoil<00:02:00.420> anything<00:02:00.600> that's<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> length<00:02:01.950> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
spoil anything that's for the length of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.149 
spoil anything that's for the length of
the<00:02:02.310> video<00:02:03.380> originally<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.409> was<00:02:04.710> thinking

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
the video originally I was thinking

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.679 
the video originally I was thinking
maybe<00:02:05.310> two<00:02:05.640> minutes<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.299> then<00:02:06.390> I<00:02:06.479> started

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
maybe two minutes but then I started

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:07.999 
maybe two minutes but then I started
going<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.229> forums<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.710> people<00:02:07.890> are

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
going on the forums and people are

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.040 
going on the forums and people are
saying<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.580> when<00:02:09.239> rockstar<00:02:09.690> does<00:02:09.869> these

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
saying that a when rockstar does these

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
saying that a when rockstar does these
gameplay<00:02:10.410> videos<00:02:10.679> they're<00:02:11.039> sometimes

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
gameplay videos they're sometimes

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.309 
gameplay videos they're sometimes
upwards<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.120> 10<00:02:12.300> minutes<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.989> know<00:02:13.080> for

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
upwards of like 10 minutes you know for

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.980 
upwards of like 10 minutes you know for
me<00:02:13.440> that<00:02:13.620> would<00:02:13.680> be

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
me that would be

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.930 
me that would be
awesome<00:02:14.440> that<00:02:14.620> would<00:02:14.680> be<00:02:14.830> 10<00:02:15.400> minutes<00:02:15.730> of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
awesome that would be 10 minutes of

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.970 
awesome that would be 10 minutes of
sheer<00:02:16.360> ecstasy<00:02:16.570> sheer<00:02:17.290> bliss<00:02:17.590> you<00:02:17.830> know<00:02:17.920> it

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
sheer ecstasy sheer bliss you know it

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.650 
sheer ecstasy sheer bliss you know it
would<00:02:18.070> be<00:02:18.190> perfect<00:02:18.610> but<00:02:18.790> uh<00:02:18.850> I<00:02:19.180> don't<00:02:19.510> know

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
would be perfect but uh I don't know

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.630 
would be perfect but uh I don't know
it's<00:02:20.230> hard<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.770> say<00:02:20.980> on<00:02:21.100> the<00:02:21.190> length<00:02:21.310> for<00:02:21.550> me

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's hard to say on the length for me

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.830 
it's hard to say on the length for me
personally<00:02:21.880> I'm<00:02:22.210> feeling<00:02:22.480> something<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
personally I'm feeling something a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.310 
personally I'm feeling something a
little<00:02:23.020> shorter<00:02:24.060> maybe<00:02:25.060> I<00:02:25.180> think<00:02:25.870> under<00:02:26.140> five

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
little shorter maybe I think under five

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.060 
little shorter maybe I think under five
minutes<00:02:26.350> but<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:26.980> hope<00:02:27.280> I'm<00:02:27.460> wrong<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.910> really<00:02:28.240> do

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
minutes but I hope I'm wrong I really do

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.070 
minutes but I hope I'm wrong I really do
but<00:02:30.070> uh<00:02:30.130> yeah<00:02:31.090> that's<00:02:31.510> pretty<00:02:31.600> much<00:02:31.750> all<00:02:31.870> I<00:02:31.960> can

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
but uh yeah that's pretty much all I can

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.390 
but uh yeah that's pretty much all I can
speculate<00:02:32.350> for<00:02:32.620> now<00:02:32.710> guys<00:02:32.920> I<00:02:33.130> think<00:02:33.280> it's

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
speculate for now guys I think it's

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
speculate for now guys I think it's
going<00:02:33.490> to<00:02:33.550> be<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> very<00:02:33.850> well-rounded<00:02:34.450> view<00:02:35.080> of

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
going to be a very well-rounded view of

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.230 
going to be a very well-rounded view of
the<00:02:35.590> game<00:02:35.770> not<00:02:36.310> spoiling<00:02:36.580> anything<00:02:36.790> nothing

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
the game not spoiling anything nothing

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.120 
the game not spoiling anything nothing
to<00:02:37.510> groundbreaking<00:02:37.900> but<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.800> course<00:02:38.980> it's

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
to groundbreaking but of course it's

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.170 
to groundbreaking but of course it's
going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.310> give<00:02:39.400> us<00:02:39.430> loads<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:40.060> new
