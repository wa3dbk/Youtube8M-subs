00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
type of squat execution that doesn't

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.580 
type of squat execution that doesn't
mean<00:05:36.190> it's<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.610> best<00:05:37.030> for<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.480> the<00:05:38.110> best<00:05:38.380> for

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
mean it's the best for you the best for

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.500 
mean it's the best for you the best for
your<00:05:38.680> body<00:05:38.860> part<00:05:39.280> and<00:05:39.669> I'm<00:05:39.880> not<00:05:40.060> saying<00:05:40.330> you

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
your body part and I'm not saying you

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.350 
your body part and I'm not saying you
necessarily<00:05:41.260> need<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.770> switch<00:05:42.430> but<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.030> think

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
necessarily need to switch but I think

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.210 
necessarily need to switch but I think
there's<00:05:43.540> a<00:05:43.600> very<00:05:43.960> very<00:05:44.380> strong<00:05:44.710> chance<00:05:44.979> at

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
there's a very very strong chance at

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.340 
there's a very very strong chance at
switching<00:05:45.610> the<00:05:45.700> high<00:05:45.910> bar<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.450> making<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:47.110> few

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:47.350 
switching the high bar and making a few

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.800 
switching the high bar and making a few
other<00:05:47.590> adjustments<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.370> your<00:05:48.490> squat<00:05:48.850> will

other adjustments to your squat will

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.780 
other adjustments to your squat will
help<00:05:49.990> you<00:05:50.080> get<00:05:50.169> more<00:05:50.410> upright<00:05:50.770> will<00:05:51.310> help<00:05:51.490> save

your lower back a little more wear and
