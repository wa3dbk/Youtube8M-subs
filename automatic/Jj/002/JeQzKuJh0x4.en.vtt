00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.040
 hi my name is mauricio and in this 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.019
 video of the trip cycle I will show you 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.490
 that tourism is followed and what kind of 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.490
 Bike trips can be made 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.570
 what is bicycle tourism 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.800
 so tourism is the result of 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.990
 travel from knowing to enjoy new 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.150
 places traveling by bicycle a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.760
 very economically and at a more rapid pace 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.100
 slow the tourism site allows us 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.710
 contact people form 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.489
 of life enjoy the landscapes the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.660
 flavors and the custom of the places 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.059
 essentially allows us to live 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.489
 experiences that we could hardly 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.670
 find traveling with other means of 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.670
 transport 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.129
 types of cycle trips there are several ways 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.720
 of traveling by bicycle according to our 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.399
 our time availability 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.190
 economic issue and our condition 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:03.070
 physical let's see what they are 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.750
 organized trips- this type of trip 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.000
 It is ideal for people who want 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.830
 started in cycling since the 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.659
 lodging if the food is all 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 organized in advance by companies of 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.970
 tourism along all the way you go 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.590
 guided by a professional cyclist and 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.899
 also accompanied by a support car 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.140
 for possible mechanical problems or 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:22.140
 Health 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.020
 you just have to take your bicycle and 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 enjoy the scenery you do not have to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.650
 worry about preparing your food and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.390
 to repair your bicycle or ride the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.850
 tent that already charge 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.490
 the company the bad thing is that the prices do not 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.220
 they are within reach of all pockets 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.110
 trips of light saddlebags in this type 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.390
 of travel we are going to carry very little 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.860
 we will only carry our clothes and 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.650
 the occasional snack for the journey 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.720
 but nothing else the idea is that the rest of 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.550
 needs such as hosting the 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.040
 meals or the maintenance of 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.780
 bicycle we will get it directly 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.479
 in the towns or cities that we go 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.010
 going through this format is ideal for 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.229
 people who do not have much 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.320
 time and they prefer to spend a money 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.080
 extra to travel with less weight travel 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.090
 before enough in the travels of 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.590
 self-sufficiency the cyclist must 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.930
 load with all the necessary material 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.720
 to be able to subsist throughout the 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.880
 journey in your saddlebags will carry the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.580
 camping material clothes the stove 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.190
 the food the kitchen elements the 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.290
 Hygiene material spare parts and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.820
 electronic equipment and everything it 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.600
 necessary to complete the journey 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.600
 planned 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:37.159
 what type of trip should I start 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.900
 If you have never traveled by bicycle 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.640
 you know how to repair it or if you do not know how 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.260
 set up a tent at 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.319
 It would be convenient for you to start with a 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.060
 organized trip of 1 or 2 days no more to 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.069
 as you gain experience of 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.900
 kilometers on your bike can already 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.000
 launch yourself to a trip of light saddlebags 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.129
 but always gradually and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.530
 progressive and when you feel full 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.870
 trust you can already throw yourself on a trip 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.280
 of self-sufficiency we have already seen all 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.230
 the types of trips we can make 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.819
 with our bike in the next 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.010
 chapters we will go deeper in 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.840
 technical and organizational issues for 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.730
 launch us to our next adventure 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.909
 will be until a next chapter up 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.909
 then
