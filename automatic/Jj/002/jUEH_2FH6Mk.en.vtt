00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 so hello it's stÃ©phane courtial 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.290
 So world champion snowscoot in 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.810
 descent in two minutes 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.750
 I will introduce the snowscoot so 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.940
 it's a machine made of two skates that 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.429
 is directional is that a handlebar so 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.039
 I gave you the first bases for 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 learn to manipulate this gear so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.600
 simply a snow scoot to do 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 turns as a beginner we're going 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.630
 not try to turn his handlebars or to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.939
 chasing the back of his machine 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.920
 we're just going to look at the side where 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.220
 we turn using the map in the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.669
 snow 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.200
 so if I want to go to the left my 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.000
 handlebar and other researchers tour I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.770
 rather go pushed high in the other 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 what makes it so much 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.510
 English to the machine and we will be able to 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 position themselves on the map then seen 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.539
 that I get off a track and that we are 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.250
 in the slope we must first give 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.780
 the grip at the front of his machine on 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.210
 front skates so we do not hesitate to 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.190
 get into his turn bent legs 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.230
 putting weight back on the front and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.879
 tilting his machine 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.190
 then out of turn we will 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.629
 straighten and loaded the back of his 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.430
 machine to prevent the machine 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.220
 skidded to find themselves back to the slope 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.689
 and do a half turn 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.369
 then we changed direction all 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.650
 simply will put his machine back flat 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.990
 and here we will start again the turn of 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.090
 the other side flexing well his 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.070
 weight on the front to enter his 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.720
 turn and stand up while charging 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.159
 the back to get out of the bend is 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.159
 rather important it is a mass transfer 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 then simply to stop 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.710
 to curb we have no fees in 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.399
 Guiding in necessarily can not brake 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.380
 in a straight line 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:53.640
 we'll just start 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.110
 skid by tilting his machine aside 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.460
 and we're going to come and scrape the snow under 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.460
 skates and so stop 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.120
 if we are surprised and want 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.660
 make an emergency stop 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.520
 Well, we can take a foot off and 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.190
 get into a skid we are not 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.570
 attached to the machine that advantage in case 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.610
 of falling as low as we are completely 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.470
 free then we'll talk a little about 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.740
 accessories on the machine there we speak 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.670
 a foot strap to keep feet 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.220
 and so a lich 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.620
 it serves to attach the machine to the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.820
 ankle this is very very important for 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.130
 lifts 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.440
 it's obligatory and it's obligatory 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.970
 also to go down tracks then 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.590
 attention down the tracks in case 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.120
 of fall 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.100
 it can snowball effect and 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:54.800
 see you back to the corner of the figure 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:58.070
 so be careful then we stay of course 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.209
 his machine legs parallel one seeks 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.980
 not to put one foot in front of a foot 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.400
 behind we will unbalance the machine 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.590
 so we stayed two parallel feet 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.150
 to go down the slopes to take 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.160
 the buttock in 40 g a perch to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.110
 left well I'll leave my foot 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640
 right in right hand opposite to the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.620
 pole 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.830
 I grab my pole between my legs I 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 put my foot in the foot strap and I 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.980
 hold my handlebars to tomorrow there I look 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.560
 far enough ahead to have to 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.660
 balance and I leave me leaflets and I 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.790
 stay not all on the back otherwise my 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.049
 before will be unloaded and I redo a 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.570
 grip no direction 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.280
 so we stay on his machine in 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.340
 balance as much weight in the front as in 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.340
 the rear 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.680
 So while sailing presents 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.280
 in front of the buttocks we put well the 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.530
 foot opposite the pole with his leash 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.650
 well the opposite leg holds its 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.129
 handlebar the same on the same side opposite the 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.319
 pole 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:55.110
 there you take your pole we go 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.000
 trigger the start we put his hand and 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.000
 the foot and go 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.509
 to let go of its perch in water by removing 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:32.150
 one hand and we release the two pole 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:34.960
 opposed sides to the lich always made 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.960
 watch out for that 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.260
 so here we are going to show how 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:07.850
 pass a security gantry 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.840
 you keep your machine well against yourself and 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.840
 we pass left side 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.580
 then to take a chairlift and bah 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.190
 it's always the same 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.020
 tie the leash to the ankle we get 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.120
 present in front of the seats one foot in 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.670
 the strap we will hold his handlebars at 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.220
 middle for to remove and that is 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.840
 balanced then we will turn around 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.630
 when the seat get there we go 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.350
 sit down holding the folder it's 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.050
 Very important 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.520
 and when I'm going to take off at least the 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.620
 weight of the machine will not lead to 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.380
 the sleeve would be held at the back there I 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.430
 bring back the handlebars count the torso and I 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.430
 can lower the railing 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.600
 It's okay 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.710
 then to go down 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.350
 I will raise the guardrail to hold my 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:36.010
 handlebar to tomorrow relocated my machine to 

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.660
 floor I lift the seat and push for myself 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.080
 free 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.080
 quite simply 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:45.949
 we look good tomorrow is on handlebars 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:48.020
 a foot in the blur strap and a foot to 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:50.360
 outside to be able to push as soon as 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.009
 we are going to receive 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.169
 comes in plates are snowscoot on the ground 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:55.879
 in the slope straightens when arriving 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:58.180
 any foot saxons that outside the 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.180
 snowscoot 

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.340
 the pole on the front and we get off 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.539
 the track 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:57.669
 sir to avoid disturbing the 

00:07:32.539 --> 00:07:57.669
 filming did not say when this one 

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.360
 so I'll show you braking 

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.630
 emergency if you have an abominable 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:12.169
 Snowman crossing the road 

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:14.000
 let's go where we avoid 

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:16.300
 the accident this person hurt himself 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.300
 alone
