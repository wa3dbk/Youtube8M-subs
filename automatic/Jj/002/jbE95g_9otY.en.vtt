annotation check it out but what was

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.400 
annotation check it out but what was
happening<00:00:27.280> was<00:00:27.600> when<00:00:28.600> you<00:00:28.660> put<00:00:28.840> your<00:00:28.990> cup<00:00:29.170> in

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
happening was when you put your cup in

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.900 
happening was when you put your cup in
it<00:00:30.400> wasn't<00:00:30.760> pressing<00:00:31.000> down<00:00:32.430> motor<00:00:33.430> wasn't

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
it wasn't pressing down motor wasn't

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.660 
it wasn't pressing down motor wasn't
spinning<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.840> it's<00:00:35.800> because<00:00:36.160> these<00:00:36.309> little

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:36.670 
spinning and it's because these little

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.840 
spinning and it's because these little
rivets<00:00:37.570> on<00:00:37.750> the<00:00:37.809> side<00:00:38.140> which<00:00:38.559> when<00:00:39.430> you<00:00:39.550> press

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850

your cup down

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.560 
your cup down
it's<00:00:41.170> what<00:00:41.670> clicks<00:00:42.670> into<00:00:42.999> place<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.480> it

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
it's what clicks into place and it

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.450 
it's what clicks into place and it
starts<00:00:43.929> the<00:00:44.050> motor<00:00:44.260> why<00:00:44.890> don't<00:00:45.190> once<00:00:45.339> they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
starts the motor why don't once they

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.239 
starts the motor why don't once they
were<00:00:45.579> jamming<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.600> if<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.319> look<00:00:47.499> closely<00:00:47.859> you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:48.249 
were jamming and if you look closely you

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.689 
were jamming and if you look closely you
can<00:00:48.429> see<00:00:48.730> that<00:00:49.710> there's<00:00:50.710> stuff<00:00:51.010> inside

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
can see that there's stuff inside

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.209 
can see that there's stuff inside
because<00:00:51.760> what<00:00:52.420> happens<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.960> sometimes<00:00:53.219> when

00:00:54.209 --> 00:00:54.219 
because what happens is sometimes when

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.309 
because what happens is sometimes when
the<00:00:54.339> stuff<00:00:54.609> leaks<00:00:54.999> it<00:00:55.210> gets<00:00:55.420> into<00:00:55.749> the<00:00:55.839> inside

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
the stuff leaks it gets into the inside

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.669 
the stuff leaks it gets into the inside
and<00:00:56.769> it<00:00:57.339> sticks<00:00:58.589> jams<00:00:59.589> and<00:01:00.479> it<00:01:01.479> realize<00:01:02.229> at<00:01:02.530> the

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
and it sticks jams and it realize at the

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.270 
and it sticks jams and it realize at the
time<00:01:02.879> what<00:01:03.879> was<00:01:03.999> going<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:04.479> so<00:01:05.100> other<00:01:06.100> people

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
of the each into the spots let it sit

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.070 
of the each into the spots let it sit
for<00:01:18.160> 10<00:01:18.550> 15<00:01:18.730> minutes<00:01:19.000> and<00:01:19.480> then<00:01:19.540> loosen<00:01:19.750> right

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
leap into here and you know just try to

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.660 
leap into here and you know just try to
be<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.780> little<00:02:10.989> bit<00:02:11.170> more<00:02:11.800> safer<00:02:12.340> with<00:02:12.489> this

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
be a little bit more safer with this

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.050 
be a little bit more safer with this
thing<00:02:12.909> but
