00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.470
 I do not know 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.240
 and well, I want to quickly comment 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.400
 that the company neither power this company that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 is responsible for studies and analysis 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.029
 of satisfaction in different areas 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.610
 directly in the automotive I can 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 tell you to do analysis on the vehicle 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.060
 about the satisfaction that the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.369
 customers in vehicles and now in this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.130
 occasion he did it on tires and good 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.230
 I saw power more or less interviewed a 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.270
 little more than one million users of 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.340
 tires that somehow had 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.140
 these tires since new in their 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.940
 also new vehicles and what good 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.949
 Well, after two years of being 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.350
 having for a few days contact with 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.090
 these good tires evaluated them and 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 interesting things because very few of 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.289
 they still have a little bit 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.329
 sensitivity that can help so much 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.769
 a tire in reducing the consumption of 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.989
 fuel but good in terms 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.519
 general satisfaction of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.039
 tire users 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.470
 Yesterday the USA was next in first 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.300
 place ends in truth is the brand 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.760
 from michelin as one of the most brands 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.760
 reliable and of better satisfaction in 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.400
 Americans with 740 points 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 thousand probable after the brand follows 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.300
 skin and skin 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.800
 goodrich until there come what we say 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.140
 above the industry average 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.150
 and below the industry average 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.630
 is continental wire firestone 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.000
 brigestone a local nexcen like 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.630
 general workshop and the last and the worst 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.390
 evaluated was tokyo toyota years was the 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.190
 last and least evaluated and have something 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 very important as I said this topic 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.700
 to be evaluating how much it benefits 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.010
 tire in terms of consumption of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.890
 good fuel was also analyzed 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.600
 what were the tires that quickly 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.790
 the client was going to change or the user is going 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.980
 to change to improve performance and 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.390
 fuel consumption in the usa and 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.640
 obviously good because this table 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 basically it is reversed and the tire that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.500
 faster is therefore seen to be able 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.330
 replace with a more efficient one and that 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.730
 consume less fuel is the brand 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.640
 toyota everything after smoke 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.890
 hankook continental bridgeton yokohama and 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.840
 of the pop of the tires that less 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 renew to improve consumption because 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.880
 therefore it is giving it is the brand 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.650
 michelÃ­n and pirelli and bf goodrich that's right 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.760
 that this is the study that is already in 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.380
 the states is not a study that of 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.540
 somehow it is showing one 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.129
 bit 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.680
 practices and the culture that the 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.209
 us power is nothing else valued the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.519
 tennis tire from the point of 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.560
 sight that both gives you or how much you 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.480
 hard but also that it gives you so much in 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.640
 the fuel consumption obviously a 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.620
 little too this subject is biased already 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.049
 that the toyo brand usually has 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.549
 Clear high performance tires 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.560
 they are tires that are used for him and 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.420
 for sports cars then good 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.760
 well these vehicles obviously the type 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.790
 of compound components that it has is 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.920
 much more abrasive soft and it makes 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.629
 also good because you had a greater 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.200
 level of drag so they are not 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.459
 so efficient or so support both the 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.750
 fuel consumption issue but 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.239
 well there are these results 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.530
 directly from equipped from the usa and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.109
 Well, I think it's very important 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.000
 start taking these analyzes as a basis 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.409
 when we have to do or when 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.090
 let's have the decision to purchase 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:19.760
 some tires and it is that there is a 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.370
 part that we are strongly evaluating 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.900
 is that the durability of the 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.659
 tire with respect to performance 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.069
 struck out if you a tire toyo in these 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.440
 carvings on these high rims 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.210
 performance because you want a better grip 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.370
 you know you 're sacrificing the 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.320
 durability and the kiel the consumption of 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.410
 fuel look for that there is a great 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.550
 laboratory which are the competencies that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.200
 are the competencies that are 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.990
 directly for example formula 1 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.730
 Nascar what is done in very high 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.260
 resistance the tires that are put 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 to compete there are precisely for 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.700
 start to approve new compounds see 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.350
 resistance durability and obviously 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.790
 there also the tr of efficiency in the 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.930
 Fuel consumption is very important 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.150
 and that is that we see in the highest category 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.090
 as you well comment a tire that you 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:05.000
 can yield at best 15 or 16 laps 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.770
 more than a great grip, it is more 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.240
 fast is a tire where you can 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.650
 achieve higher speeds but 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.180
 obviously it's a tire that you're going to 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.510
 have to change much faster 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 points
