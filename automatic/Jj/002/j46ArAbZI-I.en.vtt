would<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.860> be<00:02:41.980> willing<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.280> support<00:02:42.700> us<00:02:42.880> in

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
would you be willing to support us in

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.120 
would you be willing to support us in
doing<00:02:43.270> that<00:02:43.390> as<00:02:43.510> a<00:02:43.570> proof<00:02:43.750> of<00:02:43.870> principle<00:02:44.130> and

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
doing that as a proof of principle and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.860 
doing that as a proof of principle and
so<00:02:45.310> we<00:02:45.400> were<00:02:45.489> very<00:02:45.640> fortunate<00:02:45.790> they<00:02:46.270> said<00:02:46.480> yes

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so we were very fortunate they said yes

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.420 
so we were very fortunate they said yes
they<00:02:47.320> have<00:02:47.680> something<00:02:48.100> that's<00:02:48.220> called<00:02:48.310> a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
they have something that's called a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.780 
they have something that's called a
cloud<00:02:48.640> compute<00:02:49.270> cloud<00:02:49.900> computing

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
cloud compute cloud computing

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.110 
cloud compute cloud computing
environment<00:02:51.790> so<00:02:52.030> there<00:02:52.239> we<00:02:52.480> could<00:02:52.720> utilize

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
environment so there we could utilize

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.160 
environment so there we could utilize
400<00:02:55.120> computers<00:02:55.870> each<00:02:56.590> of<00:02:56.950> 16<00:02:57.370> cores<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:58.170> we

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
400 computers each of 16 cores and we

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.930 
400 computers each of 16 cores and we
were<00:02:59.290> like<00:02:59.440> well<00:02:59.620> what<00:02:59.799> would<00:02:59.920> be<00:03:00.160> something

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
were like well what would be something

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.640 
were like well what would be something
useful<00:03:01.480> for<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.690> community<00:03:02.140> in<00:03:02.260> terms<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
useful for the community in terms of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.530 
useful for the community in terms of
analysis<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.820> that<00:03:03.970> comes<00:03:04.150> back<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
analysis and that comes back to the

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.110 
analysis and that comes back to the
thousand<00:03:04.930> genomes<00:03:04.959> one<00:03:05.950> hope<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.370> have<00:03:06.670> is<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
thousand genomes one hope I have is the

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.150 
thousand genomes one hope I have is the
when<00:03:07.840> you're<00:03:07.959> seeing<00:03:08.200> patients<00:03:08.739> that<00:03:09.070> you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
when you're seeing patients that you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.460 
when you're seeing patients that you
suspect<00:03:09.670> may<00:03:09.850> have<00:03:09.880> a<00:03:10.090> rare<00:03:10.720> syndrome<00:03:10.989> or<00:03:11.440> a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
suspect may have a rare syndrome or a

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.620 
suspect may have a rare syndrome or a
metabolic<00:03:12.070> disorder<00:03:12.420> but<00:03:13.420> by<00:03:13.600> using

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
metabolic disorder but by using

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.380 
metabolic disorder but by using
next-generation<00:03:14.500> sequencing<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:16.180> can<00:03:16.299> be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
next-generation sequencing you can be

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.140 
next-generation sequencing you can be
able<00:03:16.540> to<00:03:16.600> very<00:03:17.320> rapidly<00:03:17.950> say<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.970> is<00:03:19.120> the

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
able to very rapidly say this is the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.330 
able to very rapidly say this is the
gene<00:03:19.480> that's<00:03:19.750> wrong<00:03:20.019> this<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.890> how<00:03:21.010> you<00:03:21.070> need

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
gene that's wrong this is how you need

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.550 
gene that's wrong this is how you need
to<00:03:21.430> treat<00:03:21.670> this<00:03:21.850> particular<00:03:22.780> individual<00:03:23.410> to

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
to treat this particular individual to

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:39.270 
to treat this particular individual to
stop<00:03:24.000> harming<00:03:25.000> further<00:03:25.840> harm<00:03:26.080> being<00:03:26.350> done
