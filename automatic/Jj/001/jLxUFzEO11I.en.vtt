she'll be demonstrating for us today on
how<00:00:19.300> to<00:00:19.360> properly<00:00:19.660> execute<00:00:20.050> a<00:00:20.529> tricep<00:00:20.980> press

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
how to properly execute a tricep press

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.880 
how to properly execute a tricep press
using<00:00:21.490> a<00:00:21.670> machine<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.660> triceps<00:00:23.200> are<00:00:23.439> the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
using a machine the triceps are the

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.950 
using a machine the triceps are the
reverse<00:00:24.189> muscles<00:00:24.640> to<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.849> biceps<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.810> they

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
reverse muscles to the biceps so they

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.749 
reverse muscles to the biceps so they
tend<00:00:26.170> to<00:00:26.260> be<00:00:26.380> more<00:00:26.560> weak<00:00:26.800> you<00:00:27.279> want<00:00:27.460> to<00:00:27.550> start

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
tend to be more weak you want to start

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.130 
tend to be more weak you want to start
with<00:00:27.849> a<00:00:27.880> lighter<00:00:28.210> weight<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.660> do<00:00:28.960> more

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.140 
with a lighter weight and do more

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.320 
with a lighter weight and do more
repetitions<00:00:29.830> we<00:00:30.550> have<00:00:30.730> it<00:00:30.880> at<00:00:30.970> a<00:00:31.000> comfortable

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
repetitions we have it at a comfortable

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.660 
repetitions we have it at a comfortable
weight<00:00:31.600> for<00:00:31.779> Monica<00:00:32.080> already<00:00:32.440> next<00:00:33.280> what<00:00:33.550> you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
which Monica is already in that perfect

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.119 
which Monica is already in that perfect
stance<00:00:46.080> there's<00:00:47.080> also<00:00:47.260> two<00:00:47.440> different<00:00:47.920> kinds

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
stance there's also two different kinds

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:49.770 
stance there's also two different kinds
of<00:00:48.190> grips<00:00:48.400> on<00:00:48.580> this<00:00:48.699> machine<00:00:49.059> when<00:00:49.540> you<00:00:49.629> have

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
of grips on this machine when you have

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.780 
of grips on this machine when you have
your<00:00:49.930> handles<00:00:50.199> flipped<00:00:50.409> outward<00:00:50.860> it<00:00:51.159> actually

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
your handles flipped outward it actually

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.390 
your handles flipped outward it actually
use<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.570> triceps<00:00:53.170> and<00:00:53.500> it<00:00:53.830> also<00:00:53.979> work<00:00:54.280> the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
use the triceps and it also work the

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.759 
use the triceps and it also work the
pectoral<00:00:54.909> muscles<00:00:55.210> as<00:00:55.330> a<00:00:55.360> secondary<00:00:55.930> when<00:00:56.680> you

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
pectoral muscles as a secondary when you

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.049 
pectoral muscles as a secondary when you
have<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.040> handles<00:00:57.309> flipped<00:00:57.460> inward<00:00:57.790> it<00:00:57.970> will

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
have the handles flipped inward it will

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.789 
have the handles flipped inward it will
be<00:00:58.180> a<00:00:58.210> more<00:00:58.390> narrow<00:00:58.690> natural<00:00:59.229> grip<00:00:59.409> and<00:00:59.680> it

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
be a more narrow natural grip and it

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.380 
be a more narrow natural grip and it
will<00:00:59.920> focus<00:01:00.070> more<00:01:00.400> on<00:01:00.430> the<00:01:00.610> triceps<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.150> cells

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
will focus more on the triceps and cells

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.210 
will focus more on the triceps and cells
we're<00:01:02.199> going<00:01:02.320> to<00:01:02.409> do<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.620> narrow<00:01:02.830> grip<00:01:03.070> today

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
we're going to do the narrow grip today

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.670 
we're going to do the narrow grip today
the<00:01:03.430> focus<00:01:03.729> on<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:03.940> triceps<00:01:04.360> so<00:01:05.140> if<00:01:05.229> Monica<00:01:05.440> if

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
the focus on the triceps so if Monica if

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.780 
the focus on the triceps so if Monica if
you<00:01:05.710> could<00:01:05.920> just<00:01:06.040> put<00:01:06.250> your<00:01:06.340> hands<00:01:06.549> on<00:01:06.700> the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
you could just put your hands on the

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.180 
you could just put your hands on the
grips<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:08.290> when<00:01:08.440> we<00:01:08.530> go<00:01:08.650> down<00:01:08.860> you<00:01:08.890> want

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
grips and then when we go down you want

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.010 
grips and then when we go down you want
to<00:01:09.250> keep<00:01:09.400> in<00:01:09.549> control<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.150> you<00:01:10.600> never<00:01:10.750> want<00:01:10.990> to

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
to keep in control and you never want to

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.420 
to keep in control and you never want to
lock<00:01:11.170> your<00:01:11.350> elbows<00:01:11.650> because<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.100> are<00:01:12.220> using

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
lock your elbows because you are using

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.670 
lock your elbows because you are using
them<00:01:12.700> as<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:12.850> pivoting<00:01:13.240> joint<00:01:13.510> so<00:01:14.380> going<00:01:14.560> down

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
them as a pivoting joint so going down

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.980 
them as a pivoting joint so going down
and<00:01:15.100> extending<00:01:15.520> slowly<00:01:15.729> up<00:01:15.939> and<00:01:16.180> when<00:01:16.899> you

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
and extending slowly up and when you

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.289 
and extending slowly up and when you
come<00:01:17.200> up<00:01:17.350> you<00:01:17.710> want<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.430> come<00:01:18.609> almost<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:19.210> the

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
come up you want to come almost to the

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.080 
come up you want to come almost to the
full<00:01:19.479> resting<00:01:19.869> point<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.490> not<00:01:21.640> locking<00:01:21.880> your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
full resting point but not locking your

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:24.569 
full resting point but not locking your
elbows<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.590> it'll<00:01:23.770> be<00:01:23.829> one<00:01:24.009> fluid<00:01:24.310> motion

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
elbows so it'll be one fluid motion

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.240 
elbows so it'll be one fluid motion
keeping<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.359> control<00:01:25.780> and<00:01:26.020> like<00:01:26.710> I<00:01:26.829> said<00:01:26.890> you

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
keeping in control and like I said you

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.590 
keeping in control and like I said you
already<00:01:27.369> have<00:01:27.579> your<00:01:27.700> light<00:01:27.909> weight<00:01:28.119> so<00:01:28.570> just

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
already have your light weight so just

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.300 
already have your light weight so just
do<00:01:28.899> multiple<00:01:29.320> reps<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.829> split<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.189> up<00:01:30.250> between

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
do multiple reps and split it up between

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.099 
do multiple reps and split it up between
different<00:01:30.969> sets<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.750> will<00:01:31.840> give<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.049> a

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109 
different sets and it will give you a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.450 
different sets and it will give you a
good<00:01:32.289> balance<00:01:32.679> between<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.009> bicep<00:01:33.429> muscle

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
good balance between the bicep muscle

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.819 
good balance between the bicep muscle
and<00:01:34.060> that's<00:01:34.570> how<00:01:34.689> you<00:01:34.750> properly<00:01:34.990> do<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> tricep

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
and that's how you properly do a tricep

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:43.850 
and that's how you properly do a tricep
press<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.310> a<00:01:36.340> machine

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.840 

now<00:01:44.860> we're<00:01:45.010> going<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.190> go<00:01:45.310> over<00:01:45.490> some<00:01:45.670> common

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
now we're going to go over some common

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.930 
now we're going to go over some common
faults<00:01:46.360> with<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:47.020> tricep<00:01:47.440> press<00:01:47.760> first<00:01:48.760> of

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
faults with the tricep press first of

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.840 
faults with the tricep press first of
all<00:01:49.060> people<00:01:49.690> tend<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.140> have<00:01:50.890> their<00:01:51.130> feet<00:01:51.370> where

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
all people tend to have their feet where

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.520 
all people tend to have their feet where
they're<00:01:52.030> on<00:01:52.180> their<00:01:52.480> tippy<00:01:52.780> toes<00:01:52.990> which<00:01:53.290> means

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
they're on their tippy toes which means

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.310 
they're on their tippy toes which means
the<00:01:53.650> seats<00:01:53.890> too<00:01:54.190> high<00:01:54.430> if<00:01:55.120> you're<00:01:55.840> too<00:01:56.080> high

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
the seats too high if you're too high

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.620

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
you're on your tippy toes

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.940 
you're on your tippy toes
then<00:02:01.300> you<00:02:01.450> need<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.780> lower<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.230> seat<00:02:02.470> to<00:02:02.830> where

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
it's at a comfortable level and you can

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.920

be stable
another<00:02:05.620> common<00:02:05.980> fault<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:06.370> if<00:02:06.550> people<00:02:06.730> lean

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
another common fault is if people lean

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.430 
another common fault is if people lean
forward<00:02:07.450> not<00:02:07.660> supporting<00:02:08.110> their<00:02:08.260> head

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
forward not supporting their head

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.950 
forward not supporting their head
because<00:02:09.070> they're<00:02:09.430> straining<00:02:09.820> this<00:02:10.330> typically

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
because they're straining this typically

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.540 
because they're straining this typically
means<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.350> you<00:02:11.530> have<00:02:11.650> too<00:02:11.890> much<00:02:12.040> weight<00:02:12.310> and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
means that you have too much weight and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.880 
means that you have too much weight and
you<00:02:13.270> need<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.510> focus<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.990> looking<00:02:14.170> forward<00:02:14.740> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
you need to focus on looking forward and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.630 
you need to focus on looking forward and
using<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.640> headrest<00:02:16.260> that's<00:02:17.260> proper<00:02:17.710> the

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
using the headrest that's proper the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760 
using the headrest that's proper the
third<00:02:18.910> one<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.150> people<00:02:19.390> often<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.260> having

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
third one that people often do is having

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.310 
third one that people often do is having
their<00:02:20.890> elbows<00:02:21.340> extended<00:02:22.240> out<00:02:22.390> which<00:02:22.900> doesn't

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
their elbows extended out which doesn't

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.900 
their elbows extended out which doesn't
properly<00:02:23.710> work<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:24.010> triceps<00:02:24.490> and<00:02:24.640> will<00:02:24.760> cause

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
properly work the triceps and will cause

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.700 
properly work the triceps and will cause
it<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.210> our<00:02:25.330> muscles<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.720> strain<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.650> you

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
it in our muscles to strain so you

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.200

working<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> triceps<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.870> don't<00:02:32.020> cause

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
working the triceps and you don't cause
