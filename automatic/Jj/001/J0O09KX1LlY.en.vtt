00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.180 

as<00:00:31.509> you<00:00:31.720> can<00:00:31.869> see<00:00:32.050> I<00:00:32.079> finally<00:00:32.410> got<00:00:32.649> the<00:00:32.829> engine

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
as you can see I finally got the engine

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.189 
as you can see I finally got the engine
started<00:00:33.640> it<00:00:34.030> didn't<00:00:34.329> go<00:00:34.420> quite<00:00:34.449> as<00:00:34.899> smoothly

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
started it didn't go quite as smoothly

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:38.009 
started it didn't go quite as smoothly
as<00:00:35.500> might<00:00:35.710> be<00:00:35.860> indicated<00:00:36.129> by<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.610> video<00:00:36.879> I<00:00:37.329> had

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
as might be indicated by the video I had

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.090 
as might be indicated by the video I had
no<00:00:38.170> oil<00:00:38.199> pressure

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
no oil pressure

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.970 
no oil pressure
I<00:00:39.129> had<00:00:39.640> no<00:00:39.820> fuel<00:00:40.149> pressure<00:00:40.659> I<00:00:40.780> had<00:00:41.290> no<00:00:41.470> spark

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
I had no fuel pressure I had no spark

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.040 
I had no fuel pressure I had no spark
and<00:00:42.220> when<00:00:42.670> I<00:00:42.699> put<00:00:42.970> gas<00:00:43.210> in<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.600> tank<00:00:43.839> it

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
and when I put gas in the tank it

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.139 
and when I put gas in the tank it
started<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.530> leak<00:00:44.739> I'm<00:00:45.550> gonna<00:00:45.760> walk<00:00:46.000> you

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
started to leak I'm gonna walk you

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.880 
started to leak I'm gonna walk you
through<00:00:46.180> each<00:00:46.510> of<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.809> things<00:00:46.989> I<00:00:47.260> did<00:00:47.559> in

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
through each of the things I did in

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.500 
through each of the things I did in
order<00:00:48.129> to<00:00:48.309> get<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.670> car<00:00:48.850> started<00:00:48.970> for<00:00:49.449> the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
order to get the car started for the

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.299 
order to get the car started for the
first<00:00:49.750> time<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.559> maybe<00:00:50.680> that'll<00:00:51.040> give<00:00:51.190> you

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
first time and maybe that'll give you

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.310 
first time and maybe that'll give you
some<00:00:51.460> ideas<00:00:51.879> of<00:00:52.059> problems<00:00:52.449> to<00:00:52.629> avoid<00:00:52.899> when<00:00:53.140> you

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
some ideas of problems to avoid when you

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.459 
some ideas of problems to avoid when you
have<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.739> same<00:00:53.949> situation<00:00:54.989> when<00:00:55.989> I<00:00:56.019> put<00:00:56.290> some

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
have the same situation when I put some

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.319 
have the same situation when I put some
gas<00:00:56.649> in<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.010> tank<00:00:57.280> it<00:00:57.429> immediately<00:00:57.760> started

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
gas in the tank it immediately started

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.889 
gas in the tank it immediately started
leaking

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
leaking

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:00.360 
leaking
I<00:00:58.929> got<00:00:59.230> underneath<00:00:59.500> and<00:00:59.829> discovered<00:01:00.250> the

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
I got underneath and discovered the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.860 
I got underneath and discovered the
drain<00:01:00.609> plug<00:01:00.820> just<00:01:01.030> needed<00:01:01.449> to<00:01:01.539> be<00:01:01.660> tightened

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
drain plug just needed to be tightened

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.350 
drain plug just needed to be tightened
up<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.289> quarter<00:01:02.620> turn<00:01:02.829> or<00:01:02.890> so<00:01:03.250> I<00:01:03.460> then<00:01:03.969> removed

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
up a quarter turn or so I then removed

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.630 
up a quarter turn or so I then removed
the<00:01:04.509> spark<00:01:05.140> plugs<00:01:05.440> to<00:01:05.710> turn<00:01:06.160> the<00:01:06.310> engine<00:01:06.429> over

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
the spark plugs to turn the engine over

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.700 
the spark plugs to turn the engine over
the<00:01:06.970> starter<00:01:07.330> motor<00:01:07.360> just<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.170> see<00:01:08.320> if<00:01:08.440> I<00:01:08.560> was

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
the starter motor just to see if I was

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.859 
the starter motor just to see if I was
getting<00:01:08.890> oil<00:01:09.250> pressure<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.940> to<00:01:10.240> see<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.539> I<00:01:10.660> was

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
getting oil pressure and to see if I was

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:12.779 
getting oil pressure and to see if I was
getting<00:01:11.110> fuel<00:01:11.530> pressure<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.399> check<00:01:12.640> the

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
getting fuel pressure and to check the

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.969 
getting fuel pressure and to check the
spark<00:01:13.149> as<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:14.020> turns<00:01:14.200> out<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.470> had<00:01:14.710> none<00:01:14.860> of

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
spark as it turns out I had none of

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.190 
spark as it turns out I had none of
those<00:01:15.130> things<00:01:15.429> were<00:01:15.610> working<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:16.300> turned<00:01:16.810> the

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
those things were working I turned the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.529 
those things were working I turned the
car<00:01:17.409> over<00:01:17.740> with<00:01:17.890> a<00:01:17.920> starter<00:01:18.369> motor<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.850> there

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:19.539 
car over with a starter motor and there

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:21.899 
car over with a starter motor and there
was<00:01:19.659> no<00:01:19.840> pressure<00:01:20.170> showing<00:01:20.649> on<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:20.950> gauge<00:01:21.190> so

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
was no pressure showing on the gauge so

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.059 
was no pressure showing on the gauge so
I<00:01:21.940> disconnected<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.259> oil<00:01:23.500> pressure<00:01:23.890> gauge

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
I disconnected the oil pressure gauge

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.820 
I disconnected the oil pressure gauge
from<00:01:24.909> the<00:01:25.179> tube<00:01:25.630> coming<00:01:25.990> from<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.350> engine<00:01:26.530> up

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
from the tube coming from the engine up

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.130 
from the tube coming from the engine up
at<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.069> firewall<00:01:27.610> I<00:01:27.880> turned<00:01:28.479> it<00:01:28.630> over<00:01:28.720> again

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
at the firewall I turned it over again

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.899 
at the firewall I turned it over again
to<00:01:29.290> see<00:01:29.320> if<00:01:29.439> I<00:01:29.619> was<00:01:29.740> any<00:01:29.950> oil<00:01:30.250> was<00:01:30.490> coming<00:01:30.670> out

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
to see if I was any oil was coming out

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.850 
to see if I was any oil was coming out
of<00:01:30.970> that<00:01:31.119> tube<00:01:31.540> and<00:01:31.780> never<00:01:32.020> there<00:01:32.320> was<00:01:32.439> nothing

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
of that tube and never there was nothing

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.330 
of that tube and never there was nothing
so<00:01:33.579> I<00:01:34.000> knew<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.240> had<00:01:34.390> rebuilt<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.140> oil<00:01:35.350> pump<00:01:35.979> and

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
so I knew I had rebuilt the oil pump and

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.639 
so I knew I had rebuilt the oil pump and
not<00:01:36.939> primed<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.570> pump<00:01:37.600> by<00:01:37.960> putting<00:01:38.259> oil<00:01:38.439> in

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
not primed the pump by putting oil in

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.859 
not primed the pump by putting oil in
the<00:01:38.770> chamber<00:01:39.220> when<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:39.549> had<00:01:39.790> finished<00:01:40.030> so<00:01:40.840> I

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
the chamber when I had finished so I

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.380 
the chamber when I had finished so I
dropped<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.590> oil<00:01:41.770> pump<00:01:42.070> away<00:01:42.430> from<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.820> block

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
dropped the oil pump away from the block

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.330 
dropped the oil pump away from the block
I<00:01:43.420> used<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.049> funnel<00:01:44.469> to<00:01:44.560> fill<00:01:44.770> it<00:01:44.950> with<00:01:45.130> some

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
I used the funnel to fill it with some

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.480 
I used the funnel to fill it with some
oil<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:45.820> then<00:01:46.000> tightened<00:01:46.390> it<00:01:46.509> back<00:01:46.689> up<00:01:46.930> again

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
oil and then tightened it back up again

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.039 
oil and then tightened it back up again
the<00:01:48.490> next<00:01:48.759> time<00:01:48.909> I<00:01:49.000> turned<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.420> car<00:01:49.630> over<00:01:49.899> with

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
the next time I turned the car over with

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.719 
the next time I turned the car over with
the<00:01:50.140> starter<00:01:50.500> motor<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.799> immediately<00:01:51.100> started

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
the starter motor I immediately started

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.969 
the starter motor I immediately started
getting<00:01:51.790> oil<00:01:52.240> coming<00:01:52.689> out<00:01:52.810> to<00:01:53.049> the<00:01:53.259> oil

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
getting oil coming out to the oil

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.760 
getting oil coming out to the oil
instrument<00:01:54.939> gauge<00:01:55.180> tube<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.320> knew<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.649> had

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
instrument gauge tube so I knew I had

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.770 
instrument gauge tube so I knew I had
oil<00:01:57.189> pressure<00:01:57.460> at<00:01:57.700> that<00:01:57.880> point<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.360> connected

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
oil pressure at that point and connected

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.800 
oil pressure at that point and connected
that<00:01:58.930> part<00:01:59.229> back<00:01:59.469> up<00:01:59.710> again<00:02:00.390> now<00:02:01.390> that<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.659> had

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
that part back up again now that I had

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.080 
that part back up again now that I had
oil<00:02:01.930> pressure<00:02:02.350> I<00:02:02.469> went<00:02:02.740> around<00:02:02.829> to<00:02:03.189> turn<00:02:03.909> the

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
oil pressure I went around to turn the

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.670 
oil pressure I went around to turn the
motor<00:02:04.450> over<00:02:04.539> again<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.140> see<00:02:05.259> if<00:02:05.289> I<00:02:05.439> was<00:02:05.530> getting

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
motor over again to see if I was getting

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.719 
motor over again to see if I was getting
any<00:02:05.950> fuel<00:02:06.250> pressure

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
any fuel pressure

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.880 
any fuel pressure
because<00:02:07.119> I<00:02:07.149> still<00:02:07.479> had<00:02:07.689> not<00:02:07.810> gotten<00:02:08.229> any<00:02:08.440> fuel

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
because I still had not gotten any fuel

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.569 
because I still had not gotten any fuel
in<00:02:09.190> the<00:02:09.429> sediment<00:02:10.179> bowl<00:02:10.390> on<00:02:10.600> the<00:02:10.690> fuel<00:02:10.929> pump

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
in the sediment bowl on the fuel pump

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.460 
in the sediment bowl on the fuel pump
turning<00:02:12.579> over<00:02:12.730> even<00:02:13.150> more<00:02:13.180> did<00:02:13.989> not<00:02:14.170> solve

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
turning over even more did not solve

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.410 
turning over even more did not solve
that<00:02:14.680> problem<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.430> decided<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:15.970> take<00:02:16.150> the

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
that problem so I decided to take the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.270 
that problem so I decided to take the
fuel<00:02:16.690> pump<00:02:16.989> off<00:02:17.200> just<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.680> check<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.100> make<00:02:18.130> sure

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
fuel pump off just to check to make sure

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.150 
fuel pump off just to check to make sure
what<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> problem<00:02:19.540> was<00:02:19.690> there<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.290> had<00:02:20.769> rebuilt

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
what the problem was there I had rebuilt

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.979 
what the problem was there I had rebuilt
the<00:02:21.370> pump<00:02:21.609> a<00:02:21.730> couple<00:02:22.030> of<00:02:22.120> years<00:02:22.329> ago<00:02:22.570> with<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
the pump a couple of years ago with a

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.110 
the pump a couple of years ago with a
new<00:02:23.170> kit<00:02:23.500> even<00:02:23.709> though<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.010> was<00:02:24.100> an<00:02:24.220> nos<00:02:24.609> pump<00:02:24.970> I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
new kit even though it was an nos pump I

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.880 
new kit even though it was an nos pump I
wanted<00:02:25.329> to<00:02:25.390> make<00:02:25.540> sure<00:02:25.570> all<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.019> rubber<00:02:26.500> parts

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
wanted to make sure all the rubber parts

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.640 
wanted to make sure all the rubber parts
were<00:02:27.040> fresh<00:02:27.340> in<00:02:27.609> there<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.000> in<00:02:28.930> taking<00:02:29.530> it

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
were fresh in there and in taking it

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.170 
were fresh in there and in taking it
apart<00:02:29.920> I<00:02:30.070> discovered<00:02:30.609> that<00:02:30.760> one<00:02:30.970> of<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
apart I discovered that one of the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.750 
apart I discovered that one of the
bowels<00:02:31.570> was<00:02:31.750> stuck<00:02:31.989> open<00:02:32.260> so<00:02:33.100> I<00:02:33.130> just<00:02:33.280> blew<00:02:33.730> a

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
bowels was stuck open so I just blew a

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.589 
bowels was stuck open so I just blew a
little<00:02:34.090> air<00:02:34.480> gently<00:02:35.079> through

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
little air gently through

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.660 
little air gently through
and<00:02:35.689> that<00:02:36.019> popped<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.590> bow<00:02:36.739> back<00:02:37.040> down<00:02:37.400> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and that popped the bow back down and

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.420 
and that popped the bow back down and
then<00:02:38.209> it<00:02:38.390> was<00:02:38.540> able<00:02:38.719> to<00:02:38.900> work<00:02:39.739> I<00:02:39.980> put<00:02:40.189> it<00:02:40.280> back

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
then it was able to work I put it back

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.500 
then it was able to work I put it back
together<00:02:40.639> again

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
together again

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.569 
together again
put<00:02:42.049> it<00:02:42.139> back<00:02:42.260> on<00:02:42.469> the<00:02:42.620> car<00:02:42.889> and<00:02:43.370> immediately

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
put it back on the car and immediately

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:45.940 
put it back on the car and immediately
started<00:02:44.359> getting<00:02:44.420> fuel<00:02:44.989> being<00:02:45.590> drawn<00:02:45.920> from

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
started getting fuel being drawn from

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.089 
started getting fuel being drawn from
the<00:02:46.219> tank<00:02:46.870> but<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.170> fuel<00:02:48.439> sentiment

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
the tank but when the fuel sentiment

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.309 
the tank but when the fuel sentiment
Bowl<00:02:49.249> got<00:02:49.519> full<00:02:49.909> I<00:02:50.180> started<00:02:50.629> getting<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.989> leak

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
Bowl got full I started getting a leak

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.839 
Bowl got full I started getting a leak
squirting<00:02:51.799> out<00:02:51.950> from<00:02:52.129> around<00:02:52.250> one<00:02:52.639> of<00:02:52.760> the

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
squirting out from around one of the

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.920 
squirting out from around one of the
screws<00:02:57.280> so<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> took<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.879> pump<00:02:59.090> off<00:02:59.269> again

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
screws so I took the pump off again

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.990 
screws so I took the pump off again
took<00:03:00.439> it<00:03:00.530> apart<00:03:00.829> again<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.189> discovered<00:03:01.879> that

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
took it apart again and discovered that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.759 
took it apart again and discovered that
when<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.180> had<00:03:02.450> put<00:03:02.689> the<00:03:02.719> diaphragm<00:03:03.379> in<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
when I had put the diaphragm in the

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.489 
when I had put the diaphragm in the
rubber<00:03:03.950> pump<00:03:04.340> part<00:03:04.639> in<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:04.879> middle<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.689> had<00:03:06.319> it

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:06.499 
rubber pump part in the middle I had it

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:08.199 
rubber pump part in the middle I had it
stretched<00:03:06.889> a<00:03:07.069> little<00:03:07.189> bit<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.730> pulled<00:03:08.060> away

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
stretched a little bit and pulled away

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.659 
stretched a little bit and pulled away
from<00:03:08.659> around<00:03:09.109> one<00:03:09.379> of<00:03:09.500> the<00:03:09.590> screw<00:03:09.889> hole<00:03:10.129> so<00:03:10.430> the

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
from around one of the screw hole so the

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.699 
from around one of the screw hole so the
gas<00:03:10.849> was<00:03:11.090> able<00:03:11.389> to<00:03:11.419> leak<00:03:11.719> up<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.169> pass<00:03:12.409> the

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
gas was able to leak up and pass the

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.220 
gas was able to leak up and pass the
screw<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:14.090> put<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.599> together<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.169> time

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
screw so I put it together this time

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.959 
screw so I put it together this time
making<00:03:15.709> sure<00:03:15.859> there<00:03:16.129> was<00:03:16.219> no<00:03:16.400> tension<00:03:16.849> on<00:03:16.909> the

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
making sure there was no tension on the

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:19.300 
making sure there was no tension on the
diaphragm<00:03:17.629> and<00:03:17.840> tightened<00:03:18.230> it<00:03:18.290> down<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.129> then

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
diaphragm and tightened it down and then

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.670 
diaphragm and tightened it down and then
finally<00:03:19.669> had<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.000> issue<00:03:20.180> of<00:03:20.659> spark<00:03:21.319> there<00:03:21.560> was

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
finally had the issue of spark there was

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.399 
finally had the issue of spark there was
no<00:03:21.829> spark<00:03:22.219> I<00:03:22.609> called<00:03:23.209> my<00:03:23.389> friend<00:03:23.689> Steve<00:03:24.079> with

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.670 
the cardboard and immediately I started
getting<00:03:49.759> spark<00:03:50.150> at<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.019> point<00:03:51.259> I<00:03:51.319> was<00:03:51.439> able

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
getting spark at that point I was able

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.129 
getting spark at that point I was able
to<00:03:51.709> start<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.220> car<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.790> went<00:03:53.479> around<00:03:53.569> to<00:03:53.840> check

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
to start the car I went around to check

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.509 
to start the car I went around to check
all<00:03:54.349> of<00:03:54.379> the<00:03:54.620> fittings<00:03:55.009> and<00:03:55.189> the<00:03:55.280> see<00:03:55.459> if

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
all of the fittings and the see if

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.979 
all of the fittings and the see if
anything<00:03:55.939> was<00:03:56.030> leaking<00:03:56.509> and<00:03:56.659> make<00:03:56.810> sure

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
anything was leaking and make sure

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.990 
anything was leaking and make sure
everything<00:03:57.319> was<00:03:57.439> charging<00:03:57.799> properly<00:03:58.489> first

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
everything was charging properly first

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.030 
everything was charging properly first
thing<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.329> noticed<00:03:59.689> was<00:03:59.840> I<00:03:59.900> had<00:04:00.229> oil<00:04:00.530> leaking

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
thing I noticed was I had oil leaking

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.450 
thing I noticed was I had oil leaking
out<00:04:01.189> through<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.609> oil<00:04:01.790> filter

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:06.460 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.980 

and<00:04:07.460> once<00:04:07.670> again<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.090> problem<00:04:08.420> similar<00:04:08.840> to

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
and once again the problem similar to

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.600 
and once again the problem similar to
the<00:04:09.110> gas<00:04:09.290> tank<00:04:09.560> was<00:04:09.710> I<00:04:09.920> just<00:04:10.100> need<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.370> tighten

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
the gas tank was I just need to tighten

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.610 
the gas tank was I just need to tighten
the<00:04:10.790> cap<00:04:11.000> down<00:04:11.240> a<00:04:11.300> little<00:04:11.540> bit<00:04:11.780> the<00:04:12.410> oil

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
the cap down a little bit the oil

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.320 
the cap down a little bit the oil
pressure<00:04:12.980> is<00:04:13.250> running<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.790> little<00:04:13.970> high<00:04:14.270> it

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
pressure is running a little high it

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.390 
pressure is running a little high it
should<00:04:14.690> be<00:04:14.810> running<00:04:15.050> about<00:04:15.260> 15<00:04:15.440> pounds<00:04:16.250> at

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
should be running about 15 pounds at

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.150 
should be running about 15 pounds at
idle<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.510> was<00:04:17.690> running<00:04:17.930> up<00:04:18.110> to<00:04:18.170> about<00:04:18.500> 3035

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
idle and it was running up to about 3035

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.520 
idle and it was running up to about 3035
pounds<00:04:19.970> so<00:04:20.390> I<00:04:20.420> may<00:04:20.630> need<00:04:20.780> to<00:04:20.900> replace<00:04:21.200> the

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
pounds so I may need to replace the

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.020 
pounds so I may need to replace the
spring<00:04:21.860> but<00:04:22.040> I<00:04:22.100> want<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.400> get<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.640> car<00:04:22.850> up<00:04:22.880> to

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
spring but I want to get the car up to

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.760 
spring but I want to get the car up to
speed<00:04:23.150> first<00:04:23.750> just<00:04:24.020> to<00:04:24.110> see<00:04:24.290> what<00:04:24.500> kind<00:04:24.740> of

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
speed first just to see what kind of

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.190 
speed first just to see what kind of
pressure<00:04:25.070> I'm<00:04:25.250> getting<00:04:25.730> in<00:04:26.150> checking<00:04:27.080> the

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
pressure I'm getting in checking the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.320 
pressure I'm getting in checking the
ammeter<00:04:27.380> I<00:04:27.980> wasn't<00:04:28.340> getting<00:04:28.550> any<00:04:28.670> charge<00:04:29.060> but

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
ammeter I wasn't getting any charge but

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.940 
ammeter I wasn't getting any charge but
I<00:04:29.420> was<00:04:29.540> getting<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.870> slight<00:04:30.140> discharge<00:04:30.740> which

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
I was getting a slight discharge which

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.770 
I was getting a slight discharge which
would<00:04:31.100> indicate<00:04:31.400> that<00:04:31.640> the<00:04:31.850> generator<00:04:32.330> wasn't

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
would indicate that the generator wasn't

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.320 
would indicate that the generator wasn't
charging<00:04:33.110> so<00:04:34.070> once<00:04:34.340> again<00:04:34.460> I<00:04:34.820> called<00:04:35.180> my

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
charging so once again I called my

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.650 
charging so once again I called my
friend<00:04:35.630> Steve<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.230> he<00:04:36.950> suggested<00:04:37.610> taking<00:04:38.090> the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
friend Steve and he suggested taking the

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.640 
friend Steve and he suggested taking the
regulator<00:04:39.410> and<00:04:39.760> grounding<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.910> field

the field terminal on the regulator to
ground<00:04:47.180> I<00:04:47.540> was<00:04:48.020> able<00:04:48.200> to<00:04:48.380> show<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.890> generator

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
ground I was able to show the generator

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.640 
ground I was able to show the generator
was<00:04:49.520> charging<00:04:50.150> so<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.870> indicated<00:04:51.350> there<00:04:51.530> was

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
was charging so that indicated there was

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.740 
was charging so that indicated there was
a<00:04:51.710> problem<00:04:52.190> with<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:52.580> field<00:04:52.940> coil<00:04:53.330> in<00:04:53.630> the

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
a problem with the field coil in the

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.770 
a problem with the field coil in the
regulator<00:04:54.470> I<00:04:54.740> took<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:55.850> cover<00:04:56.180> off<00:04:56.300> of<00:04:56.630> the

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
regulator I took the cover off of the

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.990 
regulator I took the cover off of the
regulator<00:04:57.260> and<00:04:57.560> checked<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.430> points<00:04:58.820> once

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
regulator and checked the points once

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.910 
regulator and checked the points once
again<00:04:59.300> by<00:04:59.540> rubbing<00:05:00.140> a<00:05:00.230> piece<00:05:00.440> of<00:05:00.620> manila

not<00:05:03.380> there<00:05:04.100> was<00:05:04.310> any<00:05:04.550> kind<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.030> corrosion<00:05:05.330> on

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
not there was any kind of corrosion on

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.170 
not there was any kind of corrosion on
those<00:05:05.960> I<00:05:06.350> put<00:05:06.950> it<00:05:07.040> back<00:05:07.190> onto<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.700> car<00:05:07.940> and

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
those I put it back onto the car and

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.570 
those I put it back onto the car and
once<00:05:08.870> again<00:05:09.170> there<00:05:09.380> was<00:05:09.530> no<00:05:09.560> charge<00:05:10.100> from<00:05:10.430> the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
once again there was no charge from the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.570 
once again there was no charge from the
generator<00:05:11.090> I<00:05:11.470> called<00:05:12.470> Steve<00:05:12.800> again<00:05:13.160> and<00:05:13.460> he

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
generator I called Steve again and he

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.000 
generator I called Steve again and he
said<00:05:13.850> needs<00:05:14.240> to<00:05:14.360> be<00:05:14.450> bench<00:05:14.960> test<00:05:15.290> it<00:05:15.470> probably

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
said needs to be bench test it probably

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.310 
said needs to be bench test it probably
had<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:16.400> adjust<00:05:16.670> the<00:05:16.910> gap<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.540> also<00:05:17.990> adjust

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
had to adjust the gap and also adjust

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.020 
had to adjust the gap and also adjust
the<00:05:18.410> spring<00:05:18.740> tension<00:05:18.980> on<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.370> point<00:05:19.610> so<00:05:19.880> that

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
the spring tension on the point so that

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.430 
the spring tension on the point so that
they<00:05:20.150> would<00:05:20.300> open<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:20.720> close<00:05:20.960> at<00:05:21.170> the<00:05:21.290> right

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
they would open and close at the right

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.520 
they would open and close at the right
time<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.070> that<00:05:22.850> was<00:05:22.940> my<00:05:23.090> next<00:05:23.150> step<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:23.840> took<00:05:24.290> the

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
time so that was my next step I took the

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.190 
time so that was my next step I took the
battery<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.700> generator<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.510> the<00:05:26.660> regulator

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
battery the generator and the regulator

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.230 
battery the generator and the regulator
all<00:05:27.530> out<00:05:27.740> to<00:05:27.890> his<00:05:28.070> place<00:05:28.310> where<00:05:28.790> he<00:05:28.940> could<00:05:29.060> hook

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
all out to his place where he could hook

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.420 
all out to his place where he could hook
him<00:05:29.360> up<00:05:29.480> to<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:30.080> bench<00:05:30.410> test<00:05:30.680> machine<00:05:31.160> and<00:05:31.340> he

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
him up to a bench test machine and he

00:05:31.430 --> 00:06:08.649 
him up to a bench test machine and he
could<00:05:31.580> see<00:05:31.730> exactly<00:05:31.910> what<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:32.510> problem<00:05:32.540> was

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:08.659 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.190
