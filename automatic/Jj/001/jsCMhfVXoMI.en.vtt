 I will play on the square-1 on the legendary square-1 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.059
 heavy Soviet tank is one of the best 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.599
 tanks of level 5 will occupy a magnificent 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.000
 position ie position for Fri-Sau with 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.449
 which you can shoot from afar 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.220
 opponent she is right here she is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.390
 is here where is here 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.029
 often 49 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.070
 and from there i will try to target hellcata 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.560
 everyones he there to towers heavy 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.320
 but in general there will be very interesting fights 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.410
 sit comfortably send enjoy 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 good video and in the course of the video I will 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.680
 comment 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.890
 Well, how to comment without a word chat 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.660
 I call well in to comment 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.920
 first what's the advantage to you on 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.289
 long distances 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 yes there are practically no currents if 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 fugashnitsa gets she removes first 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.350
 once and you can do you have time 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.390
 to come down 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.969
 at short distances you do not have time 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 it all comes down like you hulka then 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.280
 You see, I target him now, but I 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.950
 I can't get to him because I have 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 land mine speed and ping 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.630
 allow you to successfully aim at 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.430
 moving targets 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:22.159
 damn come on let's see everything from the first 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.890
 300 times hepe took him and this is my well 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.039
 it's just how to say hulk from y 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.520
 he has no armor here's an example if you turn up 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.600
 I will take a maximum of 100 from him 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.100
 if I get on so good but 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 heavy i can still pick up 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.420
 especially if you get clay 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.000
 somewhere a weak spot for someone 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.130
 screaming 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.399
 but took very little I think it either 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.259
 34 points or heavy because kvass at 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.630
 I would have taken much more well, look 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.670
 ka me edge 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.259
 so stop you hope hopefully stopped 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.340
 I'll take him away I'll take him down 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.909
 and took 100 hp 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.039
 I think this is not bad because you are very 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.690
 armored and I can hardly him 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:14.000
 pick up completely so waiting for their projectile 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.920
 flew a little lower than necessary and I could not 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.200
 pick him think him take mine now 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:26.930
 Friends arch arches so there is 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.209
 one class got so pissed off 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.489
 he flew off again 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.930
 doctors are good 34 points here see 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.579
 I hope she will not run away until I aim 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.370
 have taken thirty four from the first 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:44.480
 shot but she wasn't quite shot 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.910
 bad for her she was for mine so we wait 2 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.609
 they already took the rest pokotsali I think 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:55.489
 a good fight has already turned out as an atom 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:03:00.530
 bent over there us heavy remained still apt-2 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.959
 where there are a number on the map over there yah 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.850
 I hope at least take it as kv-2 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.810
 he will be pretty armored 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.599
 take long if you 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 I can take away my ally freak 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.290
 pushes from behind knocks down the sight almost 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.090
 bummed him when he slipped 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:24.330
 past ap-2 is right on my border 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.069
 visibility and it is very far away 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:33.630
 so I can hardly by it somehow 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.630
 to get to successfully have to come closer 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:42.580
 well, I won't get there 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.920
 so we stayed heavy and apt-2 in my 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.890
 visibility where I can maybe their 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:52.209
 the stream whom 2 school let's reduce 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:56.500
 sight damn i'm sort of very clear there all 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:58.900
 he will be taken away here right now to him exactly 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.269
 the ammo would hit I could pick it up 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.030
 left heavy 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:08.950
 waiting for the light can he here paper though 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:10.690
 hardly oh and vyhi ear and see here 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.569
 now it would be a very very good shot 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.019
 interesting i shoot 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:20.109
 not on the tank but under it given that 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.840
 sheâ€™s not on armor 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:25.300
 and under the armor that is, under the tank there is no armor 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 she is very weak and see how 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:31.130
 it turns out 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.979
 I took a bum in a tank 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.680
 interesting tactic as a bomb 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:39.139
 the tank, he just flushes the whole inside 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.030
 I took the tank so very strong 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.320
 armored tanks to since they don't have 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:47.720
 below them are armor and they usually have a higher 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.030
 In general, here is such a battle KV-1 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.370
