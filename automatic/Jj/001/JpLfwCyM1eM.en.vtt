00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, this is the point...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In which the flour is like this (you could even put a little more), and it starts to get soft, shiny...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
...it is no longer sticky.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
At this point [...] for what we want to do we don't need to leave it [to leaven]...

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
... because it doesn't elevate like when we put the [fresh] yeast when it was raw...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
...but rises [leavens] as it cooks.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, you will have to keep in mind that you will have to think about how to cook this...

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Since we are in a situation where most commonly we use fire...

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Wood burning fire...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We are not going to have a regulated flame, which is a great inconvenience

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Therefore, the best thing is to divide the dough into small pieces...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
...and make, depending on what we are using it for, the container to transport it...

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
...for if we are going to eat it now or take it with us. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:25.000
...make different breads or doughs with different forms...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
...and search for a container to cook it in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If we don't have a container: stones.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and embers...

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
In direct flame we are going to grab it.  

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We have to figure out how to generate, from this, a platform where we can support them...

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
...enough embers, and a fire to feed and generate the amount of embers that we want.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
If we have one, we can use in this case (a luxury) the lid of a pot. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
...which also functions as a skillet.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and cook them...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here, depending on what we have, it can be directly on the flame...

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
...or use a small layer of fat or some oil to give it more nutrition and calories...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
...and also so that it won't stick.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Something that we haven't mentioned and that needs to be taken into account...

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
...in reality this is basic, but cannot be forgotten in a situation like this...

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
...even though this seems a bit rustic, wash your hands first.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The containers and flour can touch a river rock, etc. ... there is no problem...

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.000
...but, in heating up the containers, we sterilize them with the fire itself...

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
...the spoon, everything that we will use.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Because in a situation, even though we are going to become immune, we can still catch anything...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
...so it is worth it to be preventative in that sense.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So as we do this...

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
...we are going to make the balls first and let them dry a little so that they stick less...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
...and then keep making the breads or however you want to call them.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Well, now we are going to see how to organize this to cook them like this.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
