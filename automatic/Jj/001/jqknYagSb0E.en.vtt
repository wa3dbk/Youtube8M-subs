00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
whatever basically this episode guy is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.490

about<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.859> past

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
about the past

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.760 
about the past
I<00:00:32.460> guess<00:00:33.420> competitions<00:00:34.110> he's<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.500> with

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
I guess competitions he's had with

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.620 
I guess competitions he's had with
Kakashi<00:00:35.399> that's<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:35.940> more<00:00:36.120> unfortunately

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
Kakashi that's like more unfortunately

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
Kakashi that's like more unfortunately
up<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:36.989> we<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.710> get<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> flashback

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
up so we actually get to see a flashback

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.790 
up so we actually get to see a flashback
and<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:38.940> funny<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:40.020> flashback<00:00:40.260> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800
