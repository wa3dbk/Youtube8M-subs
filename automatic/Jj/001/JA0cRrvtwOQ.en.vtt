here<00:00:47.960> so<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.079> can<00:00:49.379> see<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:51.180> hasn't

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
here so you can see that this hasn't

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.299 
here so you can see that this hasn't
change<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> looks<00:00:52.140> have<00:00:52.320> changed<00:00:52.710> but<00:00:52.860> these

change the looks have changed but these

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.569 
change the looks have changed but these
two<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.640> equivalent<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:55.160> I<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.340> need<00:00:56.430> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
two are equivalent and I don't need to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.369 
two are equivalent and I don't need to
do<00:00:56.670> anything<00:00:56.879> over<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.329> because<00:00:57.870> here's<00:00:58.170> my

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
do anything over here because here's my

to both of these terms here and rewrite

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.649 
to both of these terms here and rewrite
my<00:01:11.010> exponent<00:01:11.580> here<00:01:11.640> it's<00:01:11.850> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.150> 2x

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
6 now I'm ready to just get rid of these

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.270 
6 now I'm ready to just get rid of these
bases<00:01:23.430> once<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.330> them<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.770> exponents

bases once I have them the exponents
simplified<00:01:26.729> down<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.270> drop<00:01:27.780> my<00:01:27.840> basis<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.740> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
simplified down I drop my basis and I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.370 
simplified down I drop my basis and I
just<00:01:29.310> rewrite<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.420> up<00:01:30.630> there<00:01:30.840> so<00:01:31.350> i

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
just rewrite what I have up there so i

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
just rewrite what I have up there so i
have<00:01:31.619> 2x<00:01:32.070> squared<00:01:32.460> plus<00:01:33.170> 8x<00:01:34.170> equals<00:01:35.420> negative

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
have 2x squared plus 8x equals negative

have 2x squared plus 8x equals negative
6<00:01:37.670> now<00:01:38.670> we've<00:01:39.270> gone<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:40.020> exponential

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
6 now we've gone from an exponential

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.179 
6 now we've gone from an exponential
equation<00:01:40.860> up<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:41.930> let's<00:01:42.930> star<00:01:43.200> they're<00:01:43.409> down

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189

and<00:02:10.760> I<00:02:11.760> am<00:02:11.910> just<00:02:12.060> going<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.510> factor<00:02:12.989> the

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
and I am just going to factor the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.630 
and I am just going to factor the
try<00:02:13.459> no<00:02:13.520> real<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:16.280> is<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.520> to<00:02:16.580> be

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
try no real here and this is going to be

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.750 
try no real here and this is going to be
a<00:02:16.670> nice<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.120> factor<00:02:17.540> factors<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.620> 3<00:02:18.760> they

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
a nice one to factor factors of 3 they

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.229 
a nice one to factor factors of 3 they
add<00:02:19.940> up<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.360> four<00:02:20.810> factors<00:02:21.800> of<00:02:21.920> 3r<00:02:22.489> three<00:02:23.030> and

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
add up to a four factors of 3r three and

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.830 
add up to a four factors of 3r three and
one<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:24.520> I<00:02:25.520> need<00:02:25.670> a<00:02:25.700> positive<00:02:26.000> for<00:02:26.630> in<00:02:26.720> the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
one and I need a positive for in the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.740 
one and I need a positive for in the
middle<00:02:27.080> here<00:02:28.660> so<00:02:30.280> plus<00:02:31.280> 1<00:02:31.519> x<00:02:32.030> plus<00:02:32.150> 3<00:02:32.569> is

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
middle here so plus 1 x plus 3 is

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.550 
middle here so plus 1 x plus 3 is
positive<00:02:33.530> 3<00:02:33.950> plus<00:02:34.550> 1<00:02:34.670> plus<00:02:35.420> 3<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.019> positive

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
positive 3 plus 1 plus 3 is the positive

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.710 
positive 3 plus 1 plus 3 is the positive
for<00:02:37.040> right<00:02:37.220> there<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.670> then<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.300> just<00:02:38.480> look<00:02:38.630> out

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
for right there and then I just look out

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.280 
for right there and then I just look out
in<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> front<00:02:38.989> here<00:02:39.200> and<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.500> X<00:02:39.800> and<00:02:40.190> X<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:42.260> I

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
in the front here and it's X and X now I

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.979 
in the front here and it's X and X now I
need<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.530> finish<00:02:42.769> this<00:02:42.920> problem<00:02:43.310> and<00:02:43.989> notice

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
need to finish this problem and notice

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.500 
need to finish this problem and notice
how<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> only<00:02:45.500> do<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:45.890> t-bar<00:02:46.730> on<00:02:47.000> the<00:02:47.330> two

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
how I only do this t-bar on the two

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.900 
how I only do this t-bar on the two
factors<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:48.140> contain<00:02:48.500> X<00:02:48.709> there's<00:02:49.250> no<00:02:49.489> X<00:02:49.730> to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
factors that contain X there's no X to

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.340 
factors that contain X there's no X to
solve<00:02:50.180> for<00:02:50.390> over<00:02:50.569> here<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:50.870> I<00:02:50.930> don't<00:02:50.989> need<00:02:51.230> to

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
solve for over here so I don't need to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.690 
solve for over here so I don't need to
do<00:02:51.440> anything<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.890> this<00:02:51.980> too<00:02:52.130> it<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.310> hangs

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
do anything with this too it just hangs

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.590 
do anything with this too it just hangs
out<00:02:52.880> there<00:02:53.120> and<00:02:53.470> we<00:02:54.470> don't<00:02:55.069> use<00:02:55.310> it<00:02:55.489> anymore<00:02:55.600> so

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
out there and we don't use it anymore so

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.539 
out there and we don't use it anymore so
we've<00:02:56.780> got<00:02:56.930> X<00:02:57.140> plus<00:02:57.350> 3<00:02:57.590> is<00:02:57.650> equal<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:58.010> 0<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.340> X

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
we've got X plus 3 is equal to 0 and X

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:02.559 
we've got X plus 3 is equal to 0 and X
plus<00:02:58.819> 1<00:02:59.060> is<00:02:59.330> equal<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.690> 0<00:03:00.549> so<00:03:01.549> subtract<00:03:02.120> 3<00:03:02.480> on

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
plus 1 is equal to 0 so subtract 3 on

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.789 
plus 1 is equal to 0 so subtract 3 on
both<00:03:02.750> sides<00:03:04.720> I've<00:03:05.720> got<00:03:05.930> negative<00:03:06.200> 3<00:03:06.590> right

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
both sides I've got negative 3 right

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.059 
both sides I've got negative 3 right
there<00:03:07.040> and<00:03:07.780> subtract<00:03:08.780> 1<00:03:09.110> on<00:03:09.230> both<00:03:09.410> sides<00:03:09.769> there

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
there and subtract 1 on both sides there

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.380 
there and subtract 1 on both sides there
I've<00:03:10.400> got<00:03:10.670> negative<00:03:10.849> 1<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.010> my<00:03:13.190> answer<00:03:13.400> set<00:03:13.940> is

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
I've got negative 1 so my answer set is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.440 
I've got negative 1 so my answer set is
going<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.900> be<00:03:15.080> negative<00:03:15.319> 3<00:03:16.069> comma<00:03:16.760> negative<00:03:17.030> 1

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
going to be negative 3 comma negative 1

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.890 
going to be negative 3 comma negative 1
and<00:03:18.040> let's<00:03:19.040> see<00:03:19.190> what<00:03:19.280> we<00:03:19.430> got<00:03:19.549> here<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:20.000> is

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
and let's see what we got here it is

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.470 
and let's see what we got here it is
going<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.230> be<00:03:21.260> a<00:03:21.380> choice<00:03:21.940> three<00:03:22.940> they<00:03:23.180> have<00:03:23.359> in

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
going to be a choice three they have in

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.900 
going to be a choice three they have in
reverse<00:03:23.840> order<00:03:24.079> but<00:03:24.650> this<00:03:24.769> is<00:03:24.950> a<00:03:24.980> solution<00:03:25.430> set

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
reverse order but this is a solution set

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.910 
reverse order but this is a solution set
it<00:03:26.239> doesn't<00:03:26.600> matter<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:27.079> order<00:03:27.109> of<00:03:27.590> our

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
it doesn't matter the order of our

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.950 
it doesn't matter the order of our
answers<00:03:28.340> negative<00:03:29.030> 3<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.630> negative<00:03:30.590> 1
