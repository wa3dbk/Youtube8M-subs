 I would like to enjoy a delicious 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.009
 aromatic bread and origami parmesan 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:19.730
 man styles these are the 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:24.020
 Ingredients 4 eggs 120 grams of 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:28.580
 70 grams of bread butter hoisted 27 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:33.699
 yeast grams one kilo 160 grams of 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.800
 flour all use 696 grams of water and 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:41.730
 sugar 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.730
 29 grams of salt of this grams of ear 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.880
 a spoonful of sugar unite the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.340
 yeast 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.340
 and we add a quarter cup of water 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:01.949
 and let stand 10 minutes until 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.949
 grow and shape 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:09.460
 we put 800 grams of flour 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.460
 eggs 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.670
 the butter 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.890
 Parmesan 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.890
 yeast 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.440
 oregano and we start to kill 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.130
 we add little by little half of the water 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:41.130
 all right 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 ah 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.640
 let's get it right 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.700
 incorporated 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.700
 clarion 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.310
 and the water 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.710
 the salt 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.960
 and when the dough takes off from the container 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.909
 dump on the table with a little 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.030
 flour 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.040
 it is important not to use more flour 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.370
 the necessary to not alter your 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.370
 composition 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.590
 ah 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.920
 from outside to inside forming a 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.920
 bun 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:50.969
 let stand in a floured bowl 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.910
 as we cover with a cloth for half an hour 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.600
 spent this time with the hand 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:07.360
 we gently press to diversify 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.700
 this method will help us make the crumb 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.880
 of bread be more these things and highlight 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.380
 the flavors we cover for half an hour more 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:20.020
 where he will double his volume past that 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.470
 time we observe a spongy mass and 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.470
 soft 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.280
 We divide from desired portions 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.310
 ah 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.310
 ah 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.730
 ah 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.650
 At this moment we will make 13 loaves of 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.650
 171 grams each 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.819
 ah 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:39.300
 the piece you love will do with movement 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:41.689
 from the outside in to form a 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.689
 bun 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.950
 ah 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.419
 and so we will do with the whole mass 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.419
 remaining 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:04.710
 we will see in the bottom part a 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.050
 swirl indicator that is ready is 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.600
 important to keep the mass covered 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.330
 so that its surface does not form a 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:13.860
 crust that would cause it to lose quality 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.610
 of our bread 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.259
 we take a bun and with the hand we stretch 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.259
 to form a rectangle 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:33.220
 then from the top we roll up 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:37.030
 down by pressing on each sheet 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:40.170
 until forming a cylinder giving it shape 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.170
 of the desired bread 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.200
 i 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.879
 ah 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:08.729
 place on a floured tray with 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:12.169
 the opening down to prevent that 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.169
 open during fermentation 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.090
 cover and let stand until 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.750
 double in its volume approximately 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:26.280
 between 30 and 40 minutes varnish masters with 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.280
 egg diluted with water 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.350
 Y 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.980
 sprinkle with parmesan and oreo 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.280
 ah 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.280
 ah 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.890
 ah 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.890
 ah 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:02.790
 we bake at 350 degrees fahrenheit for 25 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:05.910
 minutes or until I give buff and aroma and 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.020
 what color let us rest for 10 minutes 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.020
 before cutting it 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:22.330
 this delicious bread and oregon imparts 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.800
 state can be enjoyed with diverse 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.120
 feder 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.720
 good profit 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.720
 ah 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.880
 Y 

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.760
