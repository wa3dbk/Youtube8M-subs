00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
they really just end up staying like

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.270 
they really just end up staying like
that<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.500> what<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.680> like<00:01:34.829> about<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.569 
that so that's what I like about this
one<00:01:35.540> they<00:01:36.540> keep<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> claws<00:01:37.049> more<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.680> not

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
one they keep the claws more of not

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160 
one they keep the claws more of not
putting<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.210> separate<00:01:39.570> but<00:01:39.689> kind<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.020> all

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
putting in separate but kind of all

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.850
