00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
one where we just run and then we all

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.010 
one where we just run and then we all
start<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.610> click<00:00:40.910> we<00:00:41.330> all<00:00:41.450> start<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.750> put<00:00:41.930> it

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
together no second chances now I think

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.590 
together no second chances now I think
would<00:00:46.190> have<00:00:46.370> been<00:00:46.580> made<00:00:46.790> slight<00:00:47.090> favourites
