actually get a lot of times when I'm
doing<00:00:27.570> seminars<00:00:27.899> I<00:00:28.500> really<00:00:28.739> don't<00:00:28.890> think

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
doing seminars I really don't think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.849 
doing seminars I really don't think
about<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.489> lot<00:00:29.640> when<00:00:29.849> I'm<00:00:29.969> out<00:00:30.269> alone<00:00:30.859> but

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
about it a lot when I'm out alone but

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.920 
about it a lot when I'm out alone but
it's<00:00:32.040> an<00:00:32.189> ongoing<00:00:32.460> question<00:00:33.059> anywhere<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> go

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
it's an ongoing question anywhere I go

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.590 
it's an ongoing question anywhere I go
do<00:00:34.110> seminars<00:00:34.320> people<00:00:34.829> talk<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.600> what

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
do seminars people talk to me about what

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.939 
do seminars people talk to me about what
lines<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.440> use<00:00:38.239> throughout<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.269> season<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
lines I use throughout a season and and

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.680 
lines I use throughout a season and and
really<00:00:43.949> that's<00:00:44.129> that's<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.550> hard<00:00:44.850> question<00:00:45.269> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
really that's that's a hard question to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.630 
really that's that's a hard question to
answer<00:00:45.720> but<00:00:46.379> here's<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> best<00:00:47.040> way<00:00:47.220> to<00:00:47.250> put<00:00:47.550> it

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
answer but here's the best way to put it

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.289 
answer but here's the best way to put it
I<00:00:47.729> used<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.620> old-school<00:00:49.620> mano<00:00:50.430> fisherman

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
I used to be a old-school mano fisherman

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:54.499 
I used to be a old-school mano fisherman
that's<00:00:51.629> all<00:00:51.869> I<00:00:51.900> used<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:53.150> green<00:00:54.150> mano

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:54.509 
that's all I used was green mano

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.929 
that's all I used was green mano
throughout<00:00:55.049> the<00:00:55.199> Midwest<00:00:55.650> you<00:00:56.040> all<00:00:56.759> know

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:56.939 
throughout the Midwest you all know

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:59.350 
throughout the Midwest you all know
you're<00:00:57.330> all<00:00:57.449> out<00:00:57.629> there<00:00:57.869> I<00:00:58.049> know<00:00:58.110> who<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:58.559> are

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
you're all out there I know who you are

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.520 
you're all out there I know who you are
that<00:01:00.360> was<00:01:00.509> the<00:01:00.629> way<00:01:00.750> we<00:01:00.780> fish<00:01:01.170> throughout

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
that was the way we fish throughout

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.090 
that was the way we fish throughout
really<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.009> 80s<00:01:02.400> 90s<00:01:02.900> in<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.960> early<00:01:04.320> 2000s

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
really the 80s 90s in the early 2000s

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.140 
really the 80s 90s in the early 2000s
but<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.729> came<00:01:06.979> fluorocarbon<00:01:07.979> okay<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.729> what

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
but then came fluorocarbon okay and what

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.929 
but then came fluorocarbon okay and what
you're<00:01:09.240> gonna<00:01:09.329> get<00:01:09.509> out<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.750> fluorocarbon

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
you're gonna get out of fluorocarbon

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:14.539 
you're gonna get out of fluorocarbon
less<00:01:11.939> stretch<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.799> stronger<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:13.979> what's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
less stretch and stronger and what's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.399 
less stretch and stronger and what's
funny<00:01:14.759> is<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.270> fish<00:01:15.479> fluorocarbon<00:01:16.259> all

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
funny is if you fish fluorocarbon all

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.840 
funny is if you fish fluorocarbon all
Lots<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.340> lot<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.560> go<00:01:19.740> back<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.250> mono<00:01:20.579> I

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
Lots a lot you can go back to a mono I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
Lots a lot you can go back to a mono I
let<00:01:21.180> my<00:01:21.329> kids<00:01:21.600> throw<00:01:21.869> mono<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.259> lot<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.590> gonna

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
let my kids throw mono a lot I'm gonna

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.090 
let my kids throw mono a lot I'm gonna
tell<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:22.979> why<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.370> second

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
tell you why in a second

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.620 
tell you why in a second
mono<00:01:26.100> starts<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.640> feel<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.060> rubber<00:01:27.360> band

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
mono starts to feel like a rubber band

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.960 
mono starts to feel like a rubber band
there's<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.260> much<00:01:28.470> stretch<00:01:29.190> in<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.550> the<00:01:29.640> reason

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
there's so much stretch in it the reason

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
there's so much stretch in it the reason
I<00:01:30.060> want<00:01:30.330> fluorocarbon<00:01:31.140> it's<00:01:31.680> gonna<00:01:31.830> guarantee

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
I want fluorocarbon it's gonna guarantee

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.289 
I want fluorocarbon it's gonna guarantee
me<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.600> strong<00:01:34.080> hook<00:01:34.650> sets<00:01:35.090> by<00:01:36.090> not

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
me very very strong hook sets by not

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.300 
me very very strong hook sets by not
having<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:37.049> stretching<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.010> line<00:01:38.190> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
having that stretching the line the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.719 
having that stretching the line the
other<00:01:38.430> thing<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> I'm<00:01:39.120> able<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.510> really

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
other thing is I'm able to really

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
other thing is I'm able to really
overpower<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.060> fish<00:01:42.570> more<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.680> than<00:01:43.830> I<00:01:43.920> used<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
overpower a fish more so than I used to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.610 
overpower a fish more so than I used to
with<00:01:44.760> a<00:01:44.790> monofilament<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.659> last<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.530> not

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
with a monofilament and last but not

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.130 
with a monofilament and last but not
least<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.430> braid<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.540> here's<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> best

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
least is braid and and here's the best

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.060 
least is braid and and here's the best
way<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.650> describe<00:01:50.460> my<00:01:50.640> system<00:01:51.119> my<00:01:51.150> setup<00:01:52.070> 50%

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
way to describe my system my setup 50%

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.210 
way to describe my system my setup 50%
of<00:01:53.130> my<00:01:53.220> rods<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:54.000> braid<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:55.130> personally<00:01:56.130> use

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
of my rods have braid I personally use

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.890 
of my rods have braid I personally use
power<00:01:56.460> Pro<00:01:56.729> I've<00:01:56.850> used<00:01:57.030> power<00:01:57.210> Pro<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.630> for

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
power Pro I've used power Pro really for

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.980 
power Pro I've used power Pro really for
the<00:01:57.960> last<00:01:58.170> 10<00:01:58.409> years<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> other<00:01:59.700> 50%<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the last 10 years and the other 50% of

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.570 
the last 10 years and the other 50% of
my<00:02:01.110> rods<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:02.330> fluorocarbon<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.710> only<00:02:05.310> time

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
my rods are fluorocarbon the only time

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.690 
my rods are fluorocarbon the only time
the<00:02:06.150> only<00:02:06.479> time<00:02:06.960> I<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.439> use<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:08.009> monofilament

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
the only time I will use a monofilament

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.780 
the only time I will use a monofilament
is<00:02:09.209> when<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:09.989> throwing<00:02:10.259> small<00:02:10.860> topwaters

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
is when I'm throwing small topwaters

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.210 
is when I'm throwing small topwaters
because<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> monofilament<00:02:12.840> sits<00:02:13.530> high<00:02:13.769> in<00:02:14.069> the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
because a monofilament sits high in the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.210 
because a monofilament sits high in the
water<00:02:14.459> almost<00:02:14.700> floats<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:16.349> you're<00:02:16.890> able<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
water almost floats and you're able to

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.619 
water almost floats and you're able to
fish<00:02:17.400> those<00:02:17.519> smaller<00:02:17.879> ones<00:02:18.000> but<00:02:18.239> if<00:02:18.330> I<00:02:18.390> go<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> a

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
fish those smaller ones but if I go to a
