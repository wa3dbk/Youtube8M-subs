I did not make this map I am not the
author<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> I<00:00:25.560> don't<00:00:25.619> claim<00:00:25.980> any<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.400> it

final<00:00:27.210> chaos<00:00:27.599> made<00:00:28.470> this<00:00:28.710> map<00:00:30.590> from<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> looks

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
final chaos made this map from the looks

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.790 
final chaos made this map from the looks
of<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:33.050> and<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.550> do<00:00:35.790> not<00:00:36.120> claim<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.719> don't<00:00:37.530> say

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
where i'm going to show you this map

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
where i'm going to show you this map
this<00:00:44.100> map<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.370> fairly<00:00:45.030> fun<00:00:46.070> especially<00:00:47.070> um<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
this map is fairly fun especially um it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.889 
this map is fairly fun especially um it
goes<00:00:48.539> with<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.039> custom<00:00:50.039> game<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.640> garbage<00:00:51.629> man

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
goes with the custom game on garbage man

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.330 
goes with the custom game on garbage man
so<00:00:53.690> all<00:00:54.690> I'm<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.230> change<00:00:55.559> teams<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.160> so

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
so all I'm going to change teams here so

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.720 
so all I'm going to change teams here so
I<00:00:56.370> can<00:00:56.489> spawn<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:57.030> top<00:00:57.440> there<00:00:58.440> we<00:00:58.559> go<00:00:58.730> the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
I can spawn up top there we go the

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.450 
I can spawn up top there we go the
zombies<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.329> spawn<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.020> here<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
zombies will spawn up here and the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.880 
zombies will spawn up here and the
humans<00:01:02.789> will<00:01:02.910> spawn<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.830> and<00:01:04.830> then

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
humans will spawn down there and then

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.609 
humans will spawn down there and then
they<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.450> zombies<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.720> grabbed<00:01:06.960> hammers<00:01:07.380> so

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
they can zombies have grabbed hammers so

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
they can zombies have grabbed hammers so
they<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.950> push<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.610> off

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
they can push that off

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
they can push that off
push<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.680> soccer<00:01:10.920> balls<00:01:11.220> off<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:12.300> main<00:01:12.540> goal

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
push the soccer balls off the main goal

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.620 
push the soccer balls off the main goal
for<00:01:12.810> them<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> splatter<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.130> humans

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
for them is the splatter the humans

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.360 
for them is the splatter the humans
somehow<00:01:15.630> with<00:01:16.320> all<00:01:16.800> these<00:01:17.100> things<00:01:17.630> then<00:01:19.370> you

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
somehow with all these things then you

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:22.250 
somehow with all these things then you
can<00:01:20.550> throw<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.910> they<00:01:21.480> can<00:01:21.660> throw<00:01:21.870> on<00:01:21.930> trip

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
can throw in they can throw on trip

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.420 
can throw in they can throw on trip
mines<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.140> my<00:01:25.350> favorite<00:01:25.710> technique<00:01:26.220> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
mines this is my favorite technique I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.359 
mines this is my favorite technique I
throw<00:01:26.910> in<00:01:27.030> tons<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.450> trip<00:01:27.720> minds<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.710> they<00:01:28.770> get

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
throw in tons of trip minds as they get

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.690 
throw in tons of trip minds as they get
blown<00:01:29.790> over<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:33.080> the<00:01:34.080> humans<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.800> if<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
blown over to the humans and if it and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.030 
blown over to the humans and if it and
if<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.510> doesn't<00:01:36.869> blow<00:01:37.080> them<00:01:37.260> up<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:40.040> throw

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
if that doesn't blow them up I throw

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.090 
if that doesn't blow them up I throw
after<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> throw<00:01:42.240> grenade<00:01:42.660> in<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.770> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
after that I throw grenade in and the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.260 
after that I throw grenade in and the
trip<00:01:44.280> mine<00:01:44.930> will<00:01:45.930> hopefully<00:01:46.200> explode<00:01:47.270> so

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
trip mine will hopefully explode so

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.700 
trip mine will hopefully explode so
that's<00:01:48.899> an<00:01:49.050> easy<00:01:49.200> kill<00:01:49.700> then<00:01:51.680> here's<00:01:52.680> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
that's an easy kill then here's the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.249 
that's an easy kill then here's the
ghost<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.250> I'm<00:01:53.670> used<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.450> push<00:01:54.899> off<00:01:55.080> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
they call here's the extra graph hammer

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.479 
they call here's the extra graph hammer
see<00:02:11.640> they

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
see they

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.369 
see they
are<00:02:14.489> these<00:02:14.760> barrels<00:02:15.150> moving

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
are these barrels moving

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.979 
are these barrels moving
anyway<00:02:18.939> we're<00:02:19.939> supposed<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.480> go<00:02:20.659> in<00:02:20.840> there

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
anyway we're supposed to go in there

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.069 
anyway we're supposed to go in there
fairly<00:02:21.260> easy<00:02:21.670> okay<00:02:22.670> then<00:02:23.239> there's<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.540> wire

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
fairly easy okay then there's a wire

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:29.610 
fairly easy okay then there's a wire
spool<00:02:24.500> here<00:02:27.129> second<00:02:28.129> you<00:02:28.459> can<00:02:28.700> knock<00:02:28.879> into<00:02:29.299> the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
spool here second you can knock into the

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.849 
spool here second you can knock into the
trash<00:02:30.620> compactor<00:02:31.689> then<00:02:32.689> you<00:02:32.959> can<00:02:33.170> destroy<00:02:33.680> the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
trash compactor then you can destroy the

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.729 
trash compactor then you can destroy the
truck<00:02:34.150> push<00:02:35.150> that<00:02:35.390> in<00:02:35.629> but<00:02:35.959> be<00:02:36.230> careful

truck push that in but be careful

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:44.050 
truck push that in but be careful
because<00:02:36.769> it<00:02:37.400> often<00:02:37.909> gets<00:02:38.209> stuck<00:02:38.689> like<00:02:39.049> now

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060
