00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
ruin anything because the sharpener

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.780

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
the other important thing always start

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.890 
the other important thing always start
with<00:00:44.160> your<00:00:44.280> base<00:00:44.430> edge<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> do<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
with your base edge you want to do that

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.390 
with your base edge you want to do that
to<00:00:46.080> keep<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.290> flush<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.830> base<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.309> then

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
to keep it flush with the base and then

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.030 
to keep it flush with the base and then
we'll<00:00:47.580> throw<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.059> ninety<00:00:48.690> degree<00:00:48.960> right<00:00:49.860> on

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
we'll throw the ninety degree right on

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.510 
we'll throw the ninety degree right on
there<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:50.730> start<00:00:51.600> by<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.930> taking<00:00:52.050> your<00:00:52.520> edge

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
there so start by just taking your edge

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.660 
there so start by just taking your edge
um<00:00:54.210> you've<00:00:54.450> got<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.750> guide<00:00:54.930> on<00:00:54.960> there<00:00:55.670> make

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
um you've got your guide on there make

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.439 
um you've got your guide on there make
sure<00:00:56.699> you're<00:00:56.910> not<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.150> have<00:00:57.330> any

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
sure you're not gonna have any

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.330 
sure you're not gonna have any
obstructions<00:00:58.290> that<00:00:58.410> are<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.040> get<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
obstructions that are going to get in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.399 
obstructions that are going to get in
the<00:00:59.430> way<00:00:59.580> because<00:01:00.360> one<00:01:00.540> key<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> this<00:01:01.050> as<00:01:01.230> well

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
the way because one key to this as well

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.479 
the way because one key to this as well
as<00:01:01.589> you<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.830> to<00:01:01.890> make<00:01:02.010> sure<00:01:02.040> you<00:01:02.220> have<00:01:02.309> nice

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
long continuous flow with your sharpener

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
long continuous flow with your sharpener
you<00:01:05.550> definitely<00:01:06.060> don't<00:01:06.180> want<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.830> just<00:01:07.830> stop

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
you definitely don't want to just stop

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.280 
you definitely don't want to just stop
halfway<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.850> take<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.210> nice<00:01:09.870> medium

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
halfway so just take it nice medium

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:24.530 
halfway so just take it nice medium
pressure<00:01:22.729> sitting<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.820> again<00:01:24.120> take<00:01:24.510> your

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
pressure sitting in again take your

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.899 
pressure sitting in again take your

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
sharpie and just run it right down your

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.770 
sharpie and just run it right down your
edge<00:01:36.469> take<00:01:37.469> your<00:01:37.619> edge<00:01:37.799> sharpener
