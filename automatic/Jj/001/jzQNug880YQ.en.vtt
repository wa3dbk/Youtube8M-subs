 you apply the two layers one on the other wet on wet 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.660
 because there is no feeling 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.340

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.750
 without a trace of brush 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.400
 fast drying thanks to the hot air of the turbine 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.500
 Paint saving a regular application without the heavens of thickness 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.760

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.839
 movement and a great deal of work 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:11.069
 and no need to wear the turbine 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.949
 in the case of the use of the backpack 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.939
 your program will not even paint that comfort of work you 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.080
 will keep the distance on your job site at home 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.870
 a large surface to be treated so as not to fill the reservoir of the 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.500
 gun every five minutes we suggest you use a tank 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.220
 dorsal 4 liters 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.819

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.609
 depending on the type of products you are here 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.469
 again the use of the back tank will prevent you from 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:45.309
 bear the weight of the paint at arm's length permanently some 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.139
 stations and alex are even powerful enough and robust to allow you 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.770
 to use the blockwork wall in the garage 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.789
 cheaper 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:56.509
 with white cement from the om and to allow you to apply some 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.959
 facade paintings 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.959
 do it yourself and achieve a saving economy 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:08.539
 bernie the public asylum protection the bed dormant monolayer under layer 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.929
 Facade food these products are very different 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:13.639
 some are very fluid 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.179
 others as clp 

00:03:15.179 --> 00:03:18.190
 so I have no trouble explaining the importance of working 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.219
 with a suitable bus size 

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.299
 to allow you a great versatility of jobs 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:24.639
 the gun are 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.679
 with two bus sets for a ride knowing that on the other hand they will 

00:03:28.679 --> 00:03:31.679
 available as an option if necessary 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:36.369
 the air cap is set to three positions 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.369
 allowing a slight horizontal or vertical horizontal 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.099
 the flow control screw will allow you to do some work of 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.089
 precision stop of flight in ironwork 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.859
 it will allow you to open the game to the maximum when you treat a facade 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.109
 the low pressure system commonly called she was following the 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.469
 country can significantly reduce the fog facts 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:03.609
 the paint coming out of the nozzle and channeled through the air around it 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.400
 this significantly reduces the masking work but let's be clear 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:10.149
 between us you still have to protect a minimum 

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.909
 the use of adhesive masking tapes will allow you to treat the 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.849
 ceiling without touching the wall and vice versa 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.660
 there are DIY tools that just simple tools allowing you to 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:23.719
 protect what must not be too late 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.610
 a wooden board will often do business 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.020
 now if his eyes 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.240
 with your alex 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.240
