 toll today would be giving a few tips 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.400
 for you are checking if the device 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:20.100
 that by its battery 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:24.930
 44 pl jn had 44 jr and A44 jh 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.500
 they are similar only with one 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.349
 bit different here where you get na 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.219
 back of the device 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:40.350
 this here is the new one new device 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:45.590
 but when we try to call him, he will not call 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:49.230
 He's just fiber and Diego. 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.010
 the first first impression is that it is 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:59.090
 a software with a problem that lived the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:05.119
 that fell but is not the battery button 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:08.250
 it's the same thing as the white screen 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:11.250
 where the lg logo appears and goes 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 disappearing slowly and turning white 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.689
 this is a battery until a little more 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:21.810
 old but it works 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:25.200

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.040
 So folks before if you're taking 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.829
 a technical assistance what you 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.259
 I like lots of money, it would be interesting. 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.380
 that you were a shop to test if the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.240
 Battery up because you're only going to buy 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.229
 batteries working there if not 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:48.220

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:51.700
 do the trick there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.220
 Here's the tip for you here in our 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.680
 assistance has already appeared in many 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.190
 devices with this type of problem 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:02.380
 and it really was the battery in the beginning 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.490
 Trying to update Fabio was making a 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.800
 leaf engine that did not solve one day 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:16.270
 try try another battery and 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:17.770
 really worked so is the tip 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.940
 first step is this battery 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.940
 take a classmate 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:33.970
 the neighbor at the friend's school 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:36.970
 working without working on the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:41.410
 market that also comes with 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.330
 certainty will not be original because the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.910
 original if you want original to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.370
 week a lg store and will pay for 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.290
 back to 70 reais 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 but the original is worth you pay the 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.850
 double but arrive where you arrived with a 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.730
 good battery is personal 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:02.580
 it could be our channel to tan the 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.980
