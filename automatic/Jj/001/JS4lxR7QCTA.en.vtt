00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.690
 1 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.610
 soraya uncross it's a girl 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:37.739
 super positive I really enjoyed his vibe 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:39.089
 so I would say soraya earlier he gets 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.100
 up we had the chance to cross too 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:44.220
 I think it's a girl a lot 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.589
 talented she knows it's supporting 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:55.050
 islam i love dany but i love 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.940
 a lot melissa nkonda too i would say 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.299
 melissa nkonda maybe for her side 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.210
 a little more roots and who told me who 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.369
 a lot more and diani for its cary side 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.869
 what is it that a rich I do not arrive 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.729
 not too much to choose I like very much 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:15.060
 two but since you have to make a choice 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:17.759
 I would say melissa nkonda this is not it 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.180
 cool I like it so fast to like it 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.890
 allen much because I was shooting whalen 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.170
 that I feel close to her in her 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:33.120
 way of treating certain subjects in 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.580
 the fact also that she is she is the 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.270
 strict in his words in his songs 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 here 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.590
 I really like that in the fray I 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.540
 know too and she has a sweet voice 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.230
 it is difficult your interview you 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.020
 had not told me that no ages i like 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.430
 his voice I can not wait for him to come back and 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.990
 now she offers us an album 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.110
 because really play up and play 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.500
 the piano and that's it and he also like 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.060
 many so his networks for this 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.860
 that she has proposed to us lately and 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.570
 also because it has its own personality 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.570
 artistic she really brings back something 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.150
 olala teri moses but I like a lot 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.950

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:27.470
 Karine has chosen between us that 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.620
 it's really you so karin I would say 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.620
 the other 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:36.710
 matthew stone because we have a beautiful 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.120
 history together on the title the price to 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.170
 pay 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.400
 we have calves nice memories 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.570
 together it's someone to whom I made 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.860
 a little bit of road that you will go 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.140

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.430
 guedj here is shine 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.680
 sometimes we do not have to say 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.010
 why I like talent but I want 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.010
 to say I like 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.740

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.790

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.069
 a he marked his time and continue to 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.069
 do it here 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:28.750
 baines no but berne it's obviously 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:30.939

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.109
 a lot both and medina that's right 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.799
 that I had the chance to do the little 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:39.340
 biopic with him so the same for for 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.299
 the affect I would say medina but alonso 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.299

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.930

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.150

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:55.770

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.710
 booba also for the title I 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:06.840
 mean to drink but I also like 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:07.880
 many aspects these two generations 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.820
 different 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.890
 I would say rim'k for uncle of the bled and 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:15.209
 what he left as an inheritance but 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:19.680
 I also like the crim we did 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.329
 bonnie and clyde a title and now there 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.990
 the actors there of his generation 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.660
 rim'k he's still here too these are these 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.260
 two people that I like so much 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.260
 more say imca 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:37.209
 I would say to rodez case because I have 

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:40.479
 made two titles with the last 100 

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:43.479
 albums but dry also I like it the same 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:47.079
 with erin case all mafia k 1 fry on 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.349
 see there they are they are they are crossing 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:52.389
 the time etc of people who puts 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:56.169
 always nice finally for who he is 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.519
 always nice for me to cross and 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.179
 here is dry also game is someone that 

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.179
 I appreciate a lot 

00:05:02.549 --> 00:05:07.659
 I kiffe games brought them a trick of 

00:05:05.049 --> 00:05:14.799
 phew but obviously it's the 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:17.049
 kery james family for sowing believe 

00:05:14.799 --> 00:05:22.599
 and for everything that has transmitted us from 

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:26.529
 positive I know I hate you at this 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:32.049
 moment it depends on the titles you see 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:34.629
 it is this cape it tears street fabi 

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:37.329
 tear also I would say tax could 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:39.219
 for the piece yema that's who's a 

00:05:37.329 --> 00:05:40.749
 very important tool for me but big 

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:47.019
 big up astrid favon prepares heavy 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:48.849
 still dj abdel this is the first with 

00:05:47.019 --> 00:05:50.860
 killer who gave me my chance on a 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.419
 project said diamyd to that probe was there 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.679
 Thursday a tenth ida but abdel and 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:06:01.110
 will understand artistically I shared 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:04.230
 a lot of 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.030
 two things with sinik with which you 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:11.040
 say it reduces naturally even if 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.020
 alger it come it's the euro so I 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.730
 would say if nick wey for 2 everything up there 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:17.150

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.150
 do together
