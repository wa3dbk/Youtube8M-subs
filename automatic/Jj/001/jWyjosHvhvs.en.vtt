so<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:04.620> video<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.069> cover<00:00:05.130> one

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
so in this video I'm going to cover one

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.679 
so in this video I'm going to cover one
of<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:05.550> common<00:00:05.850> problems<00:00:06.029> with<00:00:06.600> your

00:00:06.679 --> 00:00:06.689 
of the common problems with your

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:09.170 
of the common problems with your
automatic<00:00:06.990> cleaner<00:00:07.319> that<00:00:08.129> is<00:00:08.190> getting<00:00:08.820> stuck

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180 
automatic cleaner that is getting stuck

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.970 
automatic cleaner that is getting stuck
in<00:00:09.450> a<00:00:09.540> corner<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.080> not<00:00:10.260> move<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.620> be<00:00:10.740> able<00:00:10.799> to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
in a corner and not move to be able to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.629 
in a corner and not move to be able to
move<00:00:11.160> out<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.820> corner<00:00:12.210> so<00:00:13.280> every<00:00:14.280> pool<00:00:14.460> is

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
move out of that corner so every pool is

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.240 
move out of that corner so every pool is
little<00:00:14.849> different<00:00:15.240> configurations<00:00:16.070> but<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
little different configurations but the

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.370 
little different configurations but the
main<00:00:17.430> thing<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:18.480> sharp<00:00:18.779> corners<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.259> your

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
main thing is the sharp corners in your

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.430 
main thing is the sharp corners in your
pool<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:20.489> be<00:00:20.700> a<00:00:20.730> problem<00:00:21.180> for<00:00:21.390> swingers

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.029 

everything<00:00:26.440> is<00:00:26.529> adjusted<00:00:26.920> correctly

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
everything is adjusted correctly

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.910 
everything is adjusted correctly
containers<00:00:27.789> in<00:00:27.880> the<00:00:27.940> corner<00:00:28.210> like<00:00:28.360> this<00:00:28.770> to<00:00:29.770> be

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
containers in the corner like this to be

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:35.540 
containers in the corner like this to be
able<00:00:30.039> to<00:00:30.130> work<00:00:30.220> way<00:00:30.520> out<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.259> minute<00:00:32.410> or<00:00:32.619> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210 

so<00:00:36.550> I<00:00:36.610> come<00:00:36.880> up<00:00:37.030> to<00:00:37.150> the<00:00:37.239> side<00:00:37.510> now<00:00:38.190> she'll<00:00:39.190> be

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
so I come up to the side now she'll be

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.979 
so I come up to the side now she'll be
able<00:00:39.310> to<00:00:39.520> turn<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.790> off<00:00:39.940> at<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.150> corner<00:00:40.300> that's

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
able to turn it off at a corner that's

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:41.610 
able to turn it off at a corner that's
correct

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
correct

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.060 
correct
before<00:00:42.520> you<00:00:42.579> clear<00:00:42.850> exact<00:00:43.480> corner

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.460 

and<00:00:48.970> this<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.240> the<00:00:49.360> pool<00:00:49.570> twister<00:00:50.140> I<00:00:50.320> think

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
and this is the pool twister I think

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.720 
and this is the pool twister I think
there's<00:00:50.620> two<00:00:50.800> companies<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:51.250> make<00:00:51.430> it<00:00:51.580> now

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
there's two companies I make it now

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.910 
there's two companies I make it now
basically<00:00:52.420> what<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:52.870> device<00:00:53.050> does<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:53.710> turns

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
basically what this device does it turns

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.540 
basically what this device does it turns
all<00:00:54.220> the<00:00:54.460> hoses<00:00:55.380> three<00:00:56.380> times<00:00:56.620> every<00:00:56.830> hour<00:00:56.950> so

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
all the hoses three times every hour so

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.040 
all the hoses three times every hour so
that<00:00:57.700> if<00:00:57.790> the<00:00:57.910> cleaner<00:00:58.120> is<00:00:58.300> stuck<00:00:58.510> in<00:00:58.630> a<00:00:58.690> corner

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
that if the cleaner is stuck in a corner

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.870 
that if the cleaner is stuck in a corner
it'll<00:00:59.800> be<00:00:59.980> turned<00:01:00.190> out<00:01:00.340> of<00:01:00.490> any<00:01:00.610> kind<00:01:00.820> of

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:00.880 
it'll be turned out of any kind of

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.690 
it'll be turned out of any kind of
corner<00:01:01.650> so<00:01:02.650> it<00:01:02.740> just<00:01:02.920> kind<00:01:03.070> of<00:01:03.100> turns<00:01:03.430> the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:03.700 
corner so it just kind of turns the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.720 
corner so it just kind of turns the
hoses<00:01:04.210> as<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:05.500> clean<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.830> moves<00:01:05.980> in<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.190> pool

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
hoses as you clean and moves in the pool

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.730 
hoses as you clean and moves in the pool
it's<00:01:07.180> got<00:01:07.360> gears<00:01:07.660> in<00:01:07.840> here<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.200> they<00:01:08.290> operate

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
it's got gears in here and they operate

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.950 
it's got gears in here and they operate
to<00:01:08.830> do<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.220> you're<00:01:10.150> going<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.300> keep<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.720> gear

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
to do that you're going to keep a gear

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.590 
to do that you're going to keep a gear
spinning<00:01:11.470> in<00:01:11.620> there<00:01:12.100> and<00:01:12.790> that's<00:01:12.970> what<00:01:13.180> causes

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
spinning in there and that's what causes

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.770 
spinning in there and that's what causes
being<00:01:14.110> device<00:01:15.040> actually<00:01:15.370> work<00:01:15.790> and<00:01:16.120> twist<00:01:16.540> the

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
being device actually work and twist the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.380 
being device actually work and twist the
hoses<00:01:17.260> and<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:18.580> really<00:01:18.850> effective<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
hoses and it's really effective and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.430 
hoses and it's really effective and
keeping<00:01:19.690> me<00:01:19.810> cool

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
keeping me cool

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.260 
keeping me cool
I'm<00:01:20.800> getting<00:01:21.040> caught<00:01:21.220> in<00:01:21.520> corners<00:01:21.940> any

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
I'm getting caught in corners any

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.780 
I'm getting caught in corners any
cleaner<00:01:22.960> that<00:01:23.259> has<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.130> tendency<00:01:24.520> to<00:01:24.610> get<00:01:24.729> stuck

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
cleaner that has a tendency to get stuck

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.440 
cleaner that has a tendency to get stuck
in<00:01:25.180> one<00:01:25.210> area<00:01:25.479> this<00:01:25.780> is<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.990> great<00:01:26.200> device<00:01:26.500> I

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
in one area this is a great device I

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.359 
in one area this is a great device I
have<00:01:28.450> this<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.780> probably<00:01:29.170> about<00:01:29.470> six<00:01:29.979> or<00:01:30.130> seven

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
have this on probably about six or seven

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
effective in keeping the cleaner I'm

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.730 
effective in keeping the cleaner I'm
getting<00:01:34.450> stuck<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:34.990> one<00:01:35.140> area<00:01:35.410> of<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.560> pool

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740

and<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.430> creepy<00:01:36.759> crews<00:01:36.970> over<00:01:37.119> sometimes<00:01:37.570> get

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
and this creepy crews over sometimes get

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.240 
and this creepy crews over sometimes get
stuck<00:01:37.840> also<00:01:38.290> in<00:01:38.410> this<00:01:38.530> corner<00:01:38.860> here<00:01:39.009> with<00:01:39.160> this

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
stuck also in this corner here with this

rock formations at but since I put that
twister<00:01:42.009> on<00:01:42.040> there<00:01:42.630> about<00:01:43.630> two<00:01:43.780> years<00:01:43.930> ago

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
twister on there about two years ago

twister on there about two years ago
it's<00:01:44.530> been<00:01:44.650> working<00:01:44.860> great<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.490> hasn't<00:01:45.790> had<00:01:45.910> a

problem I'm getting stuck anywhere in

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:59.209 
problem I'm getting stuck anywhere in
this<00:01:48.340> pool

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.309 

here's<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.999> good<00:02:00.090> example<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.659> returned<00:02:00.990> jet

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
here's a good example the returned jet

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.139 
here's a good example the returned jet
that<00:02:01.530> could<00:02:01.740> cause<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> problem<00:02:02.159> has<00:02:02.939> an

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that could cause a problem has an

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.029 
that could cause a problem has an
eyeball<00:02:03.539> and<00:02:04.259> I<00:02:04.319> have<00:02:04.439> actually<00:02:04.710> have<00:02:04.950> it

eyeball and I have actually have it

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.130 
eyeball and I have actually have it
pointing<00:02:05.399> kind<00:02:05.609> of<00:02:05.670> down<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.299> kind<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.810> push<00:02:06.990> the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
pointing kind of down I kind of push the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410 
pointing kind of down I kind of push the
cleaner<00:02:07.350> over<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.000> point<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.390> was

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
cleaner over here at one point it was

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.780 
cleaner over here at one point it was
actually<00:02:09.899> going<00:02:10.229> straight<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:11.549> Queen<00:02:11.760> I

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
actually going straight out the Queen I

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.699 
actually going straight out the Queen I
wasn't<00:02:12.120> able<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.569> get<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:13.140> little<00:02:13.200> area

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
wasn't able to get that little area

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:14.930 
wasn't able to get that little area
because<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:13.890> was<00:02:13.980> pushing<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.370> hoses<00:02:14.700> over

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
because I was pushing the hoses over

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.320 
because I was pushing the hoses over
there

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
there

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.030 
there
here's<00:02:16.170> another<00:02:16.290> jet<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.739> the<00:02:16.799> middle<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
here's another jet in the middle the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.619 
here's another jet in the middle the
pool<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.370> actually<00:02:17.489> put<00:02:17.730> an<00:02:17.819> adapter<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.450> it

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
pool and I actually put an adapter on it

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.020 
pool and I actually put an adapter on it
so<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.379> that<00:02:19.500> keep<00:02:19.680> pointing<00:02:19.980> down<00:02:20.190> at

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so that is that keep pointing down at

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.270 
so that is that keep pointing down at
the<00:02:21.150> ground<00:02:21.360> well<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.560> makes<00:02:22.769> sure<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> jet

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
the ground well that makes sure the jet

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.740 
the ground well that makes sure the jet
is<00:02:23.430> shooting<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> water<00:02:23.879> down<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.480> that's

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
is shooting the water down so that's

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.180 
is shooting the water down so that's
another<00:02:25.019> thing<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.500> do<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.739> taking<00:02:26.099> out

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
another thing you can do to taking out

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.979 
another thing you can do to taking out
an<00:02:26.310> adapter<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:26.940> kind<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.180> change<00:02:27.510> direction

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
an adapter to kind of change direction

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.500 
an adapter to kind of change direction
of<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> jet<00:02:28.760> what<00:02:29.760> all<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.000> said<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.299> actually

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
of the jet what all that said I actually

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.600 
of the jet what all that said I actually
added<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:31.049> twister<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.769> one<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.069> for<00:02:32.519> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
added a twister to this one just for a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.550 
added a twister to this one just for a
little<00:02:32.760> bit<00:02:32.879> of<00:02:32.910> insurance<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:34.290> can<00:02:34.410> tell<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
little bit of insurance you can tell I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
little bit of insurance you can tell I
really<00:02:34.680> like<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.280> twister<00:02:35.760> product<00:02:36.239> the<00:02:36.690> only

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
really like the twister product the only

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.330 
really like the twister product the only
aftermarket<00:02:37.560> parts<00:02:37.769> I<00:02:37.890> know<00:02:38.069> that's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
aftermarket parts I know that's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.809 
aftermarket parts I know that's
effective

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.789 

and<00:02:44.599> here's<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.810> good<00:02:44.900> example<00:02:44.959> for<00:02:45.590> cleaner

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
and here's a good example for cleaner

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.039 
and here's a good example for cleaner
that<00:02:46.010> I<00:02:46.040> have<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> short<00:02:46.819> hose<00:02:47.060> it's

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
that I have on a short hose it's

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.780 
that I have on a short hose it's
probably<00:02:48.379> about<00:02:48.530> two<00:02:48.769> hoses<00:02:49.220> short<00:02:49.549> from

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
probably about two hoses short from

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.030 
probably about two hoses short from
reaching<00:02:49.970> the<00:02:50.930> corner<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:51.409> the<00:02:51.500> pool<00:02:51.739> so

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
reaching the corner of the pool so

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.979 
reaching the corner of the pool so
doesn't<00:02:52.459> quite<00:02:52.640> get<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.030> area<00:02:53.329> here<00:02:53.720> by<00:02:53.930> the

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
doesn't quite get this area here by the

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.869 
doesn't quite get this area here by the
deep<00:02:54.200> end<00:02:54.470> I'll<00:02:55.189> show<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:55.400> the<00:02:55.519> reason<00:02:55.640> behind

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879 
deep end I'll show you the reason behind

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.569 
deep end I'll show you the reason behind
that<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.989> is<00:02:57.170> actually<00:02:57.560> one<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.069> my<00:02:58.189> spare

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
that this is actually one of my spare

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.949 
that this is actually one of my spare
cleaners<00:02:58.939> that<00:02:59.120> I<00:02:59.180> had<00:02:59.329> kept<00:02:59.569> in<00:02:59.689> my<00:02:59.780> garage

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
cleaners that I had kept in my garage

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.410 
cleaners that I had kept in my garage
the<00:03:00.319> creepy-crawly<00:03:00.860> I<00:03:01.159> haven't<00:03:02.000> invested<00:03:02.390> a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
the creepy-crawly I haven't invested a

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.970 
the creepy-crawly I haven't invested a
lot<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.659> this<00:03:02.750> pool<00:03:03.049> if<00:03:03.379> they<00:03:03.590> had<00:03:03.739> put<00:03:03.950> a

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
lot in this pool if they had put a

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.259 
lot in this pool if they had put a
regular<00:03:04.280> cleaner<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> definitely<00:03:05.090> would

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
regular cleaner and I definitely would

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.479 
regular cleaner and I definitely would
recommend<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:06.230> different<00:03:06.530> one<00:03:06.650> for<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.159> reason

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
recommend a different one for the reason

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.789 
recommend a different one for the reason
that<00:03:07.519> I<00:03:07.909> having<00:03:08.540> a<00:03:08.659> short<00:03:08.900> hose<00:03:09.079> it's<00:03:09.409> the<00:03:09.709> way

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
that I having a short hose it's the way

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.470 
that I having a short hose it's the way
the<00:03:09.920> pool<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.220> designed<00:03:10.519> it's<00:03:10.760> got<00:03:10.909> this<00:03:11.060> long

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
the pool is designed it's got this long

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.039 
the pool is designed it's got this long
step<00:03:12.079> right<00:03:13.069> here<00:03:13.129> with<00:03:13.579> this<00:03:13.730> corner<00:03:14.150> but<00:03:14.959> the

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
step right here with this corner but the

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.140 
step right here with this corner but the
creepy<00:03:15.230> we<00:03:15.439> get<00:03:15.590> stuck<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.280> hose<00:03:16.489> mainly<00:03:17.030> we

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
creepy we get stuck the hose mainly we

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.449 
creepy we get stuck the hose mainly we
get<00:03:17.299> stuck<00:03:17.569> right<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.680> the<00:03:18.769> shallow<00:03:19.040> area

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
get stuck right here in the shallow area

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.610 
get stuck right here in the shallow area
and<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.540> creepy<00:03:20.810> would<00:03:20.959> get<00:03:21.079> jammed<00:03:21.319> in<00:03:21.500> this

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
and the creepy would get jammed in this

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.500 
and the creepy would get jammed in this
corner<00:03:22.040> that's<00:03:22.819> why<00:03:22.940> I<00:03:22.970> shortened<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.359> hose

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
corner that's why I shortened the hose

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.699 
corner that's why I shortened the hose
that<00:03:23.810> way<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:23.959> gets<00:03:24.139> around<00:03:24.319> most<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.650> the

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
that way you gets around most of the

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.740 
that way you gets around most of the
pool<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.250> clean<00:03:25.940> is<00:03:26.030> 90<00:03:26.239> percent<00:03:26.450> of<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:26.569> pool

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
pool so clean is 90 percent of the pool

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.199 
pool so clean is 90 percent of the pool
it<00:03:27.079> doesn't<00:03:27.349> get<00:03:27.440> stuck<00:03:27.709> week<00:03:28.549> after<00:03:28.670> week<00:03:28.879> so

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
it doesn't get stuck week after week so

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.910 
it doesn't get stuck week after week so
that's<00:03:29.389> one<00:03:29.569> reason<00:03:29.750> why<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.079> may<00:03:30.379> want<00:03:30.650> to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
that's one reason why you may want to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.059 
that's one reason why you may want to
have<00:03:31.489> a<00:03:31.579> shorter<00:03:31.909> hose<00:03:32.090> if<00:03:32.329> you<00:03:32.420> have<00:03:32.569> a<00:03:32.599> weird

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
have a shorter hose if you have a weird

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.430 
have a shorter hose if you have a weird
corner<00:03:34.069> like<00:03:34.639> this<00:03:34.819> here<00:03:35.239> it<00:03:36.049> couldn't<00:03:36.349> make

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
corner like this here it couldn't make

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.770 
corner like this here it couldn't make
it<00:03:36.590> caught<00:03:36.769> up<00:03:37.010> of<00:03:37.940> course<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.299> could<00:03:38.450> install<00:03:38.720> a

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
it caught up of course I could install a

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.360 
it caught up of course I could install a
pool<00:03:39.019> twister<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.709> I<00:03:39.739> would<00:03:39.889> probably<00:03:40.040> solve

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
pool twister and I would probably solve

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.099 
pool twister and I would probably solve
the<00:03:40.489> problem<00:03:41.000> but<00:03:41.450> again<00:03:41.540> like<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.870> said<00:03:41.930> this

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
the problem but again like I said this

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.199 
the problem but again like I said this
is<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.319> one<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.590> my<00:03:42.769> spare<00:03:43.040> cleaners<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.730> I

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
is just one of my spare cleaners that I

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.759 
is just one of my spare cleaners that I
had<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.389> put<00:03:44.480> in<00:03:44.540> his<00:03:44.659> customers<00:03:45.109> pool<00:03:45.409> to<00:03:45.560> help

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
had to put in his customers pool to help

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.740 
had to put in his customers pool to help
me<00:03:45.950> keep<00:03:46.609> this<00:03:46.760> full<00:03:47.000> little<00:03:47.209> cleaner<00:03:47.450> during

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:47.750 
me keep this full little cleaner during

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.809 
me keep this full little cleaner during
the<00:03:47.840> week<00:03:47.989> and<00:03:48.620> so<00:03:49.010> here<00:03:49.160> comes<00:03:49.190> the<00:03:49.489> creepy

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
the week and so here comes the creepy

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:51.159 
the week and so here comes the creepy
over<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.269> Arian<00:03:50.569> question<00:03:50.959> that<00:03:51.079> I

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
over to the Arian question that I

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:53.800 
over to the Arian question that I
mentioned<00:03:51.620> as<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.549> corner<00:03:53.030> every<00:03:53.540> pool<00:03:53.720> is

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
mentioned as a corner every pool is

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.240 
mentioned as a corner every pool is
different<00:03:54.199> so<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:54.410> have<00:03:54.500> to<00:03:54.739> adjust<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:55.099> hose

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
different so you have to adjust the hose

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.280 
different so you have to adjust the hose
accordingly<00:03:55.730> we<00:03:56.599> want<00:03:56.750> to<00:03:56.810> try<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.989> get<00:03:57.139> the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
accordingly we want to try to get the

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.280 
accordingly we want to try to get the
hose<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.769> work<00:03:57.980> for<00:03:58.430> your<00:03:58.549> particular<00:03:58.730> pool

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290

jammed and like I mentioned it's not the
cleaner<00:04:09.919> that<00:04:10.010> got<00:04:10.430> Jam<00:04:10.669> it<00:04:10.819> was<00:04:11.000> actually<00:04:11.329> the

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
cleaner that got Jam it was actually the

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.490 
cleaner that got Jam it was actually the
hose<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:12.109> kind<00:04:12.739> of<00:04:12.769> got<00:04:12.919> stuck<00:04:13.220> clean<00:04:13.849> this<00:04:14.000> area

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.330 
problem
it<00:04:26.539> was<00:04:26.659> just<00:04:26.780> a<00:04:26.930> hose<00:04:27.080> link<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.860> was<00:04:27.979> causing

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
it was just a hose link that was causing

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.189 
it was just a hose link that was causing
the<00:04:28.400> cleaning<00:04:28.699> of<00:04:28.789> the<00:04:28.849> jam<00:04:29.150> right<00:04:30.050> in<00:04:30.139> that

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
the cleaning of the jam right in that

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.800 
the cleaning of the jam right in that
area

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.930 

turning<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:36.110> to<00:04:37.010> keep<00:04:37.250> it<00:04:37.340> 50<00:04:37.550> turned<00:04:37.760> out<00:04:37.909> of

turning a to keep it 50 turned out of

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.250 
turning a to keep it 50 turned out of
that<00:04:38.060> corner<00:04:38.300> so<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.570> cleaner<00:04:38.750> action<00:04:39.110> would

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
that corner so the cleaner action would

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.040 
that corner so the cleaner action would
again<00:04:39.440> stuff<00:04:39.770> itself

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.170 

and<00:04:43.770> here's<00:04:43.950> another<00:04:44.040> example<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.790> the<00:04:44.850> host

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
and here's another example of the host

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.270 
and here's another example of the host
length<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:48.590> cleaner<00:04:49.590> connects<00:04:49.950> way<00:04:50.100> over

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
length the cleaner connects way over

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.920 
length the cleaner connects way over
there<00:04:50.400> in<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.670> shallow<00:04:50.910> end<00:04:51.030> and<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.750> is<00:04:51.810> the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
there in the shallow end and this is the

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.710 
there in the shallow end and this is the
farthest<00:04:52.380> point<00:04:52.410> in<00:04:53.310> the<00:04:53.430> pool<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.240> every

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
farthest point in the pool and every

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.760 
farthest point in the pool and every
pool<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:54.990> a<00:04:55.020> little<00:04:55.230> different<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.680> actually

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
pool is a little different I actually

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.860 
pool is a little different I actually
have<00:04:56.100> the<00:04:56.280> pulse<00:04:56.580> Wistar<00:04:56.940> device<00:04:57.210> on<00:04:57.450> this<00:04:57.630> one

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
have the pulse Wistar device on this one

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.590 
have the pulse Wistar device on this one
I<00:04:58.080> notice<00:04:58.710> that<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.920> was<00:04:58.980> getting<00:04:59.130> stuck<00:04:59.600> right

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
I notice that it was getting stuck right

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.120 
I notice that it was getting stuck right
here<00:05:00.630> in<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:00.960> shallow<00:05:01.200> end<00:05:01.500> where<00:05:02.040> it

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
here in the shallow end where it

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.070 
here in the shallow end where it
connects<00:05:02.400> into<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:02.700> pool<00:05:02.970> against<00:05:03.600> this<00:05:03.750> step

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
connects into the pool against this step

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.140 
connects into the pool against this step
like<00:05:05.040> with<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.280> twister<00:05:05.640> run<00:05:05.790> and<00:05:05.940> I<00:05:05.970> also

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
like with the twister run and I also

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.760 
like with the twister run and I also
added<00:05:06.540> that<00:05:06.570> one<00:05:06.780> extra<00:05:06.930> hose<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.560> kind<00:05:07.710> of

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
added that one extra hose to kind of

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.040 
added that one extra hose to kind of
give<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:07.920> a<00:05:08.040> little<00:05:08.190> more<00:05:08.340> slack<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:09.900> rule

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
give it a little more slack so the rule

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.690 
give it a little more slack so the rule
of<00:05:10.140> thumb<00:05:10.230> is<00:05:10.290> of<00:05:10.560> course<00:05:10.800> stretch<00:05:11.220> it<00:05:11.370> till

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
of thumb is of course stretch it till

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.850 
of thumb is of course stretch it till
reaches<00:05:12.000> the<00:05:12.090> farthest<00:05:12.450> point<00:05:12.560> without<00:05:13.560> any

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
reaches the farthest point without any

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.920 
reaches the farthest point without any
really<00:05:14.370> extra<00:05:14.700> slack<00:05:14.910> by<00:05:15.150> this<00:05:15.210> pool<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.660> had<00:05:15.840> to

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
really extra slack by this pool I had to

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.110 
really extra slack by this pool I had to
put<00:05:16.050> an<00:05:16.140> extra<00:05:16.350> hose<00:05:16.530> on<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:17.760> that<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:17.940> was<00:05:18.090> able

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
put an extra hose on so that I was able
