I'm showing you these first of all to
let<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.099> know<00:00:29.220> you<00:00:29.279> can<00:00:29.369> still<00:00:29.730> do<00:00:29.880> basic

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
let you know you can still do basic

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.450 
let you know you can still do basic
things<00:00:30.510> on<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.840> as<00:00:31.019> well<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:32.070> reason<00:00:32.369> I'm

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
things on it as well and the reason I'm

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.549 
things on it as well and the reason I'm
going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.610> show<00:00:32.790> you<00:00:32.820> fractions<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.350> that

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
going to show you fractions is that that

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.250 
going to show you fractions is that that
is<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.579> most<00:00:35.880> exciting<00:00:36.660> part<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.140> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
is the most exciting part of this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.350 
is the most exciting part of this
calculator<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.489> majority<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> your

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
calculator for the majority of your

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.060 
calculator for the majority of your
students<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.989> first<00:00:40.230> time<00:00:40.469> they're<00:00:40.680> going<00:00:40.950> to

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
students the first time they're going to

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.400 
students the first time they're going to
use<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.460> they're<00:00:41.579> probably<00:00:41.730> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> be<00:00:42.480> in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
use it they're probably going to be in

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.860 
use it they're probably going to be in
ninth<00:00:43.829> grade<00:00:43.950> taking<00:00:44.820> Algebra<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.300> or<00:00:45.719> maybe

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
ninth grade taking Algebra one or maybe

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.660 
ninth grade taking Algebra one or maybe
even<00:00:45.989> earlier<00:00:46.590> than<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.489> take

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
even earlier than that if they take

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.670 
even earlier than that if they take
Algebra<00:00:48.120> one<00:00:48.149> in<00:00:48.420> eighth<00:00:48.539> grade<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.079> they're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
Algebra one in eighth grade and they're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.590 
Algebra one in eighth grade and they're
going<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.340> excited<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.420> what

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
going to be so excited because of what

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.970 
going to be so excited because of what
I'm<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> show<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.410> we<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.770> do

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I'm going to show you that we will do

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.729 
I'm going to show you that we will do
with<00:00:53.520> fractions<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.840> let's<00:00:55.050> say<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.620> we're

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
with fractions so let's say that we're

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.099 
with fractions so let's say that we're
going<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> enter<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> fraction<00:00:56.850> four<00:00:57.480> thirds

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
going to enter the fraction four thirds

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.400 
going to enter the fraction four thirds
we're<00:00:58.890> going<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> go<00:00:59.280> ahead<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.699> press<00:00:59.910> four

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
we're going to go ahead and press four

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
we're going to go ahead and press four
and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:02.070> we're<00:01:02.190> gonna<00:01:02.280> find<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:02.969> call<00:01:03.149> a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and then we're gonna find what we call a

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.780 
and then we're gonna find what we call a
fraction<00:01:03.840> key<00:01:04.080> which<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:05.189> it's<00:01:05.460> first

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
fraction key which again it's first

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
fraction key which again it's first
column<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.720> instead<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.680> all<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:08.250> way<00:01:08.369> down

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
column and instead of all the way down

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
column and instead of all the way down
to<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> bottom<00:01:09.180> or<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.420> first<00:01:09.720> row<00:01:09.990> it's

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
to the bottom or the first row it's

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.560 
to the bottom or the first row it's
going<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.890> be<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> one<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.670> above<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.060> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
going to be the one just above that and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.649 
going to be the one just above that and
you're<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> hear<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:14.479> that's<00:01:15.479> what

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you're going to hear this that's what

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.719 
you're going to hear this that's what
you<00:01:15.810> want<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.080> hear<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.650> then<00:01:17.369> you're<00:01:17.520> going

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you want to hear and then you're going

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.080 
you want to hear and then you're going
to<00:01:17.820> press<00:01:18.060> three<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:20.189> case<00:01:20.400> you're<00:01:20.610> not

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
to press three and in case you're not

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.550 
to press three and in case you're not
sure<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.450> I've<00:01:21.630> been<00:01:21.810> talking<00:01:22.259> quite<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
sure because I've been talking quite a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.190 
sure because I've been talking quite a
bit<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.790> what<00:01:24.030> you've<00:01:24.330> really<00:01:24.720> entered

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
bit as to what you've really entered

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.960 
bit as to what you've really entered
onto<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.560> calculator<00:01:26.040> remember<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.790> have

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
onto the calculator remember we have

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.300 
onto the calculator remember we have
that<00:01:27.119> repeat<00:01:27.540> key<00:01:27.840> on<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.320> side<00:01:28.560> so<00:01:29.100> I'm<00:01:29.189> gonna

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
that repeat key on the side so I'm gonna

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.920 
that repeat key on the side so I'm gonna
press<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:31.610> okay<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.670> with<00:01:32.909> all<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.150> talking

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
press that okay so with all that talking

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
press that okay so with all that talking
I<00:01:34.200> still<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.280> correct<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.820> four<00:01:36.030> over

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I still have it correct it's four over

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.630 
I still have it correct it's four over
three<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.930> then<00:01:37.350> I'm<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.740> multiply<00:01:37.979> so

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
three and then I'm going to multiply so

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.569 
three and then I'm going to multiply so
I<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:39.060> where<00:01:39.299> my<00:01:39.420> multiply<00:01:40.049> is<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:41.070> I'm

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
I know where my multiply is and I'm

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.319 
I know where my multiply is and I'm
gonna<00:01:41.700> have<00:01:41.909> another<00:01:42.150> fraction<00:01:42.720> seven<00:01:43.680> eight

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:44.329 
gonna have another fraction seven eight

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:46.999 
gonna have another fraction seven eight
seven<00:01:45.329> over<00:01:45.960> eight<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.500> I'm<00:01:46.619> going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.860> go

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
seven over eight so I'm going to go

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.600 
seven over eight so I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.369> do<00:01:47.549> seven<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:53.100> now<00:01:53.399> I've<00:01:53.579> just

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
so what it just gave us was an answer in

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.490 
so what it just gave us was an answer in
the<00:02:15.130> form<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:16.240> mixed<00:02:16.570> number<00:02:16.750> let<00:02:17.020> me<00:02:17.050> repeat

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
the form of a mixed number let me repeat

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.650 
the form of a mixed number let me repeat
that<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.800> you<00:02:20.520> so<00:02:21.520> it<00:02:21.760> gave<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.090> an<00:02:22.210> answer<00:02:22.420> of

that for you so it gave you an answer of
1<00:02:23.320> and<00:02:23.650> 1/6<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.150> what<00:02:25.300> happens<00:02:25.720> sometimes<00:02:26.170> in

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
1 and 1/6 but what happens sometimes in

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.260 
1 and 1/6 but what happens sometimes in
math<00:02:26.530> classes<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.190> math<00:02:27.400> teacher<00:02:27.640> says<00:02:28.000> I

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
math classes the math teacher says I

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.140 
math classes the math teacher says I
like<00:02:28.990> that<00:02:29.200> answer<00:02:29.440> is<00:02:29.710> correct<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.790> want

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
like that answer is correct but I want

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.340 
like that answer is correct but I want
you<00:02:31.330> to<00:02:31.480> change<00:02:31.840> it<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.740> an<00:02:33.070> improper<00:02:33.520> fraction

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
you to change it to an improper fraction

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.440 
you to change it to an improper fraction
okay<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.860> in<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.130> case<00:02:36.580> you're<00:02:37.120> going<00:02:37.360> to

come up here and it I'm going to select

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740 
come up here and it I'm going to select
in<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.890> first<00:02:42.220> column<00:02:42.580> I'm<00:02:43.000> going<00:02:43.210> to<00:02:43.330> set<00:02:43.540> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
in the first column I'm going to set a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.740 
in the first column I'm going to set a
select<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.650> second<00:02:45.400> button<00:02:45.610> which<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.510> also

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
select the second button which just also

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.310 
select the second button which just also
happens<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.470> say<00:02:47.800> 2nd<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.480> it<00:02:50.020> happens

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
happens to say 2nd on it and it happens

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.250 
happens to say 2nd on it and it happens
to<00:02:50.410> be<00:02:50.440> blue<00:02:50.770> but<00:02:51.010> I'm<00:02:51.130> going<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> press<00:02:51.520> that

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
to be blue but I'm going to press that

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.230 
to be blue but I'm going to press that
because<00:02:53.260> what<00:02:53.410> that's<00:02:53.590> going<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:53.950> do<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.670> do

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
because what that's going to do is do

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.560 
because what that's going to do is do
the<00:02:55.420> second<00:02:56.080> function<00:02:56.860> for<00:02:57.580> my<00:02:57.760> fraction

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
the second function for my fraction

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.990 
the second function for my fraction
button<00:02:58.840> so<00:02:59.530> let's<00:02:59.740> see<00:02:59.980> what<00:03:00.220> that<00:03:00.250> second

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
button so let's see what that second

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.480 
button so let's see what that second
function<00:03:01.480> is<00:03:04.140> ok<00:03:05.140> so<00:03:05.200> what<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.740> second

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
function is ok so what the second

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.830 
function is ok so what the second
function<00:03:06.730> for<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.660> fraction<00:03:08.320> button<00:03:08.710> is<00:03:08.950> is

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
function for the fraction button is is

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.960 
function for the fraction button is is
it<00:03:10.840> converts<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.710> an<00:03:12.100> improper<00:03:12.940> fraction

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
it converts it to an improper fraction

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.090 
it converts it to an improper fraction
let's<00:03:13.600> listen<00:03:13.960> again<00:03:16.080> ok<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.140> it's<00:03:17.560> changed

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
let's listen again ok so it's changed

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.220 
let's listen again ok so it's changed
the<00:03:18.310> 1<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:18.910> 1/6<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:20.530> 76<00:03:21.490> and<00:03:22.120> we<00:03:22.540> now<00:03:22.750> have<00:03:22.780> an

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
the 1 and 1/6 to 76 and we now have an

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.740 
the 1 and 1/6 to 76 and we now have an
improper<00:03:23.680> fraction<00:03:24.180> now<00:03:25.180> if<00:03:25.360> you're<00:03:25.510> poor

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
improper fraction now if you're poor

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.720 
improper fraction now if you're poor
student<00:03:26.080> has<00:03:26.200> a<00:03:26.290> teacher<00:03:26.560> like<00:03:26.890> me<00:03:27.130> I'm<00:03:27.430> going

I<00:03:29.560> like<00:03:30.490> that<00:03:30.760> improper<00:03:31.209> fraction<00:03:31.900> but<00:03:32.380> I<00:03:32.410> just

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
I like that improper fraction but I just

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.010 
I like that improper fraction but I just
looked<00:03:32.950> at<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.190> answers<00:03:33.550> choices<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.780> tax

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
looked at the answers choices on the tax

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.740 
looked at the answers choices on the tax
test<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.040> all<00:03:36.280> they<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.670> are<00:03:36.970> decimal

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:20.370 
is I'm going to go all the way back down
get<00:04:11.530> my<00:04:11.680> fashion<00:04:11.920> key<00:04:18.690> now<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.989> has<00:04:20.140> converted

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
get my fashion key now it has converted

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.490 
get my fashion key now it has converted
our<00:04:21.330> fraction<00:04:22.330> first<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.780> converted<00:04:23.229> the

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
our fraction first it converted the

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.580 
our fraction first it converted the
mixed<00:04:23.979> number<00:04:24.250> between

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590

mixed number between
a<00:04:24.620> fraction<00:04:25.220> and<00:04:25.370> now<00:04:25.820> it<00:04:26.090> is<00:04:26.240> converted<00:04:26.810> it<00:04:26.930> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
a fraction and now it is converted it to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.400 
a fraction and now it is converted it to
decimal<00:04:27.410> form<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.810> most<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.020> students<00:04:30.350> at

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
decimal form and most of the students at

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.170 
decimal form and most of the students at
this<00:04:30.530> time<00:04:30.770> would<00:04:30.949> be<00:04:31.010> going<00:04:31.340> Oh<00:04:31.520> wah<00:04:31.760> wah<00:04:31.940> wah

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
this time would be going Oh wah wah wah

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.860 
this time would be going Oh wah wah wah
Wow

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
Wow

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.140 
Wow
and<00:04:32.990> I<00:04:33.020> think<00:04:33.860> most<00:04:34.100> most<00:04:34.550> teachers<00:04:34.790> will<00:04:34.940> be

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
and I think most most teachers will be

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.270 
and I think most most teachers will be
very<00:04:35.360> happy<00:04:35.570> with<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:35.840> as<00:04:36.169> well<00:04:36.320> and<00:04:36.860> again

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
very happy with this as well and again

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.400 
very happy with this as well and again
if<00:04:37.639> you<00:04:37.760> have<00:04:37.970> a<00:04:38.000> teacher<00:04:38.570> who<00:04:38.810> still<00:04:39.080> want<00:04:39.290> you

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
if you have a teacher who still want you

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.590 
if you have a teacher who still want you
to<00:04:39.530> continue<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.430> change<00:04:40.729> remember<00:04:41.300> you<00:04:41.419> can

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
to continue to change remember you can

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.750 
to continue to change remember you can
go<00:04:41.750> take<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.470> third<00:04:42.740> function<00:04:43.220> button<00:04:43.460> again

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
go take that third function button again

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:51.070 
go take that third function button again
it's<00:04:44.570> a<00:04:44.750> toggle<00:04:48.850> so<00:04:49.850> that's<00:04:50.090> a<00:04:50.240> toggle<00:04:50.510> it

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
it's a toggle so that's a toggle it

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.100 
it's a toggle so that's a toggle it
changes<00:04:51.830> now<00:04:52.100> it<00:04:52.520> changed<00:04:52.940> it<00:04:53.120> back<00:04:53.300> from<00:04:53.990> a

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
changes now it changed it back from a

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.280 
changes now it changed it back from a
decimal<00:04:54.500> to<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:55.520> mixed<00:04:56.060> number<00:04:56.419> and<00:04:56.570> then<00:04:56.990> again

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
decimal to a mixed number and then again

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.540 
decimal to a mixed number and then again
if<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.500> want<00:04:57.710> to<00:04:57.800> change<00:04:58.040> it<00:04:58.190> back<00:04:58.280> to<00:04:58.340> an

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
if you want to change it back to an

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.510 
if you want to change it back to an
improper<00:04:58.940> fraction<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.810> second<00:05:00.320> and<00:05:00.740> the

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
improper fraction the second and the

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.480 
improper fraction the second and the
fraction<00:05:01.940> key<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:05.270> very<00:05:05.630> very<00:05:05.990> nice<00:05:06.380> key<00:05:07.310> to

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
fraction key so very very nice key to

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.610 
fraction key so very very nice key to
have<00:05:07.700> along<00:05:08.570> with<00:05:08.780> its<00:05:08.960> second<00:05:09.410> and<00:05:09.590> third

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
have along with its second and third

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.969 
have along with its second and third
function<00:05:10.190> and<00:05:10.639> if<00:05:11.570> you<00:05:11.750> think<00:05:11.990> if<00:05:12.770> you<00:05:12.950> think

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
function and if you think if you think

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.650 
function and if you think if you think
this<00:05:13.250> is<00:05:13.400> difficult<00:05:13.850> and<00:05:14.000> I'm<00:05:14.120> thinking<00:05:14.540> in

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
this is difficult and I'm thinking in

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.500 
this is difficult and I'm thinking in
terms<00:05:14.870> of<00:05:15.020> adults<00:05:15.460> it's<00:05:16.460> much<00:05:16.820> more<00:05:17.030> difficult

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
terms of adults it's much more difficult

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.210 
terms of adults it's much more difficult
for<00:05:17.539> adults<00:05:17.840> than<00:05:18.260> it<00:05:18.380> is<00:05:18.500> for<00:05:18.710> students<00:05:19.100> and

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
for adults than it is for students and

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.610 
for adults than it is for students and
students<00:05:20.030> when<00:05:20.360> they<00:05:20.539> realize<00:05:20.990> how<00:05:21.200> much<00:05:21.350> work

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
students when they realize how much work

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.400 
students when they realize how much work
that<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:22.160> doing<00:05:22.550> for<00:05:22.789> them<00:05:23.000> they<00:05:23.510> absolutely

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
that is doing for them they absolutely

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.590 
that is doing for them they absolutely
love<00:05:24.770> having<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.400> they<00:05:25.580> they<00:05:25.970> would<00:05:26.180> they

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
love having that they they would they

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.390 
love having that they they would they
would<00:05:26.720> want<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.020> calculator<00:05:27.500> if<00:05:27.680> that's<00:05:28.100> all

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
would want the calculator if that's all

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.700 
would want the calculator if that's all
it<00:05:28.610> could<00:05:28.760> do<00:05:28.940> because<00:05:29.320> fractions<00:05:30.320> for<00:05:30.500> many

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
it could do because fractions for many

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.440 
it could do because fractions for many
of<00:05:30.889> them<00:05:31.039> are<00:05:31.580> so<00:05:31.880> difficult<00:05:32.090> and

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:32.450 
of them are so difficult and

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.570 
of them are so difficult and
time-consuming<00:05:32.830> so<00:05:33.830> just<00:05:34.160> to<00:05:34.250> let<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.550> know
