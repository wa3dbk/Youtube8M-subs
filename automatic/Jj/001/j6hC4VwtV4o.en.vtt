 awesome greenhouses are asking for us 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.009
 introduced yet with some unusual 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.660
 plants that can be grown with 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:32.470
 big desire in the room 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.300
 in residential conditions and here we had 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.730
 already a video about 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.170
 Here is such a wonderful citrus which 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.390
 called buddha hand 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:45.570
 we talked about wisteria silver 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.910
 lilac rain and now we still have 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 one story will be the roots we now you 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:54.129

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.589
 but he photographs you look what that 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.539

 beautiful 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:12.790
 lilies let's talk about glorious 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.740
 also called curly Libya because 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.200
 she has stems like creepers 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:22.230
 Dmitry is small and now I want to say 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.960
 by the way what is being sold 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.930
 planting material here from the photo 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.450
 precisely gloriosa and here you are not mistaken 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.230
 please dear friends here you see 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.710
 in the photo this is this very Gloriosa 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.170
 beautiful and inside there bulbs 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.170
 ordinary lily and even unknown what 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.050
 kind of now you see how you should 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.270
 look very root of Gloriosa here 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.350
 Please show you grows but 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.220
 dreams 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.050
 This plant family lily 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.810
 a small vineyard up to one and a half meters 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.120
 runner 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.200
 it grows 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:10.680
 in africa in asia it grows 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.020
 her tubers are like this all winter 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.140
 I lay in the open 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:21.450
 air up in the greenhouse stuck plus 8 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:24.600
 15 degrees here and as if sat down tight 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.480
 yes they do not spoil anything in principle 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.830
 you can keep them on the ground do not water 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:36.570
 no water at all 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.570
 last year, there now is 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:43.110
 it will grow back mutations no merch no 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:47.070
 from here there is no look short 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.460
 these are the tubers grown in the past 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:52.560
 year 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:54.780
 this is what the earth is doing now 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.110
 it must be very good 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.840
 fertile loose earth with organic 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.360
 humus should be like this in such 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.760
 the earth is very good carrot these here 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.510
 build up it because how would 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.580
 flowering 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.340
 depends on the size of this carrot than 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.120
 larger on those without small carrots 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 they don't bloom 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.730
 for example, this carrot is small 20 rather 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.430
 there will be nothing but he should be here 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.440
 Here is a size roughly well here or here 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:27.450
 so here it is too soon everything will be 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.580
 bloom that's when you really don't scoop 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.100
 she they look like this 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.600
 points are connected 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.450
 I mean, it's like his release 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.770
 cook and the ground like this 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:49.360
 the box for this is almost completely taken away 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:52.480
 its ground drainage is necessarily moisture so 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.720
 moisture is not absorbing material though 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.580
 expanded clay though pebbles want 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.280
 no difference will be scored completely as 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.650
 would this grit this box and here 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.840
 we stack them horizontally 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.250
 I laid horizontally and then 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.910
 I fall asleep two centimeters x three 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:16.329
 here and begin to water and in the spring I do not 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:20.730
 here look here they are like this 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:23.919
 break open this shaped fork yes 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.580
 here it turns out these here 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.919
 say the fault here, but the sprout goes 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.720
 here here here you can see 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.050
 underlined on reds somehow 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.910
 interesting and here you can see that 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.520
 you have the pilot was on the other side 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.030
 rage and start yes yes yes you can see 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.419
 already a dinner swollen works and see 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:51.100
 Here you are planted for example by hand in the spring 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:55.060
 here this carrot gives such here it will give 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.669
 tramp out of here in the form here and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.229
 along the axis well in the fall will rise again 2 2 this 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.660
 old carrots she will die off she 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:07.150
 will turn into dust and decay that is 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.740
 will again be such a v-shaped will be 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.169
 such speed has evolved 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.590
 Who's stopping this is one brand of wine 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.860
 here gives 2 here and you them then 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.630
 here you break a little bit and 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.640
 the third air under this move 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.650
 dry before it can be planted here 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.580
 Here, too, the kidney can see red now she 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.790
 almost ready to germinate 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:36.250
 understandable as stated in the literature in 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.440
 In principle, this plant can 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:45.280
 us grown in the chest and that is she 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:47.639
 like gladiolus we plant she passes 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:51.689
 summer ground and autumn 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:53.960
 how are you still before I grew buckwheat 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:56.400
 wait I want to try 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.409
 plant but make a small hole 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.449
 make for good earth appliance 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.939
 put this on the street see how she 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:06.080
 will shine quite expressively 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:09.409
 fiery orange-red 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.180
 changing color changing color they still 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.539
 wonderful plants here i want 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:17.999
 time to pay attention if you see on 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.870
 packaged photos of this one here 

00:06:17.999 --> 00:06:22.680
 gloriosa 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:25.590
 but inside it will be simple 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.469
 ordinary onion like a lily say 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:31.349
 Asian hybrid that's a sell something 

00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:33.689
 mean we were tricked you trying 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:37.400
 cheat anyway but there is 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:39.419
 hit here such here such nodule 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.279
 wonderful story, Sergey, thank you 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.319

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:46.159
 We will try to grow out of you a 

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.159
 beauty
