00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
now the mainstay of our policy nor is
the<00:00:09.119> anchor<00:00:09.389> plate<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.869> I'm<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.500> to<00:00:10.559> show

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the anchor plate and I'm going to show

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.630 
the anchor plate and I'm going to show
you<00:00:10.799> how<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.070> install<00:00:11.549> one<00:00:11.789> correctly<00:00:19.400> now<00:00:20.400> I'm

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
you how to install one correctly now I'm

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.560 
you how to install one correctly now I'm
making<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:21.090> hole<00:00:21.440> that<00:00:22.440> is<00:00:22.560> at<00:00:22.710> least<00:00:22.740> three

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
making a hole that is at least three

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.510 
making a hole that is at least three
inches<00:00:24.570> or<00:00:24.750> 75<00:00:25.170> mil<00:00:25.770> all<00:00:26.190> the<00:00:26.940> way<00:00:27.090> around<00:00:28.520> the

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
inches or 75 mil all the way around the

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.580 
inches or 75 mil all the way around the
anchor<00:00:29.820> plate<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.140> can<00:00:31.320> fit<00:00:31.560> right

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
anchor plate so that that can fit right

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.000 
anchor plate so that that can fit right
down<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> bottom<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.759> properly<00:00:34.010> now

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
down to the bottom of it properly now

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.490 
down to the bottom of it properly now
the<00:00:35.070> hole<00:00:35.340> has<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.790> be<00:00:35.970> deep<00:00:36.840> enough<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.200> that

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the hole has to be deep enough so that

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.740 
the hole has to be deep enough so that
we<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.950> this<00:00:38.160> into<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.970> ground<00:00:39.239> leaving

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
we can get this into the ground leaving

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
we can get this into the ground leaving
around<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.850> four<00:00:41.850> inches<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> hundred

it down I wanted to be so that this

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.519 
it down I wanted to be so that this
there<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.759> proud<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.719> soil<00:01:27.990> loses<00:01:28.170> a

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:28.529 
there is just proud of the soil loses a

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:33.219 
there is just proud of the soil loses a
part<00:01:29.009> perfect<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:31.009> these<00:01:32.009> u-bolts<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:32.849> what

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
part perfect now these u-bolts are what

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.819 
part perfect now these u-bolts are what
hold<00:01:34.939> the<00:01:35.939> plate<00:01:36.599> in<00:01:36.899> position<00:01:37.109> so<00:01:37.529> this<00:01:37.679> goes

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
hold the plate in position so this goes

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
hold the plate in position so this goes
down<00:01:38.069> first<00:01:38.340> then<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.029> have<00:01:39.149> to<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.389> inside

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
down first then we have to get inside

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.930 
down first then we have to get inside
and<00:01:39.840> tightening

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.160 

so<00:01:43.940> it's<00:01:44.030> finger<00:01:44.330> tight<00:01:44.360> first<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:45.800> then<00:01:45.950> we

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
so it's finger tight first and then we

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.280 
so it's finger tight first and then we
type<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.350> whole<00:01:48.500> thing<00:01:48.800> now<00:01:48.980> if<00:01:49.160> you<00:01:49.310> have
