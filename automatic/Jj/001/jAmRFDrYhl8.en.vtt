00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.889 
finger I just like this secondary
because<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.789> reminds<00:01:51.060> me<00:01:51.300> of<00:01:51.569> the<00:01:52.459> UM<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
what is that

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.430 
what is that
called<00:02:08.800> reflex<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.400> dead<00:02:10.940> silence<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:12.290> is

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
called reflex and dead silence this is

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.810 
called reflex and dead silence this is
just<00:02:12.590> because<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.220> know<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.490> lot<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.610> hand

where<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.720> want<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:32.989> use<00:03:33.140> an<00:03:33.260> AR<00:03:33.530> but<00:03:33.680> they're

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
where I want to use an AR but they're

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.790 
where I want to use an AR but they're
not<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:34.340> big<00:03:34.610> that<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:35.780> need<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.350> be<00:03:36.500> shooting

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
not so big that I need to be shooting

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.949 
not so big that I need to be shooting
across<00:03:37.100> the<00:03:37.459> map<00:03:37.610> they're<00:03:37.790> like<00:03:38.000> maps<00:03:38.690> that<00:03:38.870> I

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
across the map they're like maps that I

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.140 
across the map they're like maps that I
could<00:03:39.200> use<00:03:39.350> an<00:03:39.500> SMG<00:03:39.769> on<00:03:40.100> but<00:03:40.310> I<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:40.730> don't

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
could use an SMG on but I just don't

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.880 
could use an SMG on but I just don't
want<00:03:41.450> to<00:03:41.540> because<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.320> want<00:03:42.470> to<00:03:42.530> play<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.739> little

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
want to because I want to play a little

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.759 
want to because I want to play a little
bit<00:03:43.130> slower<00:03:43.780> so<00:03:44.780> that<00:03:45.019> would<00:03:45.170> be<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.350> bloody

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
bit slower so that would be the bloody

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.259 
bit slower so that would be the bloody
ones<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.310> know<00:03:46.400> and<00:03:46.610> that's<00:03:46.760> why<00:03:46.850> I<00:03:46.940> have<00:03:47.120> on

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
ones you know and that's why I have on

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.060 
ones you know and that's why I have on
the<00:03:47.450> strong<00:03:47.720> arm<00:03:47.900> an<00:03:48.110> extra<00:03:48.350> tactical<00:03:48.800> because

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
the strong arm an extra tactical because

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.130 
the strong arm an extra tactical because
it's<00:03:49.310> not<00:03:49.820> the<00:03:50.030> biggest<00:03:50.330> map<00:03:50.450> in<00:03:50.630> the<00:03:50.660> world<00:03:50.900> so

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
it's not the biggest map in the world so

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.840 
it's not the biggest map in the world so
I<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.410> throw<00:03:51.680> stones<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:52.250> know<00:03:52.370> right<00:03:52.640> to

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
I can throw stones you know right to

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.490 
I can throw stones you know right to
where<00:03:53.030> they're<00:03:53.209> gonna<00:03:53.330> be<00:03:53.450> these<00:03:54.200> would<00:03:54.410> be

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
where they're gonna be these would be

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.560 
where they're gonna be these would be
maps<00:03:54.709> like<00:03:54.950> strike<00:03:55.220> zone<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.640> right<00:03:55.850> strike

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
maps like strike zone all right strike

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.150 
maps like strike zone all right strike
zone<00:03:56.810> freight<00:03:57.140> maps<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.680> that<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:57.950> where<00:03:58.130> I

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
zone freight maps like that is where I

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.670 
zone freight maps like that is where I
like<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.489> have<00:03:58.610> that<00:03:58.730> extra<00:03:58.910> stun<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.630> then<00:04:00.320> on

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
like to have that extra stun and then on

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.160 
like to have that extra stun and then on

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
my chill they are you know I'd the ak-12

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.820 
my chill they are you know I'd the ak-12
red<00:04:03.890> dot<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.489> grip<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:06.170> same<00:04:06.440> radical

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
red dot and grip I that same radical

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.160 
red dot and grip I that same radical
site<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.370> on<00:04:08.209> this<00:04:08.390> one<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.660> actually<00:04:08.840> have<00:04:09.110> a

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
site and on this one I actually have a

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.810 
site and on this one I actually have a
secondary<00:04:09.650> because<00:04:10.040> this<00:04:10.250> one<00:04:10.430> I'll<00:04:10.549> be<00:04:10.670> using

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
secondary because this one I'll be using

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.660 
secondary because this one I'll be using
on<00:04:11.030> bigger<00:04:11.269> maps<00:04:11.600> so<00:04:12.410> I'll<00:04:12.799> tend<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.250> shoot<00:04:13.580> a

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
on bigger maps so I'll tend to shoot a

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.160 
on bigger maps so I'll tend to shoot a
lot<00:04:13.850> more<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.450> might<00:04:14.630> not<00:04:14.780> be<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> most

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
lot more and I might not be the most

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.330 
lot more and I might not be the most
accurate<00:04:15.470> at<00:04:15.890> those

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
accurate at those

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.879 
accurate at those
shots<00:04:16.910> so<00:04:17.570> if<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.810> rhyme<00:04:18.019> on<00:04:18.410> you<00:04:18.620> know<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.739> always

shots so if I rhyme on you know I always

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:20.849 
shots so if I rhyme on you know I always
have<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.190> second<00:04:19.489> date<00:04:19.609> just<00:04:19.940> in<00:04:20.120> case<00:04:20.329> and

now for my favorite class you guys have
been<00:05:55.820> playing<00:05:55.880> singles<00:05:56.630> to<00:05:57.380> my<00:05:57.560> knowledge

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
been playing singles to my knowledge

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.550 
been playing singles to my knowledge
still<00:05:58.580> there<00:05:58.820> allowing<00:05:59.150> this<00:05:59.479> class<00:05:59.810> to<00:06:00.110> go<00:06:00.289> I

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
still there allowing this class to go I

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.279 
still there allowing this class to go I
would<00:06:01.370> check<00:06:01.550> the<00:06:01.700> rules<00:06:01.940> every<00:06:02.570> day<00:06:02.780> before

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
would check the rules every day before

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:05.020 
would check the rules every day before
you<00:06:03.440> go<00:06:03.650> and<00:06:03.830> try<00:06:04.010> this<00:06:04.070> out<00:06:04.340> like<00:06:04.490> I've<00:06:04.700> been

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030 
you go and try this out like I've been

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.480 
you go and try this out like I've been
but<00:06:05.720> you<00:06:06.349> know<00:06:06.470> I<00:06:06.770> have<00:06:06.919> always<00:06:07.130> had<00:06:07.250> that

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
but you know I have always had that

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.400 
but you know I have always had that
extra<00:06:07.820> class<00:06:08.060> lot<00:06:08.389> that<00:06:08.599> I<00:06:08.630> don't<00:06:08.900> need<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.169> use

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
extra class lot that I don't need to use

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.770 
extra class lot that I don't need to use
I'll<00:06:09.800> probably<00:06:10.250> end<00:06:10.520> up<00:06:10.610> putting<00:06:10.849> like<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.120> bees

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
I'll probably end up putting like a bees

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.230 
I'll probably end up putting like a bees
on<00:06:12.020> in<00:06:12.229> this<00:06:12.380> little<00:06:12.680> spot<00:06:12.950> once<00:06:13.639> they<00:06:13.820> ban<00:06:14.060> it

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
on in this little spot once they ban it

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.700 
on in this little spot once they ban it
but<00:06:14.389> if<00:06:14.479> you're<00:06:14.630> playing<00:06:14.840> singles<00:06:15.440> this<00:06:15.590> is

but if you're playing singles this is

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.409 
but if you're playing singles this is
probably<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.160> funniest<00:06:16.400> class<00:06:16.760> you<00:06:16.970> can<00:06:17.090> use

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:17.419

probably the funniest class you can use
it<00:06:17.599> is<00:06:18.200> the<00:06:18.380> riot<00:06:18.650> shield<00:06:18.830> with<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.580> radar

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
it is the riot shield with a radar

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.920 
it is the riot shield with a radar
attachment
