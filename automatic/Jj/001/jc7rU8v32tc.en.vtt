 to my channel one more day and well I bring you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.949
 how to put porcelain nails step by step 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.830
 are these that I have around here so you can 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.410
 see more or less some summary of the video 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.320
 and I have a video that I did quite a bit 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 was how to put gel nails step by step 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 I'll leave you here somewhere 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.449
 so you can see it but this time 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.820
 let's make porcelain is going to be very 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.739
 easy very simple you are going to do everything 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 what do you have to use because you already know 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.969
 that soon I have my recording and you have to 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.500
 go then live the death so we do not 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.390
 will be until the end and soon 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 I will upload vi crimes of all models 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.960
 of clothes that I have to wear so that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.160
 tell me which one you like the most because the 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 it's true that my head is in a mess 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.219
 I hope you like to stay and start 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.329
 perfect let's start with the first 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.910
 step the first step is that we're going to catch 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.540
 the cuticle harrow and let's remove all 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.540
 the cuticle 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.799
 If there is excess cuticle we are going to throw it out 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.799
 backwards in the little fingers 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.039
 to have more space 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.360
 to put all the products and apart 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.880
 to remove the cuticles that we 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.649
 we have to dehydrate the nail 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.570
 and so we're going to do it with all the 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.390
 little fingers come with tranquility this 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.909
 step is the most important so that 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.549
 absorb porcelain well into the nail and 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.000
 the excess is super well dehydrated 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.550
 of the cuticle we will remove 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.210
 with a cuticle cutter we're going to 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.000
 remove everything perfect with tranquility 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.090
 ok and now I say the second step 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090
 i 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.789
 the second step we will proceed to 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.740
 dehydrate the nail we have to remove 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.860
 the natural brightness and this step is super 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.900
 important because we have to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 at the edges milestones where is the 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.660
 cuticle we have to do it super well 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.370
 because if we have a nail with glitter there 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.710
 porcelain is not going to be introduced well 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.280
 and it is easier for the nail to fall off later 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 quickly 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.409
 now it is very important that the nail does not 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.480
 touch for the client or for us 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:18.390
 same and with a little brush just what 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.250
 we will do is remove excess 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.010
 the powder that we have left but the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.579
 nail has to be dehydrated you see 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.579
 the difference 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.350
 Now we will take the appropriate tip for 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.760
 our finger we have to measure very well 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.959
 and let it be sap by the green milestones 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.450
 this step is very important for the 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.800
 nail is exactly stuck to the finger and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.300
 we are going to stick it with a glue 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.300
 specific for nails 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.010
 two 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.230
 perfect and once the 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.290
 tip us good if you see here there is a 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.140
 little step of the type stuck to the nail 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 we have to make this disappear 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:04.490
 limando 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.860
 we have to match it and let it be 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.520
 let this be lawful 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.520
 completely 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.010
 ah 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:27.319
 Very well, I could have this step 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.319
 done before or after cutting 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.890
 I'm going to cut it now 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:38.230
 to the extent that the customer of 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.230
 you same as you 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.379
 and we cut 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.170
 we are also going to encourage the way 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.879
 want the client or the form that 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.739
 we want as we do 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.629
 doing so now we proceed to 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.879
 file here and keep perfecting 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.879
 all the part around the nail 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.080
 perfect just as we have dehydrated 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.750
 before our nail as it remembers and 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.660
 It is also important to dehydrate the nail 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.060
 of the type the part of here because here 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.220
 there will also be porcelain product 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.819
 and also very important the sea everything 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.819
 let everything be 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.159
 juntitos I do not know if you notice that there is not 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.159
 no small step 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.990
 and now we are going to proceed to put the 1st 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:37.719
 for the whole part of the cuticle and 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.719
 our natural union 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.719
 and let it dry and go back to the next 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:45.719
 He passed 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.670
 perfect now let's use let's 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:55.980
 introduce the liquid 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.740
 with which we are going to have to 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:01.530
 still go along with the porcelain to be able 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.240
 make our porcelain nail we're going to 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.729
 put the monkey but here 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.080
 and we are going to introduce a little bit of 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.569
 porcelain 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.900
 and we're going to put it in the part of the 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.900
 enrollment 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.180
 ah 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.820
 to 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.030
 Y 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.330
 very important 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.660
 and enter well in the part of the 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.660
 cuticle 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:58.169
 but never ever put porcelain in the 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.169
 skin 

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:03.009
 because if it's not much easier to be 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:07.770
 takeoff 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:07.770
 and now let's let it dry 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.930
 perfect once the porcelain is 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.930
 is removed let's proceed to file the 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.780
 leave it completely smooth once it is 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.990
 all the nail the ymad and is on the sides 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.300
 by the extremes is all perfect 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.270
 let's proceed to paint them the color 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.140
 that we want in this case I'm going to 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.140
 paint white 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.839
 no more 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.690
 all right 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.229
 you can not 

00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.229
 Y 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.990
 and well girls this is the final result 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:11.839
 here we have our nails completely 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:14.149
 painted and put their capita 

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:15.379
 shine I have put it well finite 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:17.059
 because I want it just for the 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:19.569
 graduation and I did not want you not to see 

00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:19.569
 natural 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.000
