00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.000
 we almost have left so those are pretty 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.340
 that can be one for the port it 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 is decorating another to give him a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.849
 friend and always when to have these 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.830
 little things ready because you do not know 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.770
 when that moment will come when 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.010
 It is necessary to give a gift of entrepreneurship 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:25.300
 I put the phone number 966 04 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:29.590
 24 490 1992 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.110
 at the time so well we're still here 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:34.680
 waiting for a camera with lion sandro 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.680
 exact 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.010
 so long as its end 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.880
 the machine 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 now 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.840
 when they see you that they are like 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.740
 stolen simply dress like that 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 ends 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.320
 of pink little needles 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:28.369
 here is the bedspread once it tenses up 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.369
 They took all the little piece 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.850
 this comfortable I like all pigeons 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.500
 Suddenly they will take you out of the 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.750
 I design the drawing so they will take it out 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.370
 the other one is not going to get it out 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.560
 they still need 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.270
 Anyway the loser and I'm going 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.450
 to show something that I did not show it in the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.340
 previous part has a whole small 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.210
 vast around 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 this also this one would be forced 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.880
 the sale is also there with everything 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.880
 that is ready and ready 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 to 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.520
 this one is already 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.280
 unless it's ready 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.319
 this pumpkin to all aggressors almost 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.930
 there is more 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.900
 it's already done I want to mount very well 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.030
 and today they told me that here I come 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.469
 doing everything around so that in this 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.300
 moment when the linings do not pass me 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.670
 nothing 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.650
 a little posture here this position is 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.170
 very important because your temple's 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.190
 Calibrator opened in this way when 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.330
 I will place the forum 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.400
 then he has as I say to all 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.200
 girls of the course should stand out as 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.160
 who says so that he has the most 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.160
 stretched possible 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.380
 inside this club 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.209
 and then you as all the man 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.690
 it wrinkles wayward they were 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.710
 formed 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.320
 an empty tray 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:00.030
 here the coastal coast can do it 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:03.440
 before shortening the centers 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.440
 they can not do it later 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.570
 and we're still down here 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.610
 how are we going there is what is being done 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.640
 cooking for you is totally at 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.080
 reverse 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.860
 there is here 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.420
 and he had left alone this short 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.420
 to give the classes appointments 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.000
 today is once they matched everything 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.580
 value check that everything is in order by 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.709
 example here this surplus of wadding what 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.209
 they are going to withdraw they do not have to let 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.459
 be nothing or you see nothing because 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.459
 We give for the part of lining the ebro 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.980
 there is good 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.980
 success also we are not going to 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.790
 and this parasite also 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:11.620
 when when we put it 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.240
 once you have to solano 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.100
 with this system 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.459
 in the same book because all this from the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.459
 money 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.510
 how to achieve good simple rivero a 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.730
 place the open lining fabric over 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.010
 the table or the peak or the place where you 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:32.040
 work and then I'm going to run this 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.180
 gentlemen gave me minute here so there 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:39.259
 and you are going to put the penalty 10 and dady 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.259
 not to withdraw everything 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:43.800
 our ways 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.220
 one 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.750
 and what's going to put it on in shape is a 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.340
 little bit very red but I had to 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.970
 to teach 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.970
 AdriÃ¡n 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.380
 we are there 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:04.060
 for other things between his name 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:04.060
 I have enough material 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.860
 sometimes I want we are not going to cut 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.860
 two centimeters 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.550
 a little bit bigger 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.030
 one for pigs 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.030
 a bit like and here the same 

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:41.539
 no no 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.110
 I save this I save it to make another 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:54.169
 draft 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:57.370
 It fit me well and I pay it I'm going to 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:06:01.009
 generate all of pins or if you want 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:03.669
 here we are very close and if you want what 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:03.669
 they can chew 

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:08.930
 to be able to more 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.930
 in the morning 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.060
 because I'm stressed things I 'm going to put 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.669
 some easy 

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:17.669
 the road now because it is more 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:25.550
 no no no 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.599
 or not 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.410
 against this 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.520
 contrasted 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:44.149
 and I'm going to prepare my super needle for 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.149
 can celebrate 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.980
 what is convenient is intersection and the 

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.440
 dark but not here now at the hand of the 

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.520
 program I do not have it 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.520
 It is very good and the best 

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.100
 I'm going to start from scratch 

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.639
 these needles from you from our bags 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.289
 for the day doll 

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:18.280
 that we also use it for those who 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:18.280
 they are totally discontinued 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:26.069
 two 

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.990
 and you are doing it with the expenses 

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.940
 because I simply do not have rentals 

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.460
 This is from many many many parades 

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:40.880
 in the house you can do with the 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.050
 been these are going to continue here with 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.660
 this other side 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:47.210
 you want peace 

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.800
 let's go to the other side today is 

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:51.730
 migrations of ccoo bastian cielos es 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.730
 but he came back with all this we're going to 

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:54.730
 return
