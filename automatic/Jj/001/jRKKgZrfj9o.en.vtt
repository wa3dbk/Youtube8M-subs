rider raid you know you've taken on all
the<00:02:26.520> defense's<00:02:27.090> you've<00:02:27.450> got<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.630> lot<00:02:27.840> of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the defense's you've got a lot of

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.510 
the defense's you've got a lot of
buildings<00:02:28.349> to<00:02:28.410> clean<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.739> and<00:02:28.920> not<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.280> much

buildings to clean up and not that much

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
buildings to clean up and not that much
time<00:02:29.819> like<00:02:30.780> hog<00:02:31.050> riders<00:02:31.410> balloons<00:02:31.800> can<00:02:32.040> at

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
time like hog riders balloons can at

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580 
time like hog riders balloons can at
least<00:02:32.250> jump<00:02:32.700> over<00:02:32.940> walls<00:02:32.970> so<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:34.290> don't<00:02:34.530> have

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
least jump over walls so you don't have

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.590 
least jump over walls so you don't have
to<00:02:34.709> worry<00:02:34.860> about<00:02:34.980> being<00:02:35.220> stuck<00:02:35.880> by<00:02:36.090> walls<00:02:36.330> but

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to worry about being stuck by walls but

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.750 
to worry about being stuck by walls but
unlike<00:02:37.230> hog<00:02:37.410> riders<00:02:37.739> balloons<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.340> really

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
unlike hog riders balloons are really

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.290 
unlike hog riders balloons are really
really<00:02:39.120> slow<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:41.100> know<00:02:41.610> it's<00:02:41.730> there<00:02:42.180> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
really slow so you know it's there is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.360 
really slow so you know it's there is
always<00:02:42.599> a<00:02:42.630> matter<00:02:42.870> of<00:02:42.989> time<00:02:43.080> here<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:43.650> looks

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
always a matter of time here but looks

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.130 
always a matter of time here but looks
like<00:02:44.519> we<00:02:44.670> will<00:02:44.819> be<00:02:44.970> fine<00:02:45.209> with<00:02:45.390> 30<00:02:45.750> seconds

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
like we will be fine with 30 seconds

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.470 
like we will be fine with 30 seconds
left<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.530> not<00:02:46.769> very<00:02:47.040> many<00:02:47.220> buildings<00:02:47.610> to<00:02:48.180> go

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
left and not very many buildings to go

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600 
left and not very many buildings to go
and<00:02:49.440> definitely<00:02:49.800> having<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.220> arch<00:02:50.370> queen

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
and definitely having the arch queen

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.150 
and definitely having the arch queen
made<00:02:50.790> me<00:02:50.910> feel<00:02:51.090> a<00:02:51.120> lot<00:02:51.510> better<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.230> this

base was funny he had semi you know
mid-range<00:02:56.340> defenses<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:57.299> really<00:02:57.690> high<00:02:57.840> level

Archer<00:04:36.949> Queen<00:04:37.100> they<00:04:37.340> do<00:04:37.400> sometimes<00:04:37.940> but<00:04:38.240> no<00:04:38.720> it

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
Archer Queen they do sometimes but no it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.629 
Archer Queen they do sometimes but no it
doesn't<00:04:39.229> look<00:04:39.290> like<00:04:39.380> we're<00:04:39.590> even<00:04:39.949> close<00:04:40.400> this

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
doesn't look like we're even close this

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:44.020 
doesn't look like we're even close this
time<00:04:40.930> not<00:04:41.930> good<00:04:42.199> if<00:04:43.130> we'd<00:04:43.310> kill<00:04:43.550> the<00:04:43.669> art<00:04:43.820> we

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
time not good if we'd kill the art we

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.219 
time not good if we'd kill the art we
know<00:04:44.090> I<00:04:44.210> would<00:04:44.360> feel<00:04:44.389> pretty<00:04:44.840> good<00:04:44.990> about<00:04:45.050> a

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
know I would feel pretty good about a

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.070 
know I would feel pretty good about a
three<00:04:45.470> star<00:04:45.650> in<00:04:45.770> this<00:04:45.860> raid<00:04:46.100> but<00:04:46.760> if<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.419> you

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
three star in this raid but if you you

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.870 
three star in this raid but if you you
know<00:04:48.199> look<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.650> arch<00:04:48.770> queen<00:04:49.010> is<00:04:49.130> level<00:04:49.520> 40

she's gonna devastate balloons she's
gonna<00:04:51.770> follow<00:04:52.070> him<00:04:52.160> all<00:04:52.370> around<00:04:52.669> the<00:04:52.910> base

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
gonna follow him all around the base

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.050 
gonna follow him all around the base
just<00:04:53.419> killing<00:04:54.169> them<00:04:54.260> pow<00:04:54.500> pow<00:04:54.530> pow<00:04:54.740> so<00:04:55.280> you

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.460 
just killing them pow pow pow so you
know<00:04:56.150> not<00:04:56.360> looking<00:04:56.510> good<00:04:56.720> for<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:56.930> 3<00:04:57.080> star<00:04:57.229> at

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
know not looking good for a 3 star at

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.980 
know not looking good for a 3 star at
least<00:04:57.830> my<00:04:58.160> heroes<00:04:58.639> are<00:04:58.850> in<00:04:59.419> good<00:04:59.539> shape<00:04:59.600> and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
least my heroes are in good shape and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.540 
least my heroes are in good shape and
they<00:05:00.260> can<00:05:00.410> take<00:05:00.590> out<00:05:00.710> that<00:05:00.830> town<00:05:01.070> hall<00:05:01.340> and

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
they can take out that town hall and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.879 
they can take out that town hall and
we'll<00:05:02.449> probably<00:05:02.810> get<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.199> two<00:05:03.350> star<00:05:03.620> just

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:03.889 
we'll probably get the two star just

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.580 
we'll probably get the two star just
fine<00:05:04.190> so<00:05:05.090> at<00:05:05.240> this<00:05:05.360> point<00:05:05.570> i<00:05:05.780> had<00:05:05.870> only<00:05:06.080> saved

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
fine so at this point i had only saved

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:09.219 
fine so at this point i had only saved
two<00:05:06.919> balloons<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.669> surprisingly<00:05:08.389> that<00:05:08.990> first

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
two balloons and surprisingly that first

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:10.990 
two balloons and surprisingly that first
group<00:05:09.350> of<00:05:09.560> balloons<00:05:09.830> is<00:05:10.010> doing<00:05:10.430> okay<00:05:10.760> there's

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
group of balloons is doing okay there's

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.100 
group of balloons is doing okay there's
a<00:05:11.090> few<00:05:11.300> of<00:05:11.360> them<00:05:11.479> left<00:05:11.510> but<00:05:11.870> they're<00:05:11.960> going

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
a few of them left but they're going

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.560 
a few of them left but they're going
down<00:05:12.320> really<00:05:12.530> fast<00:05:12.889> if<00:05:13.220> at<00:05:13.850> this<00:05:14.030> point<00:05:14.120> i<00:05:14.539> had

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
down really fast if at this point i had

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.240 
down really fast if at this point i had
dropped<00:05:15.020> my<00:05:15.110> balloons<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.620> little<00:05:15.919> earlier

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
dropped my balloons a little earlier

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.760 
dropped my balloons a little earlier
these<00:05:16.460> remaining<00:05:16.910> two<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.389> possibly<00:05:18.020> take<00:05:18.620> it

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
these remaining two and possibly take it

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.070 
these remaining two and possibly take it
out<00:05:18.889> that<00:05:19.100> wizard<00:05:19.460> tower<00:05:19.780> might<00:05:20.780> have<00:05:20.930> had<00:05:21.050> a

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
out that wizard tower might have had a

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.650 
out that wizard tower might have had a
small<00:05:21.800> chance<00:05:22.160> for<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.400> three<00:05:22.580> star<00:05:22.760> but<00:05:23.030> really

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
small chance for a three star but really

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.469 
small chance for a three star but really
at<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:23.900> point<00:05:23.990> there<00:05:24.380> is<00:05:24.500> no<00:05:24.530> hope<00:05:25.039> so<00:05:25.850> you

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
at this point there is no hope so you

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.939 
at this point there is no hope so you
know<00:05:26.600> that's<00:05:26.900> the<00:05:27.199> that's<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.710> right

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
know that's the that's the right

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.490 
know that's the that's the right
strategy<00:05:28.729> guys<00:05:28.940> you'll<00:05:29.300> see<00:05:29.510> how<00:05:29.900> close<00:05:30.260> this

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
strategy guys you'll see how close this

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.040 
strategy guys you'll see how close this
was<00:05:30.770> to<00:05:30.950> working<00:05:31.340> if<00:05:32.060> i<00:05:32.210> had<00:05:32.240> had<00:05:32.360> a<00:05:32.479> better<00:05:32.810> way

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
was to working if i had had a better way

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.350 
was to working if i had had a better way
of<00:05:33.080> killing<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.650> archer<00:05:34.010> queen<00:05:34.220> and<00:05:34.460> taking

out those air defense at the top or the
bottom<00:05:38.020> where<00:05:39.020> i<00:05:39.080> started<00:05:39.560> it<00:05:40.340> would<00:05:40.460> have

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
bottom where i started it would have

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.920 
bottom where i started it would have
been<00:05:40.610> a<00:05:40.669> surefire<00:05:40.940> a<00:05:41.120> three-star<00:05:41.599> because<00:05:41.840> i

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
been a surefire a three-star because i

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:43.900 
been a surefire a three-star because i
was<00:05:42.050> pretty<00:05:42.320> close<00:05:42.740> even<00:05:43.490> though<00:05:43.550> i<00:05:43.610> only<00:05:43.820> got

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
was pretty close even though i only got

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.270 
was pretty close even though i only got
fifty<00:05:44.300> percent<00:05:44.539> to<00:05:44.720> star<00:05:44.960> i<00:05:45.139> take<00:05:45.710> it<00:05:45.830> out<00:05:45.950> most

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
fifty percent to star i take it out most

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.980
