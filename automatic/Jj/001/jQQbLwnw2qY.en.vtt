00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.200
 hello that such a boy is that more is 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.060
 flash talking to you and this time 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:20.779
 we are in a new cinema tutorial 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:24.710
 4d this time because because in my videos 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.890
 of in my video of this same act 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.289
 tutorial that I went up many days ago to 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.939
 my channel also asked a lot of 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.160
 things and more or less in this video I'm going to 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.050
 redo the tutorial and I'm going to 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.860
 answer more or less is like the video 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.680
 that I went up the other time about how to animate 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.810
 so good 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.950
 This program can be found in 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:49.470
 the description is called my way 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.260
 and it only helps us to export a 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.660
 Map 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.580
 to the 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.110
 so we can do it in cinema you 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.110
 double click on this and it will open 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.870
 this window and it's ok let's close the 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.730
 that is going to open this plague file open work 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.170
 and here are the worlds that you have 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.000
 I'm going to continue nar suriol let 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.410
 now once they have this good this 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 you can close it but we're going to 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.720
 stay with the address 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.640
 and you will be able to select the 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.720
 terrain that you want from the map 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.159
 this map is only going to be able 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.730
 grab the parts that you have already 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.620
 seen in 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.780
 when while playing this so 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.180
 let's select a small part not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 more so that it does not take long 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 we select that and now let's file 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.950
 select terrain png and here we are going to paste 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.710
 the direction of the main guys the main west 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.460
 comes with some good textures and 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.780
 default you can add more 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.880
 textures only of land downloads 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.110
 I am going to select the normal terrain and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.390
 I'm going to give it to open 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.510
 Once done, I'm going to give it a file and 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.590
 export so rendering 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:05.880
 I'm going to save it here 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.399
 and I'm going here I'm going to put a new folder 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.500
 and I'm going to put a map 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.800
 and another will save as map c4 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.260
 I'm going to save not that I do not touch anything and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.959
 wool ok 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.989
 once this comes out of here it's going to 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:28.780
 leave that as there are blocks of 1 point 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:32.170
 and 1 point greater than wave 1.5 I think 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.010
 will they will now turn to stone 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:38.050
 If you do not want this to happen, 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.750
 the description of this video I will leave 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.630
 a link for a new version of my way 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.160
 that will serve to have them 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.110
 all the blocks like that are not going to have more 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.540
 the problem of the stone so it's the 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.700
 I'm going to leave there since we have that 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.720
 technically good let's put this 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.720
 here and we're going to give it to open 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.360
 and let's go to the folder where 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.390
 we keep and we have these maps of 4 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.630
 points 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.670
 at the same point mtl 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.600
 the map c4 of alpha the regime and rgb 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.360
 let's open the eye 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.990
 we speak 1000 scale everything is fine and 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.990
 we give it to ok 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.810
 very well now that we already have this more or 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.700
 except this is the land that I have 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 post to render 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.260
 It is very small the fact more than everything 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.410
 so that it can be done quickly if not 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.819
 I have a lot of time and good here in 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.069
 the bottom part we have some textures 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.950
 which are of this then we are going to 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.959
 select and here where it says color there is 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.330
 an option that says texture we're going to 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.610
 give three points and we're going to go to the 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.270
 folder where is our map and we're going 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.310
 to make a weapon to make four of rgb 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:52.710
 we open it and well here we have the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.720
 textures flames burned but you see 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.820
 bad we are going to take it to hoist to see is that 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:59.490
 it looks bad then we continue 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.990
 selecting the textures 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:06.960
 and here where it says basic here below says 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.930
 speculate we are going to remove the check and 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.510
 let's check alpha once given 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.970
 alpha is going to open another one 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.640
 pestaÃ±ita that he said alpha and here again 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.829
 in texture and we are going to give rgb to 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.569
 maps on rgb 4 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.539
 now more or less has already been cleared of 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:27.550
 this and now only renderings 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.189
 we will have a cleaner finish if 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.099
 they want to eliminate the stone only from 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:36.340
 selection in all selection in the stone 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.770
 to click on this and it eliminates him good 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.360
 remain as holes but good is that 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.009
 is because they have eliminated it is not 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.020
 stuck to the map then as they limit it 

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:46.539
 so if you want to eliminate the plants 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.259
 they eliminate it if you want to limit the flowers 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.120
 they eliminate it and their map is clean for 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.689
 I do not know what you want me in my 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.209
 case 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:59.569
 I'm going to leave that the saucers there because 

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:01.580
 I like and good now the same thing about 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:06.129
 Last time they told me how to cheer up 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.129
 Marcelo as a good animal, here I have 

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:15.890
 I have this 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.890
 around here to be 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.880
 make the virus the parent virus 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.620
 then I will open it and I will bring 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.490
 the river here 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.060
 and it would be like that 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.639
 now that I no longer have 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.950
 around here but let's go down 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:41.320
 land plate 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:44.540
 and well the king is a little small 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:47.330
 so let's get closer 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.720
 with this with only having this already 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.400
 I can animate a riff and a map 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.160
 just select the parts of the 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.380
 body and encourage it and it will be very 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.870
 kawaii can add some examples 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.730
 effects that I recommend them as 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.370
 won here effect and you can give it 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:07.310
 ambient occlusion 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:10.330
 and global lighting 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.330
 and a jet club 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:15.039
 and now do not get scared, this is why 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.000
 render now it's going to take a lot more 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:21.880
 It's very important 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.220
 the lights if you put these presets that 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:26.350
 I am telling you the most important thing 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.760
 is that lights put the lights is because 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:29.860
 how is this going to take the 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.630
 global lighting will need 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.400
 lights with which to refer to their 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.750
 shades 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.080
 then there will be chairs you will be able to see 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.449
 best 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.879
 I will not only reuse right now 

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:43.699
 I tell you that with that you duplicate 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:46.400
 lights or they download a lightroom I do not know 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.770
 how I do not know what house they are in their mind 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.009
 but that's how easy it is to do this 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.870
 then with just having this can 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.650
 make the map bigger everything 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:56.319
 you want 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:58.669
 the animation will be much bigger 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.469
 encourage only is to move this in 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.240
 frames if you want to see all this 

00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:04.820
 full tutorial with a larger map 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:07.910
 and how are you going to see the end 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.670
 Well, it's going to be here in one in a 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:13.490
 corner of the video there is a link to the video 

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.930
 earlier on how to animate then more 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.220
 or less simple today's video very 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.290
 short and the truth is that it is very easy 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:20.090
 most of all they have asked me about how 

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:22.520
 eliminate this about what comes out black 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:25.280
 because here you just said is the alpha 

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.420
 materials of these and how to eliminate the 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.760
 good stone 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.260
 well now on how to make animations 

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.880
 Minecraft shorts we'll see you in a 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.480
 next video and until next time 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.480
 goodbye
