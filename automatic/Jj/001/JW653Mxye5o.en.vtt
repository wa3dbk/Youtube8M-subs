down for five seconds you can switch off
the<00:01:07.140> ABS<00:01:07.290> which<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.130> recommended<00:01:08.720> you

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the ABS which is not recommended you

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.160 
the ABS which is not recommended you
know<00:01:09.870> especially<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.980> the<00:01:11.040> road<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> also

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
know especially on the road the also

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
know especially on the road the also
cruise<00:01:13.409> control<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:14.940> extremely

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
cruise control which is an extremely

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.450 
cruise control which is an extremely
great<00:01:15.780> feature<00:01:16.080> tested<00:01:16.800> it<00:01:16.890> out<00:01:17.010> yesterday

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
great feature tested it out yesterday

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.810 
great feature tested it out yesterday
found<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.120> be<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.720> useful<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:20.310> think

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
found it to be really useful I think

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.310 
found it to be really useful I think
with<00:01:20.940> heated<00:01:21.270> grips<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.780> cruise<00:01:22.200> control

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
with heated grips and cruise control

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.710 
with heated grips and cruise control
this<00:01:22.980> makes<00:01:23.250> for<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.670> good<00:01:24.030> highway<00:01:24.930> machine<00:01:25.550> I

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
this makes for a good highway machine I

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.110 
this makes for a good highway machine I
did<00:01:27.720> find<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.680> revs<00:01:29.280> pretty<00:01:29.550> high<00:01:29.760> though

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.120 
did find that it revs pretty high though

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.270 
did find that it revs pretty high though
so<00:01:30.510> at<00:01:30.630> 70<00:01:30.930> miles<00:01:31.080> per<00:01:31.230> hour<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.500> at<00:01:31.680> 5,000

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
so at 70 miles per hour you're at 5,000

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
so at 70 miles per hour you're at 5,000
rpm<00:01:33.440> which<00:01:34.440> i<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.610> little<00:01:35.820> too<00:01:36.120> much

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.300 
rpm which i think is a little too much

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.080 
rpm which i think is a little too much
for<00:01:36.600> highway<00:01:37.290> riding<00:01:37.820> especially<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.970> those

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
for highway riding especially for those

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.810 
for highway riding especially for those
long<00:01:39.330> trips<00:01:39.510> so<00:01:40.230> I<00:01:40.560> personally<00:01:41.190> found<00:01:41.580> it<00:01:41.730> a

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
long trips so I personally found it a

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910 
long trips so I personally found it a
little<00:01:41.910> buzzy<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.840> especially<00:01:43.440> those<00:01:43.710> long

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
little buzzy for especially those long

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.160 
little buzzy for especially those long
rides<00:01:44.180> those<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.300> there<00:01:45.540> are<00:01:45.630> ways<00:01:45.660> around<00:01:45.960> it

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
rides those are there are ways around it

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.780 
rides those are there are ways around it
so<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.410> can<00:01:46.560> drop<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.770> few<00:01:46.980> calls<00:01:47.220> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.580> want

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so you can drop a few calls if you want

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.580 
so you can drop a few calls if you want
in<00:01:47.940> the<00:01:48.030> sprocket<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.690> can<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.290> something

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
in the sprocket you can do something

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.960 
in the sprocket you can do something
like<00:01:49.620> that<00:01:55.010> so<00:01:56.010> that's<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.340> start<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:56.910> it

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
like that so that's the start up and it

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.410 
like that so that's the start up and it
says<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.360> I've<00:01:57.480> got<00:01:58.610> 500<00:01:59.610> miles<00:01:59.760> left<00:02:00.150> before

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
says that I've got 500 miles left before

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.890 
says that I've got 500 miles left before
I<00:02:00.660> need<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.350> for<00:02:01.530> my<00:02:01.590> first<00:02:01.860> service

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
I need to go in for my first service

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.540 
I need to go in for my first service
these<00:02:03.900> lights<00:02:04.200> are<00:02:04.410> blinking<00:02:04.650> because<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
these lights are blinking because it

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.430 
these lights are blinking because it
it's<00:02:05.970> basically<00:02:06.390> telling<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.870> the<00:02:07.020> traction

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
it's basically telling you the traction

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.880 
it's basically telling you the traction
control<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:07.950> abs<00:02:08.129> is<00:02:08.580> not<00:02:08.759> yet<00:02:08.910> activated<00:02:09.890> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
control and abs is not yet activated it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.940 
control and abs is not yet activated it
gets<00:02:11.220> activated<00:02:11.640> above<00:02:12.150> 3<00:02:12.450> miles<00:02:12.660> per<00:02:12.840> hour<00:02:12.959> or

gets activated above 3 miles per hour or

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.940 
gets activated above 3 miles per hour or
I<00:02:13.980> think<00:02:14.730> 5<00:02:15.000> miles<00:02:15.239> per<00:02:15.330> hour<00:02:15.510> I'm<00:02:15.599> not<00:02:15.750> sure<00:02:15.950> as

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I think 5 miles per hour I'm not sure as

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.390 
I think 5 miles per hour I'm not sure as
124<00:02:17.700> miles<00:02:17.970> on<00:02:18.269> it<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.920> through<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.220> different

really<00:02:36.519> easy<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.819> ride<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.409> tried<00:02:38.409> out<00:02:38.439> the

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
really easy to ride I tried out the

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.830 
really easy to ride I tried out the
dynamic<00:02:39.280> mode<00:02:39.489> on<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> mountains<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
dynamic mode on the mountains and and I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.589 
dynamic mode on the mountains and and I
had<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.319> the<00:02:41.980> front<00:02:42.189> wheel<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.400> top<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:43.030> mean<00:02:43.420> it

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
had the the front wheel on top I mean it

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.000 
had the the front wheel on top I mean it
just<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.989> din<00:02:44.260> second<00:02:44.590> year<00:02:44.769> so<00:02:44.980> I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
just really din second year so I

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.119 
just really din second year so I
basically<00:02:45.549> shifted<00:02:46.180> back<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.360> road<00:02:46.599> mode<00:02:47.129> I

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
basically shifted back to road mode I

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.339 
basically shifted back to road mode I
was<00:02:48.849> going<00:02:49.209> around<00:02:49.299> six<00:02:49.689> or<00:02:49.810> seven<00:02:50.049> thousand

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
was going around six or seven thousand

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.280 
was going around six or seven thousand
rpm<00:02:50.709> while<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.040> was<00:02:51.159> accelerating<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:53.140> was

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
rpm while I was accelerating so that was

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.149 
rpm while I was accelerating so that was
a<00:02:53.319> little<00:02:53.500> quick<00:02:55.200> I'm<00:02:56.200> gonna<00:02:56.319> go<00:02:56.530> through<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
a little quick I'm gonna go through the

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.869 
a little quick I'm gonna go through the
trip<00:02:57.519> information<00:02:58.030> actually<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.290> info<00:02:59.590> first

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
trip information actually the info first

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.910 
trip information actually the info first
so<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.090> information<00:03:01.359> gives<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.170> best<00:03:02.590> lap

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
so the information gives you best lap

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.360 
so the information gives you best lap
times<00:03:03.420> race<00:03:04.420> info<00:03:04.870> set<00:03:05.859> up<00:03:05.950> menu

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
times race info set up menu

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.740 
times race info set up menu
a<00:03:07.319> couple<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.379> other<00:03:08.530> things<00:03:08.680> I<00:03:09.549> think<00:03:10.329> in<00:03:10.629> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
a couple of other things I think in the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.509 
a couple of other things I think in the
setup<00:03:11.079> menu<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.680> can<00:03:11.799> basically<00:03:12.040> set<00:03:12.489> the

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
setup menu you can basically set the

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.059 
setup menu you can basically set the
race<00:03:12.790> lamps<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.329> come<00:03:13.480> off<00:03:13.659> come<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.799> at<00:03:14.980> a

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
race lamps to come off come on at a

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.720 
race lamps to come off come on at a
certain<00:03:15.370> rpm

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
certain rpm

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.490 
certain rpm
right<00:03:15.940> now<00:03:16.090> it's<00:03:16.239> default<00:03:16.629> up<00:03:16.750> to<00:03:16.840> 7000

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
right now it's default up to 7000

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.399 
right now it's default up to 7000
because<00:03:17.709> it's<00:03:17.859> below<00:03:18.069> 600<00:03:18.639> mile<00:03:18.790> service<00:03:19.409> I

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
because it's below 600 mile service I

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.319 
because it's below 600 mile service I
think<00:03:20.680> that<00:03:21.010> gets<00:03:21.189> changed<00:03:21.519> to<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:21.970> ten<00:03:22.209> and

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
think that gets changed to like ten and

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.619 
think that gets changed to like ten and
a<00:03:22.389> half<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.989> after<00:03:23.709> your<00:03:23.829> first<00:03:24.010> service<00:03:24.629> but

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:25.629 
a half and after your first service but

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:26.849 
a half and after your first service but
you<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.049> you<00:03:26.109> can<00:03:26.290> change<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.650> whatever

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
you know you can change it to whatever

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.399 
you know you can change it to whatever
you<00:03:27.010> want<00:03:28.980> yeah<00:03:29.980> there's<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.760> trip<00:03:31.090> information
