00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 welcome is no more to a hd model 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.799
 and I'm bringing a new video in which you 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.870
 I will teach to update the l9 to the version 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.820
 highest from android good to the most 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.070
 elevated to what the company allows us 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.070
 a 4.1 jr living 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.740
 if you remember a video that I made 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.110
 previously on the launcher 4.1 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.450
 launcher that was to be able to have the 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.940
 appearance of jay living in our 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.010
 mobile now lg has been given and has 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.739
 opted to do the update to 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.800
 him to his terminal lg optimus on 9 and in 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.250
 This video will teach you how to how 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.920
 do what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.160
 if you have this terminal in any 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.130
 company the download will be late 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.680
 a bit since previously in many 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.300
 videos many subscribers told me and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.660
 leave me in the comments that already 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.730
 had updated to the new version the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.040
 lg optimus on 9 I was not buying 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.160
 all the time and he would not let me then 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.410
 sent for doing so and today already 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.060
 you can that previously also if 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.710
 you could but I today is when I 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 fixed and yes they have let me do it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.180
 so for that I'm going to show you what 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.240
 what we have to do is go to 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.550
 adjustments we are going to acquire adjustments of the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.410
 system vouchers click on settings of the 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.090
 system and we will have to go to the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.970
 bottom part of the whole where you put 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.500
 about the phone by pressing do 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 before the telephone we would appear this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.190
 window where what we would have 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.920
 what to do is give it to check if it exists 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.259
 a new software up here and here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610
 would put the last update I would 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.009
 would give up here as all that 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 have this lg optimus mobile of 9 and 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.930
 they returned these options puts and is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.420
 A new system version is available 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.070
 operative for your device 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.689
 or to take out now if they can not 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.700
 check it later in configurations 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.369
 of menu and here it tells you what you have to 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 do the system tells you the version 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:02.869
 operative would be the 20th and that would occupy you 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.570
 327 like 17 megabytes and I would tell you two 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.179
 trades download by any 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.729
 network except two go download using 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.140
 wifi network I do not advise you to do it by network 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.840
 wifi that we would have to give to 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.880
 download and so we would load by 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.800
 give the wifi if it would be updating 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.209
 I would try so good is one that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.280
 it would take so this is going to happen 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.350
 fast or I'll cut it and when it 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.590
 just update and I already give what 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:30.290
 I will teach again so now I am going to 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.900
 cut and when you write it completely 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.739
 or I'm going to teach it, it would be almost 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 complete by 99 percent and good 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.750
 I wait until 99% since I wanted to 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.810
 yourselves, check how it works 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.090
 updates and how does everything goes for 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.470
 that you have a follow-up and a foundation 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.960
 how will it go if we update it 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.260
 so it seems to update it we 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.050
 would put as another good aspiration a 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.430
 validation of the software package that 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.740
 gives by 0 percent we go that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.850
 We'll have to wait again I'm sorry 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.650
 guys but you have to wait a little bit 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.880
 more good but you are not going to 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.490
 expect nothing because I'm going to cut it 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.790
 but for me yes so I shit on everything 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:25.040
 but nothing happens 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:29.670
 but now we 're going to see software from 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.250
 12 times now, we would already be in the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.560
 authentic application let's zoom out a 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.150
 just zoom in and we're going to tell you 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.909
 be installed now let's be now and 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.790
 now he has said that he is going to restart a 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:48.299
 or twice once or twice and that 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.889
 this does not have any problem so do not 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.569
 I expected it to restart and see what 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:55.219
 pass 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.219
 and you have started the gym 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:04.349
 once on the phone I guess if you 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.810
 will update the firmware and restart the 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:11.040
 phone will mean that I will have another 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.510
 good time that I will have the duration in 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.849
 our mobile like I have never seen in 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.709
 no application I suppose that to the 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:18.449
 people will like to know what happens if 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.169
 update and how it is activated and that's how 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.400
 that another of the things that I'm going to do is 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.639
 time what will take 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.039
 update are the 8 and 11 of Saturday and 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.930
 goes for 0 percent when it's over 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.310
 I will tell you what time it is for you to know 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.850
 more or less what will take you in case 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.039
 you put it to use 8 that goes up 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.720
 now at the end of this first 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:41.280
 authorization what has happened is that it 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.949
 has returned to use or has become 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.229
 to perform another software address and 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:48.510
 that artificial previous one has taken some 

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:50.250
 three and a half minutes and now I'm short and 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.889
 when it says that I tell you the time and 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.410
 everything is worth this latest update of the 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.830
 software has helped a lot more time 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.940
 a total of almost 25 minutes not to say 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.270
 half an hour 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.460
 and now it's 94% I want you 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.620
 advise that if you are going to use what 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.870
 have time or that you know that today 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.910
 leave the mobile in an appropriate place and 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.360
 are you going to be able to wait a while for 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.940
 can have the update complete 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.740
 As you can see, it has reached 99% and we are going 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.780
 to wait a few seconds or a minute what 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.150
 that it takes until the 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:26.310
 Software activation and so on 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.100
 we will check how everything is done and good 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.620
 if I am now going to emphasize that yes 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.330
 someone has bothered you or is a little 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.580
 disgusted with the video this because the 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.920
 saying with many parts if another channel 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.810
 I did an alignment I like me 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.150
 like to know all the steps there 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.330
 what to wear to be able to do everything 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.250
 this and with this video what I intend 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.990
 have performed , and all this and that 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.300
 you can check it as it has 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.970
 happened to me and we wait for it to 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.090
 update and I'll put the pin and I guess 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.950
 I will have 4.1 good I must emphasize that 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.020
 until the request until it has 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.600
 restarted again the mobile has passed 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:06.510
 about 30 minutes 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.070
 as soon as it restarts for the second time 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.370
 we would appear this andrés is 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.800
 updating and I hope and I guess that 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:16.680
 it will be me living we will see it 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.370
 let's check unfortunately on what 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.380
 balls 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.390
 Let's not wait to put it to sign 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:25.300
 I have 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:28.330
 the ping code 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.900
 just as you see in particular I will be 

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:35.440
 you can still start 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:37.490
 Unfortunately, Gijón has stopped 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.530
 que 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.479
 after everything I've been waiting for and 

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:43.479
 it stops me who noses 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.319
 traditional 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:50.060
 that is, it is not any fail but that 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:53.900
 it has been used and we would have already 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.080
 is worth what good yes yes yes yes and this already 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.599
 Now 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.689
 I will soon make another video in which you 

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:03.030
 I will show the improvements that 4.1 and 

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:04.860
 they come on this mobile and until then 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.000
 thanks for the video including inclusion 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.000
 goodbye video
