 and you were going to all of us here, the team, let's explore 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.840
 commenting and today I bring you a review of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.360
 a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.240
 the microphone for playstation3 via 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 bluetooth 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.599
 witnessed by light and forgiveness and that has 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.610
 cost 30 euros is the triton brand and what 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.699
 are you trying this last three 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.719
 I like a lot of days and I'm going to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.210
 explain online 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.370
 before anything else in the box they would not be 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.020
 stay 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.710
 of vomit schools to your agricultural according to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:45.910
 delta ore ear imposed smaller 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.910
 managers who connects with this cable 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.240
 and here, it has the micro-usb connector 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.620
 the same one that goes to any mobile what 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.630
 it happens is that you do not lane it with your 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.110
 samsung or nokia charger or from 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:07.340
 apple not that no but because it does not work 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:09.830
 and good as you see this is here in 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.619
 what you put on your ear is worth 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.000
 and you get a little uncomfortable in my 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.790
 opinion but good how it works 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.500
 good to approach I feel worth it here 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:27.470
 you see a button is worth this button that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.550
 up is one more and it is to serve the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 volume then to light it the 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.740
 microphone what we have to do is 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.470
 download this 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.510
 this beige was lit blue 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.780
 we would need and then when 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.270
 we had the playstation3 is lit 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.000
 would connect first what you have to 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.880
 do before the first time you take it out 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.970
 of the box is to take it to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:01.340
 that is to play 3 accessories look for a 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.350
 device keep the knowledge because that 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.290
 it is very important 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.140
 keep this until it gets like this 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:13.130
 blinking blue and red then is that 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.010
 it gets to find a bluetooth 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:18.580
 then it will ask us for a key that key 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.860
 for the absence of the world 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:25.470
 down now when with focus is put 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.340
 pass 0 0 0 0 40 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.230
 and it is already simply put face 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:35.120
 and absolution the water is in you 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.120
 plate is simple 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:42.260
 and good in general I recommend that 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.730
 buy to talk to your compais 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:50.150
 and such because in that way they are visitable 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.970
 very useful to talk or just to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.190
 go from people when it 's very bad like that 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.130
 I hope you liked it 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.250
 give your favorite videos their 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.250
