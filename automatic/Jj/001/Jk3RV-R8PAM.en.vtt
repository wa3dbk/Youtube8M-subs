I want to start off by trying to assign
a<00:00:07.880> sonic<00:00:08.660> snapshot<00:00:09.320> to<00:00:10.190> the<00:00:10.309> theory<00:00:10.670> that

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
a sonic snapshot to the theory that

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.980 
a sonic snapshot to the theory that
you'll<00:00:10.910> be<00:00:11.059> learning<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.540> we're<00:00:11.840> going<00:00:11.960> to

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
you'll be learning and we're going to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.900 
you'll be learning and we're going to
take<00:00:12.170> a<00:00:12.200> couple<00:00:12.500> of<00:00:12.650> tunes<00:00:12.889> actually<00:00:13.639> a<00:00:13.670> few

take a couple of tunes actually a few
tunes<00:00:14.180> and<00:00:14.570> look<00:00:15.469> at<00:00:15.590> this<00:00:15.680> principle<00:00:16.160> of

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:16.279 
tunes and look at this principle of

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.540 
tunes and look at this principle of
lower<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:16.880> upper<00:00:17.480> neighbors<00:00:17.930> and<00:00:18.550> the

chord<00:01:13.740> re<00:01:14.610> fingered<00:01:15.000> played<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:15.780> here<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:16.760> all

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:17.760 
chord re fingered played up here and all

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.670 
chord re fingered played up here and all
they're<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.360> approaching<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> C<00:01:19.350> chord

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
they're doing is approaching the C chord

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
they're doing is approaching the C chord
from<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.340> half-step<00:01:20.820> blow<00:01:21.060> which<00:01:21.300> obviously

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
from a half-step blow which obviously

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.960 
from a half-step blow which obviously
would<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> B<00:01:22.380> chord<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.700> how<00:01:23.820> does<00:01:23.880> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
would be a B chord and how does that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.320 
would be a B chord and how does that
sound<00:01:24.270> against<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.750> C<00:01:24.990> based<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:26.210> lot<00:01:27.210> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
sound against the C based on a lot of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.780 
sound against the C based on a lot of
tension<00:01:27.840> right<00:01:27.870> but<00:01:28.320> then<00:01:28.470> we<00:01:28.560> resolve<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
tension right but then we resolve it and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.910 
tension right but then we resolve it and
you're<00:01:30.210> okay<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.200> here's<00:01:31.410> another<00:01:31.710> example

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
you're okay now here's another example

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
you're okay now here's another example
of<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.580> tune<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.850> uses<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.660> exact<00:01:34.020> same

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

harmonic move we all know that to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.010 
harmonic move we all know that to

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
these non diatonic tones are used to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.070 
these non diatonic tones are used to
create<00:02:48.000> tension<00:02:48.270> but<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:48.720> they're<00:02:48.870> always

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
create tension but then they're always

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.140 
create tension but then they're always
resolved<00:02:49.710> to<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.830> chord<00:02:50.130> tones<00:02:50.340> that's<00:02:50.850> great

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
resolved to the chord tones that's great

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.670
