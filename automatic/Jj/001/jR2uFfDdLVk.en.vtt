00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
because of that should we just delay

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.560 
because of that should we just delay
night<00:01:23.490> d<00:01:23.610> fighters<00:01:24.060> g5<00:01:25.909> because<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.299> c4

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
night d fighters g5 because this c4

night d fighters g5 because this c4
square<00:01:28.020> could<00:01:28.170> be<00:01:28.259> really<00:01:28.469> useful<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:29.009> 92<00:01:29.640> to

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
square could be really useful for 92 to

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.990 
square could be really useful for 92 to
see<00:01:31.409> force<00:01:31.740> may<00:01:31.920> be<00:01:31.979> leaving<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.399> light<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.670> d5

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
see force may be leaving the light of d5

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.779 
see force may be leaving the light of d5
could<00:01:33.240> actually<00:01:33.390> be<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> lesser<00:01:33.960> evil

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
could actually be the lesser evil

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.889 
could actually be the lesser evil
actually<00:01:35.789> even<00:01:36.119> though<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.360> attracted<00:01:36.899> to

still technically got mating material
can't<00:05:38.000> just<00:05:38.180> simplify<00:05:38.720> this<00:05:38.780> whoops<00:05:39.380> check<00:05:40.030> so

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
can't just simplify this whoops check so

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.160 
can't just simplify this whoops check so
technically<00:05:41.510> got<00:05:41.750> a<00:05:42.250> mating<00:05:43.250> material<00:05:44.170> bishop

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170

technically got a mating material bishop
at<00:05:45.260> night<00:05:48.310> so<00:05:50.230> accept<00:05:53.980> it<00:05:54.980> probably<00:05:55.430> probably

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
at night so accept it probably probably

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:58.330 
at night so accept it probably probably
is<00:05:55.850> tricky<00:05:56.150> to<00:05:56.390> sort<00:05:56.660> of<00:05:56.720> mate<00:05:57.010> with<00:05:58.010> bishop

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
is tricky to sort of mate with bishop

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:03.880 
is tricky to sort of mate with bishop
and<00:05:58.490> night<00:05:58.670> here<00:05:59.030> but<00:05:59.990> um<00:06:00.380> I<00:06:02.590> know<00:06:03.590> this<00:06:03.620> is

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:03.890 
and night here but um I know this is

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.390 
and night here but um I know this is
terrible<00:06:04.070> but<00:06:04.520> I<00:06:04.850> think<00:06:05.450> I<00:06:05.660> can<00:06:06.530> win<00:06:06.890> this<00:06:07.070> on

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
terrible but I think I can win this on

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.800 
terrible but I think I can win this on
time<00:06:07.610> because<00:06:07.730> it's<00:06:07.940> mating<00:06:08.270> material<00:06:08.660> if

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 
time because it's mating material if

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.810 
time because it's mating material if
nothing<00:06:09.110> else<00:06:09.230> but<00:06:09.890> of<00:06:10.040> course<00:06:10.220> I<00:06:10.340> know<00:06:10.550> how<00:06:10.760> to

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
nothing else but of course I know how to

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.170 
nothing else but of course I know how to
make<00:06:11.000> a<00:06:11.060> bishop<00:06:11.420> at<00:06:11.540> night<00:06:12.070> especially<00:06:13.180> if

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
imaginary which maybe I should reply out

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.940 
imaginary which maybe I should reply out
this<00:06:26.000> one<00:06:26.210> but<00:06:26.720> yeah<00:06:26.900> it<00:06:27.080> is<00:06:27.230> possible<00:06:27.650> to<00:06:27.710> make

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:27.950 
this one but yeah it is possible to make

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.920 
this one but yeah it is possible to make
my<00:06:28.070> bishop<00:06:28.340> at<00:06:28.460> night<00:06:28.610> let's<00:06:29.450> have<00:06:29.570> a<00:06:29.630> look<00:06:29.810> at

that<00:06:30.050> game<00:06:30.290> again<00:06:30.620> so<00:06:31.130> that<00:06:31.280> was<00:06:31.370> a<00:06:31.400> bit<00:06:31.580> crazy

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
that game again so that was a bit crazy

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.800 
that game again so that was a bit crazy
so<00:06:34.610> there<00:06:34.820> was<00:06:34.910> a<00:06:34.970> decision<00:06:35.390> here<00:06:35.600> you<00:06:35.690> know

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
so there was a decision here you know

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.260 
so there was a decision here you know
why<00:06:35.990> wasn't<00:06:36.440> I<00:06:36.530> taking<00:06:36.950> on<00:06:37.100> d5<00:06:37.640> because<00:06:38.030> this

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
why wasn't I taking on d5 because this

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.420 
why wasn't I taking on d5 because this
Knight<00:06:38.480> d2<00:06:38.660> to<00:06:39.020> see<00:06:39.230> for<00:06:39.530> its<00:06:39.800> powerful<00:06:40.130> isn't

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:40.430 
Knight d2 to see for its powerful isn't

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.190 
Knight d2 to see for its powerful isn't
it<00:06:40.630> potentially<00:06:41.650> so<00:06:43.300> instead

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:45.200 
it potentially so instead

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.740 
it potentially so instead
we<00:06:45.770> get<00:06:45.980> this<00:06:46.100> position<00:06:46.580> where<00:06:46.850> he<00:06:47.570> actually

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
we get this position where he actually

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.020 
we get this position where he actually
plays<00:06:48.110> 'if<00:06:48.410> I've<00:06:48.830> anyway<00:06:49.250> giving<00:06:49.550> himself<00:06:49.670> an
