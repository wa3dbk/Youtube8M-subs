00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.990
 Welcome to the leader of the table we are in the beginning of the third quarter 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.939
 at half-time the SV was sovereign with 36 to 22 ahead 

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:14.279
 after a small breather early in the third quarter scored here 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:15.169
 was wonderful 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:18.089
 like Michaela Heger from 40 30 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:22.470
 it only once that for many Wattwil 21 points for the first time 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.390
 this hit Bresler numbers 14 10 0-run of the RSV a preliminary decision in 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:29.739
 this game 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.739
 the Bonner who bravely resisted specialized personnel 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
 here before the end Dirk Köhler to the 7 40 to 30 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.300
 as in the previous scene which also in the next attack the wise pass of 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.140
 Navas it's more out 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.910
 Joey Johnson here vociferously uses the dance at 49 3 4 n 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.670
 he is the top scorer of the game with 23 points 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.990
 could play for the fast 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.430
 as the Bonn do not oppose at this time 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.390
 after a nice ball, Irish again scored two points and forced 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.480
 another bye 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.030
 With roller coaster nine try one is in these days also in this point in 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 Bonn clearly superior 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.440
 in addition to the approximately 850 spectators that also the Hessian radio about such 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.640
 look forward to spectacular and attractive wheelchair basketball 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.560
 the excavator Becker tells her that the m50 is 32 and shows that one 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.479
 Top team like Bonn owns morality and not below value here 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.760
 be beaten 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.190
 but the direction is fixed coach Nicolai Zeltinger time into the game too 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.140
 come Kempten Jol tons of the instruction loudly to his teammates 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.980
 continue to take their position in order to give a neurologist in this book 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.490
 Almost Frein Bertels it is possible who easter 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.560
 who then apologize the phrase firmly callous before the end 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.580
 Happy faces with players 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.350
 the Berner try the rhythm of the Lahnstädter with a break 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.030
 to disturb 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 a nice opportunity to settle here in Lincolnshire 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.170
 you can tell the Bonn provider they try everything around here not with a 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.570
 embarrassing result from the august-bebel- Halle leave 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.660
 14 junior national player Jan Haller made the 36 to 60 from Bonn's point of view Jan 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.759
 Haller offers not only in this scene against shoulders this evening 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.990
 impressive performance and clearly advanced with 18 points to the top scorer 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.829
 his team 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.689
 on the other hand, Marco Zwerger has also been showing up for some time now 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:21.930
 Here, he plays out his speed and can only do so 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.959
 be prevented by a foul on the Korberfolg 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.560
 but he too looked safe from the line these days 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.209
 Hugo van Aken continues 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.489
 brought the way 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.109
 in the end there is a deserved 76 2 52 success for the unbeaten 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:36.919
 To mark league leaders 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.169
 The people of Bonn beat Wacker but they were today 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.249
 chance 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:44.249
 Also in celebrating its players fans the first car that the Constitution 

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:47.589
 Here's how we got this game on the field and on the well-filled 

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:50.589
 Ranks in the fun park 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.569
 Marco Zwerger 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.099
 first after the game today against Bonn Norman short review of the 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.569
 last week 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.029
 You play in Cologne 

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:10.209
 want to give away today 66 to 52 also really love distinct 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.769
 clear victory against HSV happy with the last 8 days 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:19.299
 to join 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.549
 Halil cure before 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.829
 but also the confidence of the coach and 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 at the time you clearly beaten »said in the summer 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:32.589
 I really like it at the moment was not really to be expected 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.049
 that's here in 20 points 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.049
 that means that at the moment where is the ASV au in this league 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.399
 So who the defense has today works very well 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.769
 the direct penetration has been made 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.799
 therefore on 11 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.989
 it has become relatively clear that it could have been more pronounced 

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:54.929
 Yes and no 

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:58.239
 the two weeks is not just the top game and 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.939
 think we're on the right track to see that 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.249
 the next top game in Zwickau 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:07.249
 the question who should beat you this year 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.330
 per ounce 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.389
 against Zwickau with the not just happy 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:15.389
 if she says in the ground to change Damien 

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.819
