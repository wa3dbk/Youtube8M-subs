00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
I'm going to show you how to may be

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.499 
I'm going to show you how to may be
linked<00:01:33.360> together<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:34.020> few<00:01:34.560> different<00:01:34.920> ideas

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
linked together a few different ideas

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.960 
linked together a few different ideas
built<00:01:36.509> upon<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.320> little<00:01:38.189> run<00:01:38.430> right<00:01:38.670> there

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.210 

so<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.960> something<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.040> this

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220

that sounds cool when you go play back

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.289 
that sounds cool when you go play back
and<00:02:35.430> forth<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.849> that<00:02:35.879> note<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.700> that's<00:02:41.879> one<00:02:42.090> leg

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
and forth on that note so that's one leg

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.559 
and forth on that note so that's one leg
right<00:02:42.689> there<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.970> extend<00:02:48.329> that

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
right there and then you can extend that

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:57.589 
right there and then you can extend that
and<00:02:48.900> do<00:02:49.260> something<00:02:49.739> else<00:02:49.889> like<00:02:50.010> this<00:02:56.599> so

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
and do something else like this so

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.509 
and do something else like this so
you're<00:02:57.750> building<00:02:58.200> chromatically<00:02:58.859> from<00:02:59.310> this

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
you're building chromatically from this

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:17.990 
you're building chromatically from this
to<00:03:00.420> this<00:03:00.450> go<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:01.799> this<00:03:02.400> note

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.210 

so<00:03:19.000> I<00:03:19.030> you<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.600> again<00:03:19.870> I<00:03:19.930> just<00:03:20.260> kind<00:03:20.470> of<00:03:20.590> sort

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
so I you know again I just kind of sort

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.470 
so I you know again I just kind of sort
of<00:03:21.370> made<00:03:21.520> that<00:03:21.730> up<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:23.290> know<00:03:23.410> created<00:03:24.040> a

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
of made that up and you know created a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.780 
of made that up and you know created a
little<00:03:25.480> lick<00:03:25.720> there<00:03:26.080> to<00:03:26.470> kind<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.490> get<00:03:27.640> you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
little lick there to kind of get you

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.390 
little lick there to kind of get you
back<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.240> the<00:03:28.270> a<00:03:28.390> major<00:03:28.720> or<00:03:29.170> a<00:03:29.230> dominant<00:03:30.070> 7
