00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
don't wanna be wasting money like I just

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.850 
don't wanna be wasting money like I just
did<00:00:40.800> on<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.700> guy<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.210> anyway<00:00:42.530> first<00:00:43.530> things

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
did on this guy so anyway first things

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.240 
did on this guy so anyway first things
first

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
first

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.060 
first
do<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> dust<00:00:45.420> free<00:00:45.570> environment

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
do it in a dust free environment

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:48.470 
do it in a dust free environment
obviously<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.100> try<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> do<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.879> but<00:00:48.090> even

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
obviously I try to do that but even

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.869 
obviously I try to do that but even
though<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.719> did<00:00:49.110> there<00:00:49.649> still<00:00:50.010> does<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
though I did there still does so the

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.270 
though I did there still does so the
quicker<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.480> takes<00:00:51.899> you<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.379> put<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
quicker it takes you to actually put the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.490 
quicker it takes you to actually put the
screen<00:00:53.610> cover<00:00:53.760> on<00:00:54.059> your<00:00:54.090> phone<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.230> less

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
screen cover on your phone the less

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.930 
screen cover on your phone the less
likely<00:00:55.920> there's<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.309> dust<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.820> go

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
likely there's going to be dust to go

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.849 
likely there's going to be dust to go
underneath<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.570> screen<00:00:57.719> cover<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.500> try<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
underneath the screen cover so try to

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.770 
underneath the screen cover so try to
get<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> right<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.579> first<00:00:59.730> time<00:00:59.879> because<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
get it right the first time because the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.689 
get it right the first time because the
more<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.170> try<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:02.039> know<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.399> likely

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
more you try you know the more likely

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:03.889 
more you try you know the more likely
there's<00:01:02.879> gonna<00:01:02.969> be<00:01:03.090> dust<00:01:03.300> getting<00:01:03.600> stuck

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
there's gonna be dust getting stuck

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
there's gonna be dust getting stuck
underneath<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.589> screen<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.220> those

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
underneath the screen and that those

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.160 
underneath the screen and that those
little<00:01:06.119> air<00:01:06.360> bubbles<00:01:06.689> at<00:01:06.840> least<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.080> we

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
little air bubbles at least when we

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.500 
little air bubbles at least when we
drive<00:01:07.350> me<00:01:07.500> crazy<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:09.119> imagine<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
drive me crazy so I can imagine it's

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.490 
drive me crazy so I can imagine it's
going<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> same<00:01:10.080> would<00:01:10.229> happen<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
going to have the same would happen to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.429 
going to have the same would happen to
you<00:01:10.790> anyway<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.689> try<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.930> scrape<00:01:13.140> clean

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

a video on the channel if you guys want

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
a video on the channel if you guys want
to<00:01:32.970> check<00:01:33.090> out<00:01:33.270> how<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.650> basically

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
to check out how to do that so basically

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:35.960 
to check out how to do that so basically
it's<00:01:35.189> pretty<00:01:35.280> simple

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
it's pretty simple

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
it's pretty simple
step<00:01:36.450> one<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.990> peel<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.500> side<00:01:37.650> off<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.159> that

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
step one is peel this side off and that

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.190 
step one is peel this side off and that
this<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.060> just<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.509> plastic<00:01:39.689> covering

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
this is just a little plastic covering

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.899 
this is just a little plastic covering
you<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.650> on<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> screen<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.700> peel

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
you put it on the screen and then peel

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
you put it on the screen and then peel
this<00:01:42.060> other<00:01:42.240> side<00:01:42.420> off<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.750> make<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:42.930> permanent

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
this other side off to make it permanent

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.530 
this other side off to make it permanent
so<00:01:43.560> anyway<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.090> I'm<00:01:45.329> going<00:01:45.509> to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
so anyway that is that I'm going to

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.819 
so anyway that is that I'm going to
double<00:01:45.780> check<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:46.079> screen<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.409> make<00:01:46.560> sure<00:01:46.680> it's

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
double check my screen to make sure it's

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.639 
double check my screen to make sure it's
still<00:01:47.009> super<00:01:47.729> clean<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.380> looks<00:01:49.380> like<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.619> is

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
still super clean and looks like it is

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.929 
still super clean and looks like it is
I'm<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> set<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.310> nice<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> slowly

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
I'm going to set it down nice and slowly

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
I'm going to set it down nice and slowly
so<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.149> way<00:01:51.299> doesn't<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.439> dust

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
so that way doesn't like make it a dust

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.499 
so that way doesn't like make it a dust
fly<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.369> on<00:01:53.610> top<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> screen

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
fly up on top of the screen

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.920 
fly up on top of the screen
so<00:01:55.310> anyways<00:01:56.310> go<00:01:56.520> ahead<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.719> I'm

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
so anyways go ahead and do this so I'm

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.859 
so anyways go ahead and do this so I'm
going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.140> pull<00:01:58.290> off<00:01:58.469> step<00:01:59.280> number<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.869> simple

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
going to pull off step number one simple

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.209 
going to pull off step number one simple
enough<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.560> know<00:02:01.619> most<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> screen

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
enough and you know most of the screen

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.749 
enough and you know most of the screen
covers<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.790> dry<00:02:02.939> ones<00:02:03.210> are<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:04.380> so

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
covers are the dry ones are like this so

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
covers are the dry ones are like this so
now<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.820> mistake<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.299> made<00:02:06.329> not<00:02:07.170> only<00:02:07.409> with<00:02:07.829> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
now the mistake I made not only with the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.249 
now the mistake I made not only with the
dust<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.940> try<00:02:09.479> to<00:02:09.509> put<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> on<00:02:09.929> from

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
dust thing but I try to put it on from

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.869 
dust thing but I try to put it on from
the<00:02:10.379> bottom<00:02:10.739> up<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.489> reason<00:02:11.730> why<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
the bottom up and the reason why you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.670 
the bottom up and the reason why you
don't<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.420> want

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
don't really want

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.229 
don't really want
do<00:02:12.769> this<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.129> with<00:02:13.519> the<00:02:13.730> new<00:02:14.000> phones

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
do this is with the new phones

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.330 
do this is with the new phones
especially<00:02:14.659> with<00:02:14.750> front-facing<00:02:15.140> cameras<00:02:15.620> you

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
especially with front-facing cameras you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.319 
especially with front-facing cameras you
have<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.519> make<00:02:16.670> sure<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.939> screen<00:02:17.150> cover

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
have to make sure the screen cover

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:18.970 
have to make sure the screen cover
aligns<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:17.810> that<00:02:17.989> these<00:02:18.379> little<00:02:18.530> sensors

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
aligns with that these little sensors

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.039 
aligns with that these little sensors
right<00:02:19.159> here<00:02:19.459> you<00:02:20.360> have<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.510> make<00:02:20.659> sure<00:02:20.689> they're

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
right here you have to make sure they're

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.960 
right here you have to make sure they're
not<00:02:21.200> covered<00:02:21.560> otherwise<00:02:21.799> we're<00:02:22.640> on<00:02:22.700> a<00:02:22.790> phone

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
not covered otherwise we're on a phone

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.940 
not covered otherwise we're on a phone
call<00:02:23.000> there<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:24.079> screen<00:02:24.319> won't<00:02:24.439> turn<00:02:24.650> off<00:02:24.739> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
call there the screen won't turn off and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.649 
call there the screen won't turn off and
your<00:02:25.069> cheek<00:02:25.280> will<00:02:25.400> be<00:02:25.519> dialing<00:02:25.760> buttons<00:02:26.120> and

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
your cheek will be dialing buttons and

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:27.910 
your cheek will be dialing buttons and
this<00:02:27.079> is<00:02:27.170> notification<00:02:27.650> light<00:02:27.739> doesn't

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
this is notification light doesn't

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.050 
this is notification light doesn't
really<00:02:28.099> matter<00:02:28.280> if<00:02:28.400> that's<00:02:28.549> covered<00:02:28.849> but

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
really matter if that's covered but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.210 
really matter if that's covered but
anyway<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.930> would<00:02:30.290> recommend<00:02:30.739> doing<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.099> from

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
anyway I would recommend doing it from

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.860 
anyway I would recommend doing it from
the<00:02:31.280> bottom<00:02:31.519> up<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:31.819> I'm<00:02:32.390> going<00:02:32.540> to<00:02:32.569> put<00:02:32.750> this

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the bottom up so I'm going to put this

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.770 
the bottom up so I'm going to put this
guy<00:02:33.079> like<00:02:33.739> this<00:02:34.129> so<00:02:34.819> typically<00:02:35.209> you<00:02:35.299> go<00:02:35.659> the

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
guy like this so typically you go the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.470 
guy like this so typically you go the
other<00:02:35.810> way<00:02:35.989> but<00:02:36.349> I<00:02:37.000> think<00:02:38.000> this<00:02:38.120> way<00:02:38.239> is<00:02:38.269> better

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
other way but I think this way is better

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.670 
other way but I think this way is better
so<00:02:38.689> anyway<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.170> is<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.290> way<00:02:39.439> I'm<00:02:39.530> going<00:02:39.620> to

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
so anyway this is the way I'm going to

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.380 
so anyway this is the way I'm going to
do<00:02:39.799> it<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.189> I'm<00:02:40.760> going<00:02:40.909> to<00:02:40.939> put<00:02:41.120> this<00:02:41.209> guy<00:02:41.299> down

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
do it so I'm going to put this guy down

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.920 
do it so I'm going to put this guy down
now

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
now

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.780 
now
and<00:02:42.019> I'm<00:02:42.470> going<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.620> align<00:02:42.950> it<00:02:43.010> with<00:02:43.310> the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
and I'm going to align it with the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.839 
and I'm going to align it with the
camera<00:02:44.629> if<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.989> can<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:46.430> camera<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.760> kind

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
camera if I can and the camera is kind

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.099 
camera if I can and the camera is kind
of<00:02:46.970> covered<00:02:47.180> by<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.299> little<00:02:47.540> sticker<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.019> I'm

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.109 
of covered by a little sticker but I'm

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.080 
of covered by a little sticker but I'm
gonna<00:02:48.230> try<00:02:48.349> to<00:02:48.379> do<00:02:48.650> it<00:02:48.769> as<00:02:49.310> well<00:02:49.489> as<00:02:49.549> I<00:02:49.639> can<00:02:49.700> with

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
gonna try to do it as well as I can with

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.599 
gonna try to do it as well as I can with
the<00:02:50.180> earpiece<00:02:50.389> and<00:02:50.930> then<00:02:51.680> there<00:02:52.400> are<00:02:52.489> little

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
the earpiece and then there are little

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.240 
the earpiece and then there are little
sensors<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:54.170> the<00:02:54.260> camera<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:54.680> of<00:02:54.739> course<00:02:55.010> I

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
sensors and the camera and of course I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.640 
sensors and the camera and of course I
want<00:02:55.909> it<00:02:56.000> to<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.180> straight<00:02:56.750> with<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.290> actual

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
want it to be straight with the actual

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.379 
want it to be straight with the actual
screen<00:02:57.920> itself<00:02:57.980> so<00:02:58.939> that<00:02:59.090> way<00:02:59.180> it's<00:02:59.329> like

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
screen itself so that way it's like

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.619 
screen itself so that way it's like
going<00:02:59.780> straight<00:03:00.139> down<00:03:00.609> and<00:03:01.609> everything<00:03:02.569> is

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
going straight down and everything is

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:04.660 
going straight down and everything is
perfect<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.230> I'm<00:03:03.379> going<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.560> align<00:03:03.829> it<00:03:03.889> as<00:03:04.220> best

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
perfect so I'm going to align it as best

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.449 
perfect so I'm going to align it as best
as<00:03:04.849> I<00:03:04.939> can<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.209> think<00:03:05.569> that's<00:03:05.980> pretty<00:03:06.980> good<00:03:07.159> it

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
as I can I think that's pretty good it

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.740 
as I can I think that's pretty good it
looks<00:03:07.609> pretty<00:03:07.819> good<00:03:07.970> from<00:03:08.120> here<00:03:08.389> of<00:03:08.689> course

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
looks pretty good from here of course

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.140 
looks pretty good from here of course
you<00:03:09.019> can<00:03:09.170> never<00:03:09.230> really<00:03:09.500> tell<00:03:09.829> until<00:03:10.129> you<00:03:10.730> kind

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
you can never really tell until you kind

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.869 
you can never really tell until you kind
of<00:03:11.209> put<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.510> down<00:03:11.689> and<00:03:12.489> looks<00:03:13.489> pretty<00:03:13.670> good<00:03:13.819> so

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:13.879 
of put it down and looks pretty good so

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:16.240 
of put it down and looks pretty good so
anyway<00:03:14.269> what<00:03:14.870> you're<00:03:14.959> going<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.139> do<00:03:15.290> is<00:03:15.500> work
