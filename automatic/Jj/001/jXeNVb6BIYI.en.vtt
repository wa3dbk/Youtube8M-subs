disaster movie an epic movie I think

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.270 
disaster movie an epic movie I think
date<00:01:29.170> movie<00:01:29.440> was<00:01:29.590> really<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.890> only<00:01:29.979> decent

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
date movie was really the only decent

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.950 
date movie was really the only decent
one<00:01:30.520> some<00:01:31.149> of<00:01:31.240> you<00:01:31.330> are<00:01:31.450> probably<00:01:31.479> saying<00:01:31.780> no

of<00:03:28.770> the<00:03:28.920> movie<00:03:28.950> where<00:03:29.790> it's<00:03:29.970> Bella<00:03:30.210> moves<00:03:31.050> or

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
of the movie where it's Bella moves or

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
Becca in this case moves from Phoenix to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.050 
Becca in this case moves from Phoenix to
Washington<00:03:34.650> meets<00:03:34.890> Edward<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.430> has<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.820> same

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
Washington meets Edward and has the same

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.390 
Washington meets Edward and has the same
story<00:03:36.450> just<00:03:36.720> making<00:03:37.530> fun<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:37.890> each<00:03:38.130> thing

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
story just making fun of each thing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000

having a funny thing thrown into each

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.280 
having a funny thing thrown into each
scene<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:42.120> I<00:03:42.150> think<00:03:42.360> they<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:43.020> did<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.200> good

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
fun of the whole story instead of just

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.960 
fun of the whole story instead of just
poking<00:03:46.890> fun<00:03:47.070> at<00:03:47.130> random<00:03:47.550> different<00:03:47.820> things
