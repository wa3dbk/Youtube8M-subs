automatically and if you put it back it
closes<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> screen<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.630> nice<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

closes the screen so that is nice I
would<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.310> also<00:01:08.490> has<00:01:08.729> some<00:01:08.970> nifty

functions if you just double tap on the
screen<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.780> gives<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> time

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
screen like this it gives you the time

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.320

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the call right now and you can reject

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.639 
the call right now and you can reject
you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.390> have<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.750> open<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.320> flap<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
you don't have to you open the flap you

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.080 
you don't have to you open the flap you
can<00:01:46.799> directly<00:01:47.130> take<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.490> calls<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.820> we

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
can directly take the calls because we

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.630 
can directly take the calls because we
have<00:01:48.540> holes<00:01:48.869> over<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:50.130> audio<00:01:50.399> is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
have holes over here and the audio is

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.090 
have holes over here and the audio is
pretty<00:01:51.090> clear<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.990> that<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.350> one<00:01:52.829> thing<00:01:53.009> you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
pretty clear so that is one thing you

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.910 
pretty clear so that is one thing you
can<00:01:53.310> do<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.790> also<00:01:54.299> if<00:01:54.570> you<00:01:54.659> get<00:01:54.840> a<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.500> example

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
can do and also if you get a for example

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.370 
can do and also if you get a for example
SMS<00:01:56.310> etc<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> shows<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> by<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.689> notification

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
SMS etc it shows you by the notification

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
SMS etc it shows you by the notification
but<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.560> don't<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.979> preview<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.820> that

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
but you don't get the preview so that

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.730 
but you don't get the preview so that
sort<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> functionality<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.259> there<00:02:01.500> for

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
sort of functionality is there for

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020 
sort of functionality is there for
example<00:02:01.979> as<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.729> got<00:02:02.820> the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
example as you can see now we got the

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.969 
example as you can see now we got the
newest<00:02:03.270> cause<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> double<00:02:04.020> tap<00:02:04.049> it<00:02:04.439> gave

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
newest cause when I double tap it gave

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.089 
newest cause when I double tap it gave
you<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.369> info<00:02:06.090> but<00:02:06.750> again<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.649> coming<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you that info but again now coming to

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.449 
you that info but again now coming to
the<00:02:08.220> actual<00:02:08.369> usability<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.390> case

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
the actual usability of this case

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:11.979 
the actual usability of this case
not<00:02:10.640> impressed<00:02:11.090> I've<00:02:11.239> been<00:02:11.420> using<00:02:11.599> this<00:02:11.810> case

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
not impressed I've been using this case

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.229 
not impressed I've been using this case
now<00:02:12.170> for<00:02:12.409> about<00:02:12.500> two<00:02:12.829> days<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.879> think<00:02:14.120> so<00:02:14.209> I

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
now for about two days and I think so I

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:15.880 
now for about two days and I think so I
won't<00:02:14.510> be<00:02:14.659> using<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.109> case<00:02:15.439> because<00:02:15.769> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
won't be using this case because the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.309 
won't be using this case because the
thing<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:16.340> if<00:02:16.459> you<00:02:16.549> notice<00:02:17.200> using<00:02:18.200> the

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
thing is that if you notice using the

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.500 
thing is that if you notice using the
phone<00:02:18.859> now<00:02:19.040> single-handedly<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.150> little

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
phone now single-handedly is a little

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.479 
phone now single-handedly is a little
bit<00:02:20.599> difficult<00:02:20.810> with<00:02:21.140> this<00:02:21.260> case<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.709> if<00:02:22.280> you

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
bit difficult with this case and if you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.080 
bit difficult with this case and if you
type<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.909> lot<00:02:23.030> like<00:02:23.390> me<00:02:23.629> I<00:02:24.400> lot<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.879> phone

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
type a lot like me I lot on this phone

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.929 
type a lot like me I lot on this phone
it<00:02:26.359> is<00:02:26.719> actually<00:02:27.139> very<00:02:27.170> difficult<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:28.010> type<00:02:28.730> in

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
it is actually very difficult to type in

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.119 
it is actually very difficult to type in
because<00:02:29.209> this<00:02:29.359> obviously<00:02:30.139> just<00:02:30.349> pushes<00:02:30.980> it

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
because this obviously just pushes it

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.670 
because this obviously just pushes it
back<00:02:31.269> you<00:02:32.269> can<00:02:32.480> take<00:02:32.689> it<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.019> way<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
back you can take it all the way to the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.750 
back you can take it all the way to the
back<00:02:33.920> like<00:02:34.159> this

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
back like this

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.000 
back like this
but<00:02:35.120> the<00:02:35.209> thing<00:02:35.389> is<00:02:35.420> that<00:02:35.569> it<00:02:36.049> does<00:02:36.290> not<00:02:36.500> fit

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
but the thing is that it does not fit

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.629 
but the thing is that it does not fit
flush<00:02:37.430> and<00:02:37.790> as<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.239> can<00:02:38.389> see<00:02:38.980> it<00:02:39.980> just<00:02:40.010> wobbles

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:40.639 
flush and as you can see it just wobbles

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.659 
flush and as you can see it just wobbles
like<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:41.090> so<00:02:41.389> while<00:02:42.109> typing<00:02:42.470> yes<00:02:43.069> you<00:02:43.340> can

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:43.669 
like this so while typing yes you can

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:44.979 
like this so while typing yes you can
type<00:02:43.939> but<00:02:44.209> it<00:02:44.419> is<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.569> little<00:02:44.870> bit

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
type but it is a little bit

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.750 
type but it is a little bit
uncomfortable<00:02:45.409> another<00:02:46.129> thing<00:02:46.340> is<00:02:46.459> that<00:02:46.489> if

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
uncomfortable another thing is that if

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.670 
uncomfortable another thing is that if
you<00:02:46.879> take<00:02:47.359> the<00:02:47.540> tower<00:02:47.689> all<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.109> way<00:02:48.230> back<00:02:48.470> it

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
you take the tower all the way back it

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.190 
you take the tower all the way back it
blocks<00:02:49.040> your<00:02:49.340> camera<00:02:49.819> so<00:02:50.599> when<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.049> take

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
blocks your camera so when you take

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.110 
blocks your camera so when you take
photographs<00:02:51.799> you<00:02:52.459> have<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.700> awkwardly

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
photographs you have to awkwardly

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.319 
photographs you have to awkwardly
awkwardly<00:02:53.750> place<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.290> like<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:55.120> so<00:02:56.120> that's

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
awkwardly place it like this so that's

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.080 
awkwardly place it like this so that's
the<00:02:56.659> major<00:02:56.840> con<00:02:57.200> I<00:02:57.379> would<00:02:57.560> say<00:02:57.769> it's<00:02:58.489> not<00:02:58.700> very

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
the major con I would say it's not very

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.819 
the major con I would say it's not very
comfortable<00:02:59.659> to<00:02:59.810> use<00:03:00.019> it<00:03:00.230> but<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:00.650> good<00:03:00.799> thing

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
comfortable to use it but the good thing

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.949 
comfortable to use it but the good thing
is<00:03:01.099> that<00:03:01.219> if<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.459> do<00:03:01.579> not<00:03:01.730> open<00:03:02.419> the<00:03:02.719> phone

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
is that if you do not open the phone

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:04.659 
is that if you do not open the phone
like<00:03:03.169> this<00:03:03.349> and<00:03:03.590> primally<00:03:04.010> you<00:03:04.129> take<00:03:04.370> cause

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
like this and primally you take cause

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.940 
like this and primally you take cause
then<00:03:05.269> you<00:03:05.719> can<00:03:05.870> easily<00:03:06.169> take<00:03:06.379> the<00:03:06.560> calls<00:03:06.769> or

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
then you can easily take the calls or

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.800 
then you can easily take the calls or
end<00:03:07.099> the<00:03:07.250> calls<00:03:07.459> directly<00:03:08.030> like<00:03:08.239> this<00:03:08.480> and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
end the calls directly like this and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.770 
end the calls directly like this and
again<00:03:09.469> yeah<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.980> do<00:03:10.159> get<00:03:10.400> these<00:03:10.639> info<00:03:11.389> also

provide<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:21.919> lot<00:03:22.159> of<00:03:22.220> protection<00:03:22.340> as<00:03:22.879> you<00:03:23.000> can

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
provide a lot of protection as you can

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.149 
provide a lot of protection as you can
see<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.629> entire<00:03:23.930> back<00:03:24.229> is<00:03:24.260> protected<00:03:24.979> and

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:25.159 
see the entire back is protected and

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:28.240 
see the entire back is protected and
even<00:03:25.459> it<00:03:25.609> has<00:03:25.790> a<00:03:26.030> cutout<00:03:27.019> for<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.290> camera<00:03:27.379> etc

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
even it has a cutout for the camera etc

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.909 
even it has a cutout for the camera etc
so<00:03:28.639> that<00:03:28.909> way<00:03:29.120> in<00:03:29.599> terms<00:03:30.019> of<00:03:30.169> protection<00:03:30.500> it<00:03:30.799> is

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:30.919 
so that way in terms of protection it is

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:34.179 
so that way in terms of protection it is
pretty<00:03:31.159> decent<00:03:31.569> but<00:03:32.569> again<00:03:33.290> I<00:03:33.470> don't<00:03:33.620> like<00:03:33.979> the

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
pretty decent but again I don't like the

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:37.240 
pretty decent but again I don't like the
use<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:34.669> floppy<00:03:35.030> thing<00:03:35.510> and<00:03:35.720> again<00:03:35.900> if<00:03:36.799> you<00:03:36.949> put

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
use of floppy thing and again if you put

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.309 
use of floppy thing and again if you put
it<00:03:37.370> towards<00:03:37.729> the<00:03:37.849> back<00:03:38.030> also<00:03:38.510> I<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:39.019> to<00:03:39.169> use

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
it towards the back also I like to use

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.469 
it towards the back also I like to use
the<00:03:39.470> phone<00:03:39.650> single-handedly<00:03:40.489> most<00:03:41.239> of<00:03:41.389> the

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
the phone single-handedly most of the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:44.379 
the phone single-handedly most of the
time<00:03:41.689> that's<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.049> way<00:03:42.199> I<00:03:42.229> use<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.709> but<00:03:43.400> with

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
time that's the way I use it but with

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:47.020 
time that's the way I use it but with
this<00:03:44.509> case<00:03:44.810> I'm<00:03:45.199> not<00:03:45.470> able<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.829> do<00:03:45.979> that<00:03:46.220> easily

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
this case I'm not able to do that easily

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.069 
this case I'm not able to do that easily
so<00:03:47.560> overall<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.829> decent<00:03:49.250> case<00:03:49.519> by<00:03:50.209> HTC<00:03:50.689> and

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
so overall it's a decent case by HTC and

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:52.569 
so overall it's a decent case by HTC and
yes<00:03:51.379> it<00:03:51.560> does<00:03:51.769> provide<00:03:52.129> some<00:03:52.370> unique

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
yes it does provide some unique

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.089 
yes it does provide some unique
functionality<00:03:53.349> overall<00:03:54.349> if<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.590> like<00:03:54.829> these

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:55.099 
functionality overall if you like these

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.550 
functionality overall if you like these
cases<00:03:55.609> you<00:03:56.180> can<00:03:56.389> have<00:03:56.419> a<00:03:56.629> look<00:03:56.870> at<00:03:57.019> it<00:03:57.229> but

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
cases you can have a look at it but

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.259 
cases you can have a look at it but
again<00:03:57.949> if<00:03:58.370> you<00:03:58.549> like<00:03:58.759> to<00:03:58.939> use<00:03:59.060> your<00:03:59.209> phone

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
again if you like to use your phone

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.569 
again if you like to use your phone
single-handedly<00:04:00.139> then<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:00.769> do<00:04:00.979> not<00:04:01.189> recommend

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
single-handedly then I do not recommend

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.270 
single-handedly then I do not recommend
