00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.780
Shine,

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.740
Shine so beautiful

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.720
I was writing just a few things down when
you called

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.640
Trying to figure out what's wrong with me,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.100
it's like I left myself out in the cold.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.700
Just when I started to pray

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.700
I heard a voice inside me say....
Hey

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.960
Well heaven's gonna shine such a beautiful
light

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:52.200
I'm taking it as it comes, I don't put up
no fight

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.900
You're calling me in from the storm

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.360
It's gonna be so nice and warm

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.120
Heaven's gonna shine, such a beautiful light

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.180
Seems I've always known the truth deep down
in my soul

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.320
That I had to give it all to you,

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.760
gonna let
you have all the control

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.280
And now it seems so real

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.380
Just like I thought it would always feel

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.960
Oh

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.040
And heaven's gonna shine such a beautiful
light

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.920
I'm takin it as it comes

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.180
I don't put up no
fight

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.200
You're calling me in from the storm

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.820
Where It's gonna be so nice and warm

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.400
Heaven's gonna shine

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.480
such a beautiful light

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.820
So pick yourself up,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.980
shake off the dust

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.940
Go for the gold,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.480
kick off the rust

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.700
You don't gotta prove, nothing to me

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.820
Cause I'm on your side eternally

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.020
Heaven's gonna shine, so beautiful

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.340
Heaven's gonna shine such a beautiful light

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.440
Heaven's gonna shine, shine tonight

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.400
I'm taking it as it comes

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.140
It's gonna be so much fun

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.200
Heaven's gonna shine

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.460
such a beautiful light
