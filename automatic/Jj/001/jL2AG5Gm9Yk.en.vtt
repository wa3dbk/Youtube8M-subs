00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
my phone is a old boot ROM so when I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.640 
my phone is a old boot ROM so when I
jailbreak<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.119> will<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> untethered<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.590> the

jailbreak it will be untethered now the

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.639 
jailbreak it will be untethered now the
way<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.070> tell<00:01:41.369> if<00:01:41.909> it's<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> new<00:01:42.270> boot<00:01:42.479> ROM<00:01:42.689> is

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
way to tell if it's a new boot ROM is

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
way to tell if it's a new boot ROM is
the<00:01:43.890> same<00:01:44.130> way<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.399> look<00:01:44.549> on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> back<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.060> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the same way you look on the back of the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.310 
the same way you look on the back of the
packaging<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:46.829> over<00:01:47.490> week<00:01:48.240> 45<00:01:48.960> it's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
packaging and if it's over week 45 it's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.410 
packaging and if it's over week 45 it's
usually<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.799> new<00:01:49.950> boot<00:01:50.189> ROM<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:51.090> will<00:01:51.270> show

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
usually a new boot ROM and I will show

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.530 
usually a new boot ROM and I will show
you<00:01:51.479> right<00:01:51.750> here<00:01:52.670> when<00:01:53.670> you<00:01:53.790> go<00:01:53.970> on<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.329> red

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
snow to jailbreak it'll say is this

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.219 
snow to jailbreak it'll say is this

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.319 
model an older and newer boot ROM 3GS
and<00:02:01.560> it'll<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.610> right<00:02:02.880> there

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and it'll say right there

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
for example the serial number beginning

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.410 
for example the serial number beginning
with<00:02:05.909> 8<00:02:06.240> 8<00:02:06.630> 9<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:07.320> 6<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.849> week<00:02:09.330> 26<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.259> 2009

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.400 
with 8 8 9 to 6 would be week 26 of 2009
3GS<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
3GS is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.550 
3GS is
made<00:02:13.560> week<00:02:13.920> 45<00:02:14.520> or<00:02:14.760> later<00:02:15.030> usually<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
made week 45 or later usually have the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.840 
made week 45 or later usually have the
fixed<00:02:16.800> bootrom<00:02:18.710> so<00:02:19.710> there<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.010> have<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.220> week

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
fixed bootrom so there you have it week

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.690 
fixed bootrom so there you have it week
45<00:02:21.450> anything<00:02:22.200> after<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.560> is<00:02:23.010> a<00:02:23.100> new<00:02:23.460> bootrom

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
45 anything after that is a new bootrom

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
45 anything after that is a new bootrom
and<00:02:24.240> anything<00:02:25.020> below<00:02:25.320> it<00:02:25.500> should<00:02:25.770> be<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.100> old

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and anything below it should be the old

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.030 
and anything below it should be the old
bootrom<00:02:26.730> another<00:02:27.420> way<00:02:27.630> to<00:02:27.690> tell<00:02:28.020> too<00:02:28.230> is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
bootrom another way to tell too is

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.060 
bootrom another way to tell too is
because<00:02:29.550> Apple<00:02:30.120> has<00:02:30.590> now<00:02:31.590> this<00:02:31.770> isn't<00:02:31.950> a

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
because Apple has now this isn't a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.910 
because Apple has now this isn't a
hundred<00:02:32.370> percent<00:02:32.930> but<00:02:33.930> this<00:02:34.260> other<00:02:34.560> way<00:02:34.860> to

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
hundred percent but this other way to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.130 
hundred percent but this other way to
tell<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.490> usually<00:02:35.940> if<00:02:36.060> you<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.210> an<00:02:36.570> iPhone

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
tell is usually if you have an iPhone

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.990 
tell is usually if you have an iPhone
that<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.850> 32<00:02:38.850> gigabyte<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.600> a<00:02:39.690> 16<00:02:40.260> gigabyte

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
that is a 32 gigabyte or a 16 gigabyte

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.390 
that is a 32 gigabyte or a 16 gigabyte
most<00:02:42.000> likely<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.600> isn't<00:02:42.930> an<00:02:43.140> old<00:02:43.560> boot<00:02:43.830> ROM<00:02:44.070> but

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
most likely it isn't an old boot ROM but

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.730 
most likely it isn't an old boot ROM but
there<00:02:44.550> are<00:02:44.700> some<00:02:45.030> new<00:02:45.210> bootrom<00:02:45.480> 16<00:02:46.290> gigs<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
there are some new bootrom 16 gigs and

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.680 
there are some new bootrom 16 gigs and
stuff<00:02:46.980> floating<00:02:47.280> around<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:48.420> for<00:02:48.600> the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
stuff floating around but for the

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.750 
stuff floating around but for the
majority<00:02:48.780> they<00:02:49.350> are<00:02:49.530> old<00:02:49.800> boot<00:02:50.070> ROM<00:02:50.280> because

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
majority they are old boot ROM because

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.360 
majority they are old boot ROM because
now<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.740> Apple's<00:02:52.740> 4s<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.490> iPhone<00:02:54.420> 4<00:02:54.720> out

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
now that Apple's 4s and iPhone 4 out

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.250 
now that Apple's 4s and iPhone 4 out
Apple<00:02:56.370> has<00:02:56.520> discontinued<00:02:57.210> the<00:02:57.360> 16<00:02:57.750> gig<00:02:58.020> and

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
Apple has discontinued the 16 gig and

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
Apple has discontinued the 16 gig and
the<00:02:58.350> 32<00:02:58.710> gig<00:02:59.040> iPhone<00:02:59.400> 3GS<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.420> now<00:03:00.540> they<00:03:00.690> are

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
the 32 gig iPhone 3GS and now they are

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.730 
the 32 gig iPhone 3GS and now they are
just<00:03:01.700> producing<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.850> 8<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:04.350> that's<00:03:04.500> another

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
just producing the 8 so that's another

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.860 
just producing the 8 so that's another
quick<00:03:04.980> way<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.220> tell<00:03:05.550> but<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.210> main<00:03:06.420> reason

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
quick way to tell but the main reason

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.440 
quick way to tell but the main reason
the<00:03:07.350> main<00:03:07.380> way<00:03:07.770> to<00:03:07.800> tell<00:03:08.160> is<00:03:08.700> by<00:03:08.970> looking<00:03:09.330> at

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
the main way to tell is by looking at

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.600 
the main way to tell is by looking at
the<00:03:09.570> serial<00:03:09.960> number<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:10.440> again<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.340> on<00:03:11.520> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
the serial number and again it's on the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.360 
the serial number and again it's on the
back<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.030> box<00:03:12.950> and<00:03:14.150> it'll<00:03:15.150> be<00:03:15.270> usually<00:03:15.480> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
back of the box and it'll be usually the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.480 
back of the box and it'll be usually the
third<00:03:17.990> number<00:03:18.990> the<00:03:19.320> 9<00:03:19.500> will<00:03:19.740> be<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:20.010> year<00:03:20.310> and

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
third number the 9 will be the year and

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.790 
third number the 9 will be the year and
then<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> two<00:03:21.030> numbers<00:03:21.420> after<00:03:21.600> that<00:03:21.930> will<00:03:22.650> be

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
then the two numbers after that will be

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.490 
then the two numbers after that will be
the<00:03:22.950> week<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.490> again<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.150> example<00:03:24.660> my<00:03:25.230> phone

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
the week so again for example my phone

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.210 
the week so again for example my phone
again<00:03:25.860> was<00:03:26.130> made<00:03:26.400> in<00:03:26.640> 2009<00:03:27.500> week<00:03:28.500> 38<00:03:28.890> and

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
again was made in 2009 week 38 and

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.690 
again was made in 2009 week 38 and
that's<00:03:29.820> why<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.120> see<00:03:30.450> 8<00:03:30.990> 6<00:03:31.470> 9<00:03:31.560> 38<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.520> 9

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
that's why you see 8 6 9 38 the 9

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.480 
that's why you see 8 6 9 38 the 9
represents<00:03:33.330> the<00:03:33.450> year<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.080> 38<00:03:34.590> represents

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
represents the year the 38 represents

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.060 
represents the year the 38 represents
the<00:03:35.640> week<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.940> was<00:03:36.060> made<00:03:36.320> so<00:03:37.320> again<00:03:37.590> guys<00:03:37.770> this

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
the week it was made so again guys this

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.770 
the week it was made so again guys this
is<00:03:38.220> just<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.490> quick<00:03:38.670> video<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.060> hope<00:03:39.390> this<00:03:39.540> does

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
is just a quick video I hope this does

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.690 
is just a quick video I hope this does
help<00:03:40.640> you<00:03:41.640> guys<00:03:42.350> with<00:03:43.350> determining<00:03:44.310> whether

your phone's a new or old blue ROM and

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.680 
your phone's a new or old blue ROM and
again<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:47.610> it's<00:03:47.760> an<00:03:47.850> old<00:03:48.000> boot<00:03:48.209> ROM<00:03:48.390> your

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
again if it's an old boot ROM your

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.690 
again if it's an old boot ROM your
jailbreak<00:03:49.050> on<00:03:49.290> iOS<00:03:49.709> 5<00:03:49.950> will<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.310> untethered

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
jailbreak on iOS 5 will be untethered

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.600 
jailbreak on iOS 5 will be untethered
and<00:03:51.090> if<00:03:51.870> it<00:03:52.020> is<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.410> new<00:03:52.620> boot<00:03:52.860> ROM<00:03:53.130> your

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and if it is a new boot ROM your

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.150 
and if it is a new boot ROM your
jailbreak<00:03:54.390> will<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.810> tethered<00:03:55.050> so<00:03:55.620> again<00:03:55.920> if

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
jailbreak will be tethered so again if

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.380 
jailbreak will be tethered so again if
