is very sad no big deal it happens hey
at<00:02:56.540> least<00:02:56.750> all<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.019> electronics<00:02:57.560> are<00:02:57.680> good

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
at least all the electronics are good

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.400 
at least all the electronics are good
and<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.370> doesn't<00:02:58.700> seem<00:02:58.880> like<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.330> shaft<00:03:00.140> on

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
and it doesn't seem like the shaft on

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.589 
and it doesn't seem like the shaft on
the<00:03:00.560> motor<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:01.010> bent<00:03:01.340> looks<00:03:02.180> like<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.480> was<00:03:02.569> a

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
the motor is bent looks like it was a

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.809 
the motor is bent looks like it was a
belly<00:03:02.930> down<00:03:03.200> landing<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.040> gear<00:03:04.340> was<00:03:04.549> down

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
belly down landing and the gear was down

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.860 
belly down landing and the gear was down
so<00:03:05.150> maybe<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:05.569> gear<00:03:05.900> absorbed

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:16.449 

still<00:03:11.870> straight<00:03:12.790> but<00:03:14.920> looks<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.190> gear

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
still straight but looks like the gear

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.630 
still straight but looks like the gear
absorbs<00:03:16.970> most<00:03:17.270> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.569> impact<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:18.260> this<00:03:18.380> crash

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120

was<00:04:29.270> right<00:04:29.450> something<00:04:29.660> was<00:04:29.930> off<00:04:30.020> balance<00:04:30.260> but

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
was right something was off balance but
