rushing<00:00:43.230> up<00:00:43.530> I<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.370> want<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:44.700> infantry<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
rushing up I really want my infantry to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.639 
rushing up I really want my infantry to
be<00:00:45.450> able<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> advance<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> only<00:00:46.379> way<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
be able to advance and the only way I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
be able to advance and the only way I
can<00:00:46.770> do<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.370> if<00:00:47.399> their<00:00:47.730> attack<00:00:48.120> choppers

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
can do that is if their attack choppers

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.150 
can do that is if their attack choppers
in<00:00:48.660> check<00:00:48.899> is<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:49.770> being<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.010> nuisance

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
in check is really being a nuisance

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.700 
in check is really being a nuisance
right<00:00:50.489> now<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.940> staying<00:00:51.270> back<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> their

right now so I'm staying back and their

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.590 
right now so I'm staying back and their
tank<00:00:53.010> isn't<00:00:53.190> check<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.059> those<00:00:54.180> two<00:00:54.390> things

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
tank isn't check so those two things

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.170 
tank isn't check so those two things
have<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.899> happen<00:00:55.520> don't<00:00:56.520> bite<00:00:56.699> off<00:00:56.730> more<00:00:56.879> than

just back off showing my other side and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.069 
just back off showing my other side and
the<00:01:50.189> reactive<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.850> maybe<00:01:51.329> take<00:01:51.570> another<00:01:51.600> shot

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
so we're getting down in tickets and

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
so we're getting down in tickets and
it's<00:01:55.229> time<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.710> move<00:01:55.799> now<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:57.030> going

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
it's time to make a move now I'm going

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.459 
it's time to make a move now I'm going
to<00:01:57.299> pay<00:01:57.390> attention<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.810> where<00:01:57.930> my<00:01:57.960> infantry

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
to pay attention to where my infantry

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.950 
to pay attention to where my infantry
are<00:01:58.619> there<00:01:58.799> dying<00:01:59.100> up<00:01:59.369> far<00:01:59.729> left<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.780> means

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
are there dying up far left that means

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.749 
are there dying up far left that means
we<00:02:01.079> probably<00:02:01.110> got<00:02:01.590> infantry<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.549> pretty

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
we probably got infantry in some pretty

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.240 
we probably got infantry in some pretty
nice<00:02:02.939> spots<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.930> I'm<00:02:04.079> actually<00:02:04.259> going<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.619> move

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
nice spots so I'm actually going to move

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.819 
nice spots so I'm actually going to move
all<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.420> way<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.840> left<00:02:07.110> hand<00:02:07.259> position

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
all the way to this left hand position

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.400 
all the way to this left hand position
because<00:02:08.429> think<00:02:08.670> about<00:02:08.729> this<00:02:09.030> map<00:02:09.270> think<00:02:10.229> about

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
because think about this map think about

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.930 
because think about this map think about
the<00:02:10.590> two<00:02:10.739> or<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:11.039> major<00:02:11.280> spots<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the two or three major spots that

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.610 
the two or three major spots that
infantry<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.629> clump<00:02:12.930> up<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.230> there

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
infantry can clump up on there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.339 
infantry can clump up on there
team<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:14.610> behind<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:15.030> buildings<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.599> it

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
team it's behind the buildings right it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.860 
team it's behind the buildings right it
usually<00:02:16.709> results<00:02:16.950> in<00:02:17.430> shooting<00:02:18.239> fish<00:02:18.510> in<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
usually results in shooting fish in a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.660 
usually results in shooting fish in a
barrel<00:02:18.900> once<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.950> can<00:02:20.129> get<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.400> position

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
barrel once you can get that position

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.690 
barrel once you can get that position
set<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.780> if<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.530> tree<00:02:22.709> akhand<00:02:23.010> around<00:02:23.340> me<00:02:23.519> I've

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
set so if a tree akhand around me I've

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.369 
set so if a tree akhand around me I've
got<00:02:23.879> proximity<00:02:24.480> thanks<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> my<00:02:24.989> gunner<00:02:25.200> I'm

sides<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> map<00:02:28.409> just<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:28.890> give<00:02:29.040> a

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
sides of the map just to give a

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.470 
sides of the map just to give a
