blade<00:00:27.260> and<00:00:27.410> I<00:00:27.529> have<00:00:27.710> developed<00:00:28.010> a<00:00:28.310> style<00:00:28.610> for

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
blade and I have developed a style for

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.550 
blade and I have developed a style for
teaching<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.450> course<00:00:29.689> which<00:00:30.199> works<00:00:30.439> very

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
teaching the course which works very

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.040 
teaching the course which works very
well<00:00:30.800> for<00:00:30.980> us<00:00:31.310> it's<00:00:31.760> a<00:00:31.910> bit<00:00:32.090> like<00:00:32.270> our<00:00:32.570> town

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
well for us it's a bit like our town

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.530 
well for us it's a bit like our town
where<00:00:33.620> the<00:00:34.160> actors<00:00:34.730> go<00:00:34.940> through<00:00:35.180> their<00:00:35.330> paces

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
where the actors go through their paces

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.630 
where the actors go through their paces
and<00:00:36.020> every<00:00:36.260> once<00:00:36.440> in<00:00:36.559> a<00:00:36.680> while<00:00:36.830> they<00:00:37.070> stop<00:00:37.370> and

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
and every once in a while they stop and

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.549 
and every once in a while they stop and
the<00:00:37.700> stage<00:00:37.940> manager<00:00:37.970> comes<00:00:38.750> on<00:00:38.930> stage<00:00:39.200> and

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
the stage manager comes on stage and

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.890 
the stage manager comes on stage and
makes<00:00:40.040> an<00:00:40.280> editorial<00:00:40.760> comment<00:00:41.450> that<00:00:41.629> couldn't

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
makes an editorial comment that couldn't

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.860 
makes an editorial comment that couldn't
be<00:00:41.989> conveyed<00:00:42.559> in<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.190> direct<00:00:43.550> fashion<00:00:43.870> we

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
be conveyed in a direct fashion we

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.750 
be conveyed in a direct fashion we
evolved<00:00:45.350> it<00:00:45.440> perhaps<00:00:45.800> because<00:00:46.220> blade<00:00:46.519> is

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
evolved it perhaps because blade is

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.700 
evolved it perhaps because blade is
charismatic<00:00:47.510> he's<00:00:47.690> very<00:00:47.930> effective<00:00:48.470> at<00:00:48.590> the

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
charismatic he's very effective at the

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.290 
charismatic he's very effective at the
teaching<00:00:49.040> of<00:00:49.160> the<00:00:49.280> course<00:00:49.489> he<00:00:49.910> knows<00:00:50.120> the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
teaching of the course he knows the

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.600 
teaching of the course he knows the
material<00:00:50.420> he<00:00:50.989> lives<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.470> material<00:00:51.980> but<00:00:52.460> I've

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
material he lives the material but I've

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.579 
material he lives the material but I've
had<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> lot<00:00:53.030> of<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.239> experiences<00:00:54.019> in<00:00:54.050> industry

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:54.589 
had a lot of the experiences in industry

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.500 
had a lot of the experiences in industry
about<00:00:54.830> how<00:00:54.890> this<00:00:55.250> material<00:00:55.760> actually<00:00:55.910> plays

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
about how this material actually plays

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.040 
about how this material actually plays
out

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
out

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.350 
out
so<00:00:57.500> typically<00:00:57.920> blade<00:00:58.309> will<00:00:58.580> do<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.970> bulk<00:00:59.210> of

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
so typically blade will do the bulk of

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.450 
so typically blade will do the bulk of
the<00:00:59.510> instructing<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.440> a<00:01:00.620> very<00:01:00.799> Socratic

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
the instructing in a very Socratic

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.369 
the instructing in a very Socratic
manner<00:01:01.790> which<00:01:02.210> is<00:01:02.390> part<00:01:02.750> of<00:01:02.839> what<00:01:02.960> makes<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
manner which is part of what makes the

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:05.800 
manner which is part of what makes the
class<00:01:03.620> effective<00:01:04.309> blade<00:01:04.940> is<00:01:05.150> very<00:01:05.360> very<00:01:05.600> good

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
class effective blade is very very good

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.320 
class effective blade is very very good

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:15.080 
touches on a subject which can be

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.640 
touches on a subject which can be

about real-world experience relating to
that<00:01:22.220> particular<00:01:22.580> topic<00:01:23.030> I'll<00:01:23.510> chime<00:01:24.049> in

blade is wonderful about stopping just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.660 
blade is wonderful about stopping just
about<00:01:26.869> in<00:01:27.049> mid-sentence<00:01:27.680> and<00:01:27.920> allowing<00:01:28.520> me<00:01:28.640> to

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
about in mid-sentence and allowing me to

work<00:01:28.939> with<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.240> students<00:01:29.659> just<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:29.990> little<00:01:30.200> bit

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:30.409 
work with the students just a little bit

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:32.440

them about it and then I go back and sit
down<00:01:34.909> and<00:01:35.299> blade<00:01:35.570> continues<00:01:36.229> right<00:01:36.500> where<00:01:36.710> he

down and blade continues right where he

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.760 
down and blade continues right where he
left<00:01:37.009> off

classes<00:02:07.409> where<00:02:07.619> it's<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.369> lot<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.759> students

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
classes where it's a lot of students

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.910 
classes where it's a lot of students
working<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.450> groups<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.869> then<00:02:10.470> we're

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
working in groups and then we're

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.640 
working in groups and then we're
stopping<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.730> work<00:02:12.260> asking<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> question

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
stopping the work asking a question

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.509 
stopping the work asking a question
sharing<00:02:14.550> ideas<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.270> evaluating<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.519> some

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
sharing ideas and evaluating it some

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.420 
sharing ideas and evaluating it some
classes<00:02:17.940> run<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> race<00:02:19.410> for<00:02:19.470> kradic<00:02:19.739> way<00:02:19.860> so

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
classes run in a race for kradic way so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.020 
classes run in a race for kradic way so
we're<00:02:21.300> really<00:02:22.170> having<00:02:23.160> them<00:02:23.580> come<00:02:23.880> to

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
we're really having them come to

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.570 
we're really having them come to
conclusion<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> class<00:02:25.170> on<00:02:25.380> ethics<00:02:25.830> for

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
conclusion so a class on ethics for

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.150 
conclusion so a class on ethics for
example<00:02:27.500> runs<00:02:28.500> better<00:02:28.680> when<00:02:28.860> you<00:02:28.950> teach<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
example runs better when you teach it

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.400 
example runs better when you teach it
Socratic<00:02:29.640> ly<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:30.360> they<00:02:30.690> need<00:02:31.019> to<00:02:31.050> become

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
Socratic ly because they need to become

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.250 
Socratic ly because they need to become
engaged<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.310> material<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.110> if<00:02:34.110> you're

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
engaged with the material and if you're

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.560 
engaged with the material and if you're
if<00:02:34.739> you're<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.040> saying<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.459> know<00:02:35.580> here<00:02:36.239> are

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
if you're just saying you know here are

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.050 
if you're just saying you know here are
examples<00:02:37.230> of<00:02:37.320> ethical<00:02:37.680> problems<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.519> here's

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
examples of ethical problems and here's

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.030 
examples of ethical problems and here's
their<00:02:39.150> solutions<00:02:39.630> they<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.440> check<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.830> box

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
their solutions they can check the box

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.890 
their solutions they can check the box
right<00:02:41.610> okay<00:02:41.970> yes<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.300> get<00:02:42.450> that<00:02:42.569> that<00:02:42.690> makes

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
right okay yes I get that that makes

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.600 
right okay yes I get that that makes
sense<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> me<00:02:43.319> or<00:02:43.590> maybe<00:02:44.190> there's<00:02:44.430> something

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
sense to me or maybe there's something

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.559 
sense to me or maybe there's something
where<00:02:44.700> they<00:02:44.790> don't<00:02:44.850> quite<00:02:45.060> get<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.360> you<00:02:45.420> could

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
where they don't quite get and you could

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.150 
where they don't quite get and you could
bring<00:02:45.870> up<00:02:45.959> spending<00:02:46.290> discussions<00:02:46.709> but<00:02:47.130> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
bring up spending discussions but I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.470 
bring up spending discussions but I
think<00:02:47.310> it's<00:02:47.430> more<00:02:47.640> successful<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.269> them

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
think it's more successful to have them

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.380 
think it's more successful to have them
think<00:02:49.170> about<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.850> be<00:02:50.850> able<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:51.090> even

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
think about it and be able to then even

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600 
think about it and be able to then even
argue<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:51.870> class<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.130> find<00:02:53.459> our

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
argue in class and so you find our

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.210 
argue in class and so you find our
version<00:02:53.880> points<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:55.290> have<00:02:55.320> different

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
version points and you have different

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.009 
version points and you have different
students<00:02:56.549> hash<00:02:56.850> them<00:02:57.060> out<00:02:57.209> and<00:02:57.540> you'll<00:02:57.720> find

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
students hash them out and you'll find

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.690 
students hash them out and you'll find
that<00:02:58.110> sometimes<00:02:58.320> other<00:02:59.010> students<00:02:59.459> will<00:02:59.549> come

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
that sometimes other students will come

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
that sometimes other students will come
in<00:02:59.760> having<00:03:00.510> turned<00:03:01.410> their<00:03:01.590> brain<00:03:01.739> on<00:03:01.890> and

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
in having turned their brain on and

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.009 
in having turned their brain on and
being<00:03:02.370> sparked<00:03:02.760> by<00:03:02.850> an<00:03:02.910> idea<00:03:03.120> and<00:03:03.690> say<00:03:03.810> wait<00:03:03.989> a

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
being sparked by an idea and say wait a

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.770 
being sparked by an idea and say wait a
second<00:03:04.260> no<00:03:04.320> no<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.650> think<00:03:05.250> they're<00:03:05.370> right<00:03:05.780> and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
second no no I think they're right and

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.220 
second no no I think they're right and
because<00:03:07.230> we<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.560> we<00:03:07.890> use<00:03:08.000> name<00:03:09.000> cards<00:03:09.329> that

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
because we have we use name cards that

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.479 
because we have we use name cards that
have<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.410> name<00:03:10.590> on<00:03:10.709> the<00:03:10.799> front<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> back

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
have the name on the front and the back

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.280 
have the name on the front and the back
the<00:03:11.790> students<00:03:12.480> can<00:03:12.600> see<00:03:12.750> each<00:03:12.870> other's<00:03:13.079> name

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
the students can see each other's name

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.860 
the students can see each other's name
and<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.130> say<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.459> know<00:03:14.489> what<00:03:15.239> Joyce<00:03:15.420> said<00:03:15.450> was

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
and can say you know what Joyce said was

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.780 
and can say you know what Joyce said was
was<00:03:16.590> really<00:03:16.739> good<00:03:17.010> no<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:17.220> like<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.700> was

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
was really good no I like that that was

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.729 
was really good no I like that that was
an<00:03:17.850> important<00:03:18.150> point<00:03:18.299> because<00:03:19.019> they<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:19.560> see

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
an important point because they can see

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.910 
an important point because they can see
each<00:03:19.769> other<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.130> it<00:03:20.220> connects<00:03:20.579> just<00:03:21.299> a<00:03:21.450> class

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
each other so it connects just a class

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.220 
each other so it connects just a class
to<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:22.980> able<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.220> start<00:03:23.400> learning<00:03:23.790> together

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
to be able to start learning together

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.270 
to be able to start learning together
which<00:03:25.230> makes<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.709> learning<00:03:25.829> process

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
which makes the learning process

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.310 
which makes the learning process
actually<00:03:26.489> very<00:03:26.700> important<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.359> those<00:03:28.079> kinds

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
actually very important for those kinds

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.770 
actually very important for those kinds
of<00:03:28.380> classes<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.709> be<00:03:28.829> in<00:03:29.130> person<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.299> class<00:03:30.630> is

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
of classes to be in person the class is

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.930 
of classes to be in person the class is
meant<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.049> have<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.230> lot<00:03:31.530> of<00:03:31.560> interaction<00:03:32.400> as

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
meant to have a lot of interaction as

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.840 
meant to have a lot of interaction as
much<00:03:33.180> as<00:03:33.329> possible<00:03:33.780> really<00:03:34.519> at<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:35.609> end<00:03:35.700> of<00:03:35.790> it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
much as possible really at the end of it

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.130 
much as possible really at the end of it
at<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.150> end<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.299> a<00:03:36.359> big<00:03:36.480> school<00:03:36.690> tonight<00:03:36.870> from

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
at the end of a big school tonight from

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.680 
at the end of a big school tonight from
3<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.560> 5<00:03:37.650> p.m.<00:03:37.709> they<00:03:38.430> could<00:03:38.640> be<00:03:38.760> tired<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.239> they

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
3 to 5 p.m. they could be tired and they

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.640 
3 to 5 p.m. they could be tired and they
probably<00:03:39.989> definitely<00:03:40.140> late<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.560> night

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
probably definitely late the night

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.990 
probably definitely late the night
before<00:03:40.799> so<00:03:41.190> they<00:03:41.310> probably<00:03:41.459> definitely<00:03:41.700> tired

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
before so they probably definitely tired

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.250 
before so they probably definitely tired
around<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.299> time<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.959> want<00:03:43.019> to<00:03:43.140> make

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
around that time so you want to make

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
around that time so you want to make
sure<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.530> you're<00:03:43.739> keeping<00:03:44.220> them

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
sure that you're keeping them

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.270 
sure that you're keeping them
entertained<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.850> engaged<00:03:46.190> with<00:03:47.190> the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
entertained and engaged with the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.610 
entertained and engaged with the
material<00:03:47.310> I<00:03:47.670> mean<00:03:47.700> it's<00:03:47.910> really<00:03:48.410> every<00:03:49.410> class

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
material I mean it's really every class

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.160 
material I mean it's really every class
has<00:03:49.650> great<00:03:50.070> material<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.700> mean<00:03:51.269> any<00:03:51.690> class<00:03:51.930> can

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
has great material I mean any class can

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.930 
has great material I mean any class can
have<00:03:52.260> great<00:03:52.410> material<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:53.430> attitude<00:03:53.790> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
have great material but the attitude I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.610 
have great material but the attitude I
think<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.269> that<00:03:54.299> if<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.750> get<00:03:55.199> your<00:03:55.290> students

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
think is that if you get your students

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:56.620 
think is that if you get your students
to<00:03:55.650> be<00:03:55.739> engaged

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
to be engaged

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.570 
to be engaged
intellectually<00:03:57.380> they'll<00:03:57.830> learn<00:03:58.010> it<00:03:58.160> faster

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
intellectually they'll learn it faster

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.740 
intellectually they'll learn it faster
and<00:03:58.970> when<00:03:59.120> you're<00:03:59.209> trying<00:03:59.300> to<00:03:59.420> shift<00:03:59.599> their

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
and when you're trying to shift their

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.030 
and when you're trying to shift their
thinking<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.290> not<00:04:00.380> just<00:04:00.530> simply<00:04:00.680> explain<00:04:01.010> a

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
thinking and not just simply explain a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.430 
thinking and not just simply explain a
concept<00:04:01.250> but<00:04:01.880> have<00:04:02.030> them<00:04:02.150> think<00:04:02.390> differently

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
concept but have them think differently

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.479 
concept but have them think differently
then<00:04:03.440> you<00:04:03.980> need<00:04:04.250> to<00:04:04.510> engage<00:04:05.510> them<00:04:06.200> even<00:04:06.890> more

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
then you need to engage them even more

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:08.920 
then you need to engage them even more
because<00:04:07.970> you<00:04:08.090> need<00:04:08.209> to<00:04:08.330> change<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.690> way<00:04:08.780> their

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
because you need to change the way their

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.440 
because you need to change the way their
brains<00:04:09.170> are<00:04:09.470> functioning<00:04:10.340> and<00:04:10.580> get<00:04:10.970> snaps<00:04:11.239> to

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
design process you have to look at what

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.170 
design process you have to look at what
type<00:05:12.470> what<00:05:12.710> do<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:12.979> users<00:05:13.340> want<00:05:13.729> how<00:05:14.000> do<00:05:14.060> you

type what do the users want how do you

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.089 
type what do the users want how do you
greet<00:05:14.810> them<00:05:14.990> at<00:05:15.110> the<00:05:15.229> restaurant<00:05:15.380> what<00:05:15.889> type

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
greet them at the restaurant what type

an engineer and yet who is using some of

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.000 
the same engineer thinking that you use

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.089 
the same engineer thinking that you use
to<00:05:35.659> solve<00:05:35.870> a<00:05:36.080> problem<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.889> never

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
to solve a problem that you never

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:38.620 
to solve a problem that you never
thought<00:05:37.370> much<00:05:37.610> about<00:05:37.639> because<00:05:38.120> when<00:05:38.389> you<00:05:38.479> go

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
thought much about because when you go

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.510 
thought much about because when you go
to<00:05:38.690> a<00:05:38.780> restaurant<00:05:39.259> you<00:05:39.500> just<00:05:40.009> hope<00:05:40.190> that<00:05:40.400> the

to a restaurant you just hope that the
food<00:05:40.699> will<00:05:40.849> come<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.240> then<00:05:41.330> it'll<00:05:41.539> taste<00:05:41.719> good

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
food will come and then it'll taste good

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.930 
food will come and then it'll taste good
and<00:05:42.229> it<00:05:42.440> won't<00:05:42.620> be<00:05:42.740> too<00:05:42.770> expensive<00:05:43.310> and<00:05:43.759> that

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
and it won't be too expensive and that

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.209 
and it won't be too expensive and that
your<00:05:44.090> favorite<00:05:44.539> dish<00:05:44.719> will<00:05:44.960> be<00:05:44.990> there<00:05:45.469> but<00:05:46.159> you

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:46.219 
your favorite dish will be there but you

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:49.059 
your favorite dish will be there but you
you<00:05:46.789> tend<00:05:47.090> not<00:05:47.180> to<00:05:47.330> pay<00:05:47.659> any<00:05:47.870> attention<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:48.409> how

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
you tend not to pay any attention to how

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:51.010 
you tend not to pay any attention to how
were<00:05:49.250> you<00:05:49.370> greeted<00:05:49.729> by<00:05:49.759> the<00:05:49.909> hostess<00:05:50.509> how<00:05:50.840> are

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:53.409 
you seated what are the waitstaff doing

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.020 
you seated what are the waitstaff doing
how<00:05:54.409> does<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.800> cook<00:05:55.009> working<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.550> the<00:05:55.639> kitchen

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
how does the cook working in the kitchen

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.050 
how does the cook working in the kitchen
and<00:05:56.210> you<00:05:57.169> begin<00:05:57.500> to<00:05:57.680> realize<00:05:57.860> that<00:05:58.340> there<00:05:58.880> are

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
and you begin to realize that there are

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.050 
and you begin to realize that there are
many<00:05:59.840> more<00:06:00.110> dimensions<00:06:00.860> in<00:06:01.130> the<00:06:01.490> world<00:06:01.699> that

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:02.060 
many more dimensions in the world that

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.480 
many more dimensions in the world that
you're<00:06:02.210> interacting<00:06:02.539> with<00:06:02.960> then<00:06:03.860> you<00:06:04.069> pay

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
you're interacting with then you pay

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:10.820 
you're interacting with then you pay
attention<00:06:04.639> to

if we have a quiz in class we administer
our<00:06:12.900> quiz<00:06:13.129> we<00:06:14.129> swap<00:06:14.490> all<00:06:14.759> the<00:06:14.879> quizzes<00:06:15.180> we

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
our quiz we swap all the quizzes we

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.710 
our quiz we swap all the quizzes we
review<00:06:16.169> all<00:06:16.410> the<00:06:16.710> answers

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
review all the answers

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.820 
review all the answers
quizzes<00:06:18.720> tend<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.289> have<00:06:19.409> a<00:06:19.440> lot<00:06:19.680> of<00:06:19.710> the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
quizzes tend to have a lot of the

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.159 
quizzes tend to have a lot of the
questions<00:06:20.159> repeated<00:06:20.639> on<00:06:21.509> each<00:06:21.539> quiz<00:06:21.900> so<00:06:22.080> they

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
questions repeated on each quiz so they

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:23.210 
questions repeated on each quiz so they
they<00:06:22.530> didn't<00:06:22.710> know<00:06:22.800> the<00:06:22.860> answer<00:06:23.039> the<00:06:23.099> first

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
they didn't know the answer the first

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.710 
they didn't know the answer the first
time<00:06:23.460> they<00:06:24.000> should<00:06:24.180> know<00:06:24.300> the<00:06:24.389> second<00:06:24.629> time

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
time they should know the second time

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.420 
time they should know the second time
it'll<00:06:24.990> definitely<00:06:25.169> the<00:06:25.440> third<00:06:25.590> time<00:06:25.770> because

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
it'll definitely the third time because

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.589 
it'll definitely the third time because
we<00:06:26.580> review<00:06:26.849> it<00:06:26.879> in<00:06:27.030> class<00:06:27.240> we'll<00:06:27.449> spend

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:27.599 
we review it in class we'll spend

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.450 
we review it in class we'll spend
several<00:06:27.840> minutes<00:06:28.020> reviewing<00:06:28.259> that<00:06:28.650> quiz<00:06:28.919> to

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
several minutes reviewing that quiz to

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.219 
several minutes reviewing that quiz to
make<00:06:29.550> sure<00:06:29.699> students<00:06:30.030> can<00:06:30.300> use<00:06:30.960> it<00:06:31.110> as<00:06:31.199> a

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:31.229 
make sure students can use it as a

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:33.890 
make sure students can use it as a
learning<00:06:31.530> opportunity<00:06:32.240> because<00:06:33.240> I<00:06:33.419> do<00:06:33.599> want

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:33.900 
learning opportunity because I do want

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.540 
learning opportunity because I do want
to<00:06:33.930> do<00:06:34.020> a<00:06:34.050> diagnostic<00:06:34.710> to<00:06:34.800> see<00:06:34.919> what<00:06:35.370> are<00:06:35.460> they

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
to do a diagnostic to see what are they

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.249 
to do a diagnostic to see what are they
getting<00:06:35.879> are<00:06:36.210> they<00:06:36.599> doing<00:06:36.780> the<00:06:36.870> reading<00:06:37.139> I'm

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
getting are they doing the reading I'm

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:38.390 
getting are they doing the reading I'm
welcome<00:06:37.500> to<00:06:37.560> do<00:06:37.650> the<00:06:37.740> reading<00:06:38.039> it's<00:06:38.280> how<00:06:38.340> I

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 
welcome to do the reading it's how I

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.029 
welcome to do the reading it's how I
test<00:06:38.669> for<00:06:38.729> it<00:06:39.440> but<00:06:40.440> I<00:06:40.500> also<00:06:40.590> want<00:06:40.770> to<00:06:40.800> make<00:06:40.919> sure

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 
test for it but I also want to make sure

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:42.800 
test for it but I also want to make sure
that<00:06:41.159> they're<00:06:41.370> learning<00:06:41.940> if<00:06:42.180> they<00:06:42.270> and<00:06:42.720> if

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
that they're learning if they and if

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.480 
that they're learning if they and if
they<00:06:42.930> haven't<00:06:43.199> done<00:06:43.259> the<00:06:43.380> reading<00:06:43.650> maybe<00:06:44.370> they

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
they haven't done the reading maybe they

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.710 
they haven't done the reading maybe they
learned<00:06:44.639> a<00:06:44.699> little<00:06:44.759> bit<00:06:44.880> from<00:06:45.060> this<00:06:45.180> they<00:06:45.659> may

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
learned a little bit from this they may

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.149 
learned a little bit from this they may
have<00:06:45.930> some<00:06:46.050> different<00:06:46.349> questions<00:06:46.680> so<00:06:47.099> I'll

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
have some different questions so I'll

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.469 
have some different questions so I'll
have<00:06:47.250> someone<00:06:47.430> great<00:06:47.639> and<00:06:47.819> then<00:06:48.000> give<00:06:48.449> a

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
have someone great and then give a

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.050 
have someone great and then give a
result<00:06:48.900> to<00:06:49.199> see<00:06:49.380> what<00:06:50.159> the<00:06:50.280> contour<00:06:50.789> of<00:06:50.940> the

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
result to see what the contour of the

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.159 
result to see what the contour of the
grades<00:06:51.270> are<00:06:51.479> even<00:06:51.870> though<00:06:51.930> they've<00:06:52.050> already

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
grades are even though they've already

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:53.540 
grades are even though they've already
swapped<00:06:52.710> papers<00:06:53.009> and<00:06:53.099> their<00:06:53.280> own<00:06:53.370> grading

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550 
swapped papers and their own grading

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.040 
swapped papers and their own grading
students<00:06:54.270> go<00:06:54.360> through<00:06:54.509> and<00:06:54.630> check<00:06:54.780> all<00:06:54.930> them

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
students go through and check all them

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.620 
students go through and check all them
again<00:06:55.400> so<00:06:56.400> they<00:06:56.520> can<00:06:56.699> understand<00:06:57.150> what<00:06:57.539> the

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:57.630 
again so they can understand what the

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.029 
again so they can understand what the
contour<00:06:57.930> is<00:06:58.020> so<00:06:58.080> I<00:06:58.139> can<00:06:58.289> understand<00:06:58.590> our

00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 
contour is so I can understand our

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:00.680 
contour is so I can understand our
students<00:06:59.460> not<00:06:59.639> reading<00:06:59.940> the<00:07:00.030> book<00:07:00.180> yet<00:07:00.419> maybe

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
students not reading the book yet maybe

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.809 
students not reading the book yet maybe
that<00:07:00.930> maybe<00:07:01.470> we<00:07:02.039> signed<00:07:02.280> the<00:07:02.340> book<00:07:02.430> too<00:07:02.610> soon

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 
that maybe we signed the book too soon

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:03.800 
that maybe we signed the book too soon
they<00:07:02.940> weren't<00:07:03.090> able<00:07:03.150> to<00:07:03.330> get<00:07:03.569> to<00:07:03.690> the

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:03.810 
they weren't able to get to the

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.290 
they weren't able to get to the
bookstore<00:07:04.139> soon<00:07:04.380> enough<00:07:04.560> or<00:07:04.710> maybe<00:07:05.300> they're

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
bookstore soon enough or maybe they're

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.730 
bookstore soon enough or maybe they're
in<00:07:06.330> a<00:07:06.389> real<00:07:06.539> crunch<00:07:06.780> time<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.409> they<00:07:07.590> weren't

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
in a real crunch time and they weren't

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.649 
in a real crunch time and they weren't
able<00:07:07.860> to<00:07:07.979> review<00:07:08.490> some<00:07:08.610> material<00:07:08.909> so<00:07:09.389> we<00:07:09.509> try

00:07:09.649 --> 00:07:09.659 
able to review some material so we try

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:16.090 
able to review some material so we try
to<00:07:09.690> do<00:07:10.080> diagnostic<00:07:10.650> to<00:07:10.710> see<00:07:10.830> what's<00:07:10.949> happening
