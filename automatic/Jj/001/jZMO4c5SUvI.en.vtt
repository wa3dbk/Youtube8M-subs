evaporation is quite high and also the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.809 
evaporation is quite high and also the
rice<00:03:31.750> will<00:03:31.989> take<00:03:32.230> more<00:03:32.530> water<00:03:32.859> in<00:03:33.250> case<00:03:33.489> of<00:03:33.670> a

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
one is to one ratio which means if you

so<00:04:27.190> when<00:04:27.340> chicken<00:04:27.729> will<00:04:27.880> cook<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.389> will<00:04:28.509> also

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
so when chicken will cook it will also

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.779 
so when chicken will cook it will also
leave<00:04:28.990> its<00:04:29.169> water<00:04:29.500> we've<00:04:30.280> got<00:04:30.520> water

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
leave its water we've got water

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.580 
leave its water we've got water
sufficient<00:04:31.509> here<00:04:31.720> for<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.050> rice<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.289> we've

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
sufficient here for the rice that we've

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.890 
sufficient here for the rice that we've
added<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.099> the<00:04:33.520> chicken<00:04:33.849> will<00:04:34.000> also<00:04:34.360> cook<00:04:34.570> and

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
added and the chicken will also cook and

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.689 
added and the chicken will also cook and
the<00:04:35.259> entire<00:04:35.650> thing<00:04:35.680> is<00:04:35.979> going<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.340> be<00:04:36.430> very

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:36.699 
the entire thing is going to be very

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:39.270 
the entire thing is going to be very
very<00:04:36.970> flavorful<00:04:37.530> before<00:04:38.530> you<00:04:38.620> put<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:39.039> in

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
very flavorful before you put this in

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.159 
very flavorful before you put this in
the<00:04:39.430> microwave<00:04:39.580> you<00:04:39.970> need<00:04:40.180> to<00:04:40.449> check<00:04:40.690> for<00:04:40.930> salt

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
the microwave you need to check for salt

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.200 
the microwave you need to check for salt
rice<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.979> something<00:04:42.310> which<00:04:42.460> absorbs<00:04:42.880> a<00:04:42.940> lot<00:04:42.970> of

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
rice is something which absorbs a lot of

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.600 
rice is something which absorbs a lot of
salt<00:04:43.479> so<00:04:43.960> you<00:04:44.020> may<00:04:44.259> have<00:04:44.409> to<00:04:44.560> add<00:04:44.770> a<00:04:44.800> little<00:04:45.250> bit

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
salt so you may have to add a little bit

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.460 
salt so you may have to add a little bit
extra<00:04:46.120> so<00:04:49.080> solder<00:04:50.080> something<00:04:50.349> very

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
extra so solder something very

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.170 
extra so solder something very
subjective<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:51.130> may<00:04:51.280> need<00:04:51.400> more<00:04:51.669> I<00:04:51.699> may<00:04:52.030> need

we<00:04:54.849> do<00:04:54.969> we<00:04:55.210> just<00:04:55.240> have<00:04:55.570> to<00:04:55.690> cling<00:04:56.020> this<00:04:56.229> up

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
we do we just have to cling this up

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
the rice grains and the meat so we have

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.120 
the rice grains and the meat so we have
to<00:05:10.000> clean<00:05:10.240> this<00:05:10.449> up<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.979> after<00:05:11.979> you've<00:05:12.099> done

we'll<00:05:38.390> put<00:05:38.600> this<00:05:38.720> in<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.960> microwave<00:05:39.140> I<00:05:39.770> just

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
we'll put this in the microwave I just

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.460 
we'll put this in the microwave I just
got<00:05:40.550> it<00:05:40.670> out<00:05:40.730> of<00:05:40.850> the<00:05:40.910> microwave<00:05:41.060> and<00:05:41.750> let's

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
got it out of the microwave and let's

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.130 
got it out of the microwave and let's
see<00:05:42.740> how<00:05:43.250> the<00:05:43.310> Pallavas<00:05:43.760> looks<00:05:44.180> be<00:05:44.690> careful<00:05:45.020> of

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
see how the Pallavas looks be careful of

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.490 
see how the Pallavas looks be careful of
the<00:05:45.260> steam<00:05:45.500> lovely<00:05:46.460> always<00:05:47.210> remember<00:05:47.660> before

the steam lovely always remember before
you<00:05:48.590> serve<00:05:48.950> any<00:05:49.250> right<00:05:49.610> sort<00:05:49.910> of<00:05:50.000> pull<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.300> it's

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
you serve any right sort of pull of it's

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.710 
you serve any right sort of pull of it's
necessary<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.290> open<00:05:51.980> it<00:05:52.460> open<00:05:52.700> it<00:05:53.030> as<00:05:53.210> in<00:05:53.360> use<00:05:53.690> a

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
necessary to open it open it as in use a

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.100 
necessary to open it open it as in use a
fork<00:05:54.140> and<00:05:54.350> just<00:05:54.700> open<00:05:55.700> the<00:05:55.820> grains<00:05:56.110> why

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
fork and just open the grains why

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.040 
fork and just open the grains why
because<00:05:57.860> rice<00:05:58.430> is<00:05:58.460> quite<00:05:58.970> starchy<00:05:59.630> and<00:05:59.780> it

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
because rice is quite starchy and it

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.320 
because rice is quite starchy and it
sticks<00:06:00.470> to<00:06:00.650> each<00:06:00.770> other<00:06:01.010> after<00:06:01.370> it<00:06:01.790> gets<00:06:02.000> cold

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
sticks to each other after it gets cold

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.570 
sticks to each other after it gets cold
it<00:06:02.480> won't<00:06:02.690> separate<00:06:03.320> like<00:06:03.590> this<00:06:03.800> so<00:06:04.340> use<00:06:04.550> a

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
it won't separate like this so use a

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.820 
it won't separate like this so use a
fork<00:06:05.030> and<00:06:05.180> open<00:06:05.600> the<00:06:05.720> grains<00:06:05.990> you<00:06:06.140> can<00:06:06.410> always

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:06.830 
fork and open the grains you can always

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.280 
fork and open the grains you can always
reheat<00:06:07.100> in<00:06:07.370> a<00:06:07.460> microwave<00:06:07.970> so<00:06:08.510> this<00:06:09.050> is<00:06:09.170> what

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:09.290 
reheat in a microwave so this is what

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:12.010 
reheat in a microwave so this is what
I'm<00:06:09.410> doing<00:06:09.560> it's<00:06:10.070> very<00:06:10.280> very<00:06:10.850> essential<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:11.810> do

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
I'm doing it's very very essential to do

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.800 
I'm doing it's very very essential to do
this<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:12.650> that's<00:06:12.860> it<00:06:13.100> shyam<00:06:13.910> or<00:06:14.180> kofta<00:06:14.570> pulao

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
this so that's it shyam or kofta pulao
