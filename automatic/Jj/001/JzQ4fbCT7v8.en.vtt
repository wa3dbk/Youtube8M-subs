novia

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.620 

the<00:01:52.719> lower<00:01:53.520> period<00:01:54.520> no<00:01:54.939> matter<00:01:54.969> what<00:01:55.360> you<00:01:55.390> do

so what it's going to do what's going to

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.550 
so what it's going to do what's going to
look<00:01:58.060> like<00:01:58.090> if<00:01:58.539> Cara<00:01:59.229> sideways<00:02:00.000> onto<00:02:01.000> lordosis

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.300 

so<00:02:05.560> go<00:02:06.250> ahead<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.429> drop<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.700> bar
