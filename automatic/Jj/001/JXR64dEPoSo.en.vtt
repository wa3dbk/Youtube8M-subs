00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
invasive surgery there was no pain with

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.810 
invasive surgery there was no pain with
the<00:01:27.299> new<00:01:27.479> techniques<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.770> old<00:01:29.040> wanna<00:01:29.400> take<00:01:29.670> me

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the new techniques the old wanna take me

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.999 
the new techniques the old wanna take me
roughly<00:01:30.000> three<00:01:30.420> weeks<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.670> recover<00:01:32.670> from<00:01:32.939> pain

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
roughly three weeks to recover from pain

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.819 
roughly three weeks to recover from pain
but<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> new<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.790> only<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> week

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
but the new one is only like a week

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.340 
but the new one is only like a week
first<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:38.009> all<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.159> didn't<00:01:38.549> want<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.939> it

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
first of all I didn't want to do it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.260 
first of all I didn't want to do it
because<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.619> was<00:01:40.950> wondering<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.790> was<00:01:41.970> one

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
because I was wondering if it was one

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.429 
because I was wondering if it was one
cause<00:01:42.540> more<00:01:43.170> pain<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> first<00:01:44.430> one<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:46.140> it

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cause more pain like the first one so it

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.160 
cause more pain like the first one so it
was<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> different<00:01:47.189> boat<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> when<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:49.020> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
was a different boat but when I get it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.490 
was a different boat but when I get it
finished<00:01:49.820> within<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.030> day<00:01:51.270> after<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.259> patch

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
finished within a day after the patch

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.380 
finished within a day after the patch
come<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.100> could<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.850> hope<00:01:54.180> my

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
come up I could actually just hope my

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.080 
come up I could actually just hope my
eyes<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.869> see<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.770> before<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
eyes and see pretty good before the

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.590 
eyes and see pretty good before the
surgery<00:01:57.329> would<00:01:57.689> take<00:01:58.049> longer<00:01:58.590> time<00:01:59.600> patients

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
surgery would take longer time patients

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.260 
surgery would take longer time patients
would<00:02:00.750> have

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
would have

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.029 
would have
a lot<00:02:01.390> more<00:02:01.570> discomfort<00:02:02.049> because<00:02:02.409> of<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
a lot more discomfort because of the

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.760 
a lot more discomfort because of the
sutures<00:02:03.429> in<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.670> eyes<00:02:03.820> healing<00:02:04.570> is<00:02:04.990> probably

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
sutures in the eyes healing is probably

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.790 
sutures in the eyes healing is probably
close<00:02:06.340> to<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:07.179> same<00:02:07.359> but<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:07.810> would<00:02:08.019> have<00:02:08.289> to

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
close to the same but you would have to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000 
close to the same but you would have to
wait<00:02:09.039> for<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.310> sutures<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.849> fall<00:02:10.060> out<00:02:10.239> but<00:02:10.660> now

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
wait for the sutures to fall out but now

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.309 
wait for the sutures to fall out but now
we<00:02:12.010> are<00:02:12.040> beginning<00:02:12.730> to<00:02:13.060> use<00:02:13.090> a<00:02:13.629> new<00:02:13.989> technique

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319
