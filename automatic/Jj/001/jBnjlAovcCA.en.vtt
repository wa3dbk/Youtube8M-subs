you'll<00:02:07.250> see<00:02:07.460> that<00:02:07.490> all<00:02:07.880> of<00:02:07.909> a<00:02:08.090> sudden<00:02:08.360> it<00:02:08.479> pops

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
you'll see that all of a sudden it pops

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.979 
you'll see that all of a sudden it pops
and<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:10.039> car<00:02:10.250> fires<00:02:10.549> headlong<00:02:11.180> into<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.750> tire

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989

there<00:02:14.000> now<00:02:14.600> I've<00:02:14.870> got<00:02:15.019> a<00:02:15.049> feeling<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
there now I've got a feeling that the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.820 
there now I've got a feeling that the
rim<00:02:17.090> was<00:02:17.420> possibly<00:02:17.870> getting<00:02:18.140> machined<00:02:18.620> by

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
rim was possibly getting machined by

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:19.930 
rim was possibly getting machined by
something<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.430> front<00:02:19.640> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.760> car

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
something on the front of the car

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.460 
something on the front of the car
because<00:02:20.120> Steven<00:02:20.630> had<00:02:20.720> called<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:21.380> was

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
because Steven had called that there was

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.320 
because Steven had called that there was
a<00:02:21.500> problem<00:02:21.769> Phil<00:02:22.459> Keats<00:02:22.730> said<00:02:22.910> if<00:02:23.060> there's<00:02:23.239> a

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
a problem Phil Keats said if there's a

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.750 
a problem Phil Keats said if there's a
driver<00:02:23.600> made<00:02:23.840> pit<00:02:24.110> next<00:02:24.319> laughs<00:02:24.650> so<00:02:25.400> we've

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
driver made pit next laughs so we've

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.759 
driver made pit next laughs so we've
seen<00:02:26.030> rims<00:02:26.330> before<00:02:26.810> being<00:02:27.049> machined<00:02:27.410> by<00:02:27.620> our

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
seen rims before being machined by our

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.280 
seen rims before being machined by our
steering<00:02:28.130> control<00:02:28.489> arm<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.049> it's<00:02:30.049> only<00:02:30.200> a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
steering control arm and it's only a

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.750 
steering control arm and it's only a
hunch<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:30.739> that's<00:02:30.920> there's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.400> reason<00:02:31.730> for

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
hunch but that's there's a reason for

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.490 
hunch but that's there's a reason for

that I know there's been a bit of chatty
with<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.849> engineering<00:03:04.209> team<00:03:04.239> it's<00:03:04.840> very<00:03:05.049> hard

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
with the engineering team it's very hard

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.869 
with the engineering team it's very hard
to<00:03:05.379> say<00:03:05.620> I<00:03:05.799> mean<00:03:05.980> you<00:03:06.099> can<00:03:06.220> see<00:03:06.430> that<00:03:06.459> obviously

the tire has gone flat and it but it's

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:10.530 
the tire has gone flat and it but it's
obviously<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:09.579> of<00:03:09.609> sudden<00:03:09.939> failure<00:03:10.150> whether

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
obviously out of sudden failure whether

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.330 
obviously out of sudden failure whether
that's<00:03:10.810> something<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.349> rim<00:03:11.530> or<00:03:11.769> we've

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that's something with the rim or we've
