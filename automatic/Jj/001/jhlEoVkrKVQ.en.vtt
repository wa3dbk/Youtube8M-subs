00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
the touching moment that's not a bad

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.160 
the touching moment that's not a bad
thing<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.060> this<00:01:37.179> movie<00:01:37.420> does<00:01:37.569> a<00:01:37.600> good<00:01:37.779> job<00:01:38.020> at

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
thing and this movie does a good job at

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.959 
thing and this movie does a good job at
that<00:01:38.200> however<00:01:38.529> it<00:01:38.889> does<00:01:39.069> have<00:01:39.279> comic<00:01:39.700> relief

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:39.969 
that however it does have comic relief

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:41.760 
that however it does have comic relief
in<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.209> I<00:01:40.329> like<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.659> little<00:01:40.840> snowman<00:01:41.200> he<00:01:41.619> was

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
in it I like the little snowman he was

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.169 
in it I like the little snowman he was
awesome<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.340> this<00:01:42.429> movie<00:01:42.670> has<00:01:42.759> more<00:01:42.939> than<00:01:43.090> a

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
awesome and this movie has more than a

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.730 
awesome and this movie has more than a
couple<00:01:43.389> of<00:01:43.569> really<00:01:43.719> good<00:01:43.929> lessons<00:01:44.349> in<00:01:44.469> it<00:01:44.590> I

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
couple of really good lessons in it I

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.620 
couple of really good lessons in it I
wish<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.099> movie<00:01:45.429> would<00:01:45.609> have<00:01:45.639> explored<00:01:46.359> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
wish this movie would have explored the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.179 
wish this movie would have explored the
villain<00:01:46.929> aspect<00:01:47.319> more<00:01:47.529> I<00:01:47.709> can<00:01:47.920> say<00:01:48.069> this

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
villain aspect more I can say this

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:49.440 
villain aspect more I can say this
because<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.520> movie<00:01:48.729> doesn't<00:01:48.969> end<00:01:49.149> up<00:01:49.299> this

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
because the movie doesn't end up this

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:50.669 
because the movie doesn't end up this
way<00:01:49.509> and<00:01:49.749> I<00:01:49.779> never<00:01:49.840> thought<00:01:50.139> the<00:01:50.289> movie<00:01:50.529> was

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
way and I never thought the movie was

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:51.809 
way and I never thought the movie was
going<00:01:50.829> to<00:01:51.039> end<00:01:51.189> up<00:01:51.279> this<00:01:51.429> way<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.609> I<00:01:51.789> don't

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
going to end up this way so I don't

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.550 
going to end up this way so I don't
think<00:01:52.149> it's<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.329> spoiler<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:52.899> wanted<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.409> movie

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
think it's a spoiler I wanted the movie

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.349 
think it's a spoiler I wanted the movie
to<00:01:53.649> end<00:01:53.920> on<00:01:54.189> the<00:01:54.340> road<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.729> where<00:01:54.880> this<00:01:55.119> ice

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and tragic I guess that's where Disney

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.219 
and tragic I guess that's where Disney
