Independence Day in America but it does

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.430 
Independence Day in America but it does
heavily<00:00:11.370> critique<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.059> American<00:00:12.719> idea<00:00:13.139> of

heavily critique the American idea of

heavily critique the American idea of
success<00:00:13.889> which<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.160> very<00:00:14.549> individualistic<00:00:15.420> I

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
success which is very individualistic I

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.050 
success which is very individualistic I
mentioned<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.560> an<00:00:16.710> earlier<00:00:16.830> video<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.550> I

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
mentioned in an earlier video that I

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.660 
mentioned in an earlier video that I
asked<00:00:18.600> my<00:00:18.720> dad<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> read<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.650> moveable<00:00:20.160> feast<00:00:20.400> by

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
asked my dad to read a moveable feast by

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.570 
asked my dad to read a moveable feast by
Ernest<00:00:21.090> Hemingway<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.140> return<00:00:22.590> he<00:00:23.279> asked

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
Ernest Hemingway and in return he asked

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.730 
Ernest Hemingway and in return he asked
me<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> read<00:00:24.119> outliers<00:00:24.660> by<00:00:25.050> Malcolm<00:00:25.080> Gladwell

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
me to read outliers by Malcolm Gladwell

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.890 
me to read outliers by Malcolm Gladwell
I<00:00:25.980> don't<00:00:26.279> think<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:26.670> would<00:00:26.939> have<00:00:27.269> picked<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.750> up

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
I don't think I would have picked it up

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.810 
I don't think I would have picked it up
otherwise<00:00:28.410> not<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.220> wouldn't<00:00:29.670> think

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
otherwise not because I wouldn't think

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880 
otherwise not because I wouldn't think
it'd<00:00:30.000> be<00:00:30.119> interesting<00:00:30.359> but<00:00:31.019> because<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it'd be interesting but because this

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.979 
it'd be interesting but because this
book<00:00:32.070> has<00:00:32.189> been<00:00:32.340> talked<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.329> much<00:00:33.660> that

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
book has been talked about so much that

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
book has been talked about so much that
I<00:00:34.020> kind<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.469> felt<00:00:34.680> like<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:34.920> already<00:00:35.280> knew

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
I kind of felt like I already knew

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.970 
I kind of felt like I already knew
everything<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.570> without<00:00:36.719> ever<00:00:37.290> having

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
everything about it without ever having

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.040 
everything about it without ever having
actually<00:00:38.700> read<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.420> did<00:00:39.629> surprise<00:00:40.020> me

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
actually read it but it did surprise me

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
actually read it but it did surprise me
and<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> just<00:00:40.800> reaffirmed<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.640> me<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.149> idea

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and it just reaffirmed for me the idea

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.660 
and it just reaffirmed for me the idea
that<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.960> should<00:00:42.989> always<00:00:43.469> read<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.219> text

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
that you should always read the text

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.110 
that you should always read the text
yourself<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.420> never<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.760> assume<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.969> know

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
yourself and never just assume you know

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.060 
yourself and never just assume you know
what<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.300> book<00:00:48.510> is<00:00:48.629> about<00:00:48.870> or<00:00:49.289> take<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.800> somebody

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
what a book is about or take on somebody

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.830 
what a book is about or take on somebody
else's<00:00:50.460> opinion<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.239> own<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
else's opinion as your own so when I

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.720 
else's opinion as your own so when I
knew<00:00:52.020> about<00:00:52.170> outliers<00:00:52.770> before<00:00:53.340> having

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
knew about outliers before having

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.029 
knew about outliers before having
actually<00:00:54.210> read<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.449> was<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.930> idea<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
actually read it was the idea of the

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.610 
actually read it was the idea of the
10,000<00:00:56.760> hours<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.660> takes<00:00:57.899> 10,000<00:00:58.590> hours

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
10,000 hours that it takes 10,000 hours

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.400 
10,000 hours that it takes 10,000 hours
to<00:00:59.010> become<00:00:59.280> an<00:00:59.730> expert<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.570> anything<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.289> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
to become an expert in anything and I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
to become an expert in anything and I
was<00:01:01.500> also<00:01:01.890> familiar<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> idea<00:01:02.910> that

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
was also familiar with the idea that

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.660 
was also familiar with the idea that
Bill<00:01:03.449> Gates<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.989> Steve<00:01:04.019> Jobs<00:01:04.350> were<00:01:05.070> born<00:01:05.460> at

with those two ideas other than work

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
with those two ideas other than work
hard<00:01:19.680> towards<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.220> 10,000<00:01:20.939> hour<00:01:21.119> rule<00:01:21.299> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
hard towards the 10,000 hour rule and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600 
hard towards the 10,000 hour rule and
they<00:01:22.170> also<00:01:22.409> haven't<00:01:22.830> thought<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> fact

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
they also haven't thought about the fact

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.600 
they also haven't thought about the fact
that<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.420> seemingly<00:01:24.960> conflict<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.070> mean<00:01:26.250> are

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
that they seemingly conflict I mean are

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
that they seemingly conflict I mean are
you<00:01:26.700> supposed<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.299> work<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.810> hard<00:01:28.170> because

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you supposed to work really hard because

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.469 
you supposed to work really hard because
hard<00:01:28.890> work<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> only<00:01:29.460> thing<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.090> matters

hard work is the only thing that matters

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.380

or does none of that matter because

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
or does none of that matter because
what's<00:01:33.390> more<00:01:33.479> important<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> you're

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
what's more important is that you're

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.499 
what's more important is that you're
born<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> right<00:01:35.460> place<00:01:35.729> in<00:01:35.970> time<00:01:36.180> which

born at the right place in time which

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.390 
born at the right place in time which
you<00:01:36.659> cannot<00:01:36.990> control<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.650> answer<00:01:37.979> that<00:01:38.130> let<00:01:38.369> me

culture that made her success possible
the<00:05:51.990> other<00:05:52.200> people<00:05:52.710> in<00:05:52.890> her<00:05:53.040> life<00:05:53.070> that<00:05:53.450> really

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
success possible and also the lucky

addition to her own hard work but none
of<00:06:03.660> it<00:06:03.750> would<00:06:03.990> have<00:06:04.020> been<00:06:04.200> possible<00:06:04.860> without

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
of it would have been possible without

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.060 
of it would have been possible without
the<00:06:05.760> many<00:06:06.300> factors<00:06:06.690> that<00:06:07.110> contributed<00:06:07.710> to<00:06:07.890> her

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
the many factors that contributed to her

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.130 
the many factors that contributed to her
success<00:06:08.490> I<00:06:08.790> never<00:06:09.060> felt<00:06:09.390> while<00:06:09.570> reading

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
success I never felt while reading

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.950 
success I never felt while reading
outliers<00:06:10.710> that<00:06:11.190> it<00:06:11.310> glorified<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.330> idea<00:06:12.690> of

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 
outliers that it glorified the idea of

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.720 
outliers that it glorified the idea of
success<00:06:13.260> it<00:06:13.860> actually<00:06:14.250> helps<00:06:14.490> you<00:06:14.580> to

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
success it actually helps you to

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:17.420 
success it actually helps you to
understand<00:06:15.300> that<00:06:15.480> success<00:06:16.080> is<00:06:16.290> not<00:06:16.470> magic<00:06:17.160> and

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
understand that success is not magic and

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.480 
understand that success is not magic and
is<00:06:17.669> not<00:06:17.820> only<00:06:18.180> achieved<00:06:18.750> but<00:06:19.050> very<00:06:19.860> special

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
is not only achieved but very special

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.280 
is not only achieved but very special
people<00:06:20.730> but<00:06:21.240> near<00:06:21.360> the<00:06:21.510> end<00:06:21.660> of<00:06:21.750> the<00:06:21.870> book<00:06:22.050> he

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
people but near the end of the book he

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:24.380 
people but near the end of the book he
really<00:06:22.560> works<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:23.010> complicate<00:06:23.700> the<00:06:23.880> idea<00:06:24.150> of

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:24.390 
really works to complicate the idea of

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.630 
really works to complicate the idea of
success<00:06:24.600> and<00:06:25.080> ask<00:06:25.530> questions<00:06:26.100> about<00:06:26.220> whether

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:26.640 
success and ask questions about whether

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.790 
success and ask questions about whether
it's<00:06:27.120> always<00:06:27.690> worth<00:06:27.960> the<00:06:27.990> work<00:06:28.500> that<00:06:28.710> it

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
it's always worth the work that it

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.679 
it's always worth the work that it
requires<00:06:29.160> he<00:06:29.669> looks<00:06:29.820> especially

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:30.689 
requires he looks especially

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:33.529 
requires he looks especially
one<00:06:30.989> young<00:06:31.319> student<00:06:31.919> who<00:06:32.129> does<00:06:32.729> have<00:06:32.999> a<00:06:33.059> unique

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 
one young student who does have a unique

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:35.869 
one young student who does have a unique
opportunity<00:06:33.749> to<00:06:34.379> step<00:06:34.769> outside<00:06:34.979> of<00:06:35.339> what

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:35.879 
opportunity to step outside of what

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.999 
opportunity to step outside of what
would<00:06:35.969> normally<00:06:36.029> be<00:06:36.419> possible<00:06:37.139> for<00:06:37.349> her<00:06:37.439> but

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
would normally be possible for her but

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.369 
would normally be possible for her but
it<00:06:38.099> requires<00:06:38.399> so<00:06:38.729> many<00:06:38.939> sacrifices<00:06:39.689> both<00:06:40.110> for

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
it requires so many sacrifices both for

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:42.649 
it requires so many sacrifices both for
her<00:06:40.529> and<00:06:40.829> for<00:06:41.069> her<00:06:41.219> mother<00:06:41.459> and<00:06:41.789> she<00:06:42.389> has<00:06:42.509> to

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:42.659 
her and for her mother and she has to

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:44.629 
her and for her mother and she has to
work<00:06:42.809> incredibly<00:06:43.169> hard<00:06:43.469> which<00:06:43.919> means<00:06:44.159> giving

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
work incredibly hard which means giving

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.539 
work incredibly hard which means giving
up<00:06:44.789> some<00:06:45.059> normal<00:06:45.899> aspect<00:06:46.229> of<00:06:46.619> life<00:06:46.919> that<00:06:47.309> might

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:47.549 
up some normal aspect of life that might

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:49.429 
up some normal aspect of life that might
provide<00:06:47.879> meaning<00:06:48.329> to<00:06:48.449> her<00:06:48.569> outliers<00:06:49.049> is<00:06:49.409> a

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
provide meaning to her outliers is a

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.889 
provide meaning to her outliers is a
really<00:06:50.159> interesting<00:06:50.519> book<00:06:50.939> and<00:06:51.239> even<00:06:51.719> if<00:06:51.809> you

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:51.899 
really interesting book and even if you

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:54.379 
really interesting book and even if you
have<00:06:52.079> a<00:06:52.110> pretty<00:06:52.559> clear<00:06:52.860> idea<00:06:53.099> of<00:06:53.339> the<00:06:53.549> thesis<00:06:54.179> I

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
have a pretty clear idea of the thesis I

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.269 
have a pretty clear idea of the thesis I
would<00:06:54.749> say<00:06:54.959> that<00:06:55.169> it's<00:06:55.319> still<00:06:55.409> totally<00:06:56.009> worth

00:06:56.269 --> 00:06:56.279 
would say that it's still totally worth

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:58.519 
would say that it's still totally worth
reading<00:06:56.669> because<00:06:57.089> all<00:06:57.869> of<00:06:57.899> them<00:06:58.229> many

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:58.529 
reading because all of them many

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:01.909 
reading because all of them many
examples<00:06:59.099> he<00:06:59.610> uses<00:07:00.029> are<00:07:00.329> just<00:07:00.839> so<00:07:01.049> fascinating

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
examples he uses are just so fascinating

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.219 
examples he uses are just so fascinating
the<00:07:02.159> research<00:07:02.579> he<00:07:02.879> brings<00:07:03.149> in<00:07:03.360> the<00:07:03.659> interviews

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
the research he brings in the interviews

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:06.709 
the research he brings in the interviews
that<00:07:04.259> he<00:07:04.559> did<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.039> the<00:07:05.519> many<00:07:05.729> examples<00:07:06.209> that

00:07:06.709 --> 00:07:06.719 
that he did and the many examples that

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:09.799 
that he did and the many examples that
he<00:07:06.869> uses<00:07:07.319> are<00:07:07.769> always<00:07:08.309> really<00:07:08.729> engaging<00:07:09.269> and

00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:09.809 
he uses are always really engaging and

00:07:09.809 --> 00:07:13.129 
he uses are always really engaging and
even<00:07:10.589> in<00:07:10.829> a<00:07:11.069> brief<00:07:11.399> summary<00:07:11.759> of<00:07:12.119> the<00:07:12.360> book<00:07:12.689> you

can't get into detail about the many

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.049 
can't get into detail about the many
different<00:07:15.509> patterns<00:07:16.289> of<00:07:16.589> success<00:07:17.099> that<00:07:17.759> can

00:07:18.049 --> 00:07:18.059 
different patterns of success that can

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:20.419 
different patterns of success that can
better<00:07:18.419> help<00:07:18.599> us<00:07:18.809> understand<00:07:19.439> what<00:07:20.099> it<00:07:20.249> means

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:20.429
