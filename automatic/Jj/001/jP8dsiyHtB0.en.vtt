00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.680 

I<00:00:21.780> gained<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.290> lot<00:00:22.440> of<00:00:22.500> knowledge<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.100> know<00:00:23.690> at

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
I gained a lot of knowledge you know at

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.730 
I gained a lot of knowledge you know at
first<00:00:24.870> I<00:00:24.990> really<00:00:25.140> didn't<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.470> too<00:00:25.530> much

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
first I really didn't know too much

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.350 
first I really didn't know too much
about<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.100> nursing<00:00:26.430> program<00:00:26.820> but<00:00:27.030> then<00:00:27.180> we

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 
about the nursing program but then we

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.720 
about the nursing program but then we
went<00:00:27.540> down<00:00:27.690> we<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:27.900> saw<00:00:28.410> the<00:00:28.730> simulation

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
went down we actually saw the simulation

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.070 
went down we actually saw the simulation
center<00:00:29.940> and<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.390> really<00:00:30.600> did<00:00:30.750> feel<00:00:30.780> like<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
center and it really did feel like a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.110 
center and it really did feel like a
real<00:00:31.530> life<00:00:31.710> hospital<00:00:32.310> and<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.790> could<00:00:32.970> really

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
real life hospital and that could really

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.960 
real life hospital and that could really
help<00:00:33.420> students<00:00:34.380> work<00:00:35.100> with<00:00:35.340> patients<00:00:35.640> more

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970 
help students work with patients more

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.120 
help students work with patients more
efficiently<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.720> feel<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.440> that's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.950> big

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
efficiently I feel that that's a big

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.440 
efficiently I feel that that's a big
advantage<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.820> school

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
advantage for this school

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
advantage for this school
