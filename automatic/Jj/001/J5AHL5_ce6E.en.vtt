00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
impression you can play with it a little

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870 
impression you can play with it a little
bit<00:02:03.659> more<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:04.140> mean<00:02:04.439> this<00:02:04.560> isn't<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:05.250> hot<00:02:05.640> hatch

golden easy on the downside to being

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630 
golden easy on the downside to being
quite<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.420> lot<00:02:15.660> like<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.290> old<00:02:16.319> car<00:02:16.769> is<00:02:17.069> that<00:02:17.400> is

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
quite a lot like the old car is that is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.500 
quite a lot like the old car is that is
still<00:02:17.910> got<00:02:18.180> quite<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:19.140> jittery<00:02:19.819> bumpy<00:02:20.819> ride<00:02:21.180> it

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
still got quite a jittery bumpy ride it

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.229 
still got quite a jittery bumpy ride it
never<00:02:21.780> seems<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.380> just<00:02:22.680> settle<00:02:23.250> down<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.760> be

never seems to just settle down and be

never seems to just settle down and be

I<00:02:25.200> suspect<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.489> fairness<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.360> this

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
I suspect in fairness that this

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.930 
I suspect in fairness that this
particular<00:02:27.989> car<00:02:28.500> is<00:02:28.799> worse<00:02:29.519> than<00:02:29.790> most

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
particular car is worse than most

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.039 
particular car is worse than most
because<00:02:30.209> it's<00:02:30.510> fitted<00:02:30.810> with<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:31.019> optional

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
because it's fitted with the optional

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.190 
because it's fitted with the optional
sport<00:02:31.860> suspension<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.269> I'm<00:02:33.420> honest<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:34.019> is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
sport suspension and if I'm honest it is

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.420 
sport suspension and if I'm honest it is
just<00:02:34.500> too<00:02:34.950> hard

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
just too hard

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.210 
just too hard
worth<00:02:35.819> mentioning<00:02:36.390> however<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:37.260> all<00:02:37.500> models

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
worth mentioning however that all models

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.880 
worth mentioning however that all models
come<00:02:38.549> as<00:02:38.880> standard<00:02:39.390> with<00:02:39.569> Drive<00:02:40.080> performance

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
come as standard with Drive performance

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.970 
come as standard with Drive performance
control<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:41.519> you<00:02:41.549> can<00:02:41.930> adjust<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.470> throttle

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
control so you can adjust the throttle

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.130 
control so you can adjust the throttle
and<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.549> steering<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:45.150> suspension<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.989> be

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
and the steering and suspension to be

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.330 
and the steering and suspension to be
sporty<00:02:46.980> ER<00:02:47.010> or<00:02:47.400> more<00:02:47.670> comfortable<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
sporty ER or more comfortable so it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.690 
sporty ER or more comfortable so it's
okay<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.570> far<00:02:51.600> but<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.200> two<00:02:52.440> main<00:02:53.070> problems

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
okay so far but the two main problems

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.460 
okay so far but the two main problems
with<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.940> old<00:02:54.209> car<00:02:54.540> were<00:02:54.780> that<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.440> was

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
with the old car were that it was

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.710 
with the old car were that it was
slightly<00:02:56.220> expensive<00:02:56.489> and<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.299> little<00:02:57.600> bit

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
slightly expensive and a little bit

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.990 
slightly expensive and a little bit
cramped<00:02:58.049> this<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.650> now<00:02:58.950> costs<00:02:59.430> from<00:02:59.549> just

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
cramped this one now costs from just

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.259 
cramped this one now costs from just
below<00:03:00.410> 20,000<00:03:01.410> pounds<00:03:01.739> about<00:03:02.220> two<00:03:02.640> grand<00:03:02.940> more

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
below 20,000 pounds about two grand more

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.479 
below 20,000 pounds about two grand more
than<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.750> equivalent<00:03:04.049> Gulf<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.739> it<00:03:05.070> still<00:03:05.459> is

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
than the equivalent Gulf so it still is

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.970 
than the equivalent Gulf so it still is
a<00:03:05.850> little<00:03:05.880> bit<00:03:06.420> expensive<00:03:06.750> however<00:03:07.200> it<00:03:07.709> is

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
a little bit expensive however it is

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.180 
a little bit expensive however it is
also<00:03:08.340> now<00:03:08.579> 83<00:03:09.560> millimeters<00:03:10.560> longer<00:03:10.769> that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
also now 83 millimeters longer that

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.750

but what's taken me by surprise is the

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.720 
but what's taken me by surprise is the
fact<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.930> power<00:03:59.140> builds<00:03:59.920> really<00:04:00.520> nicely

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
when you put some revs on it as well so

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.790 
when you put some revs on it as well so
you<00:04:03.430> get<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.060> best<00:04:04.240> of<00:04:04.540> both<00:04:04.810> worlds<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
you get the best of both worlds of a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.690 
you get the best of both worlds of a
strong<00:04:06.630> Torquay<00:04:07.630> low<00:04:08.230> end<00:04:08.470> and<00:04:08.800> you<00:04:09.520> get<00:04:09.640> a

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
strong Torquay low end and you get a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.670 
strong Torquay low end and you get a
nice<00:04:09.940> revving<00:04:10.420> top-end<00:04:10.630> as<00:04:10.930> well<00:04:13.260> as<00:04:14.260> is<00:04:14.500> often

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
nice revving top-end as well as is often

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.160 
nice revving top-end as well as is often
the<00:04:14.800> case<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.190> BMWs<00:04:15.730> it's<00:04:16.060> incredibly<00:04:16.600> frugal

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
as well as being fast so it takes about

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.260 
as well as being fast so it takes about
seven<00:04:20.590> and<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.739> half<00:04:20.770> seconds<00:04:21.340> to<00:04:21.550> get
