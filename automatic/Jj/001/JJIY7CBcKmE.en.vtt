 better because cats can see in

 believe that cats use or angle

 sunlight or magnetized

 compass 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.870
 the cat's jaw cannot move in 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.070
 sides so the cat can't chew 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.070
 big chunks of food 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.580
 the back of the cat is extremely flexible

 180 degrees compared to the people 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:36.419
 There are only six such muscles. One of the reasons 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.030
 why do kittens sleep almost 18 hours a day 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:42.500
 is that only during sleep do 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:45.090

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.150
 only work when the temperature 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.610
