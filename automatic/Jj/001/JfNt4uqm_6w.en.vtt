00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
did to get the normal star the only

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.140 
did to get the normal star the only
difference<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:08.040> on<00:01:08.370> the<00:01:08.610> second<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.120> last

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
different in order to find the hidden

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.530 
different in order to find the hidden
star<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.920> than<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.760> exactly<00:01:15.300> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
star other than that it's exactly the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.700 
star other than that it's exactly the
same<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.990> before<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:17.900> can<00:01:18.900> tell<00:01:19.170> from<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.500> lines

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
same as before I can tell from the lines

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
same as before I can tell from the lines
on<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.100> ground<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.550> the<00:01:20.790> ghost<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.210> Luigi

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
on the ground that the ghost of Luigi

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.919 
on the ground that the ghost of Luigi
must<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.200> been<00:01:22.380> here

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
then I'll just move on to the next

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:49.810 
then I'll just move on to the next
planet<00:01:45.280> no<00:01:46.280> no<00:01:46.580> no<00:01:47.060> oh<00:01:47.450> whoops<00:01:48.200> my<00:01:49.160> mistake<00:01:49.400> I

planet no no no oh whoops my mistake I

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.030 
planet no no no oh whoops my mistake I
was<00:01:49.940> trying<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.330> spin<00:01:50.630> to<00:01:50.930> reach<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.380> star<00:01:51.710> not

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
was trying to spin to reach the star not

00:01:52.040 --> 00:02:01.090 
was trying to spin to reach the star not
spin<00:01:52.670> two<00:01:52.970> different<00:01:53.630> planet<00:02:00.100> again

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
spin two different planet again

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:13.830 
spin two different planet again
definitely<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.240> ghost<00:02:02.480> of<00:02:02.660> Luigi<00:02:03.050> was<00:02:03.380> here

direction right ahahaha it's here to get
the<00:02:47.440> hidden<00:02:47.709> star<00:02:48.360> instead<00:02:49.360> of<00:02:49.750> taking<00:02:50.290> the

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
the hidden star instead of taking the

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.620 
the hidden star instead of taking the
star<00:02:50.769> to<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.190> area<00:02:51.580> with<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.940> wiggler's<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
want to run around on this planet looks

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.930 
want to run around on this planet looks
like<00:02:59.019> the<00:02:59.170> ghost<00:02:59.410> of<00:02:59.560> Luigi<00:03:00.099> this<00:03:00.250> summer<00:03:00.549> here

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
like the ghost of Luigi this summer here

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.759 
like the ghost of Luigi this summer here
on<00:03:01.060> this<00:03:01.209> planet<00:03:04.080> will<00:03:05.080> notice<00:03:05.349> that<00:03:05.380> by

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
on this planet will notice that by

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.620 
on this planet will notice that by
running<00:03:06.010> around<00:03:06.430> on<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:07.000> planet<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.540> are

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
running around on the planet you are

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.589 
running around on the planet you are
making<00:03:07.870> a<00:03:08.080> bunch<00:03:08.319> of<00:03:08.440> flowers<00:03:08.769> appear<00:03:09.549> so<00:03:10.390> make

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
making a bunch of flowers appear so make

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.020 
making a bunch of flowers appear so make
flowers<00:03:11.079> appear<00:03:11.560> on<00:03:11.769> every<00:03:12.130> inch<00:03:12.670> of<00:03:12.880> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
flowers appear on every inch of the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.699 
flowers appear on every inch of the
planet<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:14.260> will<00:03:14.530> receive<00:03:14.739> a<00:03:16.709> hidden

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
planet and you will receive a hidden

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.140 
planet and you will receive a hidden
star<00:03:19.560> so<00:03:20.560> I<00:03:20.620> guess<00:03:20.709> that's<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.640> the<00:03:21.790> ghost<00:03:22.000> of

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
star so I guess that's what the ghost of

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.270 
star so I guess that's what the ghost of
