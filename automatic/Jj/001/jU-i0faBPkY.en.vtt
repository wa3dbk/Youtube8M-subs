and<00:01:52.720> I<00:01:52.810> began<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.140> think<00:01:53.440> what<00:01:54.040> if<00:01:54.160> I<00:01:54.280> couldn't

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
farther I thought what if no one could

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.800 
farther I thought what if no one could
ever<00:01:59.680> go<00:02:00.160> home<00:02:00.370> again

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
ever go home again

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200 
ever go home again
what<00:02:01.810> if<00:02:01.930> no<00:02:02.260> one<00:02:02.500> could<00:02:03.009> survive<00:02:03.250> below
