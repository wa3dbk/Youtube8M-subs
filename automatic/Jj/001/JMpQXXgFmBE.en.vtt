00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.480
 Ghent 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.369
 president 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 because you have 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.179
 but yes people around them you have to tell what the man is from 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.259
 rumors 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.119
 according to well-informed circles I can on Saturday May 16 in 2009 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.520
 the animal in the Indian neighborhood because then it is advisable to have an Indian neighborhood 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.590
 festival 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.590
 manage the timorplein but the street will be transformed into a bustling place 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.260
 festival site 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.560
 with among others 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.200
 what a shit 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.880

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.260
 a stage 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.590
 music and lyrics from the neighborhood 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 a children's village with clown smink and a cuddle corner also much more 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.710
 the stalls with homemade three points 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.220
 it remained a chess game 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.220
 the interplay is that blockade of the outdoor cinema 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.330
 so drinks music has many events to take part in 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.190
 a lot to mention on Saturday 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.400

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.720
 sustainable 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.230
 why 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.490
 lately there have been many fantastic neighborhoods none 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.790
 initiatives set up here in the neighborhood 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.580
 which all contribute in their own way to a second set 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.060
 Indian neighborhood 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.360
 it is precisely this project that is present on the cultural market 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.350
 can see in one fell swoop 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.770
 what a shame and creativity and talent is present in the neighborhood 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.620
