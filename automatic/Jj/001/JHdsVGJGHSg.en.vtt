out<00:00:17.670> but<00:00:18.660> but<00:00:19.439> really<00:00:19.680> -<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.310> not<00:00:20.520> very<00:00:20.820> easy

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
out but but really - it's not very easy

you<00:00:21.750> don't<00:00:21.840> have<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.080> lot<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.260> BC<00:00:22.650> build<00:00:22.859> options

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
bee suit build it's really hard to hold

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
bee suit build it's really hard to hold
that<00:00:53.370> choke<00:00:53.610> because<00:00:54.300> there's<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.629> creep

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that choke because there's just creep

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
along that wall there and I really can't

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.549 
along that wall there and I really can't
even<00:00:57.360> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.780> manage<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.050> seal<00:00:58.289> off<00:00:58.440> your

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
even if you do manage to seal off your

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.779 
even if you do manage to seal off your
choke<00:00:58.739> there's<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.190> secondary<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.670> can

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
choke there's not that secondary you can

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.740 
choke there's not that secondary you can
really<00:00:59.969> take<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.329> really<00:01:00.480> hard<00:01:00.629> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
really take so it's really hard on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.090 
really take so it's really hard on
Protoss<00:01:01.050> players<00:01:01.289> especially<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.739> certain<00:01:01.920> my

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
Protoss players especially in certain my

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.590 
Protoss players especially in certain my
opinion<00:01:02.399> looks<00:01:02.730> like<00:01:02.940> he<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.210> gonna<00:01:03.300> try<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
opinion looks like he is gonna try to

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.179 
opinion looks like he is gonna try to
seal<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.840> choke<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.589> again<00:01:04.769> I'm<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:04.979> sure

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
seal that choke but again I'm not sure

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.310 
seal that choke but again I'm not sure
maybe<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.360> just<00:01:06.570> confusing<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> layout<00:01:07.290> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
maybe I'm just confusing the layout of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.810 
maybe I'm just confusing the layout of
this<00:01:07.470> map<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.159> yeah<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> don't<00:01:08.460> think<00:01:08.670> there's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
this map but yeah I don't think there's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
this map but yeah I don't think there's
a<00:01:08.880> secondary<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.450> take<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.750> there<00:01:09.900> until

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
a secondary you can take in there until

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
a secondary you can take in there until
he<00:01:10.200> kills<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> creep<00:01:10.680> colonies<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.159> man

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
he kills the creep colonies and man

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.530 
he kills the creep colonies and man

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
time they show on a big crowd out there

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
time they show on a big crowd out there

and Pusan sending out a really early

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.580 
and Pusan sending out a really early
scout<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.630> he's<00:01:18.810> expecting<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.259> 9<00:01:19.409> pool

scout I think he's expecting a 9 pool
too<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.950> he<00:01:20.009> wants<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.280> double-check<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
too and he wants to double-check and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.280 
too and he wants to double-check and
make<00:01:20.880> sure<00:01:20.970> that's<00:01:21.180> not<00:01:21.390> quite<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.659> Quan<00:01:22.049> was

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

make sure that's not quite what Quan was
doing<00:01:22.880> keep<00:01:23.880> in<00:01:23.970> mind<00:01:24.240> NBC<00:01:24.750> hero<00:01:24.960> up<00:01:25.110> 1-0<00:01:25.680> and

honestly I just do not see Pusan coming
out<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.350> mean<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.650> not<00:01:28.740> saying<00:01:28.950> he's<00:01:29.100> a

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
out of this I mean I'm not saying he's a

bad<00:01:29.189> player<00:01:29.549> just<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.509> map<00:01:30.720> is<00:01:30.900> really

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
bad player just this map is really

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.870 
bad player just this map is really

favored towards Quan Rose type play I

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
favored towards Quan Rose type play I
really<00:01:33.299> think<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.840> was<00:01:33.900> intelligent<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> CJ

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
really think it was intelligent of CJ

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.539 
really think it was intelligent of CJ
entus<00:01:35.490> putting<00:01:36.119> Quan<00:01:36.299> roll<00:01:36.450> up<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.869> map

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
really strong player on this exact sort

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
really strong player on this exact sort
of<00:01:42.869> map<00:01:42.990> set<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.340> expect<00:01:44.640> some<00:01:44.790> sort

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
of map set and I really expect some sort

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.149 
of map set and I really expect some sort
of<00:01:45.000> link<00:01:45.210> building<00:01:45.299> out<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> scout<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.560> his<00:01:46.680> own

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
of link building out a scout of his own

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.149 
of link building out a scout of his own
I'm<00:01:47.430> gonna<00:01:47.549> send<00:01:47.820> how<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.060> drone<00:01:48.390> actually

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
I'm gonna send how to drone actually

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.380 
I'm gonna send how to drone actually
it's<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.430> early<00:01:50.549> drone<00:01:50.850> from<00:01:51.030> Quan<00:01:51.210> ROM

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's really early drone from Quan ROM

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's really early drone from Quan ROM
you<00:01:51.420> should<00:01:51.720> dissing<00:01:52.079> him<00:01:52.229> send<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.560> out<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you should dissing him send it out a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
you should dissing him send it out a
little<00:01:53.040> later<00:01:53.369> looks<00:01:54.090> like<00:01:54.149> he's<00:01:54.360> gonna<00:01:54.450> go

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
little later looks like he's gonna go

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929 
little later looks like he's gonna go
for<00:01:54.899> quick<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> hatchery<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> would<00:01:56.700> expect

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
for quick to hatchery but I would expect

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.100 
for quick to hatchery but I would expect
a<00:01:57.030> spawning<00:01:57.270> pool<00:01:57.390> shortly<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.020> then

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a spawning pool shortly and then

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.600 
a spawning pool shortly and then
probably<00:01:58.290> gas<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.950> well<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.280> probably<00:01:59.520> gonna

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
probably gas as well so probably gonna

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.399 
probably gas as well so probably gonna
blow<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.030> maybe<00:02:00.360> he's<00:02:00.570> gonna<00:02:00.659> go<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.110> proxy

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
blow up maybe he's gonna go for a proxy

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.410 
blow up maybe he's gonna go for a proxy
hatchet<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.009> he's<00:02:02.159> gonna<00:02:02.280> send<00:02:02.549> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
hatchet don't know he's gonna send that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.200 
hatchet don't know he's gonna send that
drone<00:02:03.719> into<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.049> base<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.880> might<00:02:06.030> end

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
drone into the base and I that might end

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.550 
drone into the base and I that might end
up<00:02:06.270> playing<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> factor<00:02:06.689> later<00:02:06.960> we'll<00:02:07.170> see<00:02:07.320> he's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
up playing a factor later we'll see he's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.660 
up playing a factor later we'll see he's
gonna<00:02:07.649> put<00:02:07.829> down<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.039> spawning<00:02:08.369> pool<00:02:08.489> yeah

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
gonna put down that spawning pool yeah

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.070 
gonna put down that spawning pool yeah
putting<00:02:09.239> down<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.420> spiny<00:02:09.599> pool<00:02:09.780> gonna<00:02:09.959> get

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
putting down the spiny pool gonna get

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.240 
putting down the spiny pool gonna get
the<00:02:10.170> gas<00:02:10.319> shortly<00:02:10.679> after

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the gas shortly after

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.580 
the gas shortly after
and<00:02:11.340> I<00:02:11.580> would<00:02:12.270> assume<00:02:12.360> just<00:02:12.750> flood<00:02:12.990> some<00:02:13.290> some

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
and I would assume just flood some some

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.810 
and I would assume just flood some some
units<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:13.920> it<00:02:13.980> looks<00:02:14.130> like<00:02:14.190> Busan<00:02:14.550> putting

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
units and it looks like Busan putting

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.640 
units and it looks like Busan putting
down<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> gate<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.930> cybernetics<00:02:16.440> core

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
down a gate and a cybernetics core

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.530 
down a gate and a cybernetics core
interesting<00:02:17.160> play<00:02:17.310> from<00:02:17.490> him<00:02:17.730> dragons<00:02:18.270> aren't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
interesting play from him dragons aren't

he's<00:02:35.760> trying<00:02:35.790> to<00:02:36.000> do<00:02:36.090> is<00:02:36.180> he's<00:02:36.300> gonna<00:02:36.420> try<00:02:36.660> to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
he's trying to do is he's gonna try to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.420 
he's trying to do is he's gonna try to
get<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.440> drone<00:02:37.620> on<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.830> other<00:02:37.950> side<00:02:38.160> keep<00:02:38.310> in

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
get that drone on the other side keep in

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.940 
get that drone on the other side keep in
mind<00:02:38.580> that<00:02:38.640> could<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.880> an<00:02:38.970> x-factor<00:02:39.240> here<00:02:39.950> if

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
mind that could be an x-factor here if

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.590 
mind that could be an x-factor here if
you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.310> get<00:02:41.460> basically<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.060> dragoon<00:02:42.330> on<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
you can get basically a dragoon on the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.900 
you can get basically a dragoon on the
other<00:02:42.750> side<00:02:42.990> after<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.070> works<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.490> he<00:02:44.640> I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
other side after that that works in he I

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.430 
other side after that that works in he I
think<00:02:45.060> what<00:02:45.180> he's<00:02:45.270> hoping<00:02:45.390> is<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> block<00:02:46.260> that

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
think what he's hoping is to block that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.960 
think what he's hoping is to block that
front<00:02:46.680> door<00:02:46.800> maybe<00:02:47.070> with<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.280> prober<00:02:47.640> zealot

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
front door maybe with the prober zealot

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.010 
front door maybe with the prober zealot
and<00:02:48.120> then<00:02:48.209> just<00:02:48.420> kind<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.600> pick<00:02:48.780> off<00:02:48.900> the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and then just kind of pick off the

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.990 
and then just kind of pick off the
Ling's<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:50.010> your<00:02:50.160> goons<00:02:50.340> from<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.610> from<00:02:50.910> the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
Ling's with your goons from the from the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.370 
Ling's with your goons from the from the
back<00:02:51.090> side<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.570> try<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.810> tech<00:02:52.080> up<00:02:52.230> from

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
back side and then try to tech up from

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.620 
back side and then try to tech up from
there<00:02:52.730> I'm<00:02:53.730> not<00:02:53.910> sure<00:02:53.970> if<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.240> gonna<00:02:54.420> work

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
there I'm not sure if that's gonna work

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.670 
there I'm not sure if that's gonna work
because<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:54.959> think<00:02:55.020> there's<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.350> lot<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.530> things

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
because I think there's a lot of things

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.870 
because I think there's a lot of things
that<00:02:55.800> Cointreau<00:02:56.040> can<00:02:56.190> do<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.370> take<00:02:56.520> that<00:02:56.700> down

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
that Cointreau can do to take that down

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.460 
that Cointreau can do to take that down
a<00:02:57.090> little<00:02:57.450> bit<00:02:57.720> of<00:02:57.810> Rassman<00:02:58.140> going<00:02:58.290> here<00:02:58.440> now

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
a little bit of Rassman going here now

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.600 
a little bit of Rassman going here now
as<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.800> can<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:58.950> the<00:02:59.070> desert<00:02:59.280> that's<00:02:59.430> being

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
as you can see the desert that's being

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.699 
as you can see the desert that's being
produced<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.959> drones<00:03:01.230> still<00:03:01.470> hanging

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
produced and that drones still hanging

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.290 
produced and that drones still hanging
out<00:03:01.740> in<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:01.890> back<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.100> maybe<00:03:02.850> he's<00:03:03.000> gonna<00:03:03.120> try

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.550 
out in the back and maybe he's gonna try
to<00:03:03.330> block<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.630> probes<00:03:03.840> from<00:03:04.020> coming<00:03:04.260> up<00:03:04.380> maybe

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
to block the probes from coming up maybe

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.320 
to block the probes from coming up maybe
he'll<00:03:04.680> put<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> hatchery<00:03:05.370> down<00:03:05.640> just<00:03:06.209> to

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
he'll put a hatchery down just to

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.090 
he'll put a hatchery down just to
distract<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.320> looks<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.530> yeah<00:03:07.800> Quan<00:03:08.070> oh

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
up and put down a creek Colony this is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.380 
up and put down a creek Colony this is
brilliant<00:03:29.430> from<00:03:29.670> Quan<00:03:29.880> Oh<00:03:30.000> first<00:03:30.209> of<00:03:30.300> all

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
brilliant from Quan Oh first of all

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.670 
brilliant from Quan Oh first of all
that's<00:03:30.480> gonna<00:03:30.660> distract<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.080> Dragoon<00:03:31.410> so<00:03:31.560> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that's gonna distract that Dragoon so it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.050 
that's gonna distract that Dragoon so it
can't<00:03:31.830> really<00:03:32.010> defend<00:03:32.220> the<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.700> front<00:03:32.940> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
can't really defend the the front and

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.580 
can't really defend the the front and
the<00:03:33.120> second<00:03:33.360> drone<00:03:33.480> coming<00:03:33.660> up<00:03:33.840> for<00:03:34.350> Quan<00:03:34.500> oh

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
the second drone coming up for Quan oh

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.780 
the second drone coming up for Quan oh
so<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.769> looks<00:03:34.890> like<00:03:34.920> what<00:03:35.220> Quan<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.519> gonna<00:03:35.700> do

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
so it looks like what Quan was gonna do

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:36.979 
so it looks like what Quan was gonna do
is<00:03:35.910> he's<00:03:36.060> gonna<00:03:36.150> use<00:03:36.390> that<00:03:36.540> creep<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.750> his

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
is he's gonna use that creep to his

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.840 
is he's gonna use that creep to his
advantage<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.530> forge<00:03:37.980> going<00:03:38.280> down<00:03:38.400> for<00:03:38.580> Pusan

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
I think this fight has already lost for

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.900 
I think this fight has already lost for
Pusan<00:03:56.130> I'm<00:03:56.250> not<00:03:56.370> sure<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.610> this<00:03:56.700> really

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
Pusan I'm not sure that this really

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.970 
Pusan I'm not sure that this really
anything<00:03:57.180> can<00:03:57.480> do<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.380> yeah<00:03:58.500> trying<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.830> get<00:03:58.920> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
anything can do and yeah trying to get a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.259 
anything can do and yeah trying to get a
cannon<00:03:59.310> but<00:03:59.400> I<00:03:59.459> don't<00:03:59.640> think<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.910> cannon<00:04:00.180> can

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
cannon but I don't think that cannon can

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.490 
cannon but I don't think that cannon can
range<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.600> sudden<00:04:00.840> colony<00:04:01.080> first<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.410> all

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
range that sudden colony first of all

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.979 
range that sudden colony first of all
even<00:04:02.250> if<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.459> could<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.910> think<00:04:03.269> that<00:04:03.450> cannon<00:04:03.870> can

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
even if it could I think that cannon can

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.050 
even if it could I think that cannon can
easily<00:04:04.489> basically<00:04:05.489> you<00:04:05.580> can<00:04:05.700> put<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:05.910> couple

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
easily basically you can put a couple

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.100 
easily basically you can put a couple
certainties<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.510> to<00:04:06.660> take<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.840> couple<00:04:07.019> shots

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
certainties in to take a couple shots

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.990 
certainties in to take a couple shots
