00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.639
 hello and welcome where matra 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.360
 here and today we are with one 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.720
 small round 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.150
 i want to call this series free elo and 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 depending on which patch the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.900
 I just want to get a series 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 make a follow 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.760
 and I will say what because in 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 This patch is I'll be one 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.210
 thing out take me especially 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.529
 really only noticeable to me 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.650
 are arguing about something else 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.480
 in the patch is still grandpa or more 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 But I 'll fix a thing 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.330
 take out the opinion of me in the opinion 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.009
 I am best 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.770
 I wanted so I want today 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.200
 start with the blue motion like that 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 I call them definitely and that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.690
 there had been Luzhin mitgekriegt 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 to be changed was increased slightly 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.379
 His marriage was so changed that she 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.629
 now cooldown brings when you enter 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 champion attacks and his range became 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.890
 annoyed now has everyone at the beginning 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 thought the range nerve kills 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.149
 usually one caravan one 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.329
 which is taken normally range 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.730
 the death and he will never be played again 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.860
 with lucien but he has so much mobility 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.799
 get some gameplay 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 I've really taken the guess there 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.830
 I just sit down wright with it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.420
 thought good I was fed too but 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.850
 that would have no other fed ag 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 Carey gets lauren 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
 Still pretty strong, of course 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 a wayne with the same items would have it 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.759
 And she does not get it that way either 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.880
 been strong 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.430
 the items you see here now and that 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.780
 start willingly or catch her better 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.380
 to build with a cent robber 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.579
 then you build the jus the shoes can 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 you push her in whenever you have enough 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:39.299
 money there after Yunus builds her sword 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.220
 of the fallen king then a last 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.750
 or any other offensive item 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.360
 I like Atlas football well 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.299
 also use in many ways and afterwards 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.250
 guardian angel or as a defensive one 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.630
 old what suits you the kudamm 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.399
 well but this is very crucial 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.290
 and there is already gameplay on 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.360
 we are already in the gameplay 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.590
 in it and it starts very harmless 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.600
 I would like to support everyone 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.520
 recommend this champion as a support 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 seen together their elia you see them 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.329
 does not start making me try this 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.039
 then not come away now 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.599
 from the side I think again 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.190
 That was me on the time now 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.170
 the carling intervenes to kill him 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.780
 then I see this also hit the 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.000
 so I just seems faster the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 same again two more times on I 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.900
 that again to the side out 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.240
 maybe even twice cash out 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.010
 I do not know their animal I do not think so 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.930
 I will make a counter-turn 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.430
 then you can see how many times I've ish desh 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.590
 I do not cost that again at 2 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.070
 or text that is not me again 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.020
 only on the whole time or one 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.150
 flit back and forth I do not know how 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.410
 in German we mean in any case 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.640
 There are five people here 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.000
 taken apart only with names 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.420
 lucien and the fis and it 's easy 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.730
 crazy is just madness of damage 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.810
 therefore I will still say and will 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.090
 not really that 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.370
 but more mobility comes from 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.170
 jack or with shares of the sense predator 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.460
 gives you contacts de saint cyr is 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.350
 now a better pluta 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.570
 he gives everything that the dot oster gives 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.070
 only more and costs less than this 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.430
 shield does not need a human 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.980
 to be honest and that's why the 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.690
 collection then the collection rage the 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.290
 brutalization is also coal again 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.200
 editorial staff 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.640
 so it's really crazy what to do with 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.150
 Everything can be done in this picture 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.450
 That's my picture of the day, so to speak 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.000
 or my keyboard I'll give you one 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.480
 would lay set if you want Frieler 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.360
 so said play or just practice it 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.760
 and then it plays and then wins 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.190
 just then it is incredibly strong 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.239
 so much for this little format me 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.800
 hope you liked it 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.120
 and if you liked it then 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.530
 I'll make more of it 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.530
 See you again and see you next time
