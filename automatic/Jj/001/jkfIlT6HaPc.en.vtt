 May new here is everyone can still do this 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.240
 a little child spotlight at and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:15.110
 go on the ice and you see so 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.110
 from motion 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.110
 and brings 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.930
 and now I'll show you how it works 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.850
 Looks like the action is all one 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:47.030

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.949
 glows blue makes a bit blue 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.589
 the fists shining blue when you see the 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:59.440
 bach tough game away you see now 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:06.259
 and a little police siren if you want 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.630
 if you have the multi user 102 you have one 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:18.679
 Although not so well seen but that can 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:25.810
 you order us three times 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:29.210
 war of myspace from the gps agree and 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:32.690
 what I show before , I have nation 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.159
 So you had shown a clipboard 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.740
 Describe where to get the passive one 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.270
 is activated and where you directly 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.270
 if only for purely knipst times briefly 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 to open 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.100
 that from what I want to show 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.799
 is currently on tour and someday 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.539
 you can not change anything 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.710
 probably next soon 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:08.840
 buy the liveserver and just have a look 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.819

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.819
