reason that i do this is that so i can

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.529 
reason that i do this is that so i can
run<00:00:52.199> my<00:00:52.350> metal<00:00:52.590> halide<00:00:52.949> with<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.940> leds<00:00:54.300> which

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
run my metal halide with the leds which

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.220 
run my metal halide with the leds which
is<00:00:54.690> pretty<00:00:54.809> awesome<00:00:56.539> the<00:00:57.539> light<00:00:57.719> output<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
is pretty awesome the light output that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.229 
is pretty awesome the light output that
you<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.500> one<00:00:58.800> of<00:00:58.920> them<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.309> not<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
you get from one of them is not that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.640

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
because my this pot I had it hung from

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:11.850 
because my this pot I had it hung from
the<00:02:10.830> ceiling<00:02:10.920> which

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
the ceiling which

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.820 
the ceiling which
probably<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.460> do<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.650> there's<00:02:14.650> already

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
probably going to do and there's already

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.560 
probably going to do and there's already
sands<00:02:15.550> built<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:16.030> there<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.330> kind<00:02:16.510> of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
sands built in there and that kind of

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.890 
sands built in there and that kind of
stuff<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.920> I'm<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.280> to<00:02:18.310> kill<00:02:18.490> these<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
stuff so I'm going to kill these and

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.340 
stuff so I'm going to kill these and
we'll<00:02:20.080> watch<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.410> metal<00:02:20.620> halide<00:02:20.920> warm<00:02:21.190> up<00:02:25.350> and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we'll watch the metal halide warm up and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.930 
we'll watch the metal halide warm up and
then<00:02:26.410> we'll<00:02:26.920> start<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.250> bring<00:02:27.460> into<00:02:27.670> eCos

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
then we'll start to bring into eCos

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.490 
then we'll start to bring into eCos
attics<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> see<00:02:28.870> I<00:02:29.110> have<00:02:29.170> what<00:02:29.380> they

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
attics and you can see I have what they

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.030 
attics and you can see I have what they
both<00:02:29.680> look<00:02:29.860> like<00:02:30.010> together<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.680> mean<00:02:32.830> as<00:02:32.950> you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
both look like together so I mean as you

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.440 
both look like together so I mean as you
can<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.340> warming<00:02:33.910> up<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.150> metal

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
can see just warming up this metal

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.720 
can see just warming up this metal
halide<00:02:34.750> is<00:02:34.930> like<00:02:35.140> brighter<00:02:35.670> than<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
halide is like brighter than the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.090 
halide is like brighter than the
panoramas<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:38.410> it's<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.830> a<00:02:38.920> tough

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
panoramas so it's kind of a tough

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.100 
panoramas so it's kind of a tough
transition<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.730> me<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.180> from<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.630> modal

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
transition for me going from the modal

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.540 
transition for me going from the modal
highlights<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.590> panorama<00:02:42.040> but<00:02:42.910> i<00:02:44.220> do<00:02:45.220> like

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
highlights the panorama but i do like

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.460 
highlights the panorama but i do like
using<00:02:45.820> both<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.270> them<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.050> it's<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.260> going<00:02:47.410> to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
using both of them so it's just going to

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.380 
using both of them so it's just going to
be<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:48.090> whole<00:02:49.090> system<00:02:49.570> of<00:02:49.810> finding<00:02:50.230> out<00:02:50.320> I<00:02:51.390> had

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
be a whole system of finding out I had

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.699 
be a whole system of finding out I had
to<00:02:52.480> get<00:02:52.600> the<00:02:52.690> timers<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.140> the<00:02:53.230> controllers

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
to get the timers and the controllers

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.110 
to get the timers and the controllers
and<00:02:53.890> everybody<00:02:54.190> working<00:02:54.520> happy<00:02:54.790> together<00:02:54.910> I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
know I got to buy some splitters and all

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.699 
know I got to buy some splitters and all
that<00:02:56.650> kind<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.920> stuff<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.810> tell<00:02:59.560> you<00:02:59.590> I

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
know white retrosternal isn't cheap but

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.530 
know white retrosternal isn't cheap but
everybody's<00:03:04.690> loving<00:03:04.900> it<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.270> you<00:03:07.270> know<00:03:07.390> it's

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
everybody's loving it so you know it's

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.660 
everybody's loving it so you know it's
cool<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.440> this<00:03:08.620> is<00:03:08.650> pretty<00:03:09.160> much<00:03:09.280> what<00:03:09.430> the

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
cool so this is pretty much what the

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.400 
cool so this is pretty much what the
metal<00:03:09.910> halide<00:03:10.180> looks<00:03:10.420> like<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.900> think<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.350> a

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
metal halide looks like I think it's a

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.130 
metal halide looks like I think it's a
14k<00:03:11.980> normally<00:03:12.730> when<00:03:12.850> i<00:03:12.910> run<00:03:13.120> this<00:03:13.300> i<00:03:13.600> will<00:03:13.959> only

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
14k normally when i run this i will only

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.009 
14k normally when i run this i will only
bring<00:03:14.470> in<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.709> blues<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:16.600> because<00:03:16.840> i<00:03:16.870> think

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
bring in the blues just because i think

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.440 
bring in the blues just because i think
it<00:03:17.260> looks<00:03:17.410> cooler<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.890> way<00:03:18.100> i<00:03:18.360> start<00:03:19.360> to

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
it looks cooler that way i start to

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.390 
it looks cooler that way i start to
bring<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.840> whites<00:03:20.049> tenses<00:03:21.040> look<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.280> little

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
bring in the whites tenses look a little

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.320 
bring in the whites tenses look a little
bit<00:03:21.549> saturated<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:26.880> as<00:03:27.880> opposed<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.269> the

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
bit saturated but as opposed to the

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.610 
bit saturated but as opposed to the
beginning<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.780> video<00:03:29.019> you<00:03:29.049> can<00:03:29.230> tell<00:03:29.440> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
beginning of the video you can tell that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.289 
beginning of the video you can tell that
the<00:03:29.709> anemones<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.130> stuff<00:03:30.489> are<00:03:30.640> getting<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:31.030> lot

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299

more<00:03:31.360> light<00:03:31.870> with<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.170> halide<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.600> i'll

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
more light with the halide on so i'll

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.699 
more light with the halide on so i'll
keep<00:03:34.720> you<00:03:34.840> guys<00:03:34.959> posted<00:03:35.019> i'll<00:03:35.470> make<00:03:35.590> another

fixture<00:03:50.440> there<00:03:50.680> was<00:03:50.769> very<00:03:50.980> limited<00:03:51.190> resources

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
fixture there was very limited resources

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.820
