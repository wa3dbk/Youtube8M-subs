00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
where there's a road it costs to

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.639 
where there's a road it costs to
movement<00:00:43.179> to<00:00:43.570> move<00:00:43.719> where<00:00:43.899> there<00:00:44.050> is<00:00:44.199> no<00:00:44.410> road

movement to move where there is no road

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.060 
movement to move where there is no road
if<00:00:44.829> you<00:00:45.609> move<00:00:45.820> across<00:00:46.390> an<00:00:46.929> opponent's<00:00:47.530> road<00:00:47.769> it

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
costs one goal that you pay to that

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.829 
costs one goal that you pay to that
player<00:00:50.649> if<00:00:51.609> you're<00:00:51.969> moving<00:00:52.329> where<00:00:52.539> there's<00:00:52.749> a

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
player if you're moving where there's a

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.660 
player if you're moving where there's a
barbarian<00:00:53.350> there's<00:00:53.769> three<00:00:53.980> barbarians<00:00:54.550> on

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
barbarian there's three barbarians on

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.750 
barbarian there's three barbarians on
the<00:00:54.789> board<00:00:54.999> it<00:00:55.359> costs<00:00:56.140> plus<00:00:56.499> two<00:00:57.010> extra

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
the board it costs plus two extra

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.149 
the board it costs plus two extra
movement<00:00:58.210> points<00:00:58.570> so<00:00:59.140> in<00:00:59.469> this<00:00:59.649> case<00:00:59.859> it<00:01:00.070> would

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
movement points so in this case it would

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.880 
movement points so in this case it would
cost<00:01:00.429> a<00:01:00.579> total<00:01:00.909> of<00:01:00.969> three<00:01:01.359> so<00:01:02.230> what<00:01:02.379> happens<00:01:02.710> is

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
cost a total of three so what happens is

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.880 
cost a total of three so what happens is
when<00:01:03.249> you<00:01:03.399> move<00:01:04.120> from<00:01:04.180> here<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:05.230> the<00:01:05.379> middle<00:01:05.620> of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
when you move from here to the middle of

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.070 
when you move from here to the middle of
one<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.130> these<00:01:06.280> trade<00:01:06.610> hexes<00:01:07.060> as<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.840> can<00:01:07.960> see

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
one of these trade hexes as you can see

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.840 
one of these trade hexes as you can see
you<00:01:08.170> can<00:01:08.320> also<00:01:08.409> build<00:01:08.680> roads<00:01:09.040> going<00:01:09.340> into<00:01:09.729> the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
you can also build roads going into the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.510 
you can also build roads going into the
straight<00:01:10.000> X<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.630> draw<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.869> top<00:01:11.200> tile<00:01:12.040> in<00:01:12.369> the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
straight X you draw the top tile in the

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.639 
straight X you draw the top tile in the
stack<00:01:12.790> there<00:01:13.090> these<00:01:13.630> are<00:01:13.840> called<00:01:14.020> commodities

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
stack there these are called commodities

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.530 
stack there these are called commodities
so<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.340> look<00:01:15.610> at<00:01:15.729> what's<00:01:15.909> a<00:01:15.970> picture<00:01:16.299> there

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
so you look at what's a picture there

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.300 
so you look at what's a picture there
and<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.840> try<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.079> find<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.680> picture<00:01:18.040> on<00:01:18.130> one

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
and you try to find that picture on one

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.580 
and you try to find that picture on one
of<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> other<00:01:18.670> two<00:01:18.909> trade<00:01:19.149> axes<00:01:19.540> so<00:01:20.320> when<00:01:20.500> you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
of the other two trade axes so when you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.410 
of the other two trade axes so when you
find<00:01:20.829> that<00:01:20.950> picture<00:01:21.189> that's<00:01:21.969> where<00:01:22.180> you<00:01:22.270> need

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
find that picture that's where you need

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.410 
find that picture that's where you need
to<00:01:22.479> deliver<00:01:22.960> your<00:01:23.170> commodity<00:01:23.500> to<00:01:23.950> so<00:01:24.880> you'll

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
to deliver your commodity to so you'll

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.359 
to deliver your commodity to so you'll
move<00:01:25.630> your<00:01:25.689> wagon<00:01:26.530> trader<00:01:26.770> when<00:01:27.009> you<00:01:27.130> get

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
move your wagon trader when you get

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.999 
move your wagon trader when you get
there<00:01:27.610> you<00:01:28.240> make<00:01:28.450> your<00:01:28.630> delivery<00:01:28.840> and<00:01:29.350> then

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
there you make your delivery and then

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.330 
there you make your delivery and then
you<00:01:30.159> pick<00:01:30.399> up<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.850> new<00:01:31.659> commodity<00:01:31.960> token<00:01:32.590> look

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
you pick up a new commodity token look

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.340 
you pick up a new commodity token look
at<00:01:33.460> that<00:01:33.640> picture<00:01:33.880> find<00:01:34.780> out<00:01:34.930> where<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.170> have

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.319 
at that picture find out where you have
to<00:01:35.500> deliver<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.189> and<00:01:36.880> then<00:01:37.030> you'll<00:01:37.180> give

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
to deliver it to and then you'll give

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:39.120 
to deliver it to and then you'll give
your<00:01:37.509> wagon<00:01:37.899> train<00:01:38.140> there<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:38.680> then<00:01:38.799> you<00:01:38.920> pick

your wagon train there and then you pick
up<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.369> new<00:01:39.490> commodity<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.180> so<00:01:40.570> you<00:01:40.630> repeat

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
up a new commodity and so you repeat

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.770 
up a new commodity and so you repeat
that<00:01:41.380> process<00:01:41.590> for<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.130> rest<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:42.460> game<00:01:42.780> so

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
that process for the rest of the game so

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.660 
that process for the rest of the game so
what<00:01:43.930> does<00:01:44.049> this<00:01:44.140> do<00:01:44.350> for<00:01:44.380> you<00:01:44.619> well<00:01:45.460> each

what does this do for you well each

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.700 
what does this do for you well each
delivery<00:01:46.270> you<00:01:46.450> make<00:01:46.630> each<00:01:47.079> one<00:01:47.140> of<00:01:47.439> these<00:01:47.530> will

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
delivery you make each one of these will
