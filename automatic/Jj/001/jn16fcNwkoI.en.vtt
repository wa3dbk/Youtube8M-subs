00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
favored last time around and actually

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.229 
favored last time around and actually
looks<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.190> team<00:00:44.520> eyes<00:00:44.700> are<00:00:44.910> going<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
looks like team eyes are going for the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.139 
looks like team eyes are going for the
double<00:00:45.570> 8d<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> big<00:00:47.430> strategy<00:00:48.000> by

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
double 8d so this is a big strategy by

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.610 
double 8d so this is a big strategy by
both<00:00:48.390> teams<00:00:48.600> obviously<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> range<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.440> bands

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
both teams obviously the range of bands

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.590 
both teams obviously the range of bands
between<00:00:49.770> eyes<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.309> there's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.730> big<00:00:51.030> kill<00:00:51.360> Lane

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
between eyes but there's a big kill Lane

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.720 
between eyes but there's a big kill Lane
in<00:00:51.870> any<00:00:52.079> brand<00:00:52.379> yeah<00:00:52.829> it's<00:00:53.100> gonna<00:00:53.250> be<00:00:53.430> fire

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
in any brand yeah it's gonna be fire

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.439 
in any brand yeah it's gonna be fire
versus<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.510> guess<00:00:54.690> purple<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> solo<00:00:56.300> if<00:00:57.300> we

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
versus I guess purple and solo if we

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.529 
versus I guess purple and solo if we
want<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.719> stretch<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.640> fire<00:01:00.149> lane

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
want to stretch it but this fire lane

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.630 
want to stretch it but this fire lane
actually<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> believe<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:01.980> used<00:01:02.370> in

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
actually I believe it was used in

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.479 
actually I believe it was used in
competitive<00:01:03.120> play<00:01:03.149> in<00:01:03.600> Korea<00:01:04.339> money<00:01:05.339> will

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
competitive play in Korea money will

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.320 
competitive play in Korea money will
correct<00:01:05.700> me<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.850> I'm<00:01:05.939> wrong<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:06.240> think

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
correct me if I'm wrong but I think

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.859 
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
frost<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.200> kt<00:01:08.159> rolster<00:01:08.400> used<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> actually

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
frost and kt rolster used it actually

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.820 
frost and kt rolster used it actually
and<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.060> teams<00:01:12.270> won<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:13.020> think

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
and one of the teams won with it I think

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.830 
and one of the teams won with it I think
it<00:01:13.890> was<00:01:14.010> rolster<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.580> one<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.600> great

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
it was rolster that one so the great

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.770 
it was rolster that one so the great
thing<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.470> course<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.979> you've<00:01:17.130> got

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
thing is of course that you've got

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.600 
thing is of course that you've got
masses<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.960> stone<00:01:19.320> going<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.920> there<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.280> some

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
masses of stone going in there and some

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
masses of stone going in there and some
really<00:01:21.240> focused<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> was<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.320> specially<00:01:22.680> when

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
really focused I was just specially when

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.440 
really focused I was just specially when
he<00:01:22.890> gets<00:01:23.070> level<00:01:23.400> six<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.820> back

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
he gets level six and back

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.910 
he gets level six and back
okay<00:01:24.780> game<00:01:24.990> number<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.380> shoulders<00:01:25.770> that

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
okay game number one shoulders that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.710 
okay game number one shoulders that
maybe<00:01:26.159> we're<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.000> too<00:01:27.180> much<00:01:27.330> level

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
maybe we're not gonna see too much level

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.780 
maybe we're not gonna see too much level
six<00:01:27.960> playing<00:01:28.229> these<00:01:28.350> games<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:29.220> second<00:01:29.640> one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
six playing these games the second one

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.940 
six playing these games the second one
said<00:01:30.119> okay<00:01:30.810> we've<00:01:30.990> probably<00:01:31.229> argued<00:01:31.680> us<00:01:31.740> and

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
said okay we've probably argued us and

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.859 
said okay we've probably argued us and
thinking<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> 2v2<00:01:32.700> when<00:01:33.360> you<00:01:33.450> have<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> get

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
thinking the 2v2 when you have to get

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.810 
thinking the 2v2 when you have to get
two<00:01:34.140> kills<00:01:34.500> rather<00:01:34.860> than<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.610> but

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
two kills rather than just the one but

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.460 
two kills rather than just the one but
he<00:01:36.150> could<00:01:36.360> last<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:36.810> bit<00:01:36.900> longer<00:01:36.990> on

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
he could last a little bit longer on

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.200 
he could last a little bit longer on
that<00:01:37.650> yeah<00:01:38.130> good<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.640> doesn't<00:01:39.090> matter

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
that yeah good and it doesn't matter

Pete<00:06:13.400> says<00:06:13.610> it's<00:06:13.820> time<00:06:13.970> to<00:06:14.210> double<00:06:14.690> it<00:06:14.840> don't

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 
Pete says it's time to double it don't

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
follow it through it's gonna say how it

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.040 
follow it through it's gonna say how it
is<00:06:18.350> obviously<00:06:18.770> risky<00:06:19.190> to<00:06:19.370> flash<00:06:20.330> Don<00:06:20.690> in<00:06:20.840> there

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
is obviously risky to flash Don in there

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.840 
is obviously risky to flash Don in there
from<00:06:21.230> Buicks<00:06:21.560> inside<00:06:21.980> but<00:06:22.190> would<00:06:22.460> that<00:06:22.490> be

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
from Buicks inside but would that be

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.750 
from Buicks inside but would that be
worth<00:06:23.750> it<00:06:24.110> would<00:06:24.440> they<00:06:24.740> go<00:06:25.040> for<00:06:25.310> that<00:06:25.340> one<00:06:25.520> here

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:25.760 
worth it would they go for that one here

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.000 
worth it would they go for that one here
what<00:06:25.850> they'd<00:06:26.000> a<00:06:26.300> go<00:06:26.540> for<00:06:26.750> something<00:06:26.930> that<00:06:27.110> it

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.010 
what they'd a go for something that it

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.500 
what they'd a go for something that it
absolutely<00:06:28.820> would<00:06:29.030> be<00:06:29.180> worth<00:06:29.330> it<00:06:29.450> because

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
absolutely would be worth it because

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.570 
absolutely would be worth it because
they<00:06:29.720> only<00:06:29.930> need<00:06:30.290> single<00:06:30.710> target<00:06:31.160> damage<00:06:31.190> they
