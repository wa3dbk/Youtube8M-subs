00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 good 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:12.960
 [Music] 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:17.090
 hi how are you in this video I'm going to 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.370
 teach to be the English point 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 It is a shop stitch 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.100
 what is one of my favorites for 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.340
 scarves especially let's see how it 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.800
 do here I already have my points mounted 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.080
 I have another video on how to ride points 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.110
 so if you do not know how to do it 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.300
 look for it and there he taught them how 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.550
 I already have them mounted here 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:49.360
 I'm going to start knitting the first round 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:52.990
 I'm going to knit a point of right 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.110
 a point of setback and this I'm going to 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:59.920
 repeat a right 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.920
 a reverse 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.920
 a right 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.340
 with a backhand 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.710
 I will repeat the entire back my 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.479
 first turn is exactly as if 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.170
 out to knit 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.000
 elastic one by one 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.980
 when they see the elastic one by one 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.420
 it means that it is 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:27.610
 one right and one reverse serve two by one 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.460
 between these rights a setback 10 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.770
 well I'm going to do the first round 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.940
 I'm going to weave it like this from my 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:40.510
 second round what I'm going to do 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.680
 if my first point I stay right 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.680
 the normal yew 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 a normal right of times always 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.780
 I'm going to knit them normal my backhand 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.080
 the normal yew now the points of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 right they follow instead of weaving the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:05.880
 as well as the comfortable knit 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:09.090
 I will usually knit them by the 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.160
 the point below see how I am 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.560
 going to the row below 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.130
 and I take it out 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.600
 the reverse 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.660
 the normal yew 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.100
 and the rights instead of weaving the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.960
 here I am going to nail you to the point of 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.740
 down see how I'm going to nail down 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.120
 down this was 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.530
 and I leave them permanent 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.480
 and a reverse 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.480
 right down 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.640
 It is normal 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.590
 down the row below 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.600
 here you can see it really how I am 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.600
 taking not from here 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.450
 from here 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.480
 with my point 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.989
 and normal reverse 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 in fact 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.790
 and I finish with my backhand that I have it 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.720
 normal 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.210
 let's let go 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.000
 and maybe now you can not see it 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.990
 ok but what this stitch does is 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.990
 that the rights remain very are very 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.990
 highlighted 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.660
 It looks very pretty right now I show you a 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.720
 garment already 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.180
 it's more advanced let's see again my 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.240
 points of the shore the normal yew this 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:47.610
 it's right the normal yew 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:50.280
 to my normal setback and my equal right in 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:53.790
 instead of protecting by acting as the 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.950
 I usually go to the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.569
 row below 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.350
 the bottom turn 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.310
 Look is normal 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:04.310
 and my right 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.730
 the previous round 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.680
 It is normal 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.680
 German law 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.000
 under 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.360
 It is normal 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.900
 the right below 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.090
 other times equal 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.530
 and right down 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.530
 I finish with a backhand 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.800
 If you look at how the rights are very 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:49.040
 highlighted like this is a stitch that 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.510
 it looks exactly the same 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.660
 and back 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.830
 I wanted to go ahead because of that I love 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.830
 for scarves 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.540
 I'm going to show you here one that 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.540
 I'm doing 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:10.459
 that is already more advanced this I am 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:15.330
 doing with double stamen 

00:05:10.459 --> 00:05:17.929
 the needles seems to tell you I do not 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.149
 agreement if 10 millimeters or 12 millimeters 

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:24.230
 this the thicker the needles and 

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:26.639
 thicker the stamen looks much more 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.280
 see that the world looks 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:31.469
 so they will be treated not 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.259
 make mistakes when they are doing 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:38.440
 pointed because it is difficult to recover the 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:40.780
 points then put on scuba divers 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.860
 do not go to make mistakes see how 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.969
 behind 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.969
 which is exactly the same 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.789
 and well this is an idea can combine 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:53.030
 two stamens and here I am combining a 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:55.780
 thick oxford gray yarn with a 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.740
 wool yarn also more thin 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.740
 that is changing color 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:05.840
 test that comes in colors 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:08.030
 it's not like I'm going to get 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.490
 his little flecks are missing , I know I 'm going 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.130
 to put 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:14.849
 Well, that's what your 

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:18.439
 English point the true English point 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.559
