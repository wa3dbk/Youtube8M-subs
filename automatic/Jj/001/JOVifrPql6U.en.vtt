00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
hi guys today I'm gonna talk to you

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.140 
hi guys today I'm gonna talk to you
about<00:00:02.580> this<00:00:03.179> lovely<00:00:03.780> yellow<00:00:04.319> oncidium<00:00:05.150> which

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
about this lovely yellow oncidium which

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.530 
about this lovely yellow oncidium which
I<00:00:06.359> believe<00:00:06.750> it's<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:08.069> sweet<00:00:08.340> sweet<00:00:09.059> sugar

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I believe it's the sweet sweet sugar

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.410 
I believe it's the sweet sweet sugar
type<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:10.800> not<00:00:11.070> very<00:00:11.280> sure<00:00:11.370> because<00:00:11.940> there<00:00:12.330> are

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
type I'm not very sure because there are

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.530 
type I'm not very sure because there are
a<00:00:12.450> lot<00:00:12.540> of<00:00:12.750> variations<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.759> color<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a lot of variations on this color and

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.990 
a lot of variations on this color and
shape<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:18.350> so<00:00:19.350> far<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.650> believe<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.490> closest

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
shape but so far I believe it's closest

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.960 
shape but so far I believe it's closest
to<00:00:21.150> sweet<00:00:21.449> sugar<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> I'm<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.519> gonna<00:00:23.670> call<00:00:23.939> it

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
to sweet sugar so I'm just gonna call it

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
to sweet sugar so I'm just gonna call it
like<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:26.420> and<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.869> diems<00:00:28.109> are<00:00:28.380> actually

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
like that and see diems are actually

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.780 
like that and see diems are actually

entirely my fault because as you can see

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.049 
entirely my fault because as you can see
the<00:00:48.539> roots<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.140> stay<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.649> pot<00:00:50.059> it

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the roots don't stay in the pot it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.229 
the roots don't stay in the pot it
spotted<00:00:53.180> in<00:00:54.239> um<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.649> good<00:00:56.129> manner<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:57.120> I

spotted in um not so good manner and I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.830 
spotted in um not so good manner and I
will<00:00:57.420> have<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.980> repot<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.420> after<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.600> blooms

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
will have to repot it after the blooms

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
will have to repot it after the blooms
are<00:01:01.020> done<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.800> actually<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> rebloom<00:01:02.850> it's

perfect condition it's actually

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.800

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
once a week but I will have to water it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
once a week but I will have to water it
once<00:01:46.140> every<00:01:46.380> five<00:01:46.680> days<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> think<00:01:47.520> because<00:01:47.850> I

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
once every five days I think because I

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.030 
once every five days I think because I
really<00:01:48.360> don't<00:01:48.570> like<00:01:48.780> how<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.170> sort<00:01:49.680> of<00:01:49.740> bulbs

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
really don't like how the sort of bulbs

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.030 
really don't like how the sort of bulbs
shriveled<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:51.049> it<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.530> plumbed<00:01:52.829> and

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
shriveled up it is to be plumbed and

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.510 
shriveled up it is to be plumbed and
beautiful<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:54.020> now

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
beautiful and now

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.490 
beautiful and now
looks<00:01:55.640> nasty<00:01:56.320> so<00:01:57.320> lesson<00:01:57.710> learned<00:01:59.380> the<00:02:00.380> other

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
looks nasty so lesson learned the other

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.340 
looks nasty so lesson learned the other
problem<00:02:01.399> is<00:02:01.549> that<00:02:01.579> the<00:02:02.390> roots<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:02.960> are<00:02:03.200> in

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
problem is that the roots that are in

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.440 
problem is that the roots that are in
the<00:02:03.469> pot<00:02:03.679> they<00:02:04.009> will<00:02:04.130> receive<00:02:04.579> too<00:02:04.909> much<00:02:05.149> water

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
the pot they will receive too much water

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.199 
the pot they will receive too much water
if<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.719> do<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.140> so<00:02:06.469> I<00:02:06.679> always<00:02:06.979> just<00:02:07.159> have<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.549> be

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
if I do this so I always just have to be

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.900 
if I do this so I always just have to be
careful<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.129> spray<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.310> roots<00:02:10.519> that<00:02:10.640> are

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
careful and spray the roots that are

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.240 
careful and spray the roots that are
outside<00:02:11.620> a<00:02:12.730> tip<00:02:13.730> that<00:02:14.330> I've<00:02:14.660> learned<00:02:14.900> over<00:02:15.290> the

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
outside a tip that I've learned over the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.119 
outside a tip that I've learned over the
Internet<00:02:16.670> if<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.180> use<00:02:17.510> clear<00:02:18.379> plastic<00:02:18.680> pots

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
Internet if you use clear plastic pots

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.280 
Internet if you use clear plastic pots
you<00:02:19.730> might<00:02:20.000> actually<00:02:20.180> get<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.720> roots<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.110> stay

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you might actually get the roots to stay

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.470 
you might actually get the roots to stay
inside<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.980> not<00:02:22.670> go<00:02:22.849> out<00:02:23.739> because<00:02:25.330> well<00:02:26.330> I'm

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
inside and not go out because well I'm

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.440 
inside and not go out because well I'm
not<00:02:26.629> sure<00:02:26.690> about<00:02:26.930> this<00:02:27.290> but<00:02:27.769> maybe<00:02:28.130> they<00:02:28.970> put

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
not sure about this but maybe they put

they<00:02:29.690> make<00:02:30.459> photosynthesis<00:02:31.459> as<00:02:31.640> well<00:02:31.819> I'm<00:02:32.420> not

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
they make photosynthesis as well I'm not

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.600 
they make photosynthesis as well I'm not
sure<00:02:32.780> about<00:02:33.140> its<00:02:33.349> idioms<00:02:33.680> and<00:02:33.860> other<00:02:33.980> types<00:02:34.310> I

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
sure about its idioms and other types I

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.640 
sure about its idioms and other types I
know<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.970> fillin<00:02:35.360> OPS's<00:02:35.690> roots<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.410> this

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
know that fillin OPS's roots do this

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
know that fillin OPS's roots do this
that's<00:02:37.579> why<00:02:37.730> they<00:02:37.880> come<00:02:38.030> in<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.299> clear<00:02:38.510> pots

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
that's why they come in the clear pots
