we'll<00:02:11.819> make<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> mistake<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.110> not<00:02:13.530> having<00:02:13.950> any

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
we'll make the mistake of not having any

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.240 
we'll make the mistake of not having any
balance<00:02:14.970> whatsoever<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.890> kind<00:02:17.159> of

balance whatsoever and it really kind of

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.460 
balance whatsoever and it really kind of
looks<00:02:17.489> bad<00:02:17.879> for<00:02:18.720> example<00:02:19.080> though<00:02:19.200> we're

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
looks bad for example though we're

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.119 
looks bad for example though we're
saying<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:20.390> you<00:02:21.390> know<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> baby<00:02:21.750> pink<00:02:22.230> dress<00:02:22.680> and

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:18.060 
the colors of black and gold I have a
brooch<00:04:08.050> here<00:04:16.380> do<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> think<00:04:17.620> I<00:04:17.709> should<00:04:17.860> put<00:04:17.950> it

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
brooch here do you think I should put it

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.180 
brooch here do you think I should put it
here<00:04:18.489> or<00:04:18.820> off<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.510> side<00:04:19.980> we're<00:04:20.980> down<00:04:21.160> here

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
here or off to the side we're down here

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.930 
here or off to the side we're down here
I<00:04:22.380> think<00:04:23.380> it's<00:04:23.500> a<00:04:23.560> little<00:04:23.680> strange<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.370> in<00:04:24.820> the

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:24.940 
I think it's a little strange but in the

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.880 
I think it's a little strange but in the
middle<00:04:25.210> because<00:04:25.450> you'd<00:04:26.410> think<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.770> would<00:04:26.860> be

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
middle because you'd think it would be

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.800 
middle because you'd think it would be
balanced<00:04:27.460> because<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.910> symmetrical<00:04:28.660> down

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
balanced because it's symmetrical down

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.780 
balanced because it's symmetrical down
the<00:04:28.900> center<00:04:29.200> but<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> think<00:04:29.980> off<00:04:30.340> to<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.610> side

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
the center but I think off to the side

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.100 
the center but I think off to the side
would<00:04:30.970> be<00:04:31.180> a<00:04:31.210> little<00:04:31.510> bit<00:04:31.600> better<00:04:31.750> so<00:04:32.050> you

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
would be a little bit better so you

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.460 
would be a little bit better so you
don't<00:04:32.290> have<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.740> giant<00:04:33.840> things<00:04:34.840> right<00:04:35.260> there

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
don't have to giant things right there

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.600 
don't have to giant things right there
do<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.740> know<00:04:35.830> anything<00:04:35.980> can<00:04:36.160> you<00:04:36.280> even<00:04:36.400> see

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
do you know anything can you even see

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.600
