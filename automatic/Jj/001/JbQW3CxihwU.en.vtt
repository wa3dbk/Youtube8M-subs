it's about keeping as much dry fiber as
possible<00:01:52.710> right<00:01:53.220> they<00:01:53.700> call<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.000> dry<00:01:54.210> fiber

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
possible right they call it dry fiber

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.649 
possible right they call it dry fiber
but<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.320> referred<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.219> as

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
but it's also referred to as

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.120 
but it's also referred to as
myofibrillar<00:01:57.659> hypertrophy

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
myofibrillar hypertrophy

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
myofibrillar hypertrophy
it's<00:01:59.490> where<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.630> nobody<00:02:01.259> really

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it's where there is nobody really

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
it's where there is nobody really
understands<00:02:02.159> that<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> lot<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> theories<00:02:03.000> about

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
understands that a lot of theories about

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.149 
understands that a lot of theories about
this<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:04.049> where<00:02:04.290> there's<00:02:04.530> actually<00:02:04.799> an

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
this but it's where there's actually an

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.150 
this but it's where there's actually an
increase<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:07.320> fiber<00:02:07.619> size<00:02:08.280> or

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
thickness of your muscle you're actually

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.630 
thickness of your muscle you're actually
building<00:02:11.290> that's<00:02:12.130> why<00:02:12.220> they<00:02:12.310> call<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.460> dry

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
building that's why they call it dry

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.130 
building that's why they call it dry
muscle<00:02:13.180> dry<00:02:13.600> fiber<00:02:14.200> when<00:02:14.980> you<00:02:15.160> train<00:02:15.520> for

muscle dry fiber when you train for

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
all the shit that I do it's lifting very

which is basically water in the muscle
you're<00:02:33.400> gonna<00:02:33.490> focus<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:34.090> really<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.440> low

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
you're gonna focus on really like low

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.010 
you're gonna focus on really like low
calories<00:02:36.070> like<00:02:36.250> you're<00:02:36.610> cutting<00:02:37.020> essentially

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
calories like you're cutting essentially

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:43.130 
calories like you're cutting essentially
and<00:02:38.490> you're<00:02:39.490> going<00:02:39.790> to<00:02:40.560> try<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.620> keep<00:02:41.890> the

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
and you're going to try to keep the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.510 
and you're going to try to keep the
exercises<00:02:44.140> or<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.620> rep<00:02:44.800> range<00:02:44.830> parameters

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
in the tissue to a minimum to a minimum

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.970 
in the tissue to a minimum to a minimum
in<00:02:51.040> fact<00:02:51.430> like<00:02:51.610> almost<00:02:51.970> none<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.530> what's<00:02:53.860> gonna

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
in fact like almost none so what's gonna

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.570 
in fact like almost none so what's gonna
happen<00:02:54.040> is<00:02:54.490> when<00:02:54.640> you<00:02:54.730> get<00:02:54.940> down<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.510> 190

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
happen is when you get down to 190

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.150 
happen is when you get down to 190
you're<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:58.030> have<00:02:58.270> maintained<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.290> lot<00:03:00.040> of

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
you're going to have maintained a lot of

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.590 
you're going to have maintained a lot of
your<00:03:00.280> strength<00:03:00.700> they're<00:03:00.910> gonna<00:03:01.000> be<00:03:01.180> as<00:03:01.330> strong

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
your strength they're gonna be as strong

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.080 
your strength they're gonna be as strong
as<00:03:01.750> you<00:03:01.870> were<00:03:02.020> when<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.350> were<00:03:02.490> 250<00:03:03.490> I'm<00:03:03.850> not<00:03:04.000> as

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
as you were when you were 250 I'm not as

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.670 
as you were when you were 250 I'm not as
strong<00:03:04.210> as<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.480> was<00:03:04.660> when<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.900> was<00:03:05.020> 250<00:03:05.440> but<00:03:05.590> I'm

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
strong as I was when I was 250 but I'm

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.620 
strong as I was when I was 250 but I'm
still<00:03:06.190> pretty<00:03:06.430> goddamn<00:03:06.940> strong<00:03:07.300> because<00:03:07.570> I

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
still pretty goddamn strong because I

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.340 
still pretty goddamn strong because I
still<00:03:07.870> look<00:03:08.080> very<00:03:08.110> heavy<00:03:08.790> but<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.780> would<00:03:10.990> have

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
still look very heavy but you would have

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.699 
still look very heavy but you would have
maintained<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.520> perhaps<00:03:12.790> even<00:03:13.180> built<00:03:13.750> some

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
maintained and perhaps even built some

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.830 
maintained and perhaps even built some

myofibrillar tissue that's going to give

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.110 
myofibrillar tissue that's going to give

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
lot of water retention you know it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.020 
lot of water retention you know it's
just<00:03:29.230> aqua<00:03:29.590> plasma<00:03:29.950> mints<00:03:30.190> look<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.430> up<00:03:30.490> plasma

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
keeps a lot of weight on their body you

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.020 
keeps a lot of weight on their body you
don't<00:03:35.740> want<00:03:35.950> that<00:03:36.070> way<00:03:36.250> I<00:03:36.430> don't<00:03:36.700> want<00:03:36.880> that

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
don't want that way I don't want that

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.670 
don't want that way I don't want that
weight<00:03:37.300> that's<00:03:37.570> why<00:03:37.780> I<00:03:37.810> don't<00:03:38.020> train<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.650> a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
weight that's why I don't train like a

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.800 
weight that's why I don't train like a

bodybuilder to any great degree I still

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.330 
bodybuilder to any great degree I still
change<00:03:41.020> my<00:03:41.140> strength<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:41.680> that<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:42.040> can<00:03:42.190> have

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
change my strength so that I can have

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.420 
change my strength so that I can have
muscle<00:03:43.270> fiber<00:03:43.660> my<00:03:44.320> nervous<00:03:44.650> system<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:45.100> strong
