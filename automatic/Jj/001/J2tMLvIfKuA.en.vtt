00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:13.503
 Hi, My name is Lili and I already told you about my friend, 

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.000
 a real bear. 

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:19.583
 The friends 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.700
 As soon as the Bear moved into my house, we were inseparable. 

00:00:32.112 --> 00:00:34.012
 Day and night. 

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:38.875
 Every day. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.460
 Yes, we did everything together. 

00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.056
 Of course, I did not forget my other friends: 

00:01:14.262 --> 00:01:15.208
 Speedwell, 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.580
 Tobias, 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.708
 Jacob 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:24.708
 and Norman. 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:45.829
 I think the Bear felt the connection between me and my friends in the aquarium and he also wanted to be one of us. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.480
 But he did not really understand that they did not know how to breathe out of the water. 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.780
 Yes, my Bear was very sociable. 

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:04.041
 Even with my neighbor's nasty dog. 

00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:08.458
 They played together until George lost a tooth, quite by chance. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.742
 I'm sure it was a milk tooth. 

00:02:17.091 --> 00:02:21.958
 But Madame Citrouillon got so angry that she forbade my Bear to approach George. 

00:02:23.646 --> 00:02:26.377
 She even wanted a no-contact order. 

00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:32.458
 But his lawyer was struggling to find a suitable law article. 

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:39.416
 She used every means to turn my Bear away from home 

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.958
 but no one had followed her. 

00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:46.121
 Anyway, I know what it is: My Bear was sociable, 

00:02:46.795 --> 00:02:47.500
 romantic 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.958
 and kind.
