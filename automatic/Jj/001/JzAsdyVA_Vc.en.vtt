00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
golden frequencies of the guitar and

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.319 
golden frequencies of the guitar and
they<00:00:49.860> built<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:50.430> structure<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.210> more

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
they built a structure the more

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.130 
they built a structure the more
specifically<00:00:52.170> emphasize<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.760> range<00:00:54.210> the

specifically emphasize that range the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
specifically emphasize that range the
result<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> superlight<00:00:56.789> structure<00:00:57.480> that

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
result is a superlight structure that
