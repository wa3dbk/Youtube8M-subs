right we're done loading now and here's

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.390 
right we're done loading now and here's
the<00:04:23.180> full<00:04:23.720> desktop<00:04:24.130> sized<00:04:25.130> mobile<00:04:25.850> burn<00:04:26.030> page

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
the full desktop sized mobile burn page

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.500 
the full desktop sized mobile burn page
it's<00:04:28.400> quite<00:04:28.580> nice<00:04:28.729> all<00:04:28.970> the<00:04:29.090> images<00:04:29.270> are

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
it's quite nice all the images are

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.969 
it's quite nice all the images are
loaded<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:29.840> properly<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.260> it<00:04:30.380> doesn't<00:04:30.650> seem

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
loaded up properly and it doesn't seem

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.240 
loaded up properly and it doesn't seem
to<00:04:31.220> be<00:04:31.340> any<00:04:31.460> problems<00:04:32.440> seems<00:04:33.440> all<00:04:33.560> very<00:04:33.770> fluid

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
to be any problems seems all very fluid

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.930 
to be any problems seems all very fluid
and<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:35.600> is<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.990> believe<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.400> first<00:04:37.610> device

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
and this is the believe the first device

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.700 
and this is the believe the first device
since<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.419> iphone<00:04:38.539> that's<00:04:39.199> actually<00:04:39.410> got

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
since the iphone that's actually got

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.250 
since the iphone that's actually got
pinch<00:04:40.039> gestures<00:04:40.610> as<00:04:40.760> well<00:04:41.000> so<00:04:41.720> we<00:04:41.840> just<00:04:41.990> placed

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
pinch gestures as well so we just placed

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.320 
pinch gestures as well so we just placed
two<00:04:42.530> fingers<00:04:42.860> on<00:04:42.949> the<00:04:43.039> screen<00:04:43.160> move<00:04:44.120> them

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
two fingers on the screen move them

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.110 
two fingers on the screen move them
apart<00:04:44.690> we<00:04:44.840> can<00:04:45.050> zoom<00:04:45.350> in<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.820> the<00:04:46.820> opposite

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
apart we can zoom in and the opposite

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.520 
apart we can zoom in and the opposite
way<00:04:47.270> pinching<00:04:47.780> in<00:04:47.900> words<00:04:48.220> seems<00:04:49.220> back<00:04:49.550> home

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
way pinching in words seems back home

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.870 
way pinching in words seems back home
but<00:04:51.530> it's<00:04:51.620> quite<00:04:51.860> well<00:04:52.100> so<00:04:52.400> as<00:04:52.490> you<00:04:52.580> can<00:04:52.699> see

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
but it's quite well so as you can see

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.550 
but it's quite well so as you can see
it's<00:04:53.030> not<00:04:53.150> perfect<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:53.840> can<00:04:54.050> be<00:04:54.199> slightly

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
it's not perfect it can be slightly

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.590 
it's not perfect it can be slightly
glitchy<00:04:54.979> but<00:04:55.370> for<00:04:55.910> the<00:04:55.970> most<00:04:56.150> part<00:04:56.240> works

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
glitchy but for the most part works

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.960 
glitchy but for the most part works
quite<00:04:56.930> well
