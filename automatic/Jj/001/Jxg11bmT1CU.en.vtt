00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
putting a shea butter on I used to put a

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:58.719 
putting a shea butter on I used to put a
whole<00:01:57.289> bunch<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.649> little<00:01:57.950> twists<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:58.340> her<00:01:58.460> hair

whole bunch of little twists in her hair

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.850 
whole bunch of little twists in her hair
but<00:01:58.909> the<00:01:59.030> outcome<00:01:59.450> was<00:01:59.630> a<00:01:59.659> lot<00:01:59.899> of<00:02:00.020> tangles<00:02:00.289> now

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
but the outcome was a lot of tangles now

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.160 
but the outcome was a lot of tangles now
I<00:02:00.890> only<00:02:01.189> use<00:02:01.520> two<00:02:01.880> plots<00:02:02.179> for<00:02:02.509> the<00:02:02.569> stretch<00:02:02.929> and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
I only use two plots for the stretch and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.949 
I only use two plots for the stretch and
that<00:02:03.409> avoids<00:02:03.740> tangles<00:02:07.179> so<00:02:08.179> follow<00:02:08.479> us<00:02:08.600> through

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.210 
between using a cleanser and co-washing
on<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.730> left<00:04:13.970> side<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.209> used<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.799> vitamin

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
on the left side I used the the vitamin

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.490 
on the left side I used the the vitamin
C<00:04:16.459> product<00:04:17.000> which<00:04:17.389> was<00:04:17.570> to<00:04:17.750> get<00:04:17.930> the<00:04:18.109> chlorine

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
C product which was to get the chlorine

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.800 
C product which was to get the chlorine
out<00:04:18.709> of<00:04:18.919> my<00:04:19.070> hair<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:19.340> effectively<00:04:20.000> a<00:04:20.120> cleanser

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
out of my hair so effectively a cleanser

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.260 
out of my hair so effectively a cleanser
on<00:04:20.959> the<00:04:21.350> right<00:04:21.560> side<00:04:21.829> I<00:04:22.160> basically<00:04:22.699> only<00:04:22.880> co

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
on the right side I basically only co

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.020 
on the right side I basically only co
washed<00:04:23.539> at<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.990> point<00:04:24.289> so<00:04:24.770> it<00:04:25.010> was<00:04:25.250> longer<00:04:25.760> so

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
washed at that point so it was longer so

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.300 
washed at that point so it was longer so
that's<00:04:26.510> how<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:26.750> could<00:04:27.020> tell<00:04:27.050> what<00:04:27.949> each

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
that's how I could tell what each

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.150 
that's how I could tell what each
product<00:04:28.910> was<00:04:29.060> doing<00:04:29.360> to<00:04:29.570> my<00:04:29.750> hair<00:04:30.110> and<00:04:30.320> how<00:04:31.130> I

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
product was doing to my hair and how I

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.910 
product was doing to my hair and how I
should<00:04:31.340> use<00:04:31.669> it

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.660 

you

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.920 

so<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:45.730> guys<00:04:46.000> see<00:04:46.180> that<00:04:46.210> was<00:04:46.480> not<00:04:46.660> a<00:04:46.690> lot<00:04:46.900> of

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
so you guys see that was not a lot of

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.500 
so you guys see that was not a lot of
work<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.500> get<00:04:48.280> rid<00:04:48.430> of<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.610> chlorine<00:04:48.850> once<00:04:49.300> we

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
work to get rid of the chlorine once we

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.570 
work to get rid of the chlorine once we
were<00:04:49.630> out<00:04:49.690> of<00:04:49.870> the<00:04:50.050> pool<00:04:50.230> you<00:04:50.680> step<00:04:51.130> one<00:04:51.310> two

the texture for the next day I'm still

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.060 
the texture for the next day I'm still
only<00:04:56.110> using<00:04:56.590> my<00:04:56.710> water<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.160> oil<00:04:58.860> one<00:04:59.860> of<00:04:59.980> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
only using my water and oil one of the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.530 
only using my water and oil one of the
things<00:05:00.280> I<00:05:00.400> want<00:05:00.580> to<00:05:00.640> stress<00:05:00.730> about<00:05:01.180> me<00:05:01.360> using

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
things I want to stress about me using

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.140

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
water and oil only and getting a defined

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.450 
water and oil only and getting a defined
set<00:05:04.510> on<00:05:04.750> my<00:05:04.960> braid<00:05:05.470> outs<00:05:05.620> twist<00:05:05.890> outs<00:05:06.070> whatever

set on my braid outs twist outs whatever

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.240 
set on my braid outs twist outs whatever
is<00:05:06.790> I<00:05:07.300> think<00:05:07.360> it's<00:05:08.290> attributed<00:05:08.590> to<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:09.010> fact

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
is I think it's attributed to the fact

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.330 
is I think it's attributed to the fact
that<00:05:09.520> I'm<00:05:09.700> doing<00:05:10.320> conditioner<00:05:11.320> only<00:05:11.770> wash<00:05:12.100> and

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
that I'm doing conditioner only wash and

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.670 
that I'm doing conditioner only wash and
gos<00:05:12.490> so<00:05:13.120> that<00:05:13.270> means<00:05:13.600> that<00:05:13.870> my<00:05:14.110> hair<00:05:14.320> is<00:05:14.350> well

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
gos so that means that my hair is well

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.620 
gos so that means that my hair is well
conditioned<00:05:15.490> all<00:05:15.700> of<00:05:15.820> the<00:05:15.940> time<00:05:16.120> so<00:05:16.300> what<00:05:16.420> I<00:05:16.450> am
