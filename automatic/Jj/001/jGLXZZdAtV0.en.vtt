best FPS games that have been that have

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.839 
best FPS games that have been that have
ever<00:02:28.819> been<00:02:30.430> been<00:02:31.430> been<00:02:31.819> made<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:34.280> gameplay<00:02:34.700> is

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
ever been been been made the gameplay is

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.160 
ever been been been made the gameplay is
quite<00:02:35.569> good<00:02:36.069> and<00:02:37.069> it<00:02:37.910> can<00:02:38.239> somewhat<00:02:38.840> compares

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
quite good and it can somewhat compares

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.820 
quite good and it can somewhat compares
us<00:02:39.349> some<00:02:39.680> some<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.400> modern<00:02:41.239> games<00:02:41.830> and

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
us some some of the modern games and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.830 
us some some of the modern games and
that<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.370> probably<00:02:43.640> why<00:02:44.030> it's<00:02:44.330> among<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.720> mess

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
that is probably why it's among the mess

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.390 
that is probably why it's among the mess
SBS's<00:02:45.910> and<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:48.290> much<00:02:48.500> has<00:02:48.680> been<00:02:48.860> in<00:02:48.980> changed

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
SBS's and not much has been in changed

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.039 
SBS's and not much has been in changed
in<00:02:50.269> the<00:02:50.540> gameplay<00:02:50.870> as<00:02:51.290> said<00:02:51.530> before<00:02:51.650> even<00:02:53.049> in

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
in the gameplay as said before even in

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.229 
in the gameplay as said before even in
blue<00:02:54.319> shift<00:02:54.620> so<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.459> pretty<00:02:55.640> much<00:02:55.700> continues

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
blue shift so it pretty much continues

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.589 
blue shift so it pretty much continues
the<00:02:56.630> gameplay<00:02:57.019> from<00:02:57.940> from<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.120> original

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
the gameplay from from the original

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.280 
the gameplay from from the original
half-life<00:03:00.170> game<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:02.150> graphics<00:03:02.360> themselves

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
half-life game the graphics themselves

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.850 
half-life game the graphics themselves
well<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:05.060> graphics<00:03:05.420> aren't<00:03:06.170> really<00:03:06.739> that

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
well the graphics aren't really that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.449 
well the graphics aren't really that
good<00:03:07.099> but<00:03:07.280> aren't<00:03:07.790> bad<00:03:08.090> either<00:03:09.190> those<00:03:10.190> were

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
good but aren't bad either those were

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.819 
good but aren't bad either those were
pretty<00:03:10.790> much<00:03:11.079> the<00:03:12.079> best<00:03:12.200> graphics<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:15.440> the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
pretty much the best graphics for the

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.690 
pretty much the best graphics for the
1998<00:03:17.079> for<00:03:18.079> the<00:03:18.230> year<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.500> was<00:03:18.680> released<00:03:18.980> in<00:03:19.190> um

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
1998 for the year it was released in um

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.720 
1998 for the year it was released in um
it<00:03:20.630> does<00:03:20.930> allow<00:03:21.170> some<00:03:21.440> tweaking<00:03:21.859> and<00:03:22.190> works

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
it does allow some tweaking and works

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.099 
it does allow some tweaking and works
pretty<00:03:23.030> much<00:03:23.269> on<00:03:23.690> all<00:03:24.410> of<00:03:24.620> the<00:03:24.739> computers<00:03:26.109> the

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
pretty much on all of the computers the

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.990 
pretty much on all of the computers the
graphics<00:03:27.380> can't<00:03:27.769> really<00:03:28.010> compare<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.519> today's

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
graphics can't really compare to today's

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.099 
graphics can't really compare to today's
games<00:03:29.329> but<00:03:30.459> can<00:03:31.459> be<00:03:31.609> used<00:03:31.790> as<00:03:32.209> some<00:03:32.840> kind<00:03:32.870> of

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
games but can be used as some kind of

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:40.470 
games but can be used as some kind of
base<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:34.040> base<00:03:34.579> to<00:03:35.000> build<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:36.069> to<00:03:37.069> newer<00:03:37.760> games

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.039 

so<00:03:41.480> um<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:43.579> graphics<00:03:43.790> are<00:03:44.150> as<00:03:44.510> said<00:03:44.780> and

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
so um the graphics are as said and

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.170 
so um the graphics are as said and
pretty<00:03:45.470> pretty<00:03:46.069> amazing<00:03:46.549> for<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> time<00:03:47.030> it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
pretty pretty amazing for the time it

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.990 
pretty pretty amazing for the time it
was<00:03:47.269> released<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:50.000> but<00:03:50.950> what<00:03:51.950> makes<00:03:52.190> the<00:03:52.400> the

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
was released the but what makes the the

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.110 
was released the but what makes the the
half-life<00:03:53.420> series<00:03:53.650> so<00:03:54.650> good<00:03:54.859> isn't<00:03:55.700> really

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
half-life series so good isn't really

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.970 
half-life series so good isn't really
the<00:03:56.660> graphics<00:03:57.019> themselves<00:03:57.470> but<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.799> gameplay

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
the graphics themselves but the gameplay

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.780 
the graphics themselves but the gameplay
and<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:59.239> story<00:03:59.569> and<00:03:59.930> pretty<00:04:00.920> much<00:04:01.099> the<00:04:01.310> the

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
and the story and pretty much the the

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.479 
and the story and pretty much the the
fact<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.150> it<00:04:02.450> was<00:04:02.650> among<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.769> first<00:04:03.799> FPS

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
fact that it was among the first FPS

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.160 
fact that it was among the first FPS
games<00:04:04.730> that<00:04:04.940> was<00:04:05.030> ever<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.959> was<00:04:06.829> released

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
games that was ever that was released

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.429 
games that was ever that was released
so<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.409> basically<00:04:10.849> but<00:04:11.849> that<00:04:12.299> made<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.659> some<00:04:13.019> as

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
so it basically but that made it some as

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.360 
so it basically but that made it some as
popular<00:04:14.159> as<00:04:14.189> it<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:16.530> tilted<00:04:17.250> up<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.759> today

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
popular as it is and tilted up to today

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.379 
popular as it is and tilted up to today
so<00:04:20.370> in<00:04:20.850> my<00:04:21.120> opinion<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:22.370> blueshift<00:04:23.370> add-on<00:04:23.820> is

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
so in my opinion the blueshift add-on is

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.620 
so in my opinion the blueshift add-on is
a<00:04:24.690> great<00:04:25.139> addition<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.800> half-life<00:04:26.250> series

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
a great addition to the half-life series

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.620 
a great addition to the half-life series
features<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.720> great<00:04:27.960> story<00:04:28.320> and<00:04:28.770> even<00:04:29.310> a<00:04:29.370> better

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
features a great story and even a better

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.350 
features a great story and even a better
and<00:04:30.630> an<00:04:30.840> even<00:04:30.960> better<00:04:31.280> gameplay<00:04:32.280> it's<00:04:32.849> worth

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
and an even better gameplay it's worth

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.540 
and an even better gameplay it's worth
all<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.020> time<00:04:34.229> spent<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.800> really<00:04:35.400> worth

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
all the time spent and really worth

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.159
