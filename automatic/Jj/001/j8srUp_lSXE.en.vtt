00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.800
 Today, we are running out of pcgh in danger 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.840
 the center of pcgh editorial 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.430
 we'll try out what 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.309
 happens if you have a cpu cooler in the 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.220
 running business like what for 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.980
 a processor is exactly what we are 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.430
 test this is our graphic artist a test 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.230
 cpu a core i7 920 to 3 5 ghz 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.750
 overclocked and what a cooler will be 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.059
 we remove the same from the processor 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.760
 is a thermalright and 320 extreme with 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.339
 A 120 mm fan always runs with you 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.749
 1300 turns everything clear then I would 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:39.499
 say before we want to get started you 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:41.539
 to greet someone else 

00:00:39.499 --> 00:00:42.969
 the rest of me sitting next to me and 

00:00:41.539 --> 00:00:48.589
 Unfortunately, the video is no longer allowed on it 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:52.329
 Clear everything in the first step 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.329
 we have the 120 mm fan 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.640
 the cooler must first the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.640
 be loosened 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.759
 weighs only by the dead weight 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.759
 the cooler on the processor 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.549
 the colleague Mark in professional circles too 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.159
 benchmark called tried with his 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.969
 wind instrument the cpu temperature too 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.259
 to reduce 

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.259
 Unfortunately without success 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.510
 after ten seconds, the temperature rises 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.680
 to 100 degrees celsius 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.700
 it probably will not be after that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.070
 read correctly 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 at least 14 seconds it takes to the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.790
 protection mechanism attacks and the pc 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.620
 a little choice turns off 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.180
 note please do try this 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.180
 at home in no case after 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.130
 after we reconnect the cooler 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.330
 we have to test whether with the processor 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.330
 everything is fine 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.130
 only windows reports that 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.100
 operating system is not working properly 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.050
 shut down was yes some 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.760
 Colleagues warned me against this 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.920
 experiment because the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.100
 processor is not very cheap 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.840
 But the conclusion is yes yes the warning 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.700
 was so free in vain so fast 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.080
 is not synonymous with cpu then 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.910
 overclocked and with the cabin voltage 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.540
 and if it's true we have it 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.540
 still running enough
