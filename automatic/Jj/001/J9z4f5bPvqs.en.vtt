I'm<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.799> gonna<00:01:49.950> pillar<00:01:50.340> down<00:01:50.549> my<00:01:50.729> hallway

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
I'm just gonna pillar down my hallway

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.630 
I'm just gonna pillar down my hallway
well<00:01:51.930> yeah<00:01:52.409> apparently<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.009> can't<00:01:53.250> kill<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
well yeah apparently you can't kill the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120 
well yeah apparently you can't kill the
NPC's<00:01:54.090> on<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> map<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.079> know<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> guess

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
NPC's on this map which you know I guess

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.560 
NPC's on this map which you know I guess
it's<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.399> safety<00:01:56.670> feature<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.240> guess<00:01:57.450> you

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it's like a safety feature I guess you

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.149 
it's like a safety feature I guess you
need<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.930> NPC's<00:01:58.380> here<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
need the NPC's here which you know is

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.520 
need the NPC's here which you know is
fine<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.969> cool<00:02:00.240> I'm<00:02:00.450> down<00:02:01.020> for<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.259> that

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
fine that's cool I'm down for that that

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
fine that's cool I'm down for that that
sounds<00:02:01.740> like<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> good<00:02:02.040> plan<00:02:02.329> but<00:02:03.329> Sir<00:02:03.659> but<00:02:04.409> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
sounds like a good plan but Sir but then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.719 
sounds like a good plan but Sir but then
you<00:02:04.590> can't<00:02:04.799> dig<00:02:05.009> below<00:02:05.219> you<00:02:05.280> because<00:02:05.610> you're

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
you can't dig below you because you're

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.479 
you can't dig below you because you're
just<00:02:05.820> overly<00:02:06.240> hitting<00:02:06.750> these<00:02:06.869> npcs<00:02:07.560> don't

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
just overly hitting these npcs don't

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.680 
just overly hitting these npcs don't
want<00:02:08.610> coming<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:09.060> like<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.300> you're<00:02:09.660> just

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
want coming it like this you're just

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.010 
want coming it like this you're just
overly<00:02:10.289> hitting<00:02:10.679> these<00:02:10.800> npcs<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.810> can't

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
overly hitting these npcs and you can't

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.790 
overly hitting these npcs and you can't
kill<00:02:13.260> them

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
kill them

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.370 
kill them
so<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.310> one<00:02:14.760> big<00:02:14.790> cycle<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.690> it<00:02:16.230> is

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
so it is just one big cycle and it is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.600 
so it is just one big cycle and it is
really<00:02:17.270> really<00:02:18.270> annoying<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:19.380> don't<00:02:20.370> even<00:02:20.460> know

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
really really annoying I don't even know

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.310 
really really annoying I don't even know
where<00:02:20.760> I'm<00:02:20.940> going<00:02:21.120> I'm<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.510> gonna<00:02:21.600> climb<00:02:22.080> up

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
where I'm going I'm just gonna climb up

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.170 
where I'm going I'm just gonna climb up
here<00:02:22.590> hopefully<00:02:23.580> there's<00:02:23.760> something<00:02:23.940> at<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
here hopefully there's something at the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
here hopefully there's something at the
top<00:02:24.450> if<00:02:24.660> there's<00:02:24.930> not<00:02:25.110> then<00:02:25.170> it's<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> complete

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
top if there's not then it's a complete

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.120 
top if there's not then it's a complete
waste<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.490> time<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:26.870> that's<00:02:27.870> fine<00:02:28.620> whatever

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
waste of time and that's fine whatever

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.730 
waste of time and that's fine whatever

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
for emeralds hmm this this map seems to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.850 
for emeralds hmm this this map seems to
be<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.790> currency<00:02:44.790> based<00:02:45.410> which<00:02:46.410> I'm<00:02:46.650> not

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
be really currency based which I'm not

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.900 
be really currency based which I'm not
sure<00:02:47.310> how<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:47.880> feel<00:02:48.330> about<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:49.520> because<00:02:50.520> like

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
sure how I feel about that because like

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.940 
sure how I feel about that because like
I<00:02:51.180> don't<00:02:51.570> know<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:51.840> survival<00:02:52.470> maps<00:02:52.710> they're

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
I don't know with survival maps they're

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.190 
I don't know with survival maps they're
not<00:02:53.040> men<00:02:53.220> Demi<00:02:53.430> currency<00:02:53.970> based<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.990> at<00:02:55.080> least

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
not men Demi currency based or at least

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200 
not men Demi currency based or at least
in<00:02:55.350> my<00:02:55.500> mind<00:02:55.530> they're<00:02:55.920> not<00:02:56.100> they're<00:02:56.970> meant<00:02:57.120> to

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.210 
in my mind they're not they're meant to

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.550 
in my mind they're not they're meant to
be<00:02:57.270> you<00:02:58.260> know<00:02:58.970> survival<00:02:59.970> base<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.380> guess

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
be you know survival base and I guess

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.920 
be you know survival base and I guess
currency<00:03:02.250> plays<00:03:02.520> into<00:03:02.850> survival<00:03:03.330> i<00:03:03.390> guess<00:03:03.630> i'm

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
currency plays into survival i guess i'm

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.690 
currency plays into survival i guess i'm
probably<00:03:04.260> going<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.860> about<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.070> topic<00:03:05.310> that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
probably going on about a topic that

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.600 
probably going on about a topic that
honestly<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.300> have<00:03:06.690> no<00:03:06.900> idea<00:03:06.930> about<00:03:07.830> I<00:03:08.070> it's<00:03:08.520> not

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
honestly I have no idea about I it's not

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.340 
honestly I have no idea about I it's not
like<00:03:08.730> i've<00:03:08.910> created<00:03:09.240> a<00:03:09.480> survival<00:03:09.930> map<00:03:10.110> if<00:03:10.230> i

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
like i've created a survival map if i

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.990 
like i've created a survival map if i
was<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.980> let's<00:03:11.250> be<00:03:11.400> honest<00:03:11.640> we<00:03:11.790> all<00:03:11.820> know

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
a Midway series between wheel of

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.470 
a Midway series between wheel of

misfortune in the next map but I have

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.710
