00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.540 
your holster and your shotgun is going
to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.120> low<00:00:33.300> ready<00:00:33.570> fully<00:00:34.110> loaded<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.770> in<00:00:35.040> one

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
to be low ready fully loaded so in one

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.729 
to be low ready fully loaded so in one
in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> chamber<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.149> well<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:37.050> trick<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.380> with

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
in the chamber as well the trick is with

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.520 
in the chamber as well the trick is with
this<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.879> have<00:00:39.180> four<00:00:39.629> targets<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.440> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
this one we have four targets in the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.990 
this one we have four targets in the
rear<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.370> think<00:00:41.579> they're<00:00:41.730> about<00:00:42.050> 45<00:00:43.050> yards

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
rear and I think they're about 45 yards

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.400 
rear and I think they're about 45 yards
maybe<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.210> more<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:46.110> they

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
maybe a little more and there they

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.700 
maybe a little more and there they
require<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> slug<00:00:47.219> hit<00:00:47.489> now<00:00:48.350> over<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
require a slug hit now over here to the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.150 
require a slug hit now over here to the
left<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.520> eight<00:00:51.030> popper<00:00:51.899> targets<00:00:52.289> now<00:00:53.070> if

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
left we have eight popper targets now if

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.560 
left we have eight popper targets now if
we<00:00:53.250> shoot<00:00:53.489> one<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:53.879> popper<00:00:54.239> targets

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
we shoot one of these popper targets

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.389 
we shoot one of these popper targets
with<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> slug<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.289> match<00:00:55.500> DQ<00:00:56.039> you're

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
with a slug it's a match DQ you're

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.189 
with a slug it's a match DQ you're
disqualified<00:00:56.789> basically<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.780> hit<00:00:57.960> one<00:00:58.109> of

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
disqualified basically if you hit one of

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.840 
disqualified basically if you hit one of
those<00:00:58.260> targets<00:00:58.710> it's<00:00:59.129> damaging<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
those targets it's damaging to the

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.400 
those targets it's damaging to the
targets<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:00.660> unsafe<00:01:00.989> because<00:01:01.199> they're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
targets and it's unsafe because they're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
targets and it's unsafe because they're
so<00:01:01.590> close<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.430> these<00:01:02.579> are<00:01:02.640> those<00:01:03.149> poppers<00:01:03.570> are

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
so close so these are those poppers are

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.940 
so close so these are those poppers are
bird<00:01:03.930> shot<00:01:04.170> only<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.909> this<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
bird shot only so the way I see this is

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
bird shot only so the way I see this is

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

in the shotgun and with the key with
shotgun<00:01:54.119> as<00:01:54.299> long<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.810> don't<00:01:54.990> miss<00:01:55.200> your

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
shotgun as long as you don't miss your

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.499 
shotgun as long as you don't miss your
ahead<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.369> curve<00:01:56.729> on<00:01:56.880> everybody<00:01:57.299> else

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
ahead of the curve on everybody else

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.929 
ahead of the curve on everybody else
because<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.439> reloading<00:01:58.979> stuff<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.490> horrible

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
because the reloading stuff is horrible

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.149 
because the reloading stuff is horrible
it's<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.869> takes<00:02:01.259> a<00:02:01.380> lot<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.560> time<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.009> lot<00:02:02.040> of

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
it's it takes a lot of time and a lot of

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's it takes a lot of time and a lot of
practice<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.579> do<00:02:02.790> which<00:02:03.060> I<00:02:03.180> don't<00:02:03.240> do<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.469> I'm

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
practice to do which I don't do so I'm

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
practice to do which I don't do so I'm
gonna<00:02:04.860> grab<00:02:05.159> three<00:02:05.369> rounds<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:05.909> my<00:02:06.060> belt<00:02:06.299> and

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
gonna grab three rounds off my belt and

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.779 
gonna grab three rounds off my belt and
I'm<00:02:07.079> going<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> stuff<00:02:07.530> three<00:02:07.860> rounds<00:02:08.250> into<00:02:08.489> the

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
I'm going to stuff three rounds into the

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.820 
I'm going to stuff three rounds into the
tube<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.149> my<00:02:09.239> shotgun<00:02:09.690> while<00:02:09.959> I'm<00:02:10.200> walking<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
tube of my shotgun while I'm walking and

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.070 
tube of my shotgun while I'm walking and
have<00:02:11.580> predetermined<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.690> think<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.020> is

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
have predetermined that I think this is

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.530 
have predetermined that I think this is
the<00:02:13.200> best

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
the best

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.140 
the best
place<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.049> shoot<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.590> me<00:02:14.769> so<00:02:15.640> by<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.879> time<00:02:16.090> i

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
place to shoot for me so by the time i

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.929 
place to shoot for me so by the time i
get<00:02:16.269> here<00:02:16.719> walking<00:02:17.469> and<00:02:17.620> i'll<00:02:18.519> get<00:02:18.640> three

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:18.939 
get here walking and i'll get three

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:21.360 
get here walking and i'll get three
rounds<00:02:19.599> in<00:02:19.689> there<00:02:19.870> i'm<00:02:20.769> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> raise<00:02:21.129> up

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
rounds in there i'm going to raise up
