00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 and today I'm here in the district of kreuzberg 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 is a super modern place of Berlin and the 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 People are going to know the cool market. 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.269
 who know about food from all over the world 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.269
 come on 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.810
 all were in this market without scenery 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.060
 It hosts a traditional fair but it's 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.180
 Thursday night that happens street bottom 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.430
 also in the five to ten of the night this 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.980
 shed is crowded with stalls that 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.369
 comes next says the whole world have options 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.500
 Asian aramis all with 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.500
 very cheap price of street food 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.410
 the idea came out in 2013 was so certain that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.660
 now there is another third-party market 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 Sunday morning only with 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.770
 breakfast foods to visit 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.899
 It's worth it, it just has to come. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:04.320
 bit prepared because you're sure to 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:06.540
 will face queue and last video of the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 special series and belé and I decided to do 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.740
 a sweet recipe 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.900
 I'm lenk is a bread full of fruits 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.030
 crystallized and almonds in the 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 It's a delight to start this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.720
 recipe we will dissolve the yeast 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.450
 that I'm using yeast here 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.860
 Only a dry papo says to listen a little bit 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.380
 of warm milk 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.810
 And then I'll let it rest for about ten 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.510
 I have a few minutes here in this 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.390
 flour the salt and I 'll add then 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.460
 the people also put the butter 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.590
 melted that is already cold to him 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.990
 incorporates everything with a fork and now 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.050
 then add the yeast dissolved in the 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.050
 milk 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.790
 now I will put the flour to the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.090
 incorporate the dough until it 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.680
 she is homogeneous 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.990
 when I have everything homogeneous I put 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.440
 So the grapes pass and I put them in the sauce 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.520
 before in the room the crystallized fruits and 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.690
 the almond blades 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.830
 now I mix everything very well with one 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.600
 wooden spoon 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.220
 I like to mix all 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.280
 ingredients even when the dough one 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.830
 bit soft and then I play this 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 to the table with plenty of flour and 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 I'm adding flour until she 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.940
 stay at the point that leaves your hands 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.459
 when the dough is no longer sticking 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.170
 in the hands I then make a ball and I go 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.570
 put in a clean bowl that I 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.060
 I passed some oil and put the oil 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.350
 also over the top and cover all 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.299
 with plastic film 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.970
 now let it rest for more or less 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.830
 one hour now that the pasta has grown 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.209
 enough people will open to stuff 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.920
 with the fashion part 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.360
 the literal translation of part of the morning and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.100
 peanut butter 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.890
 But in Brazil, we know more about Brazil. 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.040
 name of marzipã both in germany and 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.140
 in the square here in France this bread is very 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.390
 consumed during the Christmas season and they 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.880
 place that part of the band inside the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.519
 bread to represent the boy jesus then 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.340
 I put the marzipan inside and they 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.580
 they cover with bread with the bread dough as 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.420
 if it were the robes the boy's robe 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.459
 Jesus 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.100
 after the bread has closed with 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.440
 Marzipan I put it on a form 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.650
 I also spent some oil and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.629
 let it grow for another half hour 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:28.720
 now it 's just back in the oven 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.299
 preheated to 180 degrees 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.980
 after roasting and occupy all with a 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:34.980
 icing sugar drizzle 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.360
 now let's see how he got by 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.360
 inside 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.720
 Look at the marzipan filling here in the 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.159
 medium 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.140
 say that the ideal is to wait a few days 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:54.269
 Before eating I 'm fine but I think 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.269
 I'll wait for my fiancé with him right now.
