butter yeah that's going to do is it's
going<00:03:52.470> to<00:03:52.530> actually<00:03:52.920> help<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.550> bread<00:03:54.450> to<00:03:54.600> get

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
going to actually help the bread to get

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.860 
going to actually help the bread to get
a<00:03:54.750> little<00:03:54.840> golden<00:03:55.260> brown<00:03:55.470> and<00:03:56.570> so<00:03:57.570> the<00:03:57.660> butter

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
a little golden brown and so the butter

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.080 
a little golden brown and so the butter
melts<00:03:58.260> at<00:03:58.350> a<00:03:58.380> lower<00:03:58.560> point<00:03:58.800> but<00:03:59.459> by<00:03:59.610> using<00:03:59.640> the

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
melts at a lower point but by using the

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.390 
melts at a lower point but by using the
blended<00:04:00.510> oil<00:04:00.630> we<00:04:01.530> actually<00:04:01.860> raised<00:04:02.130> at<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
blended oil we actually raised at a
