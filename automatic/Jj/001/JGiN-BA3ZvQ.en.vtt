we<00:04:35.620> try<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:35.920> make<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.430> plates<00:04:36.670> as<00:04:36.940> thin<00:04:37.240> as

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
we try to make the plates as thin as

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.500 
we try to make the plates as thin as
possible<00:04:37.630> so<00:04:38.200> we<00:04:38.230> can<00:04:38.380> use<00:04:38.740> as<00:04:39.010> much<00:04:39.270> plates<00:04:40.270> as

anything in the vicinity of the battery
the<00:06:05.740> lipo<00:06:06.010> safe<00:06:06.220> has<00:06:06.520> a<00:06:06.900> velcro<00:06:07.900> tape<00:06:09.660> opening

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
the lipo safe has a velcro tape opening

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.409 
the lipo safe has a velcro tape opening
so<00:06:11.230> it's<00:06:11.350> quite<00:06:11.620> easy<00:06:11.680> to<00:06:12.040> put<00:06:12.970> the<00:06:13.060> battery

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
so it's quite easy to put the battery

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.760 
so it's quite easy to put the battery
inside<00:06:14.520> and<00:06:15.520> close<00:06:16.120> it<00:06:16.150> again<00:06:16.390> if<00:06:17.260> you<00:06:17.500> want<00:06:17.680> to

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
inside and close it again if you want to

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.190 
inside and close it again if you want to
charge<00:06:17.980> the<00:06:18.190> battery<00:06:18.490> you<00:06:19.180> can<00:06:19.330> just<00:06:19.600> plug<00:06:20.020> in

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200 
charge the battery you can just plug in

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.740 
charge the battery you can just plug in
the<00:06:20.470> the<00:06:21.070> charging<00:06:21.550> let's<00:06:21.760> put<00:06:22.360> it<00:06:22.479> into<00:06:22.720> the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
the the charging let's put it into the

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.230 
the the charging let's put it into the
lipo<00:06:23.140> save<00:06:23.400> close<00:06:24.400> it<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:24.790> then<00:06:24.940> you<00:06:25.030> have<00:06:25.210> a

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
lipo save close it and then you have a

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.850 
lipo save close it and then you have a
small<00:06:25.690> opening<00:06:26.110> here<00:06:26.470> where<00:06:27.160> you<00:06:27.220> can<00:06:28.860> take

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:29.860 
small opening here where you can take

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.610 
small opening here where you can take
out<00:06:30.010> the<00:06:30.430> let's<00:06:30.639> so<00:06:31.120> it's<00:06:31.300> quite<00:06:32.020> easy<00:06:32.080> to<00:06:32.350> use

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
out the let's so it's quite easy to use

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.730 
out the let's so it's quite easy to use
while<00:06:33.610> charging<00:06:33.910> and<00:06:34.330> if<00:06:35.050> you<00:06:35.229> want<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:35.530> store

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
while charging and if you want to store

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.710 
while charging and if you want to store
it<00:06:35.800> during<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:36.850> week<00:06:37.000> so<00:06:37.300> if<00:06:37.419> you<00:06:37.540> don't

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
it during the week so if you don't

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.170 
it during the week so if you don't
racing<00:06:38.200> just<00:06:38.979> put<00:06:39.160> it<00:06:39.280> inside<00:06:39.400> inside<00:06:39.970> the

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
racing just put it inside inside the

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
racing just put it inside inside the
safe<00:06:40.390> and<00:06:40.890> you're<00:06:41.890> safe
