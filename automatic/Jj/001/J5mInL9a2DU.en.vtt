00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.810
 so all strong beer say about the new 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.810
 the firmware that came out for many 10 8 00 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.350
 Conversely, the protection of firmware bodies 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.739
 all citizens left the club 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:14.529
 who was finally afraid 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.439
 kinetic scrolling 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.599
 however it is possible through with lead 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.390
 if you can't do it 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.220
 Ukrainians what 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 it will be necessary to reduce the product cold 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:28.829
 I believe that the long-awaited 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.799
 update is kinetic 

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:31.910
 scroll 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.440
 very good what works 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.570
 problems 30 years 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.910
 everything is very nice to 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 to part 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.590
 but for a long time waited for by nottingham who 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.730
 was tentek scrolling by the way was 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.710
 project debut 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.850
 so did nothing 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.640
 new desktop 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.650
 you know if you have plans like 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.770
 contacts 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.230
 too skeptical scrolling 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.990
 all who are just quick 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.660
 pretty 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 we still have you run order 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.090
 on the desktop 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200
 appears explains 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.100
 but almost with player control 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 and even the spoon is shown 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.460
 which is very very nice 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.460
 you can see a spoon 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.750
 2 because 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.690
 but almost which can be customized 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.210
 here 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.600
 here now that's another thing again 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.300
 duo of RAM has become more 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.840
 not yet checked 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.910
 percent 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.910
 more interesting innovations 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 this desktop is the same as 5 more 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.660
 square on holding me 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.870
 then it turned out the phone is locked 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.630
 and they call you 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 used to be athletic buttons reject 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.979
 now when the phone is different 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.979
 pit 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.880
 exit 6 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.689
 person 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.169
 well what else 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.279
 such 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.889
 tuned in 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.169
 to divert need to spend 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:17.339
 order of law 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.469
 yes look there but choose a debt and 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:20.689
 look 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.019
 all the information it will need to hold 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.969
 died before it was just buttons 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.589
 that is also 55 30 added 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:29.799
 hair 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:30.900
 in the same 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.999
 at the same weak link 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:35.169
 and alarm clocks, that is, when we do not let them 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:36.379
 need to hold your finger to 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.489
 turn off 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.749
 or m then spend another in that 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.340
 to keep the leg extended awesome leg 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.629
 to sleep 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.559
 aig 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.800
 another innovation that added this 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.499
 keyboard change 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.169
 here let's say in the suburbs of Moscow we 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.239
 write but this message 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.180
 work somewhere for training and 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.879
 center keyboard yes 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.999
 it is located 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.589
 of such a position we type 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:06.429
 earlier earlier pack of that phone 

00:03:06.429 --> 00:03:08.619
 turned 

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:11.020
 2 keyboard just turned 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.349
 I happened to resort keyboard 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.319
 that many rub judging by because the background is 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:17.489
 it was not clear 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.260
 Now, now, like everyone is turning on 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.919
 was getting on the rent really very 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.689
 correct solution 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:27.509
 there may be so 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:29.659
 here it is 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.659
 changes that did not notice 

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:35.939
 court you liked thank you for
