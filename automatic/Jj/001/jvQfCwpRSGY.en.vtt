just I got and also i bought the one
holographic<00:00:46.440> EXT<00:00:47.340> oxus<00:00:47.960> beldam<00:00:48.960> because<00:00:49.590> i

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
holographic EXT oxus beldam because i

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.549 
holographic EXT oxus beldam because i
think<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.160> might<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.000> my<00:00:51.270> dental<00:00:51.570> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
think it might go well for my dental so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
think it might go well for my dental so
I'm<00:00:52.649> fighting<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> EXT<00:00:53.670> oxus<00:00:53.940> matang<00:00:54.420> in

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I'm fighting for the EXT oxus matang in

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.360 
I'm fighting for the EXT oxus matang in
manner<00:00:54.840> growth<00:00:55.110> or<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.890> i<00:00:55.980> got<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> for

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
manner growth or what and i got it for

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.130 
manner growth or what and i got it for
one<00:00:56.550> dollar<00:00:56.820> which<00:00:57.120> is<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> good<00:00:57.539> offer<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.079> a

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
one dollar which is a good offer it's a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.099 
one dollar which is a good offer it's a
holographic<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.239> work<00:01:00.449> contents<00:01:00.960> which

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
holographic so the work contents which

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
holographic so the work contents which
came<00:01:01.379> actually<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.219> play<00:01:02.520> mat<00:01:02.760> here

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
came actually is this play mat here

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
came actually is this play mat here
which<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.049> front<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.500> guys<00:01:04.650> there<00:01:05.100> on

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
which is in front of you guys there on

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.870 
which is in front of you guys there on
the<00:01:05.519> table<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.869> got<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.320> rouble<00:01:08.220> Platinum

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the table and we got a rouble Platinum

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
the table and we got a rouble Platinum
rule<00:01:09.060> book<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> also<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:10.650> caught<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.250> if

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
rule book and also it caught this if

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
rule book and also it caught this if
attorney<00:01:11.760> on<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.970> other<00:01:12.180> side<00:01:12.500> and<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.650> got

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
attorney on the other side and we got

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.399 
attorney on the other side and we got
this<00:01:14.040> really<00:01:14.369> shiny<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:15.060> nice<00:01:15.720> coin<00:01:16.170> though

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
this really shiny a nice coin though

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.580 
this really shiny a nice coin though
with<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.740> galley<00:01:17.189> infinite<00:01:17.909> free<00:01:18.150> sign<00:01:18.590> and

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
with the galley infinite free sign and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.570 
with the galley infinite free sign and
also<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.220> got<00:01:20.430> damage<00:01:21.090> counters<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.310> yes<00:01:23.310> so

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
also we got damage counters and yes so

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.960 
also we got damage counters and yes so
we'll<00:01:23.729> take<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> look<00:01:24.060> at<00:01:24.180> tech<00:01:24.509> now<00:01:24.689> and

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
we'll take a look at tech now and

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840 
we'll take a look at tech now and
firstly<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.299> got<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.130> holographic<00:01:29.130> delayed

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
firstly I got the holographic delayed

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.499 
firstly I got the holographic delayed
which<00:01:30.150> looks<00:01:30.540> fantastic<00:01:31.700> how<00:01:32.700> graphic<00:01:33.119> looks

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
which looks fantastic how graphic looks

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.130 
which looks fantastic how graphic looks
nice<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.409> got<00:01:34.619> psychic<00:01:35.100> energies<00:01:35.549> x<00:01:35.909> 13<00:01:36.450> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
nice and I got psychic energies x 13 and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.420 
nice and I got psychic energies x 13 and
also<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> got<00:01:38.509> hold<00:01:39.509> on<00:01:40.610> grass<00:01:41.610> energies<00:01:42.240> x<00:01:43.340> 11<00:01:44.340> i

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
also I got hold on grass energies x 11 i

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.539 
also I got hold on grass energies x 11 i
think<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.600> i'll<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:45.869> show<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.290> guys<00:01:46.549> from

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
think so i'll just show you guys from

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.819 
think so i'll just show you guys from
the<00:01:47.610> bottom<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.290> know<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.470> see<00:01:49.770> the

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
the bottom because you know you see the

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.850 
the bottom because you know you see the
first<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.939> yeah<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:51.360> Beedrill<00:01:51.930> please<00:01:52.619> not

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
first so yeah it's Beedrill please not

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.310 
first so yeah it's Beedrill please not
be<00:01:53.100> drew<00:01:53.659> kakuna<00:01:54.659> times<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.770> actually<00:01:57.290> read<00:01:58.290> 0

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
be drew kakuna times to actually read 0

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.870 
be drew kakuna times to actually read 0
x<00:01:59.250> fall

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.870 

The<00:02:02.630> Epoch<00:02:02.750> Times<00:02:02.960> for<00:02:03.500> then<00:02:03.860> we<00:02:03.979> got<00:02:04.130> leafeon

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
The Epoch Times for then we got leafeon

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.050 
The Epoch Times for then we got leafeon
which<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.299> pretty<00:02:05.509> good<00:02:05.780> times<00:02:06.729> too<00:02:07.729> yeah

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
which is pretty good times too yeah

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.130 
which is pretty good times too yeah
you've<00:02:08.300> got<00:02:08.330> a<00:02:08.450> social<00:02:08.840> times<00:02:09.140> too<00:02:09.380> and<00:02:10.840> we<00:02:11.840> got

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
you've got a social times too and we got

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:25.229 
you've got a social times too and we got
EV<00:02:13.069> x<00:02:13.580> 4<00:02:15.849> we<00:02:16.849> got<00:02:17.950> c<00:02:18.950> dot<00:02:19.160> x<00:02:20.090> 2<00:02:22.120> wheezing<00:02:23.200> x<00:02:24.200> 2
