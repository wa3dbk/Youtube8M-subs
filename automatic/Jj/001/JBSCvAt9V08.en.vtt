00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
important to realize that this is a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
important to realize that this is a
learning<00:00:58.859> process<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.550> anything<00:01:00.120> else<00:01:00.300> and

thing I think that's really cool we're
never<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.930> number<00:01:16.259> one<00:01:16.500> but<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> can

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
never going to be number one but we can

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.999 
never going to be number one but we can
always<00:01:17.369> strive<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.420> be<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.840> best<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.979> know

thing<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.640> can<00:01:20.820> but<00:01:21.030> sometimes<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.659> just

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
thing that we can but sometimes we just

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.570 
thing that we can but sometimes we just
keep<00:01:22.080> thinking<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> we're<00:01:23.070> never<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
keep thinking that we're never going to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.240 
keep thinking that we're never going to
hit<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:23.820> level<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.330> we<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.409> trying<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.040> make

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
hit this level and we are trying to make

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
hit this level and we are trying to make
ourselves<00:01:27.439> um<00:01:29.329> we're<00:01:30.329> pushing<00:01:30.570> ourselves<00:01:30.840> too

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
ourselves um we're pushing ourselves too

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.620 
ourselves um we're pushing ourselves too
hard<00:01:31.619> is<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.979> I'm<00:01:32.070> trying<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.430> say<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
hard is what I'm trying to say and that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
hard is what I'm trying to say and that
can<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:34.020> really<00:01:34.770> hurt<00:01:35.189> us<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.729> long

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
can actually really hurt us in the long

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.690 
can actually really hurt us in the long
run

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.420 

what<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.730> advise<00:01:44.240> Jacob<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.930> do<00:01:45.110> was<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.220> take<00:01:46.370> a

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
what I advise Jacob to do was to take a

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.630 
what I advise Jacob to do was to take a
break<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.120> I<00:01:48.080> think<00:01:48.770> some<00:01:49.280> people<00:01:49.610> might

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
break and I think some people might

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.610 
break and I think some people might
actually<00:01:50.000> be<00:01:50.300> like<00:01:50.450> no<00:01:50.660> he<00:01:51.170> needs<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.470> just

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
actually be like no he needs to just

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.320 
actually be like no he needs to just
keep<00:01:51.830> working<00:01:52.220> through<00:01:52.430> this<00:01:52.550> sometimes<00:01:53.150> you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
keep working through this sometimes you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.020 
keep working through this sometimes you
really<00:01:53.570> do<00:01:53.870> need<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.260> mental<00:01:54.830> break<00:01:55.700> in

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
really do need that mental break in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.730 
really do need that mental break in
order<00:01:56.930> to<00:01:57.229> allow<00:01:58.130> yourself<00:01:58.990> to<00:01:59.990> come<00:02:00.229> back<00:02:00.470> to

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
order to allow yourself to come back to

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.430 
order to allow yourself to come back to
it<00:02:00.920> while<00:02:01.250> you're<00:02:01.430> on<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:01.880> break<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.540> think<00:02:03.290> it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
it while you're on this break I think it

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.650 
it while you're on this break I think it
would<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:03.740> really<00:02:03.979> good<00:02:04.250> idea<00:02:04.430> to<00:02:05.150> slowly

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
would be a really good idea to slowly

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.540 
would be a really good idea to slowly
integrate<00:02:06.140> yourself<00:02:06.500> back<00:02:07.070> into<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
integrate yourself back into the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.060 
integrate yourself back into the
creative<00:02:07.820> process<00:02:08.590> personally<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.619> would

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
creative process personally I would

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.310 
creative process personally I would
really<00:02:10.340> like<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.790> go<00:02:10.940> on<00:02:10.970> a<00:02:11.390> walk<00:02:11.900> somewhere

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
really like to go on a walk somewhere
