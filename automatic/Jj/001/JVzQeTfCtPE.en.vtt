00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 moin together in the house and prince has become 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.950
 some done it comes some new ones 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:19.289
 This is one of those is going on 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.760
 the name prince exo 30 100 tsp like her 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.500
 that's already 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.750
 follower of the normal tour so the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.180
 oranges variant for example what 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.429
 david ferrer also plays here 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.309
 in the name to find the esp stands for 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.079
 extreme string pattern and that means 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.190
 Here you get on a 100 head of 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.440
 16 times 16 pages picture so spider in the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.210
 remaining frame 103 head 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.230
 we already said that there is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.879
 300 grams and balance of 31 5 next to the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.039
 obviously very obvious 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.710
 Rough the spin friendly and very 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.180
 There are good sides to play image 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.899
 this device already below double 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.579
 bridge ensures that when playing 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.809
 the stick eats really full and 0 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.210
 hybrid at least not the way you like it 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.979
 do not want to have 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.630
 The big holes in the frame are included 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.240
 long ago criticize program 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.680
 xo 3 is called that the whole worries 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.939
 for that sweet spot a bit 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.689
 gets bigger because the pages are good 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.729
 can move 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.689
 and otherwise I think so 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.820
 every case a racket for 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.710
 team player for tournament players 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.689
 and because 300 grams for each still 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 reasonably negotiable who is very very 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.560
 Actually, it's actually quite agile 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 agile i found the one with the calmest of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.860
 all these open pages a bit 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.540
 what have many manufacturers now? 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 lots of such open pages pictures 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 created the thing I found with am 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.810
 most stable 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.090
 Controlled the bat offers 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.320
 power level of 900 is there with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.970
 security which are above and 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.220
 which ones are underneath mean but 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 so in the end what I play when playing 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.759
 felt the thing was not very in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 the middle of all bat variants 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.899
 the prince new to the market brings a lot 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 controlled very good allrounder 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 but of course not like one 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 18 20 his picture or something like that 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.290
 Spin over it very well controllable 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.000
 and that makes the conclusion a very very 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.979
 good update a very very good one 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.540
 extension of the range and in addition to 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.119
 the whole as I personally find very 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.549
 successful optical 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.180

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.569

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.590
