like last week now I gotta the new Under
Armour<00:00:08.730> head<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.840> i<00:00:10.500> think<00:00:11.099> they<00:00:11.160> call<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.340> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
Armour head the i think they call it the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.810 
Armour head the i think they call it the
headline<00:00:12.740> mainly<00:00:13.740> right<00:00:13.920> now<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.280> used<00:00:14.490> in

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
headline mainly right now it's used in

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.689 
headline mainly right now it's used in
the<00:00:15.000> NLL<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.710> box<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> stuff<00:00:17.340> like<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.520> but

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the NLL for box and stuff like that but

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.349 
the NLL for box and stuff like that but
it's<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> great<00:00:18.840> crossover<00:00:19.289> head<00:00:19.560> I<00:00:20.359> see

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
it's a it's a great crossover head I see

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.880 
it's a it's a great crossover head I see
a<00:00:21.390> couple<00:00:21.480> field<00:00:21.990> goal<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.650> there<00:00:22.769> he

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
a couple field goal is here and there he

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.160 
a couple field goal is here and there he
isn't<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.220> but<00:00:23.580> i<00:00:23.609> figured<00:00:24.000> for<00:00:24.300> some<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.109> you

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
isn't it but i figured for some of you

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.859 
isn't it but i figured for some of you
guys<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.500> aren't<00:00:25.650> sure<00:00:26.150> it<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.359> actually<00:00:27.840> a

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
guys that aren't sure it is actually a

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.040 
guys that aren't sure it is actually a
field<00:00:28.019> head<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.189> i<00:00:29.689> just<00:00:30.689> figured<00:00:30.929> i<00:00:31.019> might

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
field head to but i just figured i might

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.990 
field head to but i just figured i might
make<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.439> review<00:00:31.830> for<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.160> guys<00:00:32.250> just<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.880> you

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
make a review for you guys just so you

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.260 
make a review for you guys just so you
can<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.950> of<00:00:34.950> know<00:00:35.250> what's<00:00:35.460> going<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.880> before

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
can kind of know what's going on before

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.549 
can kind of know what's going on before
you<00:00:36.540> buy<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.899> kind<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.590> thing<00:00:38.090> i<00:00:39.140> put<00:00:40.140> mine<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
you buy it kind of thing i put mine on a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.660 
you buy it kind of thing i put mine on a
nice<00:00:40.770> gate<00:00:41.040> ice<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:42.180> feel<00:00:42.570> or<00:00:42.809> gate<00:00:43.680> 803<00:00:44.430> not

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
nice gate ice and a feel or gate 803 not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.529 
nice gate ice and a feel or gate 803 not
ice<00:00:45.950> and<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.100> feels<00:00:47.670> like<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> fairly<00:00:48.239> light

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
ice and it feels like a fairly light

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.139 
ice and it feels like a fairly light
head<00:00:48.719> it's<00:00:49.469> comparable<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> eclipse<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
head it's comparable to the eclipse and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.229 
head it's comparable to the eclipse and
wait<00:00:51.350> a<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.579> wide<00:00:53.879> side

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
wait a little little on the wide side

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.639 
wait a little little on the wide side
especially<00:00:54.570> through<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.410> through<00:00:55.980> here<00:00:57.649> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
especially through like through here so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.310 
especially through like through here so
that's<00:00:58.859> why<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.070> did<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.690> quad<00:01:00.690> side<00:01:00.930> wall<00:01:01.170> on

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
that's why I did the quad side wall on

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.520 
that's why I did the quad side wall on
this<00:01:02.030> another<00:01:03.030> reason<00:01:03.420> for<00:01:03.449> doing<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.110> I

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
this another reason for doing that is I

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140 
this another reason for doing that is I
wanted<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.890> get<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.070> pocket<00:01:05.489> similar<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
wanted to get a pocket similar to my

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.200 
wanted to get a pocket similar to my
nemesis<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:08.840> by<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> Nemesis<00:01:11.729> having<00:01:12.119> a

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
nemesis and by the Nemesis having a

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.480 
nemesis and by the Nemesis having a
flared<00:01:12.540> lower<00:01:13.080> side<00:01:13.439> wall<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:14.869> it<00:01:15.869> kind<00:01:16.110> of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
flared lower side wall it it kind of

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.999 
flared lower side wall it it kind of
made<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.640> harder<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:17.970> get<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.330> exact<00:01:18.780> replica<00:01:19.740> I

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
made it harder to get an exact replica I

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.370 
made it harder to get an exact replica I
mean<00:01:20.670> if<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:20.880> tried<00:01:21.150> long<00:01:21.750> enough<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.170> probably

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
mean if I tried long enough I probably

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.140 
mean if I tried long enough I probably
could<00:01:22.650> have<00:01:22.680> gotten<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> exact<00:01:23.369> replica<00:01:23.820> EPP

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
could have gotten the exact replica EPP

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.730 
could have gotten the exact replica EPP
it<00:01:24.270> fully<00:01:24.630> closed<00:01:25.939> but<00:01:26.939> this<00:01:27.900> quad<00:01:28.229> side<00:01:28.500> wall

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
it fully closed but this quad side wall

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
it fully closed but this quad side wall
kind<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.130> accounts<00:01:29.820> for<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.390> flare<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
kind of accounts for that flare of the

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.230 
kind of accounts for that flare of the
Nemesis<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> essentially<00:01:32.549> got<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.880> exact

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
Nemesis so I essentially got the exact

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.840 
Nemesis so I essentially got the exact
same<00:01:33.420> pocket<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.320> here<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.460> don't

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
same pocket so here is a little I don't

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.609 
same pocket so here is a little I don't
know<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.119> got<00:01:39.240> both<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> little

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
know if I got both in there a little

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.510 
know if I got both in there a little
side<00:01:40.950> by<00:01:41.100> side<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.409> think<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.250> did<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.460> pretty

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
side by side so I think I did a pretty

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.719 
side by side so I think I did a pretty
good<00:01:44.790> job<00:01:45.170> my<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.290> nemi's<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> little<00:01:47.220> little

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
good job my other nemi's a little little

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.719 
good job my other nemi's a little little
on<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.820> money<00:01:48.030> side<00:01:48.829> went<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:49.950> wanted<00:01:50.640> to

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
on the money side went out wanted to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.179 
on the money side went out wanted to
test<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.780> shots<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.530> see<00:01:52.920> how<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
test some shots on this see how it

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
test some shots on this see how it
reacts<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.880> rebounds<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.020> real<00:01:55.200> like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
reacts like rebounds if it's a real like

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.249 
reacts like rebounds if it's a real like
stiff<00:01:55.979> rigid<00:01:56.219> head<00:01:56.579> which<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> seems<00:01:57.899> like<00:01:58.110> it

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
stiff rigid head which it seems like it

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.740 
stiff rigid head which it seems like it
will<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:58.710> these<00:01:58.979> support<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.509> one

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
will be because these support and one

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.310 
will be because these support and one
cool<00:02:00.990> thing<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.380> saw<00:02:01.590> that<00:02:01.799> they<00:02:01.950> did<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:03.320> it

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
cool thing I saw that they did is it

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.109 
cool thing I saw that they did is it
kind<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.560> bored<00:02:04.829> out<00:02:05.040> some<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.460> these<00:02:05.549> supports

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
kind of bored out some of these supports

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.630 
kind of bored out some of these supports
here<00:02:06.710> you<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.799> make<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.250> little<00:02:08.399> lighter

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
here you know make it a little lighter

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.059 
here you know make it a little lighter
give<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.209> couple<00:02:09.390> extra<00:02:09.629> holes<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.590> know<00:02:10.709> for

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
give a couple extra holes you know for

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.339 
give a couple extra holes you know for
side<00:02:11.250> wall<00:02:11.459> while<00:02:12.360> still<00:02:12.690> keeping<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.080> rigid

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
side wall while still keeping it rigid

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.980 
side wall while still keeping it rigid
but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
but

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.240 
but
taking<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.650> full<00:02:15.430> support<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.410> rather<00:02:18.100> than

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
taking out full support so rather than

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.370 
taking out full support so rather than
becoming<00:02:18.910> flexible<00:02:19.510> up<00:02:19.630> here<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> seems<00:02:20.230> like

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
becoming flexible up here it seems like

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.150 
becoming flexible up here it seems like
it's<00:02:20.530> going<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.740> remain<00:02:21.010> fairly<00:02:22.000> stiff<00:02:23.160> but

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
it's going to remain fairly stiff but

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.030 
it's going to remain fairly stiff but
that's<00:02:24.430> also<00:02:24.640> my<00:02:24.990> pre<00:02:26.040> shooting<00:02:27.040> demo

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
that's also my pre shooting demo

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.490 
that's also my pre shooting demo
prediction<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.780> once<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.170> out<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
prediction so once I get it out on the

prediction so once I get it out on the
field<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.250> fields<00:02:33.550> kind<00:02:33.730> of<00:02:33.790> dry<00:02:34.000> up<00:02:34.150> a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
field and the fields kind of dry up a

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.660 
field and the fields kind of dry up a
little<00:02:34.450> bit<00:02:34.570> because<00:02:35.160> most<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.310> guys<00:02:36.460> know

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
little bit because most you guys know

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
little bit because most you guys know
what<00:02:37.540> do<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.690> get<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.810> brand<00:02:38.080> new<00:02:38.200> stick<00:02:38.500> the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
what do you get a brand new stick the

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.500 
what do you get a brand new stick the
last<00:02:38.860> thing<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.130> want<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> do<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.700> like<00:02:39.970> go<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
last thing you want to do is like go and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.840 
last thing you want to do is like go and
take<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:40.930> mud<00:02:41.110> first<00:02:41.470> day<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.850> that's

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
take it in the mud first day so that's

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.050 
take it in the mud first day so that's
why<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.090> didn't<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:45.160> basically<00:02:46.090> my<00:02:46.330> overall

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
why I didn't so basically my overall

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.640 
why I didn't so basically my overall
thoughts<00:02:49.060> on<00:02:49.330> it<00:02:49.510> is<00:02:49.630> it's<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.260> good<00:02:50.470> head

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
thoughts on it is it's a good head

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.830 
thoughts on it is it's a good head
especially<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.430> price<00:02:51.580> i<00:02:51.910> think<00:02:52.570> it's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
especially for the price i think it's

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.460 
especially for the price i think it's
only<00:02:53.080> selling<00:02:53.440> for<00:02:53.470> about<00:02:53.740> 75<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.450> it's<00:02:56.140> a<00:02:56.290> good

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
only selling for about 75 so it's a good

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.210 
only selling for about 75 so it's a good
value<00:02:56.650> head<00:02:57.600> it's<00:02:58.600> not<00:02:58.960> necessarily<00:02:59.920> just<00:03:00.100> a

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
value head it's not necessarily just a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.630 
value head it's not necessarily just a
beginner's<00:03:00.610> head<00:03:01.350> it<00:03:02.350> crosses<00:03:03.190> over<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:03.610> i

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
beginner's head it crosses over like i

want to use a wall or you can probably

leaves had the gate web for a while to

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.940 
leaves had the gate web for a while to
about<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.770> same<00:03:14.920> size<00:03:15.190> actually<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:17.650> it's

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
about the same size actually but it's

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.920 
about the same size actually but it's
still<00:03:18.310> legal<00:03:19.560> but<00:03:20.560> otherwise<00:03:21.690> basically<00:03:22.690> i

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
still legal but otherwise basically i

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.820 
still legal but otherwise basically i
can<00:03:23.500> get<00:03:23.620> into<00:03:23.860> some<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> stringing<00:03:25.140> i<00:03:26.140> got

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
can get into some of the stringing i got

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.980 
can get into some of the stringing i got
a<00:03:26.860> care<00:03:27.130> package<00:03:27.310> a<00:03:27.550> while<00:03:27.700> ago<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.120> ECM<00:03:28.750> black

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
a care package a while ago of ECM black

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.350 
a care package a while ago of ECM black
so<00:03:29.970> figured<00:03:30.970> i<00:03:31.180> would<00:03:31.690> use<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:31.930> in<00:03:32.320> this<00:03:32.500> and

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
so figured i would use that in this and

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.560 
so figured i would use that in this and
I<00:03:34.360> mean<00:03:35.170> it's<00:03:35.320> good<00:03:35.470> mesh<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:36.460> very<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.210> dry

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
I mean it's good mesh it's very it's dry

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.630 
I mean it's good mesh it's very it's dry
feeling<00:03:38.110> compared<00:03:38.620> to<00:03:39.660> the<00:03:40.660> older<00:03:40.990> ECM<00:03:41.710> which

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
feeling compared to the older ECM which

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.900 
feeling compared to the older ECM which
breaks<00:03:42.940> it<00:03:43.120> nice<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.480> quick<00:03:43.630> but<00:03:43.870> it's<00:03:44.910> it's

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
breaks it nice and quick but it's it's

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.900 
breaks it nice and quick but it's it's
also<00:03:46.090> a<00:03:46.540> little<00:03:47.320> stickier<00:03:47.830> depends<00:03:48.550> to<00:03:48.700> flake

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
also a little stickier depends to flake

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.120 
also a little stickier depends to flake
a<00:03:48.940> little<00:03:49.210> bit<00:03:49.300> this<00:03:50.140> however<00:03:50.320> didn't<00:03:50.890> really

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
a little bit this however didn't really

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.980 
a little bit this however didn't really
and<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.610> think<00:03:51.640> I<00:03:51.910> did<00:03:52.090> a<00:03:52.120> mess<00:03:52.390> review<00:03:52.690> on<00:03:52.840> it

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
and I think I did a mess review on it

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.980 
and I think I did a mess review on it
before<00:03:53.110> but<00:03:54.210> it's<00:03:55.210> a<00:03:55.330> very<00:03:55.360> high<00:03:55.720> quality

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
before but it's a very high quality

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.710 
before but it's a very high quality
match<00:03:56.350> stage<00:03:57.130> dry<00:03:57.400> doesn't<00:03:58.000> harden<00:03:58.420> in<00:03:58.630> the

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
cold like some of those stuff so I went

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.250 
cold like some of those stuff so I went
with<00:04:01.570> a<00:04:01.630> 20<00:04:01.990> diamond<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.500> yeah<00:04:03.040> 20<00:04:03.550> diamond<00:04:04.260> ECM

black<00:04:05.910> quad<00:04:06.910> sidewall<00:04:07.830> patterns<00:04:08.830> a<00:04:08.950> little

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
black quad sidewall patterns a little

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.980 
black quad sidewall patterns a little
screwy<00:04:09.520> just<00:04:09.850> because<00:04:10.030> of<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.209> way<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.810> the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
screwy just because of the way that the

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:15.540 
screwy just because of the way that the
side<00:04:11.680> wall<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:13.720> you<00:04:13.950> know<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.010> tried<00:04:15.280> for<00:04:15.520> a

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
side wall is but you know I tried for a

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.330 
side wall is but you know I tried for a
really<00:04:15.820> hard<00:04:16.120> pull<00:04:16.450> down<00:04:16.660> up<00:04:16.870> here<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:18.220> to

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
really hard pull down up here just to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.430 
really hard pull down up here just to
get<00:04:18.820> a<00:04:19.030> little<00:04:19.239> bit<00:04:19.450> of<00:04:19.480> stiffness<00:04:19.870> up<00:04:20.230> here

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
get a little bit of stiffness up here

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.650 
get a little bit of stiffness up here
because<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.520> sidewalls<00:04:22.360> are<00:04:22.479> open<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:24.660> it's

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
because the sidewalls are open so it's

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.900 
because the sidewalls are open so it's
harder<00:04:26.169> with<00:04:26.380> 20

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
harder with 20

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:28.840 
harder with 20
I'm<00:04:26.940> in<00:04:27.120> to<00:04:27.180> really<00:04:27.420> stretch<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.930> near<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.200> top

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
I'm in to really stretch it near the top

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.890 
I'm in to really stretch it near the top
but<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:30.650> think<00:04:31.880> aside<00:04:32.880> from<00:04:33.030> maybe<00:04:33.270> a<00:04:33.420> novice

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
but I think aside from maybe a novice

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.350 
but I think aside from maybe a novice
stringer<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:35.370> head<00:04:35.580> isn't<00:04:35.940> all<00:04:36.300> that

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
stringer this head isn't all that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.920 
stringer this head isn't all that
difficult<00:04:36.930> string<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:38.220> had<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.580> little<00:04:39.030> bit<00:04:39.180> but

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
difficult string I had a little bit but

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.770 
difficult string I had a little bit but
that<00:04:39.990> was<00:04:40.260> because<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:41.880> difficulty<00:04:42.510> came

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
that was because the difficulty came

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.680 
that was because the difficulty came
more<00:04:43.140> in<00:04:43.440> trying<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:44.810> get<00:04:46.490> this<00:04:47.490> head<00:04:47.790> a<00:04:48.150> pocket

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
more in trying to get this head a pocket

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.200 
more in trying to get this head a pocket
similar<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.380> the<00:04:49.800> head<00:04:49.980> that<00:04:50.190> I've<00:04:50.310> used<00:04:50.340> and

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
similar to the head that I've used and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.560 
similar to the head that I've used and
loved<00:04:51.450> for<00:04:51.570> many<00:04:51.840> years<00:04:52.170> so<00:04:53.070> I<00:04:53.490> tried<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.540> know

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
loved for many years so I tried you know

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.960 
loved for many years so I tried you know
obviously<00:04:55.170> there's<00:04:55.650> no<00:04:56.100> patterns<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.850> out

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
obviously there's no patterns really out

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.650 
obviously there's no patterns really out
there<00:04:57.120> for<00:04:57.360> this<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:59.060> I'm<00:05:00.060> not<00:05:00.360> one<00:05:00.630> for

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
there for this and I'm not one for

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.890 
there for this and I'm not one for
looking<00:05:01.260> them<00:05:01.410> up<00:05:01.560> anyway<00:05:02.090> so<00:05:03.090> basically<00:05:03.780> I

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
looking them up anyway so basically I

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.080 
looking them up anyway so basically I
just<00:05:04.170> tried<00:05:04.410> something<00:05:04.590> new<00:05:04.800> I'm<00:05:05.130> purely

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
just tried something new I'm purely

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.510 
just tried something new I'm purely
experimental<00:05:06.360> brand<00:05:07.320> new<00:05:07.440> head<00:05:07.650> so<00:05:08.040> I<00:05:08.070> figured

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
experimental brand new head so I figured

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.780 
experimental brand new head so I figured
why<00:05:08.700> not<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:10.110> like<00:05:10.770> I<00:05:10.800> said<00:05:10.920> for<00:05:11.100> a<00:05:11.370> novice

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
why not but like I said for a novice

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.610 
why not but like I said for a novice
stringer<00:05:12.210> probably<00:05:13.170> you're<00:05:13.320> going<00:05:13.440> to<00:05:13.500> have

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
stringer probably you're going to have

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.160 
stringer probably you're going to have
some<00:05:13.800> difficulty<00:05:14.720> somebody<00:05:15.720> that's<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:15.930> little

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
some difficulty somebody that's a little

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.680 
some difficulty somebody that's a little
more<00:05:16.560> advanced<00:05:16.910> you'll<00:05:17.910> eventually<00:05:18.180> figure

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
more advanced you'll eventually figure

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.110 
more advanced you'll eventually figure
it<00:05:18.810> out<00:05:19.190> but<00:05:20.240> for<00:05:21.240> me<00:05:21.360> it<00:05:21.540> took<00:05:21.660> me<00:05:21.840> about<00:05:22.020> maybe

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
it out but for me it took me about maybe

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.190 
it out but for me it took me about maybe
not<00:05:24.120> even<00:05:24.180> an<00:05:24.480> hour<00:05:24.630> to<00:05:24.900> come<00:05:25.050> up<00:05:25.170> with

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
not even an hour to come up with

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.680 
not even an hour to come up with
something<00:05:25.650> for<00:05:25.830> this<00:05:25.950> so<00:05:26.480> considering<00:05:27.480> bright

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
something for this so considering bright

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.910 
something for this so considering bright
new<00:05:27.870> head<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.490> coming<00:05:29.490> up<00:05:29.580> with<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.790> pattern<00:05:30.390> I

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
new head and coming up with a pattern I

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.800 
new head and coming up with a pattern I
took<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.130> out<00:05:32.250> kind<00:05:33.120> of<00:05:33.180> threw<00:05:33.360> a<00:05:33.390> little<00:05:33.600> low

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
took it out kind of threw a little low

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.780 
took it out kind of threw a little low
all<00:05:34.140> i<00:05:34.260> did<00:05:34.440> is<00:05:34.560> cinched<00:05:35.070> up<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.460> bottom

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:35.790 
all i did is cinched up the bottom

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.930 
all i did is cinched up the bottom
string<00:05:36.000> a<00:05:36.060> little<00:05:36.360> bit<00:05:36.510> it's<00:05:36.900> perfect<00:05:37.560> so<00:05:38.310> i

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
string a little bit it's perfect so i

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.000 
string a little bit it's perfect so i
might<00:05:39.330> have<00:05:39.480> to<00:05:39.510> do<00:05:39.660> it<00:05:39.750> again<00:05:39.870> want<00:05:40.230> to<00:05:40.320> see

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010 
might have to do it again want to see

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.960 
might have to do it again want to see
some<00:05:41.250> shots<00:05:41.550> but<00:05:42.110> otherwise<00:05:43.110> yet<00:05:43.530> it's

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
some shots but otherwise yet it's

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.010 
some shots but otherwise yet it's
perfectly<00:05:44.970> ok<00:05:45.890> nylon<00:05:46.890> three<00:05:47.250> straight<00:05:48.020> my

perfectly ok nylon three straight my

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.659 
perfectly ok nylon three straight my
usual<00:05:49.440> go-to<00:05:50.270> pretty<00:05:51.470> it's<00:05:52.470> a<00:05:52.680> modest<00:05:53.190> pocket

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
usual go-to pretty it's a modest pocket

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:57.620 
usual go-to pretty it's a modest pocket
not<00:05:53.880> not<00:05:54.210> huge<00:05:54.570> not<00:05:55.260> not<00:05:56.220> not<00:05:57.150> really<00:05:57.210> shallow

not not huge not not not really shallow

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.390 
not not huge not not not really shallow
either<00:05:57.960> so<00:05:58.919> um<00:06:00.200> overall<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.320> head<00:06:01.500> yeah<00:06:02.190> I

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
either so um overall the head yeah I

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.690 
either so um overall the head yeah I
would<00:06:02.669> say<00:06:02.850> definitely<00:06:03.530> um<00:06:04.530> you<00:06:05.490> might<00:06:05.640> want

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
would say definitely um you might want

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.820 
would say definitely um you might want
to<00:06:05.910> check<00:06:05.970> one<00:06:06.210> of<00:06:06.300> these<00:06:06.390> out<00:06:06.570> and<00:06:08.180> yeah<00:06:09.830> aside

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
to check one of these out and yeah aside

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.070 
to check one of these out and yeah aside
from<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:11.240> hopefully<00:06:12.240> all<00:06:12.360> your<00:06:12.540> seasons<00:06:12.960> are

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
from that hopefully all your seasons are

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.800 
from that hopefully all your seasons are
going<00:06:13.320> well<00:06:13.590> and<00:06:14.040> I<00:06:14.820> think<00:06:15.120> a<00:06:15.390> couple<00:06:15.419> of<00:06:15.690> them

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
going well and I think a couple of them

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.420 
going well and I think a couple of them
are<00:06:15.900> wrapping<00:06:16.200> up<00:06:16.290> at<00:06:16.470> least<00:06:16.560> for<00:06:16.740> college

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
are wrapping up at least for college

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.610 
are wrapping up at least for college
guys<00:06:17.640> it<00:06:18.000> was<00:06:18.150> pretty<00:06:18.330> soon<00:06:18.630> and<00:06:20.000> yeah

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
guys it was pretty soon and yeah

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.810 
guys it was pretty soon and yeah
