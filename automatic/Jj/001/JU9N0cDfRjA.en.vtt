00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.890
 welcome to the channel 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.559
 brazil trix i'm a fan 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'm here today to do the tutorial 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.130
 universe turn the reverse walt 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.139
 Let's call it a setback here in Brazil. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.609
 to stay easy reverse right 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.199
 so that's it before you start 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.390
 I'll tell you a story soon. 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.119
 It's imperative that you 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.010
 the always come back right because he 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.640
 will be the basis for the recess does not have 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.230
 other 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 The easiest way you learn is 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.080
 through your football, you should 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.669
 here o 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.380
 if you do not know how to perform this movement 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.940
 learn to make the first one for the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.190
 Reverse tutorial here goes to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.300
 Structural here he learned then 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.920
 Come back home. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.899
 the second moment you will need me 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.789
 I love teaching this way it's going to be the 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.320
 chic uncertainty 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.170
 so if you do not know how to kick the tornado 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.570
 still training become learned become 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.090
 preference for the same side as you 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.469
 run the site back because there the 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.789
 repayment will be much much easier 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.649
 to learn if you have a strong sector 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.120
 hug and the tornado preferably for the 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.680
 same side if you can not help it 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.199
 damage to the same side learn what 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 is missing to the opposite side and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.380
 then I came to capture the reverse of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.630
 china is going to be too complicated people 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.250
 learn in the puzzle if you hurt and 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.250
 anyway how to avoid it there 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.479
 it is important that you find a 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.400
 wall and preference at the time of 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.950
 waist and preferably that it be a 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.350
 too wide for you to sit on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.390
 it will be essential to sit on it. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.100
 the wall around the grass that is 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.140
 concrete but here is to record your car 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.090
 fall there her mother already hurt me a lot 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.380
 then starting the tutorial from the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.320
 reverse 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.630
 I'll break the reverse into three parts 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.909
 holy 3 progressions three steps first 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.159
 step is going to be the next one we'll go 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.590
 start the reverse as if you were to make a 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.240
 siege to lap is obviously the same for 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.500
 a progression of this movement 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.780
 so we will put this new 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.399
 Putting it down only what changes in the 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.210
 you have the option to use the two 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.430
 hands 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.310
 so why proceeded to assault you 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.590
 reach the left hand that rate and I've already climbed 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.310
 to perform the step number that will be 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.810
 simply sit and turn around or 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.730
 you can score with the right hand 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.769
 also the ball with my left hand but I 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.420
 like the right hand also kind of 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.860
 to make sure I will not slip 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.610
 This hand is there just to mark 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.440
 She's no use, she marks and leaves. 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.420
 right then there are two options that can 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.940
 be used two ways to run only 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.209
 a preference of yours then the first 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.220
 step will start the reverse by sitting 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.500
 on the wall turning over as if it had 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:41.980
 Running a tornado is that the tornado 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.019
 made useful then you will perform such 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.060
 as if he had run around 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:51.230
 this first step for you to become 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.970
 get used to the reverse drive 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.350
 until your gay brain because I already 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.720
 I got used to it, it's not very close. 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.549
 step by step number 2 will run 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.690
 at that moment a little faster 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.700
 so you're going to need it now 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.870
 add a bit more speed of 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.250
 it's important that you come back 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.060
 reverse or is perfect because the 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.030
 last 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.340
 It's the same try here today this morning. 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.140
 here 12 common 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.910
 You learn that I do not know that 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.030
 conservatory will not teach the step 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.590
 register here because you learn there anyway 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.200
 whether to accept the same from one palace 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.280
 only with more speed your brain 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.790
 and start processing faster 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:31.100
 the right reverse then a little bit in 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.630
 A little bit add more speed 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:34.430
 depending on its shape its speed 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.959
 you can do this the 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.490
 a week from now 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:38.720
 nobody needs to learn everything in the same 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.650
 newspaper 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.090
 step number 3 and the final step will be 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.940
 over the world without touching the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.239
 butt on the wall so here is you 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.910
 will try even if you challenge and try 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.270
 perform moves on touching the butt in the 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.520
 motor 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.900
 so that you run the third 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.910
 step is necessary that the second step 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.950
 fluent 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.200
 too much to the point that you say to yourself 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.280
 Even I'm going to jump a little higher. 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.410
 so the band simply is not enough 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.340
 reverse executive if you can not 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.350
 do it there 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.310
 face step 3 means your 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.840
 step 2 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.239
 it's still bad you need to run 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.540
 one more step 2 or maybe even one 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.590
 so I can 3 to 1 slowly your mother 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.590
 is performed 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.350
 It seems easy but it 's easy It's even easy 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.820
 for those who already know become for those already 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.380
 has 17 reverse reverse 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.660
 if you are having problem with reverse 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.430
 because you do not yet have the basis of 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.830
 tornado and the base of his football the Basque 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.370
 come back there to be able to go through 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.960
 reverse easy and quiet 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.039
 To finish this tutorial, I'll go 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.259
 here two important information 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.389
 that apply to the right reverse 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:52.800
 the first is when you even risk 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.970
 you can choose to land with the 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.820
 two legs 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.830
 or you can think with just one foot 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.030
 I recommend that you learn both by 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.130
 being with both legs is important 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.410
 for you one day make a reverse 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.330
 need for example this with a 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.070
 leg at a time add influence 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.860
 then for your movement in the sequence 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:13.349
 fluent and can leave you with the leg 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.000
 Otherwise this is the tutorial and if 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:17.070
 you missed the last two sectoral 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.570
 that we even made a chat kit with 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.340
 of parkour and the 360 ​​pop of shopping one 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.810
 of young people easier for you to learn 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.330
 and who is interested in getting the 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.949
 hacking a lot of people have asked to 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.020
 the people on the pants will go 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.120
 get out a new gray model will come out 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.440
 dark graffiti very much mass 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.090
 only here at the end of the month or at the beginning 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.409
 next month so for now it has 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.270
 which is all almost exhausted in three 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.949
 only pants left in store only 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.070
 who want to access the event page 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.599
 on facebook by the virtual store does not get the 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.400
 phone while there in the front and pick up 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.130
 but for now only by the same pc right 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.409
 this is what we see in the next 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.039
 brazil 3 responds to episode 4 on Thursday 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.550
 market 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:55.550
 thanks
