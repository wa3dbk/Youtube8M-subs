00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 i 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:06.470
 how are you people today? 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.050
 talk about a topic that asked me one of 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.460
 my friends is called selenne we are going to 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.320
 talk about the benefits of having a 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.870
 cat let's start with curious facts 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.400
 about cats the first curious fact 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.320
 about cats is that the month of August 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.050
 it is considered as the month of the cats 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.089
 but it is not so to say some 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.159
 festivity or something that is given to 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:28.310
 cats but because in this month is when 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:31.720
 the moon is brighter at night 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.360
 on the moons of August but this that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.250
 cause the cats in the cats so 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.800
 your gestation period looks like 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.350
 your doubts are disturbed your hormones 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.240
 then in that in that month of August it is 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.160
 when cats are more crazy 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:51.380
 now they go into heat and all the 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.180
 cities where there are cats are heard 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.190
 much much more cats that are 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.630
 disturbed by all the streets because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.520
 in the month of August as it is more 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.880
 lit up at night and these are 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.950
 nocturnal animals this one generates them 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.650
 a feeling that the time has come 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.240
 of mating or mating and then the 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.770
 cats go crazy so much 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.810
 that the month of August is considered the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.939
 month of the cats second curious fact of 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.530
 the cats is that black cats are 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.600
 considered unlucky but it is not 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.020
 because they are, but because they are given a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 relationship with witches but it's not that 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.229
 be unlucky because in itself the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.000
 most of the animals that are colored 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.610
 Black is said to be unlucky 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.770
 like the black crow that is a bird of 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.539
 bad omen like the black dog that 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.179
 considers that when people see it 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.869
 his death is near there is also 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.429
 many other animals or they are black 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.289
 black pigeons and there are many animals that 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.750
 they are considered unlucky but it is not 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.490
 because they have bad luck but because of 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.799
 black color and by the superstitions of 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.740
 the good people third data and curious of 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.020
 cats is that cats do not transpire 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.759
 that is, they can not sweat on their own 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.649
 then he will always know that this one 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.899
 is licking to refresh your body 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.179
 because as they can not sweat a way 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:04.700
 to cool off a bit is to be in 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:06.500
 salivating and cleaning is a little the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.720
 fourth curious fact is that cats are 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.759
 of the animals that messes least and 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 considered as one of the animals most 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.490
 clean inside 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.470
 variety of animals 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.540
 the fifth curious fact is that all 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.640
 people who own cats has 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.070
 demonstrated second a study by the 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.770
 buffalo university is that they are 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.870
 reduces blood pressure then this 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.180
 encourages minor to what would be stress 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.310
 in people and it gives them a feeling 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.650
 of relaxation by having the company of 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.320
 a pet and they say that the cats then 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.480
 by purring they also help a lot 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.880
 that people relax this is a 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.140
 study that was done at the university 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.090
 Buffalo and took runners 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.590
 24 years and older that have not yet been 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.080
 gave medication and others were given 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.090
 pets to keep them company 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.650
 and according to this study with people 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.260
 that they were medicated if the people who 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.140
 they were with pets or a greater 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.670
 depression in the blood pressure of 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.530
 people who had pets that from the 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.810
 people who were only taking 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.370
 the medication then this is another one of 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.530
 the benefits to having a cat in 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.060
 house that makes them good company those 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.130
 are some curious facts that we can 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.240
 find about cats then 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.610
 I 'm going to talk about some of the 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:20.069
 benefits of cats cats are 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.870
 animals that are very calm in fact 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:24.019
 they do not get upset as much as if 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.639
 dogs that can be a little more 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.920
 playful a little more hyperactive the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.049
 cats can be very calm and 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.200
 also very independent one like 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.569
 owner of a cat can leave it hours and 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.939
 there will be no problems that it will be 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.549
 the cat 6-13 somehow and when 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:43.769
 arrives is altered a lot to see your 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:45.750
 presence cats are animals very 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.939
 independent but not so to speak 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.739
 they are disinterested of their masters in fact 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.419
 They are very affectionate animals but once 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.639
 who already have some confidence or already 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:55.950
 they have a lot of time living with their 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.870
 owners also cats like you 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.669
 also cats as they are one of the 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.230
 cleanest animals there were no 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.790
 you have to bathe every 15 days 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.469
 you only have to give them some 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.329
 how many times a year and with that 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.129
 keep clean is another of the 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.769
 benefits that there may be in a cat not 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:13.230
 another of the benefits that we have 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.849
 cats is that they also help you 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.669
 Keep your home clean of pests like 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.470
 they can be cockroach mice 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.710
 bats bugs any kind of 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.389
 plague these are eliminated by cats 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.949
