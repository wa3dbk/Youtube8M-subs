 It is Well hot hot is the number of Haydn Good evening the number of channels 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:17.910
 Well, it's 45 degrees without blowing the temperature aim of current cpu . 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:20.040
 It is the key to this export video , and then the temperature rises sharply and you get 66 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.340
 Oh I already give it back 1 minute face mate 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:27.850
 I'm going to go around 77.578 near 80 degrees 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:32.860
 Yes, it is cpu cooler replacement today 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.690
 I have I purchased today Kedomo I'm a retail cooler and Well this other stuff using 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.010
 I think comes out not with wearing of by there will Yongkang path box also tune in here. 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.379
 But it is exceptional 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:50.629
 Well then 8 things t 40 try to buy things recommended 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.199
 It 's too fast, let's get in on the exchange method, and you want to start working right away. 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.880
 I'm sorry 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:58.210
 It is off a decent power It is a First Horizontal Well then 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.240
 Let's remove all cables temporarily in Japan 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 Hey it is in front will continue to dandruff more of here 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.890
 Good 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.310
 but I have seen Let's do here i here the ne little other in a this is it 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.659
 It is a retail cooler Eh-this is now an exchange 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:21.580
 a First of all, I 'm removing this , but it's time I thought 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.580
 The masu If there was a do face let alone remove this connector Monechotto 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.220
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:33.720
 Yes , so it's a work to be done from now on 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:38.550
 I think that kinda want to take this grease it first I kinda clean to clean 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.020
 How do you feel like I'm getting clean I bought this time in Ison and I have something to do right away 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.720
 Let's check 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.780
 Yes I wonder if it was either Esaido flow It is the people of 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.880
 It means that you do not disturb in the air 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.140
 Child I color in me something 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.760
 This of Japan's world of books 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 a 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:03.420
 Anyway is it this magnitude comparator Then look dividing of Koch feather genuine guy 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 There is a difference between the dog and the Chin來 I dogs and team 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.300
 So there are this attachment after Come After suffering only when absorbing Ne heel YoKon 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.230
 this 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:17.540
 I think that how to assemble properly can be easily done with this manual 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.439
 What is this a little difficult but the point is this 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:26.270
 I feel like it is written me something white variety from the back side of the substrate 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:31.460
 I'm doing a lot of troubles and cheap 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:34.490
 Yes zinc will come out even if I look at the instructions here 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.210
 Please check the installation cpu flap form and 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:44.110
 1 tt 4 in a This is what I 'm cooking from behind 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.110
 Plug in what you are saying 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:53.160
 Or rather I think it would be useless if this is true I think that it is dangerous or static electricity 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.610
 Let's be careful to be on the insulator that everyone 8 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.000
 Well right now I have installed this 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.239
 So I hope you look at the other side of this sheet metal 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.360
 It is this board It feels like I fixed this 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:10.780
 Then the next draft 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:15.970
 Kana This will be fixed in the You're 8 This large like this from here 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:20.800
 Yes now it's about fixing this board next time 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.190
 Then it was written that I applied the grease because it was the next work, but I bought it purposely 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.350
 Was 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:29.420
 there is a possibility that this time it is even a this Mazabo exchange 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:33.440
 This was something that came with me that it could be used for a while 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 So it kinda looks at Yes I would like to use here of grease one this time 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.690
 Ene and cormorant Nyotto It is the grease towards the cpa 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 Is it like this 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:46.320
 I wrote Nante in Son this please rim 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.650
 vip is in Star ation 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.370
 Do not remove it before installing it 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.830
 The other I was back by cod of here in Son Do a one that went by removing such other This 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.840
 I had kicked almost all stand it all 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.110
 Yes Yes 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.140
 Please do not forgive me like this 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.069
 I also have to think about the air flow 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.130
 Well then I will do this 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.330
 This school 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:17.900
 I wonder if it's horse racing and it's good 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:21.440
 Looking at something like this board 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.240
 a Then it is fixed with natto next 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.920
 Kneaded incense spanner that comes in picture book 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.730
 There are fixed by Tiger 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:35.660
 If and or cheek was this 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:42.800
 Ahead Tcha Nde there this cpu fan in Son 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.910
 It fits into the socket for the cpu and return here it is in love tanto restored raised 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.600
 Shall we 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.940
 i1 like this all in the way of installation 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:54.170
 More 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:54.170
 In than has returned I would like to do so Te' from it is if it works properly now 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.710
 Hey Wait 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:08.750
 It is hitting what your code 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:11.400
 Aichan and sister and Ann started moving 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:15.400
 Better return now to the inner 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:19.800
 Press fun to learn setup error 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.800
 Is that so? 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.830
 I wonder what I bought 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.169
 Just a minute 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:30.729
 no hard disk 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.729
 Naa had been Well write me no hard disk 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.180
 missing operating system position 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.710
 i really do not have to spend a few days, but there were many of you 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.949
 You 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:54.139
 It became 8 0 gold venue and was variously messed up 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:57.590
 The day after the shooting took place on the day after shooting, but with Ev j dedicated personal computer movement 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.020
 The conditions are different in picture book a little bit again 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:05.930
 Is it 12 degrees lower ? 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:09.979
 8 cp temperature as of 42. Where is the bread changed? 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:16.789
 Let's get into the cpu outright setting where it gets wonderfully hot 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:17.120
 Yes it is and Pai will continue to work hard hit by Ayyyappari temperature 51 we have the same station 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.009
 The 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:26.309
 It's almost a minute later, but 8 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:26.969
 It's around 54 degrees The question is different from yesterday, but I think that there will also be some influence there 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:31.469
 But 

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:37.649
 Compared to that, it's still quite a bit before the temperature rise 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:39.360
 As it came out at around 80 degrees, it feels like it is early if this is settled at 54 degrees This time retail 

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:40.000
 It is this from the cooler 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.270
 atf 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.400
 We exchanged for thing called p 40 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:53.290
 It's a little bit I think it was sweet and how to apply grease , but it's too cute 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:57.070
 cpu has become cold, and no, if the result of this time is decided 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:07:00.020
 The other I honestly Do not use this detail is not anymore 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:06.169
 There is only a big, and the cat pattern is really good 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:10.819
 a It's a line so this is the price you care about, but also here ats 5 minutes t 40 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:13.110
 It is sold for around 5,000 yen in a fee , and if you explain, it is an orchid cafe that looks like this 

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:31.550
 Even if you paste the page link 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:31.550
 Boober adaa pakipaki だ ー ー ー ー -little attention Patinho 

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:36.520
 A little 

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:42.759
 You might also there to say just because the mounting severe 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:46.300
 I so As our What Is a Re there I guess that I now Related Videos previous cpu

 Video may dangerous and does not change before the summer and paste them in here. 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.120
 I have pasted my personal computer configuration at Amon . 

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:57.800
 Also this time I'm also writing a book on Bloom Interesting 

00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.949
 I'm very happy to see the current of the boom together with the video that you have up to the skill 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:05.180
 It is such a feeling that it is a few channels here after the war 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:13.110
