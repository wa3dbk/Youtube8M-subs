 but the money for the ticket and not at all with this 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.360
 expert.ru great random lottery 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.250

 bake the troll later my enough is enough 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.390
 tolerate the shade is good because firstly 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.430
 it's the best passive in the world 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 passivation which does not allow with this 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.619
 troll and heading passivate him 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 which gives the head to anyone who 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.110
 trying to hurt the little 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.530

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.510
 mill 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.329
 midone that is particularly interesting if 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.430
 great tos great toast that can 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 throwing a troll is just generally simple 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.969
 Throw you cards would be awesome 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 it was possible to do so there is darkness 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.170
 females do not rush perfectly but there is ulta 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 before the fire the driver collect just 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.879
 troll face breaking troll in this 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.469
 plan less interesting hero yes there is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.109
 near and there is a long-range attack 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.120
 there is a great ulta but by and large 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 the odds are not that great because the shadows gives 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 camp camp camp camp sun 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.850
 Well, again passive shadow 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.280
 about which we must not forget but ourselves 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.560
 see yes pull back to stand as 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.240
 stand as the camp trolls do not have time 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.030
 react because i'll be too 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.460
 almost too cool 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.869
 There is no alternative to this case. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.640
 concerns and again the potential that morning he 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.810
 Of course higher trolls in the forest can be 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.430
 principle without any problems 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.939
 to come back 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.250
 teanika well, at first if the trolls 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.900
 have time to somehow dominate that is 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.110
 their chances are just stupid at the farm 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.439

 on the team of arcana you always have mana 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.670
