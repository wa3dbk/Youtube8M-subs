here<00:00:19.860> so<00:00:20.790> I'm<00:00:20.910> using<00:00:21.120> 332<00:00:21.990> cable<00:00:23.150> 7<00:00:24.150> by<00:00:24.300> 7<00:00:25.550> so<00:00:26.550> I

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
here so I'm using 332 cable 7 by 7 so I

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.340 
here so I'm using 332 cable 7 by 7 so I
got<00:00:27.210> our<00:00:27.360> ferrule<00:00:27.720> there<00:00:27.930> and<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.230> we're

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
got our ferrule there and then we're

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.250 
got our ferrule there and then we're
gonna<00:00:28.440> get<00:00:28.620> ourselves<00:00:28.800> a<00:00:29.040> camera<00:00:30.080> so<00:00:31.080> we

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
gonna get ourselves a camera so we

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.200 
gonna get ourselves a camera so we
insert<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:32.359> Faro<00:00:33.359> through<00:00:34.609> one<00:00:35.609> side<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.089> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
insert the Faro through one side of the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.860 
insert the Faro through one side of the
hole<00:00:37.160> then<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.190> grab<00:00:38.519> our<00:00:38.760> cam<00:00:39.149> lock<00:00:39.420> we<00:00:39.600> copped

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
hole then we grab our cam lock we copped

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.110 
hole then we grab our cam lock we copped
a<00:00:40.140> single<00:00:40.949> plate<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.519> put<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.820> through<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
a single plate and I put it through the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.299 
a single plate and I put it through the
hole<00:00:42.269> we<00:00:43.909> bring<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.030> end<00:00:45.179> back<00:00:45.510> through<00:00:46.309> and

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
hole we bring the end back through and

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.439 
hole we bring the end back through and
put<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.789> other<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.059> all<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
put it in the other two all of the

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.700 
put it in the other two all of the
Pharaoh<00:00:49.460> so<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.850> double<00:00:51.059> Pharaoh<00:00:51.710> so

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
Pharaoh so this is a double Pharaoh so

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.819 
Pharaoh so this is a double Pharaoh so
then<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.280> pull<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.640> tight<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
then we just pull it tight to get a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.739 
then we just pull it tight to get a
smaller<00:00:56.219> loop<00:00:58.069> and<00:00:59.069> then<00:00:59.249> unwind<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.449> bit<00:01:00.479> more

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:00.749 
smaller loop and then unwind a bit more

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.180 
smaller loop and then unwind a bit more
cable<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.409> I've<00:01:01.499> got<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.679> roll<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:03.739> 551<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:04.950> so

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
cable so I've got a roll of 551 here so

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.020 
cable so I've got a roll of 551 here so
I<00:01:05.220> should<00:01:05.340> last<00:01:05.670> me<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.120> 100<00:01:06.360> anyways<00:01:07.370> so<00:01:08.370> I

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
put our loop at the end so I'll cut that

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:55.280 
put our loop at the end so I'll cut that
there<00:01:50.480> with<00:01:51.480> our<00:01:51.630> wire<00:01:52.110> cutting<00:01:52.500> pliers<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
there with our wire cutting pliers so we

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.640 
there with our wire cutting pliers so we
guard<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.710> now<00:01:56.780> so<00:01:57.780> what<00:01:57.990> we're<00:01:58.110> gonna<00:01:58.170> do<00:01:58.470> is

guard that now so what we're gonna do is

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.280 
guard that now so what we're gonna do is
uh<00:01:59.390> put<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.540> end<00:02:00.720> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.900> wire<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.770> whole

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
uh put the end of the wire and a whole

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.690 
uh put the end of the wire and a whole
piece<00:02:04.290> of<00:02:05.000> the<00:02:06.000> lock<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> now<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.009> got<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.459> in

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
piece of the lock so now we got that in

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.869 
piece of the lock so now we got that in
so<00:02:09.450> now<00:02:09.719> it's<00:02:09.959> pretty<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.259> me<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> snare

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
so now it's pretty much me the snare

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.420 
so now it's pretty much me the snare
so<00:02:12.209> we<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.319> check<00:02:13.560> if<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:13.769> works<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.219> you

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
so we just check if it works good you

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.530 
so we just check if it works good you
see<00:02:14.609> it's<00:02:14.760> already<00:02:14.909> going<00:02:15.150> down<00:02:15.950> with<00:02:16.950> ease<00:02:17.370> so

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
see it's already going down with ease so

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.739 
see it's already going down with ease so
now<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.599> grab<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.959> lot<00:02:19.170> another<00:02:19.349> Faro<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.629> we

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:21.749 
now we grab a lot another Faro and we

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:28.729 
now we grab a lot another Faro and we
put<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.049> through<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.409> little<00:02:22.620> hole<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.560> then

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
put it through the little hole and then

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.330 
put it through the little hole and then
we<00:02:28.829> have<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.069> bring<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:29.400> back<00:02:29.430> around<00:02:31.129> and<00:02:32.129> put

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
we have to bring it back around and put

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.360 
we have to bring it back around and put
it<00:02:32.370> back<00:02:32.579> to<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.909> other<00:02:33.030> hole<00:02:33.920> seam<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.129> the

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it back to the other hole seam is the

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.509 
it back to the other hole seam is the
other<00:02:35.579> side<00:02:35.939> I<00:02:36.239> would<00:02:36.900> just<00:02:37.139> pull<00:02:37.349> it<00:02:37.469> tight<00:02:37.709> to

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
other side I would just pull it tight to

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.909 
other side I would just pull it tight to
make<00:02:38.639> a<00:02:38.700> smaller<00:02:39.060> loop<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.530> we'll<00:02:40.620> bring<00:02:40.769> our

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:40.919 
make a smaller loop and we'll bring our

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:43.670 
make a smaller loop and we'll bring our
lock<00:02:41.129> back<00:02:41.400> up<00:02:41.930> so<00:02:42.930> when<00:02:43.079> I<00:02:43.169> will<00:02:43.349> measure<00:02:43.530> it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
lock back up so when I will measure it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.920 
lock back up so when I will measure it
to<00:02:44.129> make<00:02:44.400> sure<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.969> around<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.450> length<00:02:45.719> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
to make sure it's around the length you

minutes take your time once you get
going<00:04:00.359> and<00:04:00.479> goes<00:04:00.719> a<00:04:00.750> lot<00:04:00.900> faster<00:04:01.169> in<00:04:01.739> Nueva<00:04:02.629> so

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629
