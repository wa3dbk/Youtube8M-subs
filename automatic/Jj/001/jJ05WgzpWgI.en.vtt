you're going to do your hair for the

you're going to do your hair for the

first time on all natural hair the

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.610 
first time on all natural hair the
reason<00:02:09.970> I<00:02:10.239> say<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.479> is<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:10.929> they<00:02:11.590> have

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
reason I say that is because they have

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.410 
reason I say that is because they have
specially<00:02:12.340> formulated

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
specially formulated

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.980 
specially formulated
a<00:02:13.470> color<00:02:14.470> system<00:02:14.709> for<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.250> root<00:02:15.430> area<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.090> in

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
a color system for the root area and in

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.650 
a color system for the root area and in
a<00:02:17.319> separate<00:02:17.739> color<00:02:17.980> system<00:02:18.489> for<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.060> areas<00:02:19.510> on

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
a separate color system for the areas on

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.290 
a separate color system for the areas on
the<00:02:19.780> ends<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.290> hair<00:02:20.319> this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.550> lot<00:02:22.120> more

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
the ends of the hair this is a lot more

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.850 
the ends of the hair this is a lot more
detailed<00:02:22.840> than<00:02:22.959> something<00:02:23.410> you<00:02:23.500> might<00:02:23.650> find

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
detailed than something you might find

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.680 
detailed than something you might find
in<00:02:24.069> the<00:02:24.130> supermarket<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:25.209> little<00:02:25.510> bit

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
in the supermarket and a little bit

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.870 
in the supermarket and a little bit
closer<00:02:26.020> to<00:02:26.440> what<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.800> colorist<00:02:27.310> might<00:02:27.520> do<00:02:27.730> to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
closer to what a colorist might do to

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.910 
closer to what a colorist might do to
you<00:02:27.970> at<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.599> salon<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.260> sink<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.830> the

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
you at the salon of the sink on the

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.160 
you at the salon of the sink on the
roots<00:02:30.160> so<00:02:30.700> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:31.090> this<00:02:31.420> is<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.600> great<00:02:31.870> way<00:02:32.140> to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
roots so I think this is a great way to

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.540 
roots so I think this is a great way to
go

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
go

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180 
go
rather<00:02:34.510> than<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:34.959> supermarket<00:02:35.260> if<00:02:35.770> you<00:02:35.980> can't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
rather than the supermarket if you can't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.239 
rather than the supermarket if you can't
make<00:02:36.340> it<00:02:36.489> into<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.819> colorist
