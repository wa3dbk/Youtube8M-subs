00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.530 
brought blush I've been wearing it I've
tried<00:03:24.109> initially<00:03:24.950> looks<00:03:25.160> very<00:03:25.489> frosted<00:03:26.269> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
tried initially looks very frosted and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.289 
tried initially looks very frosted and
kind<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.560> scary<00:03:27.799> actually<00:03:28.129> but<00:03:28.730> i've<00:03:29.150> been

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
kind of scary actually but i've been

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:31.180 
kind of scary actually but i've been
using<00:03:29.510> it's<00:03:29.840> such<00:03:30.140> a<00:03:30.170> pretty<00:03:30.409> natural<00:03:30.739> tone

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
using it's such a pretty natural tone

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.229 
using it's such a pretty natural tone
color<00:03:31.549> and<00:03:32.049> i'm<00:03:33.049> really<00:03:33.799> liking<00:03:34.459> it<00:03:34.790> and<00:03:35.060> i

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
color and i'm really liking it and i

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:36.490 
color and i'm really liking it and i
think<00:03:35.269> it's<00:03:35.569> really<00:03:35.780> good<00:03:35.930> for<00:03:36.049> fall<00:03:36.260> because

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
think it's really good for fall because

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.729 
think it's really good for fall because
it's<00:03:36.709> not<00:03:36.890> as<00:03:37.069> much<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.400> like<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:38.170> pink<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.500> has

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.319 
it's not as much of like a pink it has
more<00:03:39.920> like<00:03:40.129> peachy<00:03:40.519> undercover<00:03:40.970> but<00:03:41.150> i<00:03:41.209> would

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
more like peachy undercover but i would

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.390
