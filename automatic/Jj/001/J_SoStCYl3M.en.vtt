00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.800
All right everyone, welcome to Tomahawk DIY.  

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.019
today we'll be taking a look at
accessing the hard drive

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.480
on a Dell Inspiron laptop.  

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.460
First, you want to make sure 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.029
the computer has been disconnected 
of all peripheral devices, 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.289
unplugged the power cable, remove the battery.  

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.420
Once you’ve removed the battery, 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.759
push the power button to be sure to 
discharge any 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:43.550
residual electricity within the computer 
and then we’ll access the hard drive 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.080
by removing screw

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.400
and then use your fingers

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.720
to pull up this panel that takes a little 
bit of force 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.700
and once you get under it you’ll start hearing 
clicking as 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.720
you pop off the latches until finally 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.920
you can remove this entire panel.  
Here’s the RAM module.  

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.010
You can see my other video on installation 
of that RAM.  

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.250
to get the hard drive out, you've got a 
tab here

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.300
you can see the connectors and some screws 
holding things in place.  

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.800
So we’re going to start by 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.650
moving these 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:36.410
screws 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:58.090
simply with a small Phillps screwdriver. 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.190
To remove the hard drive assembly use this
tab

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:07.600
and kind of pull on this bracket to 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.280
work the hard drive you’re disconnecting 
over here.  

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.290
Then, you’ll use the tab to lift it out.  
Slide it out. 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.550
once you have the hard drive assembly free

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.750
you can now use your Philips screwdriver, 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.319
we’re going to make a little space here.  

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:40.859
Simply unscrew these 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.730
four screws from the frame.
Be careful not to lose

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.730
your hard drive or drop it in the 
process.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.299
Also,

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.590
use care and caution on what you're

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.709
holding onto, obviously. Try not to 
touch anything

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:10.159
that might get damaged and

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.560
you'll eventually have the hard drive
free.
