this visit our cover one of the resource

both<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:26.570> dual<00:03:26.810> storage<00:03:27.470> are<00:03:27.709> actually<00:03:28.400> you

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
both the dual storage are actually you

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.449 
both the dual storage are actually you
know<00:03:29.200> far<00:03:30.200> away<00:03:30.440> from<00:03:30.500> each<00:03:30.860> other<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.430> that

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
know far away from each other so that

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.550 
know far away from each other so that
they<00:03:31.790> will<00:03:31.880> not<00:03:32.030> be<00:03:32.180> taken<00:03:32.510> now<00:03:32.690> at<00:03:32.959> one<00:03:33.230> shot

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
they will not be taken now at one shot

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.800 
they will not be taken now at one shot
the<00:03:34.310> reason<00:03:34.610> why<00:03:34.760> I<00:03:34.790> put<00:03:35.030> an<00:03:35.120> archer<00:03:35.540> here

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
the reason why I put an archer here

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.960 
the reason why I put an archer here
because<00:03:36.170> it<00:03:36.500> actually<00:03:36.650> protects<00:03:37.549> the<00:03:37.730> town

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
because it actually protects the town

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.259 
because it actually protects the town
hall<00:03:38.239> from<00:03:39.140> some<00:03:39.799> of<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.040> troops<00:03:40.250> attack<00:03:40.760> who

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
hall from some of the troops attack who

hall from some of the troops attack who
just<00:03:41.720> one<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.859> know<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.310> town<00:03:43.670> hall<00:03:43.910> for

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150
