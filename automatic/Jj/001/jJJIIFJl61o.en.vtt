00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.900
 let's show the process 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.020
 of fabric manufacture and with few 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.179
 the group 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:13.139
 basic first as how of the teacher and then we will show the elements that 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.799
 apply will do it with by e 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.529
 a container 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.230
 a container that houses solitos that you want this container at least 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.349
 houses approximately 20 liters 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.480
 then this water the important thing of telecom has is that the water is water 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.470
 rain 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.440
 juana vázquez to rest 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.560
 for three four or five days after the environment 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.519
 so that chlorine does not have a presence in it 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.730
 the vegetable is vital that the water is without presence of chlorine then 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.740
 of this vast reposado to the interperie before five days approximately with the 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.550
 Sun 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.600
 the temperature scanner and the chlorine to the disappeared 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 But to start moving forward, you need an aeration process 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.490
 so 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.170
 we have gotten this little engine that is an aquarium compressor 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.180
 normal 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.090
 what 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 the investigations of the sun that can go 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.090
 we will work 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.480
 in a pond of 200 to 300 liters 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.030
 we have placed a little hose 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.500
 we have put 1 little kisses for whoever they are 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.010
 in the background 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.640
 and good is round dissimulation and this straight 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.200
 i the function of it is that eta 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 will come out i like air bubbles 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.030
 to 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.350
 never and of compost argel and precisely that the microorganisms that 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.530
 can develop min 10 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.330
 we are going to introduce the hoses 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
 inside him inside the water 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.180
 and we are going to turn on the compressor 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.010
 press malcom press 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.000
 okay we observe that immediately the aeration process begins 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.110
 in the nymex the necessary to do 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.400
 the one that is little 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.460
 sand stones that sell specials well to make this effect but good 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.369
 us in order to recycle and not buy as much 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.369
 we drill the hoses and to the north 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:20.790
 we wanted to do let's add 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.459
 let's start making manufacturing 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.390
 now here we have milanesa 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.399
 They are in the room we buy a producer plays well 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.579
 microorganisms but 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.579
 in any country has molasses can serve 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:38.119
 Iowa 

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:40.409
 to place the molasses 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.109
 I could find what it does in another container but I do it 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.919
 militarily haiti 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.629
 a measure 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.849
 more or less 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.199
 I gave them about half a glass of molasses 

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.349
 the water 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.749
 and now 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.809
 what I do 

00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.809
 until now it has not been of 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.870
 bison lamelas ramona made the molasses costs 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.169
 Cádiz May 11 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:12.419
 Fascism 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:17.089
 some say that there is always placed in a little bit of hot water to 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.629
 crisis is the best case 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.219
 like you the week without depth 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.299
 let's see what it is 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.299
 in a couple of seconds the molasses is dissolved 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.320
 toc toc toc toc toon apon 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.140
 once done this ap let's add to efe would have activated the algae natural 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:41.829
 which can also be water so it is closer 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.269
 to the beach or I know it from the seaweed shreds the season equal result 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.179
 let's be like warming 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:52.179
 a trickle owed to the algae shooter 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.009
 sometimes all this is economic without a doubt 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:04:02.049
 I can not anymore we're not going to work with linares chemical materials and now 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.489
 here we have a later complement that has also been made with material 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:07.969
 recycling 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.119
 recycled paint tubes here are the earthworms 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.639
 here are the worms look 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.879
 reserve equipment to earthworms 

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:23.159
 in the process of composting activity is doing yes 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.900
 yes the big party here is directed 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:31.279
 what I love not having here 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.419
 in a warehouse also recycled as you can see 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.120
 and this leached together ap apart from a bus 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.379
 what has happened and in doha also inevitably 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:44.729
 let's place home 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.189
 Oxfam has decided years ago 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:53.559
 farah and making our efe that is part of a bus that are falling to 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:54.680
 container 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.529
 i follow the process 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.360
 I dedicate you postcard 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.069
 this container 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:02.939
 here we have 

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:04.599
 another container 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.839
 same 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:09.839
 also paint conditions 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.710
 here are the sampras worms 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.639
 processing the organic material 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.759
 through this sand duct the leached to this container 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:26.589
 certainly also recycled 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:31.400
 we are finishing 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.779
 I think this tea 

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:39.639
 these processes days ago the leachates we say 

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.830
 alconchel 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.830
 2 look 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:46.850
 there is 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.120
 reaches fall just stopped since 

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:56.900
 that the process goes out when the worm beds are irrigated was vainly vain 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:59.899
 columbus 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.360
 this process must be for at least three days receiving 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.559
 alignment 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:12.020
 and later 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.530
 we can use it directly on plants without risk of burning flowers 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:20.349
 and we can do it publicity 

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.059
 with a sprinkler 

00:06:22.059 --> 00:06:26.349
 or they can do it directly on the earth we have no problem like that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.849
 we should reduce the content of this one for example by placing 50% of 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.530
 from there, 50% chlorine-free water, what's really important 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.879
 with this we have a public light plant 

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.389
 and with low cost of bs
