much<00:02:31.140> away<00:02:31.380> but<00:02:31.820> my<00:02:32.820> question<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.780> this

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
much away but my question is is this

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.950 
much away but my question is is this
going<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.380> be<00:02:34.970> hinting<00:02:35.970> towards<00:02:36.330> another<00:02:36.540> game

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
going to be hinting towards another game

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
or is it going to be hinting towards

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.030 
or is it going to be hinting towards
something<00:02:38.790> maybe<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.390> PSB<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:40.650> God<00:02:40.890> of

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
something maybe for the PSB like God of

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.940 
something maybe for the PSB like God of
War<00:02:41.250> chain<00:02:41.520> chains<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.420> olympus<00:02:42.540> was<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.800> know
