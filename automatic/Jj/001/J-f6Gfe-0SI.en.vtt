instead climb the mountain now I already
climbed<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.189> there's<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> place<00:01:56.670> of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
climbed it because there's a place of

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.030 
climbed it because there's a place of
power<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.270> there<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> wanted<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.110> get<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.439> so<00:01:59.009> I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
power up there I wanted to get it so I

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.399 
power up there I wanted to get it so I
have<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.399> marker<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.000> top<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.930> once<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
have the marker to the top but once you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.980 
have the marker to the top but once you
come<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.770> here<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.369> pretty<00:02:03.360> much<00:02:03.540> will<00:02:03.719> loop

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
come up here you pretty much will loop

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.300 
come up here you pretty much will loop
this<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.500> you're<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> quest

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.150 
this and you're going to get a quest
item<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> glitch<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
item and that is going to glitch the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.940 
item and that is going to glitch the
quest<00:02:08.520> for<00:02:09.209> later<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.319> need<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> go

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
quest for later so now we need to go

quest for later so now we need to go
ahead<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.430> out<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.700> here<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.090> we're

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
ahead and get out of here and we're

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.940 
ahead and get out of here and we're
go<00:02:12.440> talk<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.310> guy<00:02:13.460> now<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.840> basically<00:02:15.320> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
don't do the third step if you're going

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.990 
don't do the third step if you're going
through<00:02:24.500> do<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.010> third<00:02:25.220> step<00:02:25.490> before<00:02:25.730> you

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
through do the third step before you

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.550 
through do the third step before you
talk<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.270> them<00:02:26.600> you're<00:02:27.260> going<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.410> have

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
to try now once we do that what's going

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.010 
to try now once we do that what's going
to<00:02:49.520> happen<00:02:49.880> is<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:50.240> going<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.450> change<00:02:50.870> the

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
to happen is it's going to change the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.080 
to happen is it's going to change the
objective<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.860> it's<00:02:52.340> going<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:52.610> say<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.060> need

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
objective and it's going to say we need

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.420 
objective and it's going to say we need
to<00:02:53.270> reach<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.960> start<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.530> path<00:02:54.710> now<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
to reach the start of the path now the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.430 
to reach the start of the path now the
start<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.880> path<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.300> right<00:02:56.540> there<00:02:56.840> so<00:02:57.320> what

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
start of the path is right there so what

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.050 
start of the path is right there so what
we're<00:02:57.530> going<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:57.680> do<00:02:57.860> is<00:02:58.070> we're<00:02:58.280> going<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.520> walk

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
we're going to do is we're going to walk

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.490 
we're going to do is we're going to walk
through<00:02:59.090> this<00:02:59.570> and<00:02:59.930> then<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.320> going<00:03:00.440> to

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
through this and then it's going to

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.830 
through this and then it's going to
change<00:03:00.770> and<00:03:01.130> say<00:03:01.340> collect<00:03:01.910> prove<00:03:02.300> that<00:03:02.660> you

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
change and say collect prove that you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.540 
change and say collect prove that you
climb<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.230> mountain<00:03:03.560> we've<00:03:03.770> already<00:03:04.070> done
