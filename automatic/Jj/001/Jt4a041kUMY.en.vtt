00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 very good friends who are very good 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.740
 as well as in the title is a small 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.320
 tutorial on how to get the theme for 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.509
 destination playstation 4 and advance 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.580
 warfare is to say that these issues do not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.350
 are in European history we are 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.620
 about an American story and I think 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.260
 that Japanese had Asian 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.670
 and good as I should have them but 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.200
 they want me to leave the option of 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.870
 download and go to the story and 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.350
 download and it does not work out very well I have five 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:37.830
 subjects the three that are up European 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:41.670
 however, we are both going to be able to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.830
 how it looks like I'm recording with the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.930
 mobile because I do not have a captor and the 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.930
 Grade games directly between 64 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.810
 as in contrast to the appearance of truth 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.810
 that change the sounds 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 the method and good for this we need 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 an account yes or yes to American yes or yes 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.229
 It has to be the American account 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.380
 well here I have a hole that is this 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.380
 here 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.399
 we have to go fit just like for 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.399
 choose a subject theme 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:25.520
 I get the option to go to the playstation 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.520
 store store 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.409
 we do not know five topics 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:38.210
 and dow jones warfare that I imagine 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.300
 It will not take long to leave in 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.620
 European universal I imagined let's hope 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.979
 that is not not long, but as I already 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.979
 they come and I do not have that's why I realized 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.979
 directly 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.990
 Let's go there 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.270
 are here 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.970
 as I said the themes change one of 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.460
 sound personalize the sounds too 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.500
 not only is 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 not only is the appearance but also 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.350
 the sounds we now test the fate of 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 destination 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.950
 although I remember that the aspect will be 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.629
 easier because I could download it theme 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.810
 with a pendrive and installs 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.810
 directly 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.930
 let's choose the d 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.930
 vs 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.889
 this water for the truth changes as in 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.389
 screen change the same is not common 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:36.150
 the interest that only governs screen and 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:38.010
 is and nothing I hope you liked 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.329
 I hope this has helped you a lot 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.329
 tutorial and see you in the next goodbye
