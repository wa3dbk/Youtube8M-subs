00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi folks, I'm traveling miranda o 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.639
 technical director of the season football today 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.309
 presenting the model confusion is like 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 made a new product from apple stove a 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.490
 wood stove designed to be 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.690
 used in restaurants that have 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.690
 self service service 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.970
 It's the stove that's ready to be 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.609
 used in low 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.470
 just take it out of the box and ride it and give it 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.470
 the finish you want 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.690
 in the style of your restaurant this is a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.670
 place that was designed not to 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.480
 cooking but keeping the food 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.570
 hot 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 it has an area to receive the pots 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.930
 of 0 63 square meters which is a plate 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.110
 or two plates whose compliance is 0 56 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.010
 cm for the old meter excuses 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.930
 56 centimeters per 1 meter in 12 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.149
 these two plates the first plate 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.629
 temperature can reach from 200 to 300 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.570
 degrees and find can betray the second plate 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.549
 from 100 to 100 to 200 degrees and if you 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.530
 uses the apple system to found the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.500
 hawk system has an economic system 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.340
 ours is a system that uses little 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.409
 and generates more energy and less smoke 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.229
 then this system consumes only 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.689
 one pound of 300 wins per hour 1 is the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.490
 maximum consumption but probably you 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.970
 will use much less of it because 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.439
 idea is to only keep the temperature is o 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.299
 ideal temperature to maintain the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.610
 food hot food 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.650
 is the stove that does not allow has no 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.380
 smoke within the environment of the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 you do not have soot and there is a 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.840
 that keep the environment clean 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.229
 so as I said is the stove that economical 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.930
 for restaurants that hold food 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:53.040
 hot with a good presentation and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.530
 space is a new product that 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.140
 we are launching is that it is still done under 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.979
 order and if you wish to have a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.869
 budget 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.750
 just write us what you buy to see 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.549
 Let's calculate the cost to be able to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.799
 send the stove said to you 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.800
 then it is a new product is that the stove 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.940
 I hope you can meet the market of 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.330
 restaurants 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.730
 the hillbilly local food or foods to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.770
 Brazil skies seeking another one 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.770
 product with that obliges
