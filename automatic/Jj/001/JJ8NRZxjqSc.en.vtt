00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.440
 brescia 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.270
 kat hi all guys are at ganz 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.099
 and here today with this new video yes 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.800
 is a nuclear made with the 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:26.410
 pistol cup 40 nuclear nice in my 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.270
 notice to see also a lot left 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.679
 although I have to thank the media 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.300
 teammates who were like 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.790
 precisely that they went by nucleus 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.879
 together with me then we say in addition to 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.350
 try their nuclear too 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.170
 they went with new counterattacks 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.760
 avoid therefore I went out thanks to them 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.400
 also to accomplish this 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.829
 result that I am very happy about 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.399
 because the people who will follow me 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.010
 they follow me follow me for a long time they will know 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.170
 that I am also among myself was not a type 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.829
 that went with the secondary ones so I have 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.980
 tried these things too 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.740
 if they cannot be called of the of the yes 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.690
 can tell of hallucinating things because 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.259
 however it makes a lot of sense of oneself already 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.479
 a lot on the tube but I have to say that they are three 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.100
 already I never went for mobs with 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.770
 secondary things are here also because 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.800
 cial almost I was struggling with the primary 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.690
 in fact if you go to see you I would bring 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.759
 always marco lapi 90 pp 90 crmp 7 be 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.920
 here but with many other weapons 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.050
 precisely because it wasn't my style 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
 of play also with the secondary one indeed 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.679
 I sucked enough 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.239
 apart from the mp 9 it seems to me that yes 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.860
 he called so that he was really strong 

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:44.979
 but here I saw that they were turned 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.500
 many nuclear with on the tube precisely with 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.179
 These piston lines and seen that 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.459
 just going for nuclear could 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.179
 be a little bit more fun 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:56.830
 just to show precisely that is not 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.390
 to do to make gameplay where 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.130
 in fact, I also deal with weapons only 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.390
 instead we say that a swarm for 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.070
 example as one can say a hundred more 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 so with all a high score anyway 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.830
 with with a secondary it is easier 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.900
 because in any case we get to the v set then i 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.560
 chants do everything from the dogs you love it 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.630
 swarm and stroÃ² here so I think 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.740
 a nuclear made with a secondary one 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.150
 precisely where only the kills are valid 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.890
 weapon is a little bit nicer from 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:33.170
 see we care to point out that you sit 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.770
 almost as if the dc 4 recovered all a 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:39.290
 end game precisely when I was in in 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.690
 unstoppable has done is made of the kind 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.340
 37 in a row here do not care about the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.160
 recovered but appears even if you didn't 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.100
 retrieved 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.530
 there is one you put a class with the c4 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.470
 so can use it is obviously going to be 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.450
 made 15 who 15 who would be 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.850
 however, let us not dwell differently 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.850
 boys then words a moment of 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.910
 this of this secondary I can you 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.890
 to say that one of the most is really strong 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.160
 strong in my opinion even though there is also the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:13.630
 b 23 which is a weapon I really can't 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.700
 tell her nothing really strong doesn't happen 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.490
 just be afraid to go with 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.970
 that weapon in my hand because I at least I 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.680
 feel very safe is really not strong 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.290
 almost never for one-on-one confrontations 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.040
 obviously you must also have enemies 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.110
 not too strong because you are enemies 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.690
 we say strong if you can call v 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.400
 sat they go out right away or they do 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.350
 it calls of sight against therefore obviously 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.820
 enemies must not be too strong 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.570
 but obviously they won't be too much either 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:47.170
 scarce because the game before this 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.730
 Voice nuclear side with the fall 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.290
 fall was much easier to use than 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.110
 kap however I came out less the same 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.950
 so they were still not saying 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.380
 was very decent anyway and this one 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.660
 cup 40 I used it guys with soccer not 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.010
 it is built with tormented charge not 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.610
 with long barrel for the simple fact 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.850
 that being the prestige it must 900 that 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.980
 prestige master presidium 0 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.940
 I don't have any unlock points anymore and here I don't 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.480
 I can unlock that anymore 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.190
 that is why it is called type as it is called 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.280
 a secondary gunslinger that is me 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.050
 allows you to put two accessories on 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.530
 secondary and therefore I had to be there between 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.180
 long charged tormented meat now given 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.350
 that the second one was still happening to me 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.730
 to use it 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.040
 normally when I was also going to 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.900
 one hundred percent more ice cores in war 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.940
 I remember if I met you two 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.780
 enemies in a row without a loader 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.560
 increased 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.880
 I could never do the double e 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.910
 so I decided already thought and I decided 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:50.300
 to put on the kick or why me 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.310
 the loader was increased to do 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.650
 so that at least if I had met two 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.400
 people in a row 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:00.970
 I could have killed both and 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.830
 the hyper I used were anti-splinters 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.080
 inflexible if you all go for nuclear 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.180
 guys don't put me in a ghost 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.290
 it makes no sense not to put the 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.760
 silencer because it is not needed e 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:16.310
 make yourselves anti-splinter because it is one of the 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.530
 most important parquet when you go for 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.169
 obviously inflexible nuclear will be 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.930
 because at least you arrive and you and you ai 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:26.650
 your companions all 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.240
 alvisal counterattack faster then 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.180
 I used jackal 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.430
 obviously because I didn't have to finish them 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.259
 extra ammunition will be needed 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:41.009
 some c4 of some c4 I could have 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:45.130
 restore thanks to jackal point and 

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:48.550
 he didn't use what the real boys used to use 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:52.360
 steel because I said so much I do not 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.160
 they serve shocks or indeed blinding no 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.880
 I need too many accessories I don't have one 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:59.800
 primary and the spaces I miss 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.820
 let's use them precisely with steel because 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:06.340
 anyway I have a little bit more than of 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.530
 safety in using steel because 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.419
 obviously all the pieces at the end a little 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.220
 of advantages they give you and therefore I have 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:18.690
 said he'd put the 3 look for it too 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:21.400
 steel and then I used dexterity and 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.120
 their name was only boys 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.950
 I don't recommend others 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.300
 others for tertiary precisely dexterity 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.400
 important because as a secondary 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.020
 you must have the weapon ready for 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:34.170
 win all one on one fights 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:38.880
 and then guys use eu contacted e 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:40.560
 of sat speaking native of this of 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.300
 this mode with multiple teams 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.890
 I recommend you always go here for 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:49.770
 try the kids because being 

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:52.530
 for example, I don't like one 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:53.100
 playing too much in a group I heard you go 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:54.240
 in three 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.680
 obviously given for the connection 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.110
 because it would be too good instead 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.690
 play with six people or 9 with one 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.700
 perfect connection instead of the 6 

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:04.050
 against 6 in nine against nine in a group 

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:06.990
 We very much to read there is a 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.580
 3 to 3 painful connection with two 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.960
 your friends is really nice there 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:12.750
 have more fun the connection is 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.760
 perfect of course if you're a host 

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.710
 or your teammate 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.960
 will do host and even better though anyway 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.880
 even if it's not very funny 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.500
 I hope guys that this video is there 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.730
 liked remember to leave a nice one 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.720
 I like it if you liked the video 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.880
 just 

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.200
 try this new chemical mode 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.790
 is really a lot and we get it 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.210
 as always at the next hello video 

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.210
 boys
