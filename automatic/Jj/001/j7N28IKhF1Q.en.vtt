way to blend my hair now this is why

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.620 
way to blend my hair now this is why
that<00:03:28.890> flat<00:03:29.250> tool<00:03:29.549> is<00:03:29.700> right<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> middle<00:03:30.450> is

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that flat tool is right in the middle is

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.870 
that flat tool is right in the middle is
very<00:03:30.690> important<00:03:31.380> it<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.829> going<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.549> serve<00:03:32.850> as

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
very important it is going to serve as

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.319 
very important it is going to serve as
your<00:03:33.720> base<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.950> that<00:03:35.190> main<00:03:35.549> part<00:03:35.970> that's

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
your base for that main part that's

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.960 
your base for that main part that's
going<00:03:36.600> to<00:03:36.690> blend<00:03:37.109> in<00:03:37.530> with<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:38.010> half<00:03:38.220> wig<00:03:38.640> and

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
going to blend in with the half wig and

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.780 
going to blend in with the half wig and
this<00:03:39.660> way<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.290> a<00:03:40.350> hundred<00:03:40.829> percent<00:03:40.920> protective

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
this way is a hundred percent protective

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.360 
this way is a hundred percent protective
because<00:03:42.060> there's<00:03:42.510> nothing<00:03:43.130> none<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.250> your

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
because there's nothing none of your

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.089 
because there's nothing none of your
ends<00:03:44.700> are<00:03:45.060> exposed

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.259 

so<00:03:52.030> all<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:52.390> do<00:03:52.599> is<00:03:52.870> take<00:03:53.709> a<00:03:53.920> bobby<00:03:54.549> pin<00:03:54.730> well
