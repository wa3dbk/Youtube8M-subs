00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 that in a short time seems to have found the 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 right path for this Italy to you 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.660
 alessandro here we are then with antonio 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.710
 count and ask if this is the point of the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 dreams 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 if he had dreamed it so if he slept 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.250
 even to dream it was night but 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.830
 we say that beyond the result mi 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.340
 interested to see the answer of the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.200
 guys it was just an answer 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.430
 positive under the commitment below from the point 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.690
 of view of the game idea we want 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.290
 carry on a tourist 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.790
 to great big aggression 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.550
 availability on their part and with 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.469
 found a lot of players 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.050
 available that they want to make him do 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.340
 something important said this if not 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.899
 only four days we work 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.719
 together and there is a truly path 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.579
 long and hard yet to do though 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.100
 these are games that still damage 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 trust from enthusiasm allow us to 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.609
 work to keep doing what 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.860
 we are doing 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.840
 still with more credibility here since 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 point of view of aggression from 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.950
 point of view of high pressing from 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.330
 ability to attack even defending 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.700
 how he explained to us what they do 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.060
 team I know I like a team of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.060
 antonio conte 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.580
 we say that we have undertaken the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.080
 route 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.300
 we did six workouts together 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.680
 quite intense because then I had to do 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.990
 recover from the labors of the championship 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.300
 but already give some communities of 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 play of the known tactical principles and I must 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.720
 say I'm happy because anyway 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.540
 I saw great big application 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.300
 will from these guys 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.300
 I repeat this is a mix of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.810
 of the mature boys 8 and 30 years and many 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.160
 young people who want and who can 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.050
 however to become players 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.050
 important but was still in my opinion 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.480
 very very long but I always say that 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:01.240
 winning helps you win so surprised 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:04.420
 from the understanding between the immobile zaza that yes 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.160
 they are great but we have 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.530
 worked for this we worked for 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:11.170
 the agreement of the attackers but as well 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:15.550
 he then found himself right along with 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:18.340
 right-handed youth with with immobile and lo 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.780
 same quailrella the same ceramics 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.790
 has been tried in that position 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.410
 I repeat the important thing is that it is 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 availability and what is the moral 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.960
 however there is a lot and is finding a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.370
 group of really questionable guys 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.260
 having said that now we recover 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.930
 we try and work because tuesday there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370
 awaits a battle against norway 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.180
 which showed him to be a 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.120
 very physical team 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.870
 here is precisely in marco's perspective 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.850
 Verratti 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.800
 we all ask whether you are the present or if 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.190
 is still the future of our football e 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.650
 you can play with de rossi and gian marco 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 verratti this is present may be the 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.630
 future depending on the times 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.940
 they decide to send him to the field 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.710
 from the beginning during the match for 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.150
 that role I say we have one 

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.160
 important coverage but not 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.860
 we forget that there is more than Daniel de 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.870
 reds that today did only for the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.370
 great game we andrea pirlo 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.770
 who gave his willingness to do 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.900
 we grow these kids we are just 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.510
 marco marco verratti 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.700
 here I say that I see him very much 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:21.250
 kitsch of the track to enter because in 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.050
 terms I need people who do 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 inserts of leg that though also 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.850
 on the outside it was a box 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.680
 special tonight but you apologize 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.069
 I say he had some oils tonight 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.989
 the important thing is to continue 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.099
 because I am convinced that working yes 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.139
 they can do good things 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:42.549
 thanks, thanks, antonio, count the line 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.549
 back to Rome then post match to par
