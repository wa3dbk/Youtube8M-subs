00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
middle of the zipper tape is pretty good

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.740 
middle of the zipper tape is pretty good
usually<00:01:49.729> okays<00:01:50.729> everybody<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:51.240> be<00:01:51.360> so<00:01:51.509> far

ok<00:01:52.680> now<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.909> turned<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:55.140> way<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.710> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
ok now you turned this this way you just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.289 
ok now you turned this this way you just
turn<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.189> open<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.329> see<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:59.189> leaf<00:01:59.820> dish<00:02:00.090> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
turn it open and see the leaf dish it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.520 
turn it open and see the leaf dish it
way<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.450> here<00:02:00.780> now<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.990> want<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.290> kind<00:02:01.409> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
way out here now you want to kind of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.520 
way out here now you want to kind of
roll<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:02.000> this<00:02:03.000> fabric<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.200> right

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
roll this this fabric so that it's right

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.260 
roll this this fabric so that it's right
next<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:06.020> right<00:02:07.020> next<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> coils<00:02:07.829> yeah

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
next to the right next to the coils yeah

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.150 
next to the right next to the coils yeah
it<00:02:09.870> would<00:02:10.110> look<00:02:10.200> better<00:02:10.380> if<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.680> was<00:02:10.860> pressed

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
it would look better if this was pressed

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.730 
it would look better if this was pressed
of<00:02:11.370> course<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.060> no<00:02:12.360> pins<00:02:12.600> in<00:02:12.780> there<00:02:12.960> but<00:02:13.230> we

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of course and no pins in there but we

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.680 
of course and no pins in there but we
can<00:02:13.980> everything<00:02:14.330> we're<00:02:15.330> doing<00:02:15.360> things

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
can everything we're doing things

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.120 
can everything we're doing things
roughly<00:02:16.790> okay<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.930> next<00:02:18.960> step<00:02:19.350> then<00:02:19.680> would

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
roughly okay so the next step then would

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.440 
roughly okay so the next step then would
be<00:02:21.620> beaming<00:02:22.620> way<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.100> pin<00:02:23.370> for<00:02:24.150> a<00:02:24.210> minute

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
be beaming way of your pin for a minute

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.800 
be beaming way of your pin for a minute
no<00:02:24.810> pan<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.620> next<00:02:25.920> step<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.160> be<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.340> stitch

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
no pan the next step would be to stitch

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.940 
no pan the next step would be to stitch
you<00:02:27.810> know<00:02:27.960> here<00:02:28.500> really<00:02:28.980> close<00:02:29.190> to<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:30.950> really

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you know here really close to the really

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.620 
you know here really close to the really
close<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.560> tape<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.460> I<00:02:35.580> can't<00:02:35.910> pick<00:02:36.300> I

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
close to the tape and I can't pick I

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.170 
close to the tape and I can't pick I
can't<00:02:37.020> put<00:02:37.170> those<00:02:37.290> pins<00:02:37.560> there<00:02:37.770> because<00:02:38.180> I've

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
can't put those pins there because I've

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.880 
can't put those pins there because I've
got<00:02:39.420> pins<00:02:39.660> on<00:02:39.840> pants<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:40.380> I'm<00:02:40.440> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.620> put<00:02:40.770> it

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
got pins on pants so I'm going to put it

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.240 
got pins on pants so I'm going to put it
over<00:02:41.010> here<00:02:41.390> okay<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.690> step<00:02:45.930> two<00:02:46.250> we

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
over here okay so that's step two we

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.650 
over here okay so that's step two we
call<00:02:47.490> step<00:02:47.760> 2<00:02:48.530> then<00:02:49.530> step<00:02:49.830> 3<00:02:50.360> all<00:02:51.360> you're<00:02:51.630> doing

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
call step 2 then step 3 all you're doing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.370 
call step 2 then step 3 all you're doing
now<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:53.220> your<00:02:53.490> your<00:02:54.270> opening<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:54.990> so<00:02:55.230> it's

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
now is your your opening this so it's

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.540 
now is your your opening this so it's
flat<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:58.880> lay<00:02:59.880> this<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.240> now<00:03:00.300> so<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.690> flat

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
flat just lay this out now so it's flat

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.830

this side and stitch this tape to this
flat

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.870 

you<00:03:19.140> ditching<00:03:19.740> the<00:03:19.860> tape<00:03:20.130> to<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.460> flat<00:03:20.760> down

to turn it to the outside and be sure

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.690 
to turn it to the outside and be sure
you<00:03:31.500> mark<00:03:31.830> where<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.070> bottom<00:03:32.400> of<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.520> zipper

you mark where the bottom of the zipper

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.040 
you mark where the bottom of the zipper
is<00:03:32.820> so<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.090> don't<00:03:33.270> go<00:03:33.450> through<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:33.900> break

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
is so you don't go through it and break

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.710 
is so you don't go through it and break
a<00:03:34.080> needle<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.560> got<00:03:34.860> done<00:03:35.040> before<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.240> then<00:03:36.540> just
