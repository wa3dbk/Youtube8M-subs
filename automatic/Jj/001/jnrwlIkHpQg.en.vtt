buy bullets all at once in a single best

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
buy bullets all at once in a single best
which<00:00:22.050> makes<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.529> possibly<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.279> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
which makes it possibly one of the

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.640 
which makes it possibly one of the
craziest<00:00:24.000> ones<00:00:24.269> I've<00:00:24.420> ever<00:00:24.449> used<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.439> one<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
craziest ones I've ever used it's one of

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.230 
craziest ones I've ever used it's one of
the<00:00:25.740> most<00:00:25.890> underrated<00:00:26.220> guns<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> advanced

the most underrated guns in advanced

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
the most underrated guns in advanced
warfare<00:00:27.449> I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.529> it's<00:00:28.680> because<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.039> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
warfare I think it's because it's the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.890 
warfare I think it's because it's the
last<00:00:29.340> weapon<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.789> unlock<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.539> SMG

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
last weapon you unlock in the SMG

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.209

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
category and people don't want to wear

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.880 
category and people don't want to wear
to<00:00:33.059> unlock<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.719> wanna<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.440> know<00:00:34.469> power

through<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> levels<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.910> skip<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.140> if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
through the levels and skip it but if

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.270

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
recommend it it's a five-run fast it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.650 
recommend it it's a five-run fast it
kills<00:00:40.590> pretty<00:00:40.890> much<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.370> one<00:00:41.700> burst<00:00:41.940> up<00:00:42.270> close

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and personal medium to long range it

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.209 
and personal medium to long range it
might<00:00:45.360> take<00:00:45.600> two<00:00:45.899> or<00:00:45.930> more<00:00:46.530> but<00:00:46.920> in<00:00:47.070> my

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
like the red dot say I'm not too keen on
the<00:01:37.439> iron<00:01:37.619> sights<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:38.159> bit<00:01:38.250> too<00:01:38.970> small<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.390> my

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the iron sights a bit too small for my

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.719 
the iron sights a bit too small for my
likings<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.710> why<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:40.890> put<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.159> on<00:01:41.400> feel

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
likings so that's why I put that on feel

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.219 
likings so that's why I put that on feel
free<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> change<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.720> would<00:01:43.079> also

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
free to change that I would also

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
free to change that I would also
recommend<00:01:43.500> maybe<00:01:43.979> putting<00:01:44.369> on<00:01:44.460> extended<00:01:45.030> mags

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
recommend maybe putting on extended mags

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.240 
recommend maybe putting on extended mags
but<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.619> if<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:46.920> don't<00:01:47.130> want

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
but you don't have to if you don't want

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.580 
but you don't have to if you don't want
to<00:01:47.579> again<00:01:48.119> for<00:01:48.600> grip<00:01:48.780> was<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.229> reduce<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
to again for grip was gonna reduce a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.590 
to again for grip was gonna reduce a
vertical<00:01:49.950> recoil<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.549> well<00:01:51.060> it's<00:01:51.329> gonna

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
vertical recoil and well it's gonna

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.870 
vertical recoil and well it's gonna
benefit<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.290> when<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.310> spraying<00:01:53.640> this

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
benefit you when you're spraying this

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.080 
benefit you when you're spraying this
weapon<00:01:54.270> maybe<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.990> kind<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> firing<00:01:56.250> best<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
weapon maybe like kind of firing best a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.959 
weapon maybe like kind of firing best a
quick<00:01:57.990> concession<00:01:58.560> because<00:01:59.159> obviously<00:01:59.549> it

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
quick concession because obviously it

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
quick concession because obviously it
reduces<00:02:00.360> vertical<00:02:00.869> recoil<00:02:01.049> as<00:02:01.380> much<00:02:01.409> as<00:02:01.740> it

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
reduces vertical recoil as much as it

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.469 
reduces vertical recoil as much as it
possibly<00:02:01.950> can<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.610> those<00:02:02.880> two<00:02:03.030> attachments

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
possibly can and those two attachments

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
possibly can and those two attachments
together<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.320> felt<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> kept<00:02:05.549> it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
together just it felt right so I kept it

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.399 
together just it felt right so I kept it
like<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.329> pretty<00:02:06.689> beast<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
like that and I do pretty beast with it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.040 
like that and I do pretty beast with it
most<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.009> town<00:02:08.310> went<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.270> simple

usual not quite as usual sometimes you
fall<00:02:16.420> but<00:02:16.570> most<00:02:16.780> attempts<00:02:17.050> to<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.260> use<00:02:17.470> fags

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
fall but most attempts to do use fags

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.400
