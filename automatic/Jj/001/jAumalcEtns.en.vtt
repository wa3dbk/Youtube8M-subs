00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello good evening everyone and sir 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.490
 rodrigue and order everything you 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.160
 comment on this football game so much 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.670
 waited by fans of the round ball 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.389
 we meet for the final of this 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.340
 competition 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.199
 we'll see if the tag team is 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.430
 able to win this competition 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.100
 in all cases they made a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 very very remarkable competition and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.269
 frankly big bravo to them 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.160
 this is the team she has not changed 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.660
 compared to other matches except 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 that gorgaud was officially 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.450
 rejected in the club and replaces but 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.640
 obviously Jeremy lead everything will play 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 instead of tevez tevez 20 years plays at 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.610
 right and left at the top left 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.040
 hoping they bring back from the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 freshness to this team here we hope 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
 see a very very good football match 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 and then left there we 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.289
 find for the match here is the team of 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.600
 the opponent is a pretty bpl 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.149
 versatile with falcao and diego costa 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.629
 in attack we play when we stage 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840
 mythical 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.079
 it's gone I feel that this match is going to be 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.090
 huge 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.879
 tie your belts go it's gone 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.860
 do it play directly with ben arfa 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 who give it to motta mottaki gives it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
 a tevez pitcher small overflow that goes 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.049
 to do a little center we start 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.880
 directly with aguero or son magnifying the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.320
 frame very very little so that's it 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.869
 directly puts pressure on 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.400
 the opponent is not finished at gweru who 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.390
 once again it's countered these 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.830
 countries unfortunately it was when 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.049
 even badly shot here we put the pressure 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.670
 on the opponent where the clock was supposed to 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.409
 trampled but there is no fault 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.240
 so here is the referee I know 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.310
 not what you do but it's 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.650
 enough critics that he once again 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.509
 where greece is hanging this case 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.060
 penalty no no penalty 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.280
 there was offside apparently I did not 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.720
 am not so sure sir referees go 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.970
 it does not matter the team of tons 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.420
 do not stop we put directly blow of 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.680
 pressure or sakho that glue swept his 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.540
 opponent has it directly 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.970
 the referees op to give a cardboard 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.979
 good I admit that he was a little bit a 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.649
 little bit wind here it is first of all 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.079
 swept like a housekeeper 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.000
 So here it is not serious the corner here 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.020
 but what makes falcao and not 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.899
 not the talent that marks 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.579
 falcao which marks this hit which is 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.770
 in with of course a pass 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.789
 decisive of the defender of the team of 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.039
 toques I do not know what is 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810
 happened and your laurie turned out 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.909
 very upset against thinkers and there are 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.730
 of what sakho who misses and then a 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:19.980
 decisive pass of the defender is enough 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.689
 stupid as a goal is good here is falcao for 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.849
 tunis who watches the brand big centers 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.890
 of pitcher qu'aguero that attracts but 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.420
 how can you miss this saguaro 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.250
 is not possible you are too expensive 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.260
 to miss opportunities like that it's 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.930
 pretty unfortunate costa that will eliminate 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.579
 exactly four defenders against the goal 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.909
 and poultry colorist more simply 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:41.939
 do anything big fat right strikes 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.930
 to eliminate your loris and put the 2 0 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.909
 it starts very badly 2 0 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.010
 before the end of the first period 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:51.989
 it's very, very bad sign for 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.609
 the team of toys péquignot the coach goes 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.319
 go on the offensive by making 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.060
 nicely done replacement return royce and 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.519
 muller hoping they are hot 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.180
 to save this team we take the 3 0 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.560
 which we do not touch 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.280
 we almost went to 3.0 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.260
 unfortunately it was an engagement 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.840
 could shoot next but it's not over 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.010
 81st minute we went to the lot consists 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.810
 simply banging me to acts 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.699
 high is this a two ponyo acquired this 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.650
 who's going to do it goes the powerhouse that will 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:21.750
 the fallout his run had lasted the 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.720
 letter he had taken there but more than a 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.790
 style 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.650
 but as we know very well play 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.630
 knowing that you do not come back very hard 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.130
 of the head he will fetch the balloon and 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.420
 he'll put it down the score the 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.100
 it's not over there is still way 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.770
 this month I 'm going to be epic I'll get it 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.080
 say pogba who goes out into the street 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.400
 tv is tevez who has lob on goss 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.140
 who see their name and that's the sniper 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.460
 the ball is not possible a high 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.930
 level to a mirror who are busy 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:47.230
 crochet it's not bad it's not so 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.010
 why is it to leave no no pogba 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.060
 it's not possible 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.920
 in the final match it's 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.860
 impossible to get hurt but what is it 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.209
 what happens is the rout it gives to 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.070
 see and there varela which is very fast 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.090
 sakho is what will stop what we 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:02.410
 do not stop it without rolling your loris 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.940
 who does the tap and unfortunately 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.500
 I think that will be the end for this 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.540
 thiago motta action that does not happen to 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.680
 go get the ball and it's over the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.810
 dick but ultimately this meeting 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.209
 it is rather a pity rather unfortunate 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.490
 for this toy team that made a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.989
 competition but magical but 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.730
 unfortunately we can not win 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.080
 this cut very well play at 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.760
 the opponent anyway he did not have 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.830
 a lot of action but he knew 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.160
 concretize its actions and mark 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.140
 goals 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.790
 that's just all 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.860
 the downpour of our players who had full 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.450
 action that could not mark his 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.730
 only step knowing we had tvc 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.470
 hard euros in attack you are here two years 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.000
 we lost the battle but not the 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.520
 war we will come very hard we will pass 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.750
 from just to interview 2 and 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.750
 péquignot the coach 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.960
 I know I pulled the suit had 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.160
 good for an event like this is going 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.419
 make the control you 're going to change its 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.400
 life do because I'm too much not on 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.509
 the videos so I'm not in the mood 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.620
 I hope you will change it was a 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.620
 day break the balls until the end 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.470
 so what is my feeling after this 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.690
 match there 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.920
 because I was going to laugh good I see 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.720
 if you ask questions like that 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.720
 without anything I sell my husband directly 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.070
 wanting to come to this club 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.470
 no future i have no future i'm going to 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.460
 seems as fast as I'm put and your 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:32.650
 questions really start the case 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:34.910
 it's the echo of strikethrough that's why 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.199
 I have the best coach in the world and we 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.330
 ask the mayor whose questions you 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.910
 take for whom do you take for whom 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.100
 frankly will you back off do not 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.509
 come over talk to me once this 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.070
 team that I fight from here big bitch 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:48.070
