00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.910
 Y 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.880
 gray for our to our the day of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.130
 today I chose a chicken breast that is 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.430
 seasoned only with a touch of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 mustard corn with a touch of pepper 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.400
 let's go with what I wanted 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.259
 tell you is that we are going to vary a bit 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.720
 the carbohydrate sometimes cassava to a 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.030
 little forget like that is then let's 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.580
 use me here that is already cooked with a 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.769
 sauce that is very easy and while I 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.140
 I prepare this dressing of our yucca 

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:42.269
 because we also have a salad 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.550
 Fresh prepared with lettuce for the mid 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.170
 and tomato that you want to tell us about 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the afternoon, the only thing that remains 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.430
 to say it 's about mid afternoon that 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 same is a small snack in the 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.390
 which the idea is to recover the energy that 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.370
 we lose during the afternoon in this case 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.399
 we suggest for example some cookies 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.020
 fitness with a joe yogurt half of the 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.719
 yobo yogurt that we had already used in the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.610
 mid-morning exactly also I do not know 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.530
 forget to always read the contribution 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.720
 nutritional in the nutritional table of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.990
 the machine and we're going to add a little bit of 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 Salt 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.299
 you can help me to place a 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.820
 portion of salad on the plate by 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 supposed in this case of the yuccas 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.140
 How many would you recommend me to eat 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:28.020
 lunch we could be placing some 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.020
 five or six excellent then one time 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.250
 the chicken breast 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.570
 and our mojito 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.770
 it's delicious 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.710
 very well what we are going to do now is 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.600
 having our time 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.580
 calculated for a mid-afternoon follows 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.140
 lunch at one or one and a half to what 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.700
 time I can eat the average from a 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.380
 excellent question sofÃ­a and that 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.030
 there are usually many 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.930
 concerns of that of our 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.450
 followers in social networks 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.090
 we should eat every three to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.130
 four hours yes because that 's where we 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 we can assure that the body does not pass 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.180
 the fast constantly and in fact the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.030
 body only absorbs what it needs 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.880
 excellent then about one- thirty 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.640
 and then I can eat at four or five 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.860
 in the afternoon and mid afternoon to dinner 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.920
 I was thinking that it is good to consume 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.050
 some soup then I have a cream of 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.090
 I'm wrong and what I'm going to do is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.370
 just add onions that you 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.910
 They are gilding with a bit of a 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:39.310
 sweet corn and what other things could we 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.680
 take into account when we do or are going to 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.810
 eat a dinner that we could eat in 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.670
 this case then tell us the soup but that 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.010
 other ideas we could have for a 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.050
 Look dinner we can make a salad very 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.620
 Quick any vegetables that we have already 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.720
 list 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.640
 to tomato or what we had left over from lunch 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.190
 For example, add a little bit of 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.799
 cheese or ham and we would have the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.840
 protein in the salad and we can 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.599
 add him if he wants us bits of 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.019
 bread there are people who do not have much time 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:10.180
 for lunch and we believe some people 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.310
 they do it at dinner we have to 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.260
 serve us a lot ie 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.170
 eat what I did not eat at lunch 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.750
 something totally wrong because the 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.549
 lunch must be done is part 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.560
 important in the fractionation of 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.269
 feeding us we avoid getting 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.329
 very hungry to the next meal 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.940
 if we do not eat enough or what 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:33.489
 we need at the time of our turn 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.799
 eat we will arrive very hungry and 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.870
 if on the other hand we do not snack and 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.239
 we make breakfast we are going to have a 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.690
 Abundant breakfast and the body starts to 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.030
 absorb all in fat then the most 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.269
 important is never to skip a 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.099
 food really have the schedules 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:54.159
 suitable for our food 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.080
 also and I think we've seen that all 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:58.270
 the food groups are in 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.260
 2 in excellent nutrition in the day 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.210
 so is 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.920
 Also as you can see a 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.350
 fractional feeding is always 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.780
 delicious nutritious and it has to be 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.420
 obviously balanced look what we're going 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.420
 to do is the soup serve 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.209
 it smells very rich is very rich I love it 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:22.940
 this cream 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.940
 our onion with corn 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.950
 and now I think we 're ready I think 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.320
 that now we can say that dinner 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.120
 is served thanks for all your 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.740

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.600

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.610
