take<00:02:12.430> you<00:02:12.849> to<00:02:13.569> build<00:02:13.599> this<00:02:14.020> from<00:02:14.349> inception<00:02:14.680> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
take you to build this from inception to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.850 
take you to build this from inception to
completion<00:02:15.270> it<00:02:16.270> took<00:02:16.420> me<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.690> year<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.410> when

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
completion it took me a year and when

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860 
completion it took me a year and when
that<00:02:18.340> year<00:02:18.640> I<00:02:18.670> worked<00:02:18.970> on<00:02:19.150> it<00:02:19.330> seven<00:02:19.690> days<00:02:19.720> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
that year I worked on it seven days a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.130 
that year I worked on it seven days a
week<00:02:20.050> pretty<00:02:20.800> much<00:02:21.010> 12<00:02:21.310> 15<00:02:21.700> hour<00:02:21.849> days

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.470 
week pretty much 12 15 hour days
it<00:02:23.350> really<00:02:23.620> shows<00:02:23.920> what<00:02:24.250> engine<00:02:24.970> are<00:02:25.330> we

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
it really shows what engine are we

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.970 
it really shows what engine are we
looking<00:02:25.600> at<00:02:25.900> and<00:02:26.170> what<00:02:26.440> have<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:26.740> done<00:02:26.920> with

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
looking at and what have you done with

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.220 
looking at and what have you done with
it<00:02:27.130> actually<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.240> motor<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.750> friend<00:02:29.020> of<00:02:29.080> mine

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
it actually that motor a friend of mine

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.110 
it actually that motor a friend of mine
Mike<00:02:29.470> garrison<00:02:30.010> make<00:02:30.220> those<00:02:30.430> motors<00:02:30.850> for<00:02:31.090> a

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
Mike garrison make those motors for a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120 
Mike garrison make those motors for a
while<00:02:31.390> they're<00:02:31.810> no<00:02:31.959> longer<00:02:32.130> developed

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
while they're no longer developed

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.699 
while they're no longer developed
anymore<00:02:33.520> but<00:02:33.880> are<00:02:34.540> those<00:02:34.690> ingenuity<00:02:35.260> motors

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
anymore but are those ingenuity motors

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.980 
anymore but are those ingenuity motors
that's<00:02:35.950> an<00:02:36.069> ingenuity<00:02:36.490> and<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.150> built<00:02:37.750> really

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
that's an ingenuity and it built really

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.410 
that's an ingenuity and it built really
high<00:02:38.380> horsepower<00:02:38.740> big<00:02:39.580> horsepower<00:02:39.940> and

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
high horsepower big horsepower and

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.380 
high horsepower big horsepower and
awesome<00:02:40.900> looks<00:02:41.730> yeah<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.910> really<00:02:43.060> does<00:02:43.330> look

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
awesome looks yeah it really does look

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.900 
awesome looks yeah it really does look
great<00:02:43.690> now<00:02:44.230> that<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.890> tank<00:02:45.160> designed<00:02:45.790> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
great now that the tank designed to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.530 
great now that the tank designed to
notice<00:02:46.180> it's<00:02:46.480> got<00:02:46.690> some<00:02:47.050> work<00:02:47.560> on<00:02:47.800> it<00:02:48.540> that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
notice it's got some work on it that

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.670 
notice it's got some work on it that
looks<00:02:49.780> like<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:49.959> might've<00:02:50.200> took<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.410> couple

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
looks like it might've took a couple

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.790 
looks like it might've took a couple
days<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.760> took<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.060> little<00:02:52.209> while<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:52.870> we<00:02:53.620> got

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
days it took a little while we we got

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.470 
days it took a little while we we got
the<00:02:53.920> tank<00:02:54.130> done<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.670> instead<00:02:55.330> of<00:02:55.390> putting

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
the tank done and instead of putting

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.720 
the tank done and instead of putting
graphics<00:02:56.140> on<00:02:56.320> it<00:02:56.350> we<00:02:56.680> decided<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.130> put<00:02:57.190> billet

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
graphics on it we decided to put billet

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.850 
graphics on it we decided to put billet
insert<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:58.540> tank<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.050> then<00:02:59.200> defender<00:02:59.739> and

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
insert in the tank and then defender and

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.940 
insert in the tank and then defender and
in<00:02:59.980> the<00:03:00.100> bags<00:03:00.660> so<00:03:01.660> we<00:03:02.110> made<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> Bill<00:03:02.620> it<00:03:02.769> and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
in the bags so we made to Bill it and

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.800 
in the bags so we made to Bill it and
then<00:03:03.100> we<00:03:03.220> meet<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> carbon<00:03:03.910> fiber<00:03:04.150> insert<00:03:04.660> in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
then we meet the carbon fiber insert in

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.900 
then we meet the carbon fiber insert in
the<00:03:04.900> billet<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.410> then<00:03:06.130> sunk<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.610> billet

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the billet and then sunk the billet

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.479 
the billet and then sunk the billet
piece<00:03:07.060> down<00:03:07.269> into<00:03:07.660> the<00:03:07.780> tank<00:03:08.010> yeah<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.280> looks

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
piece down into the tank yeah that looks

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.630
