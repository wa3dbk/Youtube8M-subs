00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.020
 now we are ready to enter the world of internet 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.509
 an intricate network of interconnected networks that extends across the globe 

00:00:12.239 --> 00:00:15.550
 here the routers and switches 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.019
 the establishment and requested that networks as well 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.019
 how the internet is a completely different environment than 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:27.140
 inside the walls of the local network here is a 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.920
 many opportunities much more time-consuming and many solutions thanks to 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.550
 existence of few integrated controls with some new ideas 

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:41.149
 encounter here in fertile soil to go further but due to this freedom 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.970
 also some dangers to hide 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.170
 you never know when the time comes when the deadly bing is here 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.300
 a special version of barroso vitor mallmann creates his own business 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.150
 uncontrolled servers or our own computers 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.970
 our packages can be via satellite phone lines to 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.500
 communication via radio or even by transoceanic cables is not always 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 as the fastest or the shortest route but are likely to reach the 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.510
 destiny sooner or later is perhaps why we sometimes talk about toyota 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.780
 and itunes, but when everything works as it should it can be done five times 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.780
 Around the world in time of a blink of an eye 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.740
 and this all at the price of a local call or even less 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.670
 near the end of our trip 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.049
 we find the server computer where the requested webpage is there 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:41.229
 we will find another firewall according to the point of view of the package states the lighthouse 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.149
 can be an insurance route or a fearsome opponent 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.149
 everything depends on the side you are on and our intentions 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.010
 the headlamp is designed to allow only packages that meet the criteria 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.400
 defined 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.450
 this headlamp is working with ports 80 and 25 which are ports of 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.210
 input 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 all attempts to enter the other doors if they have a weekend 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.799
 the strength 25 used to bring the mail packages 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.509
 already the fortress tries was for the internet packages destined to the 

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:32.369
 web server 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:33.609
 inside the firewall 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:36.609
 packets are carefully scanned 

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:40.129
 some are struggling for action 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.089
 while others have already raised doubts 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.900
 the SÃ£o Paulo operated hand is incarnated anyway for example is 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.500
 regret happens besides riding 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.500
 before past the peak happened due to bad 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.810
 for the few who are lucky enough to get here 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.810
 the trip is almost over 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:11.949
 simply go to the interfaceflor to be taken to the web server 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:14.919
 currently 

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:19.429
 a web server and can run on many types of machines from a 

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:23.109
 big bath frei last month by the cameras to weber until a computer 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.439
 and because no refrigerator with the proper configuration could be 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.959
 find out if there are enough ingredients to prepare a chicken with 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.229
 sauce or if it was necessary to go shopping remember that we are in the 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.609
 dawn of inter 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.149
 practically everything is possible 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:43.719
 one by one the packages are received affections items packaging 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.129
 the information contained in our application is sent to a 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:55.129
 server application 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:06.159
 how many packages they had been classified with 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.159
 for the youngest 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:23.219
 he was referred 

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:28.899
 returning after going through the parents or grandmothers routers that over the internet 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:33.189
 W 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.210
 passed through our upper district in three years 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.800
 by our lady of fatima 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.770
 yea 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.840
 we are ready to provide the material lego the requested information 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.879
 like for example this movie 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.350
 all this occurs every time you seek your sixth place is sovereign 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.759
 satisfied with your efforts full of confidence in the world our best 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:11.039
 faithful packets continue happily toward the sunset of another day 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:14.039
 with the certainty of having served you have access 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.189
 this is not a happy ending
