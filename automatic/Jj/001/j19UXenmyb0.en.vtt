00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.360
 hello everyone with you fan planets and today 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:12.879
 There will be a review on the game for wolking dead 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.650
 In general, the game horseradish knows when a long time ago 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.270
 came out my always decided to do on her 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.279
 review since the game is really 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:23.769
 quality is generally wonderful here and 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.519
 she is wonderful in terms of plot 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.410
 but not in terms of gameplay here you can play 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.390
 look like there is a game 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.750
 practically watching you don't play 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.480
 Mostly that is, but as the plot is real 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.030
 exciting and play really interesting 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.090
 that is, perform such special actions 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:46.570
 you do not need you here while you look and 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:48.580
 enjoy the plot now let's 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.340
 I will say while they are talking here 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.580
 for a long time I will say about the graphics 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.190
 the graphics here are just wonderful 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.800
 For example, animation of faces in many even 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.590
 dinner an offer of you this kind of animation is not 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.089
 for example when the eyes do the moves 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 have a mouth opens i have it all 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.820
 done as realistic in many 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.280
 computer games do not even make it 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.160
 such that for example eyes 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 move in different directions that is 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.820
 meaning not in different directions but not at all 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.540
 his eyes moving , that is stupid head 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.760
 turns 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.790
 lover eyes and so it looks 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.020
 unrealistic 10 done it like a cartoon 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.940
 looks good here and also for 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.070
 score of the effect of the sketch graphics looks 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.710
 beautifully though in principle if the schedule 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 narrow what to take will be seen at the very 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.330
 business 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 that is, by sketching graphics and by 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.360
 this effect is like a graph 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.670
 beautiful looks it is wonderful here 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 about the distance drawing 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 there is a way the distance drawing sucks 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.870
 done but here in principle ok 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 looks compared to the first mission 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.450
 or there you need to go by car who knows 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 passed this game that is everything there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.179
 blurry everything is very sloppy so not beautiful 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 looks and so here but in general here 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.090
 do not need a huge drawing distance 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.580
 since here are mostly approximate 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.040
 such scenes here are just not visible that 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.360
 there are constantly moving away 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.150
 approximate characters so here 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 all done here by the way a link to the game I 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.150
 leave in the description for the video can there 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 download means so come on now 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.070
 let's see what needs to be done 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.570
 here is a nakida post ideology from these 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:41.880
 dialogues depend on the further development 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:44.220
 plot as far as I understood it and the principle 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.060
 played she delays want to pass 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.959
 further but this is again due to the plot 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.130
 as if here would add more 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:57.269
 some action seems to me it was 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:59.820
 would be a different game 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.510
 as it is at the moment it's ok 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.930
 I think that the game has its own style to me 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 it seems 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.790
 but the only thing I didn't like was 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.230
 the physics game seems to me my mother could 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.860
 get make it some real 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:22.850
 wooden like physics like here 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.800
 the ancients and earl knockout when 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.480
 3d games have just been created 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:32.180
 all sorts here still retire not fourth 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.430
 maybe or retire my third then 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:40.810
 there are such ancient physics 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.810
 I don't recognize for sure 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.250
 Well, in general, in principle, the game 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.730
 Great, you can install the link 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:53.510
 in the description of the game studio is still possible 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.290
 say but here's the graphics really 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:00.590
 sheets of animation is impressive perfectly 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.830
 did 1 in general, in principle, the characters 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:08.410
 beautifully traced again by 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.720
 sketch still talk also here 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.579
 wonderful scenes there when by car 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.470
 go action is yes there is all that here 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:21.079
 present that is, it looks real 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.470
 beautiful it all captures the plot 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.729
 interesting will continue to pass 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.130
 great toy 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.050
 By the way, you can even take off our passage 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.000
 I do not know for sure you can write in 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.600
 comments can also be attention 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.510
 passing here and by the way I forgot 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:42.740
 show by the way we can here 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.690
 walk in some scenes so here 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.190
 let's say 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.090
 we can go there like in many 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.890
 quests from similar who played 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.800
 that is, we can walk here yes oh this 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.930
 that's the way the least occur then 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.210
 there is when we can walk over dreams here 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.800
 constantly some kind of dialogue and everything is easier 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.740
 I think this one was needed more 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.840
 make more opportunities to pick 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.370
 all sorts of objects apply them as in 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:11.140
 many places , then the game would have been 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:13.789
 just a super one here just like that 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.180
 I think I should have added a little 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.919
 still here is such a wonderful toy 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.360
 On this review I sign up 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.360
 on the channel all bye 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.610
 knight
