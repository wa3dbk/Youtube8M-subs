 One day I was walking. 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.390
 going to school when he saw a man 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.750
 very poor, asking for help and he 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.910
 so meaningful because that man seemed 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.800

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 but it was then that he 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.200
 felt something like in the state in a 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.840
 knot in the throat 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.930
 he remembered that in his flood he had a 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.070
 Sandwich delicious and it could give 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.610

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.900

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.370

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.890
 Before I brushed my teeth I was there 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.880

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:19.600

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.160

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.320
 he was so happy and so he went to 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.610
 the school could not stop thinking 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.600
 in your plant when he got home 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.090
 Good night, little plant and it was dufour. 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.700
 how to sleep a bullfighter dreamed of a 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.300

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.390
 dreaming of that coffee with 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:54.690
 milk and woke up was rushing to see 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.690

 They dream of knowing now what this is 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.790
 I was playing football with a ball of 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.979

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.070

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:44.330
 the little plant gave him leather balls get 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.240

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.490

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.310
 He gave everything he did in nawa 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:55.100
 and then he put together a lot of toys 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.639

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:01.160
 I already know what I can do all the 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.350
 Days, now I'm going to dream about toys. 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.229
