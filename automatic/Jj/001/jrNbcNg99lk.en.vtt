00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
extra to that so that you can actually

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.309 
extra to that so that you can actually
maneuver<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.970> wick<00:02:09.149> around<00:02:09.509> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> candle

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
as its as its drying so that it always

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460 
as its as its drying so that it always
