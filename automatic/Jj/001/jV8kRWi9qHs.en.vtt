00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.170
 well here we have a little monster that is 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.650
 one of my projects done on 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.920
 rock and really 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.270
 has a piece of root 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.030
 very spectacular 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.730
 although we have before beginning 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.730
 good because we have already pruned the individual 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.200
 the main one we have cut I have cut 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.710
 two branches 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.940
 is here 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.940
 It will be a good neckline 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.540
 that has left me a good sign 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.309
 and another one that was here 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.750
 do not 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.570
 an inclined trunk 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.120
 good because a branch we have taken three 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.090
 cuttings 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.590
 as you can see 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.649
 I have peeled the bottom 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.480
 to leave it for a couple of days in water 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.720
 Soaking 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.420
 I have removed almost all the sheets possible 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.420
 you need to leave some least one 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.130
 nothing is pricked on substrate with hormones 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.020
 in root before you know yourself luck 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 principle the elms is that it is also not 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.500
 nothing with your hands follow the stick 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.890
 stick in hand skewer stick 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.210
 meat 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.000
 we are removing the earth 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.950
 and good pulling some quarrels at 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.950
 air how is the matter 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.050
 And it's good 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.200
 we already have the little tree here 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.200
 time 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:01.030
 already prepared for another year we have 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.920
 so that's about five centimeters 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.250
 more or less of earth maybe I do not 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.810
 I arrived 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.670
 the root has been left more exposed 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.360
 and here you can see how it is like 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.670
 like flying I'm like flying is very 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.340
 well your object very fly bolnuevo all 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.950
 on the rock and everything 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.200
 Well with a couple of gummies to hold 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.270
 these roots here to the lowered so that not 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.990
 escape to see how long it lasts 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.990
 is something else 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.160
 and nothing wired also for 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.120
 let's say mark the new apex not that 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.630
 it is clear not apex that you have for 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.230
 above 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.350
 and put it then the will not ask for 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.350
 she 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.670
 while we have it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.290
 The idea is 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:06.120
 create a cup here at this height create 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.969
 a cup is that everything is inclined 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.799
 towards that side as if the wind came 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.170
 from this side of here you came from 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.159
 here and the wind and I would have inclined 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.159
 all the tree asia 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.269
 to busquets 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.269
 not the new cup
