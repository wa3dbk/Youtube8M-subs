00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
country here the United States so what

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.400 
country here the United States so what
we<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.900> here<00:00:19.080> are<00:00:19.199> three<00:00:19.380> different

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we have here are three different

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.679 
we have here are three different
specific<00:00:20.189> tires<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.820> aka<00:00:21.210> chain

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
specific tires we have the aka chain

specific tires we have the aka chain

course the J concepts dirt web and each

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670 
course the J concepts dirt web and each
tire<00:00:27.150> is<00:00:27.449> on<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.840> wheel<00:00:27.960> made<00:00:28.260> by<00:00:28.470> its

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
tire is on the wheel made by its

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.429 
tire is on the wheel made by its
manufacturer<00:00:29.599> now<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.810> could<00:00:30.960> be<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> really

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
manufacturer now this could be a really

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.160 
manufacturer now this could be a really
really<00:00:31.740> long<00:00:32.160> video<00:00:32.610> but<00:00:32.880> I'll<00:00:33.719> try<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:33.989> avoid

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
really long video but I'll try to avoid

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.290 
really long video but I'll try to avoid
that<00:00:34.590> basically<00:00:35.430> what<00:00:35.610> I'm<00:00:35.700> gonna<00:00:35.850> do<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.210> I'm

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that basically what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700 
that basically what I'm gonna do is I'm
just<00:00:36.329> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.600> share<00:00:36.750> some<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> my<00:00:37.110> personal

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
just going to share some of my personal

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
just going to share some of my personal
opinions<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.280> my<00:00:38.399> thoughts<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.969> share<00:00:39.510> my

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
opinions and my thoughts and share my

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.049 
opinions and my thoughts and share my
experience<00:00:40.350> with<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:41.070> guys<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.520> each<00:00:41.730> tire

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
experience with you guys on each tire

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.440 
experience with you guys on each tire
now<00:00:42.960> each<00:00:43.260> tire<00:00:43.559> basically<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.760> couple<00:00:45.390> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
now each tire basically has a couple of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.760 
now each tire basically has a couple of
strengths<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> couple<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.170> weaknesses<00:00:46.559> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
strengths in a couple of weaknesses and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.380 
strengths in a couple of weaknesses and
so<00:00:46.890> let's<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.070> let's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.550> get<00:00:47.760> right<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
so let's just let's just get right to it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.889 
so let's just let's just get right to it
basically<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:50.610> dirt<00:00:50.850> web<00:00:51.059> seems<00:00:51.420> to<00:00:51.539> generate

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
basically the dirt web seems to generate

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.139 
basically the dirt web seems to generate
about<00:00:52.020> as<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.559> grip<00:00:52.890> as<00:00:53.100> any<00:00:53.399> tire<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
about as much grip as any tire and it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.930 
about as much grip as any tire and it
has<00:00:54.360> probably<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.050> best<00:00:55.559> life<00:00:56.100> expectancy

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
has probably the best life expectancy

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.470 
has probably the best life expectancy
for<00:00:57.629> club<00:00:57.840> racing<00:00:58.020> week<00:00:58.320> in<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.590> week<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:59.480> but

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
for club racing week in and week out but

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
for club racing week in and week out but
its<00:01:00.629> biggest<00:01:00.930> weakness<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.489> takes

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
its biggest weakness is that it takes

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.179 
its biggest weakness is that it takes
time<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.719> really<00:01:04.199> takes<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.920> longer

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
time it really takes a little bit longer

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.609 
time it really takes a little bit longer
than<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.970> other<00:01:06.000> tires<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> really

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
than the other tires for it to really

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.679 
than the other tires for it to really
for<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> traction<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.640> really<00:01:08.850> come<00:01:09.119> up<00:01:09.299> to

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
for the traction to really come up to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
for the traction to really come up to
where<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.170> super<00:01:10.619> competitive<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> pace

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
where it's super competitive and on pace

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.609 
where it's super competitive and on pace
with<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> fastest<00:01:12.390> guys<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> track<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
with the fastest guys on the track the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.440 
with the fastest guys on the track the
other<00:01:13.740> downside<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.030> happens<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
other downside is that this happens to

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.420 
other downside is that this happens to
be<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> 60<00:01:15.869> millimeter<00:01:16.020> dirt<00:01:16.409> web<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> there's

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
be a 60 millimeter dirt web and there's

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.420 
be a 60 millimeter dirt web and there's
no<00:01:17.670> question<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.990> particularly<00:01:19.950> really

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
no question that I I particularly really

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
no question that I I particularly really
liked<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.939> dirt<00:01:21.180> tech<00:01:21.450> inserts<00:01:21.900> but<00:01:22.110> they<00:01:22.560> are

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
liked the dirt tech inserts but they are

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.469 
liked the dirt tech inserts but they are
very<00:01:22.950> firm<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.369> they<00:01:23.670> tend<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.000> stay<00:01:24.240> very

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
very firm and they tend to stay very

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.450 
very firm and they tend to stay very
firm<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> while<00:01:25.140> which<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:25.950> nice<00:01:26.250> because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
firm for a while which is nice because

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.219 
firm for a while which is nice because
when<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:26.939> tires<00:01:27.119> wear<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> cut<00:01:28.080> them

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
when the tires wear out you can cut them

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.240 
when the tires wear out you can cut them
out<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.500> tires<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.799> put<00:01:29.070> them<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
out of these tires and put them in

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.230 
out of these tires and put them in
another<00:01:29.610> set<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.909> tires

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
another set of tires

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
another set of tires
but<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.500> doesn't<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.009> help<00:01:32.250> if<00:01:32.549> you're

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
but that doesn't really help if you're

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.370 
but that doesn't really help if you're
gluing<00:01:33.030> up<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> set<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.570> tires<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> want<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
gluing up a set of tires and you want to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.730 
gluing up a set of tires and you want to
compete<00:01:34.650> tonight<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.960> next<00:01:37.229> tire<00:01:37.409> is

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
compete tonight so the next tire is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
compete tonight so the next tire is
really<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.240> somewhere<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.630> between<00:01:39.720> it's

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
really kind of somewhere in between it's

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.639 
really kind of somewhere in between it's
the<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:41.369> proline<00:01:41.729> electron<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
the the proline electron and the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.100 
the the proline electron and the
electron<00:01:44.070> works<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.759> well<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.509> don't

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
electron works really well it I don't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.810 
electron works really well it I don't
know<00:01:46.320> that<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.680> generates<00:01:47.009> quite<00:01:47.430> as<00:01:47.610> much

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
know that it generates quite as much

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
know that it generates quite as much
side<00:01:48.210> bite<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.899> other<00:01:49.110> two<00:01:49.380> tires<00:01:49.649> but<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
side bite as the other two tires but the

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
side bite as the other two tires but the
one<00:01:50.820> nice<00:01:51.030> thing<00:01:51.060> about<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> electron<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
one nice thing about the electron is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.389 
one nice thing about the electron is
that<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.259> comes<00:01:52.500> up<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.829> pace<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.369> little

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
that it comes up on the pace a little

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.050 
that it comes up on the pace a little
bit<00:01:53.700> faster<00:01:54.270> than<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> other<00:01:54.509> two<00:01:54.780> tires

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
bit faster than the other two tires

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.459 
bit faster than the other two tires
ultimately<00:01:57.060> probably<00:01:57.600> generating<00:01:58.229> very

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
ultimately probably generating very

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
ultimately probably generating very
close<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:58.920> same<00:01:59.040> amount<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.399> grip<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
close to the same amount of grip the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
close to the same amount of grip the
downside<00:02:00.689> for<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.259> electron<00:02:01.740> though<00:02:01.950> is

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
downside for the electron though is

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.800 
downside for the electron though is
because<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.880> comes<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.329> little<00:02:03.509> bit<00:02:03.600> lower

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
because it comes with a little bit lower

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
because it comes with a little bit lower
tread<00:02:04.170> height<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.770> will<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.549> it's

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
tread height it will not it's it's

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.779 
tread height it will not it's it's
window<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:07.020> useful<00:02:07.649> you<00:02:08.009> know<00:02:08.099> traction<00:02:08.640> is

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
window of of useful you know traction is

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.449 
window of of useful you know traction is
just<00:02:09.300> smaller<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.229> electron<00:02:10.770> will<00:02:11.039> probably

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
just smaller the electron will probably

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.309 
just smaller the electron will probably
generate<00:02:11.580> just<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:11.940> much<00:02:12.060> grip<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.170> was

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
generate just as much grip and if I was

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.910 
generate just as much grip and if I was
in<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.470> bind

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
in a bind

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.680 
in a bind
if<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.670> was<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.910> bind<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.180> had<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.420> grow<00:02:15.540> up<00:02:15.630> a

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
if I was in a bind and had to grow up a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.390 
if I was in a bind and had to grow up a
set<00:02:15.840> of<00:02:15.870> tires<00:02:16.080> right<00:02:16.319> now<00:02:16.500> tonight<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.190> race

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
set of tires right now tonight and race

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220

depending<00:02:18.209> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.360> track<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.600> I'm<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.990> I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
depending on the track that I'm at I

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.020 
depending on the track that I'm at I
would<00:02:19.680> probably<00:02:19.920> choose<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.459> chain-link<00:02:20.730> of

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
would probably choose the chain-link of

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.660 
would probably choose the chain-link of
the<00:02:21.090> electron<00:02:21.450> first<00:02:22.250> over<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.280> dirt<00:02:23.459> web

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
the electron first over the dirt web

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.670 
the electron first over the dirt web
just<00:02:24.540> because<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.110> could<00:02:25.170> get<00:02:25.470> them<00:02:25.650> to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
just because I think I could get them to

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.490 
just because I think I could get them to
a<00:02:25.950> higher<00:02:26.430> traction<00:02:26.970> quicker<00:02:27.209> but<00:02:28.050> there's<00:02:28.350> no

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
a higher traction quicker but there's no

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.410 
a higher traction quicker but there's no
question<00:02:28.650> if<00:02:28.980> you're<00:02:29.069> gonna<00:02:29.160> buy<00:02:29.790> tires<00:02:30.090> and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
question if you're gonna buy tires and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.790 
question if you're gonna buy tires and
you<00:02:30.540> really<00:02:30.990> want<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.200> get<00:02:31.260> some<00:02:31.410> use<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:31.709> you

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
you really want to get some use and you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.630 
you really want to get some use and you
really<00:02:31.980> want<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.160> get<00:02:32.220> your<00:02:32.340> money's<00:02:32.610> worth

out of them the electron doesn't tend to

out of them the electron doesn't tend to

last as long as the other two tires now
the<00:02:37.680> chain<00:02:38.220> link<00:02:38.459> which<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.640> basically<00:02:39.030> the

the chain link which is basically the

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.180 
the chain link which is basically the
obviously<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.959> here<00:02:40.080> the<00:02:40.170> last<00:02:40.830> tire<00:02:41.040> we'll

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
obviously right here the last tire we'll

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
obviously right here the last tire we'll
talk<00:02:41.370> about<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.780> generates<00:02:43.170> quite<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.500> of

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
talk about it generates quite a bit of

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.479 
talk about it generates quite a bit of
grip<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:44.550> definitely<00:02:45.239> comes<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.890> breaks<00:02:47.220> in

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
grip it definitely comes up it breaks in

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.930 
grip it definitely comes up it breaks in
more<00:02:48.270> quickly<00:02:48.630> than<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.560> dirt<00:02:49.739> web<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.220> maybe

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
more quickly than the dirt web and maybe

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.790 
more quickly than the dirt web and maybe
even<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.239> little<00:02:51.300> bit<00:02:51.450> more<00:02:51.630> quickly<00:02:51.870> than<00:02:52.350> the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
even a little bit more quickly than the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920 
even a little bit more quickly than the
electron<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> it<00:02:53.880> definitely<00:02:54.060> tends<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.720> last

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
electron and it definitely tends to last

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.460 
electron and it definitely tends to last
so<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:56.700> far<00:02:56.940> as<00:02:57.000> side<00:02:57.330> bite<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.810> really<00:02:58.200> feels

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
so as far as side bite it really feels

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
so as far as side bite it really feels
very<00:02:58.830> once<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.400> get<00:02:59.610> both<00:02:59.820> of<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.090> chain<00:03:00.330> link

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
very once I get both of the chain link

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.990 
very once I get both of the chain link
and<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.870> dirt<00:03:01.080> web<00:03:01.230> broke<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.280> almost<00:03:02.580> can't

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
and the dirt web broke in I almost can't

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.920 
and the dirt web broke in I almost can't
tell<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.390> difference

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
tell the difference

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.960 
tell the difference
the<00:03:04.230> biggest<00:03:04.440> difference<00:03:04.920> with<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.700> chain

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
the biggest difference with the chain

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.340 
the biggest difference with the chain
link<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.510> dirt<00:03:06.690> web<00:03:06.870> when<00:03:07.080> they're<00:03:07.200> all

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
link and the dirt web when they're all

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.949 
link and the dirt web when they're all
broken<00:03:07.680> in<00:03:07.980> is<00:03:08.160> that<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> dirt<00:03:09.390> web<00:03:09.600> the

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
broken in is that the dirt web the

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.870 
broken in is that the dirt web the
insert<00:03:10.410> stays<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:11.160> little<00:03:11.340> bit<00:03:11.519> firmer<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
insert stays a little bit firmer a

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.580 
insert stays a little bit firmer a
little<00:03:12.030> bit<00:03:12.150> longer<00:03:12.360> and<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:13.140> think<00:03:13.320> that

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
little bit longer and so I I think that

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.570 
little bit longer and so I I think that
makes<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.950> tire<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.190> little<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.430> more

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
makes the tire a little bit more

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.970 
makes the tire a little bit more
consistent<00:03:15.260> but<00:03:16.260> when<00:03:16.470> they<00:03:16.560> insert<00:03:16.830> get<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
consistent but when they insert get a

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.229 
consistent but when they insert get a
little<00:03:17.130> bit<00:03:17.220> softer<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> chain<00:03:18.000> link<00:03:18.180> I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
little bit softer and the chain link I

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.000 
little bit softer and the chain link I
think<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.480> makes<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.470> as<00:03:19.799> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
think it makes it just you know as the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.710 
think it makes it just you know as the
insert<00:03:20.370> goes<00:03:20.519> away<00:03:20.760> there's<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:21.150> that<00:03:21.299> sweet

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
insert goes away there's like that sweet

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.910 
insert goes away there's like that sweet
spot<00:03:21.930> where<00:03:22.079> it<00:03:22.170> gets<00:03:22.290> really<00:03:22.530> really<00:03:22.650> high

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
spot where it gets really really high

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.190 
spot where it gets really really high
traction<00:03:23.220> but<00:03:23.670> in<00:03:23.970> general<00:03:24.660> these<00:03:24.810> are<00:03:24.959> just

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
traction but in general these are just

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.130 
traction but in general these are just
there<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.500> three<00:03:25.650> really<00:03:25.890> good<00:03:26.130> tires<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.880> a

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
there are three really good tires and a

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.289 
there are three really good tires and a
lot<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.170> these<00:03:28.410> tires<00:03:28.680> work<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.670> variety<00:03:30.030> of

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
lot of these tires work a variety of

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.880 
lot of these tires work a variety of
tracks<00:03:30.540> my<00:03:30.750> home<00:03:30.930> track<00:03:31.170> rain<00:03:31.410> man's<00:03:31.620> any

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
tracks my home track rain man's any

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.770 
tracks my home track rain man's any
three<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.400> these<00:03:32.579> tires<00:03:32.790> I've<00:03:33.060> used<00:03:33.420> all<00:03:33.630> of

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
three of these tires I've used all of

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.900 
three of these tires I've used all of
them<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.049> compete<00:03:34.380> very<00:03:35.100> very<00:03:35.370> similar<00:03:35.640> if<00:03:35.850> not

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
them to compete very very similar if not

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.500 
them to compete very very similar if not
identical<00:03:36.090> lap<00:03:36.630> times<00:03:37.459> down<00:03:38.459> at<00:03:38.640> SC<00:03:38.940> VRC<00:03:39.360> which

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
identical lap times down at SC VRC which

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.030 
identical lap times down at SC VRC which
is<00:03:39.600> about<00:03:39.750> an<00:03:39.870> hour<00:03:39.900> south<00:03:40.320> I've<00:03:40.560> used<00:03:40.829> all

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
is about an hour south I've used all

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.560 
is about an hour south I've used all
three<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.430> these<00:03:41.489> tires<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.850> had<00:03:42.090> identical

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
three of these tires and had identical

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.240 
three of these tires and had identical
lap<00:03:42.840> times<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.769> think<00:03:43.860> what<00:03:44.100> you'll

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
lap times and so I think what you'll

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.800 
lap times and so I think what you'll
find<00:03:44.280> is<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.489> on<00:03:44.850> a<00:03:44.880> lot<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.329> clay<00:03:45.510> tracks

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
find is that on a lot of the clay tracks

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.600 
find is that on a lot of the clay tracks
around<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.110> country<00:03:46.470> any<00:03:47.130> of<00:03:47.310> these<00:03:47.430> tires

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
around the country any of these tires

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.370 
around the country any of these tires
will<00:03:47.880> probably<00:03:48.450> work<00:03:48.660> but<00:03:49.140> there's

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
will probably work but there's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.930 
will probably work but there's
absolutely<00:03:49.620> no<00:03:50.010> question<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.700> there<00:03:50.850> are

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
absolutely no question that there are

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.850 
absolutely no question that there are
going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.180> be<00:03:51.239> tracks<00:03:51.600> where<00:03:51.870> one<00:03:52.200> tire<00:03:52.470> will

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
going to be tracks where one tire will

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.069 
going to be tracks where one tire will
reign<00:03:53.100> supreme<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.090> guess<00:03:54.450> at<00:03:54.720> the<00:03:54.840> end<00:03:54.959> of

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
reign supreme so I guess at the end of

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.500 
reign supreme so I guess at the end of
the<00:03:55.140> day<00:03:55.350> I've<00:03:56.100> shared<00:03:56.400> my<00:03:56.579> opinion<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.150> these

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
the day I've shared my opinion on these

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.930 
the day I've shared my opinion on these
three<00:03:57.810> tires<00:03:58.310> obviously<00:03:59.310> that<00:03:59.519> these<00:03:59.790> are

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
three tires obviously that these are

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.470 
three tires obviously that these are
three<00:04:00.390> very<00:04:01.610> they're<00:04:02.610> new<00:04:02.790> products<00:04:03.269> they

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
three very they're new products they

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.509 
three very they're new products they
work<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.959> well<00:04:04.079> but<00:04:04.769> I<00:04:04.799> would<00:04:04.980> say<00:04:05.190> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
work really well but I would say the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.729 
work really well but I would say the
safest<00:04:05.970> bet<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:07.260> go<00:04:07.380> look<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.650> what

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
safest bet for you is to go look at what

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.470 
safest bet for you is to go look at what
some<00:04:07.829> of<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.010> fastest<00:04:08.400> guys<00:04:08.579> on<00:04:08.880> your<00:04:09.180> track

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
some of the fastest guys on your track

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.420 
some of the fastest guys on your track
are<00:04:09.660> running<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.140> give<00:04:10.620> whatever<00:04:11.130> they're

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
are running and give whatever they're

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.400 
are running and give whatever they're
doing<00:04:11.670> a<00:04:11.760> try<00:04:11.940> because<00:04:12.150> odds<00:04:12.870> are<00:04:13.140> that's

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
doing a try because odds are that's

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.159 
doing a try because odds are that's
these<00:04:13.950> guys<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:15.209> local<00:04:15.510> fast<00:04:15.720> guys<00:04:15.959> they

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
these guys the local fast guys they

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.599 
these guys the local fast guys they
usually<00:04:16.289> put<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.680> time<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.100> know<00:04:17.340> what<00:04:17.519> it

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
usually put the time in to know what it

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.370 
usually put the time in to know what it
takes<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:18.000> end<00:04:18.090> up<00:04:18.209> going<00:04:18.329> fast<00:04:18.660> so<00:04:18.900> anyways<00:04:19.320> I
