it I got it because the Leonard's I have

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.490 
it I got it because the Leonard's I have
our<00:00:39.440> LED<00:00:39.949> and<00:00:40.790> it<00:00:41.570> puts<00:00:41.780> out<00:00:41.900> a<00:00:41.930> really<00:00:42.290> harsh

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
our LED and it puts out a really harsh

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.319 
our LED and it puts out a really harsh
light<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:43.160> really<00:00:43.460> brightens<00:00:43.699> everything<00:00:43.940> up

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
light it really brightens everything up

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:45.819 
light it really brightens everything up
but<00:00:44.570> it's<00:00:44.690> really<00:00:44.840> kind<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.230> harsh<00:00:45.469> and<00:00:45.559> I

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
but it's really kind of harsh and I

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.819 
but it's really kind of harsh and I
wanted<00:00:46.129> more<00:00:46.280> of<00:00:46.309> a<00:00:46.430> mood<00:00:46.670> lighting<00:00:46.940> type<00:00:47.329> deal

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
wanted more of a mood lighting type deal

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.560 
wanted more of a mood lighting type deal
so<00:00:48.829> that's<00:00:48.950> actually<00:00:49.160> why<00:00:49.460> I<00:00:49.489> got<00:00:49.730> this<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.210> it

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
so that's actually why I got this so it

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.299 
so that's actually why I got this so it
would<00:00:50.719> be<00:00:50.870> more<00:00:51.140> ambience<00:00:51.739> when<00:00:52.070> we<00:00:52.190> go

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
would be more ambience when we go

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.819 
would be more ambience when we go
camping<00:00:52.840> instead<00:00:53.840> of<00:00:53.930> light<00:00:54.170> shining<00:00:54.590> in<00:00:54.680> your

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
camping instead of light shining in your

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.290 
camping instead of light shining in your
eyes<00:00:54.949> I'm<00:00:55.160> hoping<00:00:55.430> it's<00:00:55.610> bright<00:00:55.850> enough<00:00:55.879> just

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
eyes I'm hoping it's bright enough just

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.910 
eyes I'm hoping it's bright enough just
so<00:00:56.420> you<00:00:56.510> can<00:00:56.629> play<00:00:56.780> Scrabble<00:00:56.899> or<00:00:57.530> something

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
so you can play Scrabble or something

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.819 
so you can play Scrabble or something
like<00:00:58.070> that<00:00:58.129> I<00:00:58.609> don't<00:00:59.570> see<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.050> as<00:01:00.140> much<00:01:00.379> as<00:01:00.559> a

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
like that I don't see it as much as a

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:02.529 
like that I don't see it as much as a
survival<00:01:01.460> tool<00:01:01.670> because<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.149> takes<00:01:02.359> special

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
survival tool because it takes special

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.639 
survival tool because it takes special
candles<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:04.960> was<00:01:05.960> thinking<00:01:06.170> about<00:01:06.229> making<00:01:06.590> a

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
candles I was thinking about making a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.050 
candles I was thinking about making a
mold<00:01:06.830> see<00:01:07.039> if<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:07.250> could<00:01:07.399> make<00:01:07.580> those<00:01:07.729> myself

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
mold see if I could make those myself

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.650 
mold see if I could make those myself
just<00:01:08.600> a<00:01:08.780> just<00:01:09.380> because<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:09.860> would<00:01:09.950> be<00:01:10.100> cheaper

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
just a just because it would be cheaper

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.270 
just a just because it would be cheaper
but<00:01:11.660> basically<00:01:12.229> I<00:01:12.259> got<00:01:12.560> it<00:01:12.679> just<00:01:12.830> for<00:01:12.950> kind<00:01:13.250> of

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
but basically I got it just for kind of

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.859 
but basically I got it just for kind of
like<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.520> mood<00:01:13.789> lighting<00:01:14.090> thing<00:01:14.479> when<00:01:14.750> we're

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
like a mood lighting thing when we're

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.260 
like a mood lighting thing when we're
out<00:01:14.990> camping<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.740> put<00:01:15.890> outside<00:01:16.220> and<00:01:16.549> perhaps

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
out camping to put outside and perhaps

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.770 
out camping to put outside and perhaps
we<00:01:17.570> can<00:01:17.689> play<00:01:17.840> Scrabble<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.500> things<00:01:18.830> on<00:01:19.280> it<00:01:19.780> it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780

has a spring on the bottom so these

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.090 
has a spring on the bottom so these
candles<00:01:59.810> are<00:01:59.899> spring-loaded<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:00.619> as<00:02:00.799> they

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
candles are spring-loaded so as they

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760 
candles are spring-loaded so as they
burn<00:02:01.369> down<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.600> spring<00:02:02.869> pushes<00:02:03.049> them<00:02:03.409> up<00:02:03.560> so

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
burn down the spring pushes them up so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.510 
burn down the spring pushes them up so
that<00:02:03.799> these<00:02:04.070> candle<00:02:04.549> wicks<00:02:04.729> stay<00:02:04.939> at<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> top

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
that these candle wicks stay at the top

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.740 
that these candle wicks stay at the top
I've<00:02:07.520> only<00:02:07.670> got<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:07.880> hand<00:02:08.329> and<00:02:08.539> I'm<00:02:08.630> holding

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
I've only got one hand and I'm holding

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.060 
I've only got one hand and I'm holding
the<00:02:08.929> camera<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:09.350> one<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:09.709> I<00:02:09.739> couldn't<00:02:09.950> show

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
the camera with one so I couldn't show

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.560 
the camera with one so I couldn't show
you<00:02:10.220> that<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:10.640> I<00:02:10.670> just<00:02:10.729> want<00:02:11.060> to<00:02:11.150> make<00:02:11.390> sure<00:02:11.420> I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
you that but I just want to make sure I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.990 
you that but I just want to make sure I
showed<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.049> that<00:02:12.230> and<00:02:12.590> I'll<00:02:13.459> get<00:02:13.610> back<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> you

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
showed you that and I'll get back to you

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.199 
showed you that and I'll get back to you
after<00:02:14.299> it's<00:02:14.420> dark

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:20.209 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.880 

okay<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.269> this<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.810> exactly<00:02:22.230> two<00:02:22.500> cups<00:02:22.769> of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
okay so this is exactly two cups of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.240 
okay so this is exactly two cups of
water

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
water

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.679 
water
Nathan<00:02:23.939> mold<00:02:24.180> aluminum<00:02:24.659> camping<00:02:25.140> pot<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:26.689 
Nathan mold aluminum camping pot and

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.360 
Nathan mold aluminum camping pot and
let's<00:02:27.689> see<00:02:27.959> how<00:02:28.230> long<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.530> takes<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.980> table

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
let's see how long it takes this table

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.199 
let's see how long it takes this table
we're<00:02:29.879> about<00:02:30.060> two<00:02:30.420> minutes<00:02:30.659> before<00:02:30.989> 8<00:02:31.560> o'clock

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
we're about two minutes before 8 o'clock

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.619 
we're about two minutes before 8 o'clock
so<00:02:33.209> we'll<00:02:33.599> be<00:02:33.719> back<00:02:35.120> okay<00:02:36.120> it's<00:02:36.239> been<00:02:36.389> about<00:02:36.569> a

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
so we'll be back okay it's been about a

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.199 
so we'll be back okay it's been about a
half<00:02:36.780> an<00:02:36.989> hour<00:02:37.139> and<00:02:37.319> it's<00:02:37.439> still<00:02:37.650> not<00:02:37.799> boiling

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
half an hour and it's still not boiling

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.080 
half an hour and it's still not boiling
there's<00:02:39.209> some<00:02:39.420> large<00:02:39.629> bubbles<00:02:40.049> in<00:02:40.170> there

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
there's some large bubbles in there

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.699 
there's some large bubbles in there
we're<00:02:42.090> gonna<00:02:42.329> see<00:02:43.109> if<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.290> get<00:02:43.469> to<00:02:43.680> a<00:02:43.709> boil

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
we're gonna see if you get to a boil

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.369 
we're gonna see if you get to a boil
okay<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.829> been<00:02:47.010> about<00:02:47.040> 45<00:02:47.730> minutes<00:02:48.030> or<00:02:48.659> 42

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
okay it's been about 45 minutes or 42

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.770 
okay it's been about 45 minutes or 42
minutes<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.859> just<00:02:49.920> measured<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:51.540> water

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
minutes I just measured it the water

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.020 
minutes I just measured it the water
temperature<00:02:52.230> is<00:02:52.290> 196<00:02:53.159> degrees<00:02:53.549> so<00:02:53.849> I'm<00:02:53.939> gonna

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
temperature is 196 degrees so I'm gonna

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.789 
temperature is 196 degrees so I'm gonna
let<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.269> go<00:02:54.480> for<00:02:54.689> a<00:02:54.750> long<00:02:54.930> while<00:02:55.079> longer

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
let it go for a long while longer

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.860 
let it go for a long while longer
to<00:02:56.489> see<00:02:56.700> if<00:02:56.819> we<00:02:56.970> can<00:02:57.120> actually<00:02:57.239> get<00:02:57.599> it<00:02:57.720> to<00:02:57.750> a

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
to see if we can actually get it to a

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.589 
to see if we can actually get it to a
boil<00:02:58.200> we'll<00:02:59.189> see<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.730> then<00:02:59.909> I'm<00:03:00.150> gonna<00:03:00.299> do<00:03:00.569> a

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
boil we'll see and then I'm gonna do a

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.129 
boil we'll see and then I'm gonna do a
light<00:03:00.870> test<00:03:01.169> and<00:03:01.409> see<00:03:01.560> how<00:03:01.590> bright<00:03:01.799> is<00:03:01.950> this

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:03.139 
light test and see how bright is this

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.869 
light test and see how bright is this
okay<00:03:04.139> it's<00:03:04.290> about<00:03:04.409> 55<00:03:05.099> minutes<00:03:05.340> into<00:03:05.760> the

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
okay it's about 55 minutes into the

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:08.420 
okay it's about 55 minutes into the
experiment<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.689> I'm<00:03:06.900> seeing<00:03:07.139> steam<00:03:07.530> escaping

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
experiment and I'm seeing steam escaping

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.080 
experiment and I'm seeing steam escaping
from<00:03:08.760> the<00:03:08.939> lid<00:03:09.150> so<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:10.290> thinking<00:03:10.849> it's<00:03:11.849> gonna

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
from the lid so I'm thinking it's gonna

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.670 
from the lid so I'm thinking it's gonna
start<00:03:12.359> boiling<00:03:12.599> any<00:03:12.930> minute<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:16.200> I'll

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
start boiling any minute now and I'll

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.319 
start boiling any minute now and I'll
get<00:03:16.859> back<00:03:16.889> to<00:03:17.159> you<00:03:17.280> in<00:03:17.489> five<00:03:17.549> minutes<00:03:17.790> okay

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
get back to you in five minutes okay

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.490 
get back to you in five minutes okay
it's<00:03:18.510> been<00:03:18.659> about<00:03:18.689> an<00:03:18.989> hour<00:03:19.109> into<00:03:19.409> the

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
it's been about an hour into the

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.209 
it's been about an hour into the
experiment

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.219 
experiment

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:23.179 
experiment
I<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.519> steam<00:03:20.819> rising<00:03:21.629> from<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:21.930> lid<00:03:22.189> let's

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:23.189 
I see steam rising from the lid let's

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:25.460 
I see steam rising from the lid let's
see<00:03:23.340> if<00:03:23.430> it's<00:03:23.579> boiling<00:03:24.079> I'm<00:03:25.079> gonna<00:03:25.260> measure

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
see if it's boiling I'm gonna measure

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.530 
see if it's boiling I'm gonna measure
the<00:03:25.739> temperature<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.579> then<00:03:27.120> let's<00:03:27.299> go<00:03:27.510> ahead

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
the temperature and then let's go ahead

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.670 
the temperature and then let's go ahead
and<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.769> actually<00:03:29.099> boiling<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:30.560> think<00:03:31.560> it's

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
and it's actually boiling I think it's

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.530 
and it's actually boiling I think it's
probably<00:03:31.979> been<00:03:32.489> boiling<00:03:32.729> since<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> steam

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
probably been boiling since the steam

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.809 
probably been boiling since the steam
was<00:03:33.659> coming<00:03:33.989> out<00:03:34.049> a<00:03:34.109> little<00:03:34.409> about<00:03:34.680> 55<00:03:35.400> minutes

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
was coming out a little about 55 minutes

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.629 
was coming out a little about 55 minutes
but<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.449> a<00:03:36.479> boil<00:03:37.189> with<00:03:38.189> the<00:03:38.220> little<00:03:38.519> and

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
but that is a boil with the little and

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.039 
but that is a boil with the little and
it<00:03:38.729> definitely<00:03:38.879> blows<00:03:39.359> the<00:03:39.510> water<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.959> not

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
it definitely blows the water it's not

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.189 
it definitely blows the water it's not
quite<00:03:40.669> boiling<00:03:41.669> now<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:42.569> it<00:03:42.659> definitely<00:03:43.049> was

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
quite boiling now but it definitely was

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.229 
quite boiling now but it definitely was
so<00:03:43.590> there<00:03:43.829> you<00:03:43.949> have<00:03:43.979> it<00:03:44.099> a<00:03:44.280> bowl<00:03:44.609> two<00:03:44.849> cups<00:03:45.090> of

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
so there you have it a bowl two cups of

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:53.270 
so there you have it a bowl two cups of
water<00:03:45.419> in<00:03:45.689> one<00:03:46.290> hours<00:03:46.590> time

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.930 

and<00:03:53.370> then<00:03:54.209> this<00:03:54.480> box<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:56.310> see<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.490> kennel

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
and then this box the you see a kennel

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.970 
and then this box the you see a kennel
ear<00:03:57.090> box<00:03:57.390> I<00:03:57.810> can<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.790> perfectly<00:03:59.790> I<00:04:00.680> would<00:04:01.680> say

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
ear box I can see perfectly I would say

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.000 
ear box I can see perfectly I would say
that<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:05.180> how<00:04:06.180> long<00:04:06.360> excuse<00:04:07.080> me<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.470> really<00:04:07.830> got

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
that is how long excuse me I really got

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.640 
that is how long excuse me I really got
one<00:04:08.190> hand<00:04:10.819> box<00:04:11.819> is<00:04:12.270> about<00:04:12.569> 21<00:04:13.020> inches<00:04:13.050> away

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
one hand box is about 21 inches away

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.650 
one hand box is about 21 inches away
from<00:04:13.830> the<00:04:14.550> candle<00:04:15.000> in<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.510> lire<00:04:17.269> so<00:04:18.269> if<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.450> move

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
from the candle in the lire so if I move

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.470 
from the candle in the lire so if I move
it<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:18.840> closer<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:20.239> think<00:04:21.239> you<00:04:21.329> can

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
it a little closer I think you can

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.470 
it a little closer I think you can
probably<00:04:21.690> make<00:04:21.810> it<00:04:22.109> just<00:04:22.320> about<00:04:22.380> everything

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
probably make it just about everything

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.850 
probably make it just about everything
so<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.510> could<00:04:24.750> play<00:04:24.900> Scrabble<00:04:25.350> or<00:04:25.470> something

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
so I could play Scrabble or something

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.570 
so I could play Scrabble or something
around<00:04:26.070> a<00:04:26.190> picnic<00:04:26.490> table<00:04:26.880> with<00:04:27.000> this<00:04:27.120> lamp<00:04:28.580> you

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
around a picnic table with this lamp you

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.100 
around a picnic table with this lamp you
see<00:04:29.760> if<00:04:29.850> I<00:04:29.940> can<00:04:30.090> show<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.360> how<00:04:30.600> well<00:04:30.810> it<00:04:30.930> lights

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
see if I can show you how well it lights

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.000 
see if I can show you how well it lights
everything<00:04:31.320> up<00:04:35.030> it's<00:04:36.030> okay<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.830> wouldn't<00:04:37.830> want

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
everything up it's okay I wouldn't want

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.409 
everything up it's okay I wouldn't want
to<00:04:38.040> go<00:04:38.160> walking<00:04:38.370> around<00:04:38.550> with<00:04:38.880> this<00:04:39.060> because<00:04:39.270> a

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
to go walking around with this because a

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.690 
to go walking around with this because a
lot<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.750> light<00:04:40.050> gets<00:04:40.290> in<00:04:40.440> your<00:04:40.500> eyes<00:04:40.710> through

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
lot of light gets in your eyes through

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.240 
lot of light gets in your eyes through
those<00:04:41.850> top<00:04:42.090> vents<00:04:42.650> but<00:04:43.650> if<00:04:43.800> you<00:04:43.890> set<00:04:44.130> it

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
those top vents but if you set it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.450 
those top vents but if you set it
somewhere<00:04:44.430> I<00:04:46.040> think<00:04:47.040> it'll<00:04:47.160> give<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.430> a

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
somewhere I think it'll give you a

somewhere I think it'll give you a
really<00:04:47.669> good<00:04:47.790> mood<00:04:48.030> lighting

you see if I can show you how well it

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.980 
you see if I can show you how well it
lights<00:04:55.300> everything<00:04:55.480> up<00:04:59.220> it's<00:05:00.220> okay<00:05:00.580> I

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
lights everything up it's okay I

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.030 
lights everything up it's okay I
wouldn't<00:05:01.990> want<00:05:02.170> to<00:05:02.200> go<00:05:02.320> walking<00:05:02.680> around<00:05:02.740> with

through<00:05:05.860> these<00:05:05.980> top<00:05:06.280> vents<00:05:06.840> but<00:05:07.840> if<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.080> set

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290

through these top vents but if you set
it<00:05:08.320> somewhere<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:10.020> think<00:05:11.020> it'll<00:05:11.320> give<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.590> a
