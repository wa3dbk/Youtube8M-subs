00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.750
 you need advice that is to a 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.119
 beginner is myself raÃºl carrasco 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.390
 discipline dedication and above all 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.390
 weather 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.980
 at what age should you start 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:41.320
 increase good muscle mass to the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.730
 age that you have to start doing 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.630
 weights the bodybuilding exercises 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:48.400
 hypertrophy is at the age of which at a 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.060
 age that practically what is the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.550
 maturation development is the closure 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.830
 hormone is usually called medically 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.870
 has closed that usually happens most 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.790
 of age at 18 20 years would be ideal 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.460
 that does not mean that a little more 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.390
 early at 16 or 15 years old under 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.149
 medical supervision is to perform the 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 work with hypertrophy or compresses 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.959
 how much creatine should be taken 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.659
 every day 5 grams would be enough 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.269
 Good 5 grams a day for an athlete and 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:28.480
 mimics the normal creatine that an athlete 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.939
 You can purchase it in your daily diet 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.489
 thus from 5 grams to 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.870
 up there would be a surplus what is it 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.510
 an athlete of hypertrophy needs 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.670
 let's say that between 5 grams minimum and 10 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.140
 grams as average normal and if not 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.420
 We were professional athletes in the 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.240
 case of 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.459
 I myself fins from 90 to 100 or more more 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.060
 weight and even 15 grams daily would be 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.060
 why
