00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
I can have half this light hang from one

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.209 
I can have half this light hang from one
side<00:01:51.240> or<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:52.170> maybe<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.710> all<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.979> hang<00:01:53.189> it

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
side or I can maybe just all I hang it

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.609 
side or I can maybe just all I hang it
vertically<00:01:53.700> instead<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.119> horizontally<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:55.049> can

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
vertically instead of horizontally I can

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.080 
vertically instead of horizontally I can
quickly<00:01:56.039> adjust<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.579> here

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.580 

am<00:02:02.090> I<00:02:02.240> doing<00:02:02.450> this<00:02:02.540> backwards<00:02:02.900> there<00:02:03.320> we<00:02:03.410> go

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
am I doing this backwards there we go

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.040 
am I doing this backwards there we go
and<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.790> can<00:02:04.940> hang<00:02:05.150> it<00:02:05.270> just<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:05.960> we

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 
and you can hang it just like that so we

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.570 
and you can hang it just like that so we
get<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.200> lot<00:02:06.410> of<00:02:06.470> really<00:02:06.770> cool<00:02:06.950> options<00:02:07.370> there

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
get a lot of really cool options there

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.640 
get a lot of really cool options there
nice<00:02:08.390> white<00:02:08.690> holes<00:02:08.930> to<00:02:09.140> get<00:02:09.260> you<00:02:09.380> know<00:02:09.500> your

cool stuff with this this is actually

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.600 
cool stuff with this this is actually
bright<00:02:33.410> enough<00:02:33.620> and<00:02:33.800> you'll<00:02:33.920> see<00:02:34.130> in<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.280> second

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
bright enough and you'll see in a second

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.130 
bright enough and you'll see in a second
that<00:02:34.640> you<00:02:34.850> could<00:02:35.000> put<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:35.480> inside<00:02:35.930> your

trusting and save yourself a little bit
of<00:02:38.060> room<00:02:38.270> or<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.960> can<00:02:39.170> hang<00:02:39.650> it<00:02:39.770> off<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:40.070> the

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
of room or you can hang it off to the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.710 
of room or you can hang it off to the
sides<00:02:40.430> again<00:02:40.700> some<00:02:40.880> really<00:02:41.180> neat<00:02:41.330> things<00:02:41.540> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
sides again some really neat things you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.190 
sides again some really neat things you
can<00:02:41.870> do<00:02:42.020> with<00:02:42.230> it<00:02:43.660> I'm<00:02:44.660> going<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.840> show<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.080> how

can do with it I'm going to show you how
bright<00:02:45.380> this<00:02:45.560> is<00:02:45.710> now<00:02:45.950> again<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.760> UV<00:02:47.150> 16<00:02:47.690> which

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
bright this is now again the UV 16 which

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.410 
bright this is now again the UV 16 which
is<00:02:48.160> ungodly<00:02:49.160> bright<00:02:49.760> it's<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.060> looking<00:02:50.330> at

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
is ungodly bright it's like looking at

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
is ungodly bright it's like looking at
the<00:02:50.510> surface<00:02:50.840> of<00:02:50.960> the<00:02:51.020> Sun<00:02:51.230> 16<00:02:52.130> 1<00:02:52.580> watt<00:02:52.880> LEDs

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
the surface of the Sun 16 1 watt LEDs

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.500 
the surface of the Sun 16 1 watt LEDs
the<00:02:54.080> original<00:02:54.710> version<00:02:55.040> of<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.280> was<00:02:55.490> 18<00:02:56.090> 1

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
the original version of this was 18 1

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.790 
the original version of this was 18 1
watt<00:02:56.780> LEDs<00:02:57.370> these<00:02:58.370> are<00:02:58.760> 18<00:02:59.540> 3<00:03:00.080> watt<00:03:00.290> LEDs

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
watt LEDs these are 18 3 watt LEDs

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.850 
watt LEDs these are 18 3 watt LEDs
super-bright<00:03:02.080> because<00:03:03.080> they<00:03:03.230> are<00:03:03.350> spread<00:03:03.680> up

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
super-bright because they are spread up

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.229 
super-bright because they are spread up
it<00:03:04.130> doesn't<00:03:04.430> look<00:03:04.520> like<00:03:04.550> you're<00:03:04.850> staring<00:03:05.060> at

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
it doesn't look like you're staring at

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.400 
it doesn't look like you're staring at
the<00:03:05.300> surface<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.840> Sun<00:03:06.020> so<00:03:06.170> that's<00:03:06.260> a

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
the surface of the Sun so that's a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.930 
the surface of the Sun so that's a
little<00:03:06.530> bit<00:03:06.680> nicer<00:03:07.040> now<00:03:07.459> you'll<00:03:07.610> notice<00:03:07.820> here

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
little bit nicer now you'll notice here

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.729 
little bit nicer now you'll notice here
also<00:03:08.390> there's<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.690> nice<00:03:08.870> little<00:03:09.020> reflection

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
also there's a nice little reflection

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.900 
also there's a nice little reflection
there<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.100> can<00:03:10.250> almost<00:03:10.370> see<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.610> little

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
there you can almost see the little

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.070 
there you can almost see the little
light<00:03:11.060> that's<00:03:11.270> on<00:03:11.420> top<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.750> my<00:03:11.840> camera

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
light that's on top of my camera

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.050 
light that's on top of my camera
obviously<00:03:12.920> that's<00:03:13.370> going<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.610> help<00:03:13.790> you<00:03:14.000> know

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
obviously that's going to help you know

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.050 
obviously that's going to help you know
a<00:03:14.120> little<00:03:14.300> bit<00:03:14.420> more<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.880> really<00:03:16.880> rugged

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
a little bit more and really rugged

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.670 
a little bit more and really rugged
construction<00:03:17.330> actually<00:03:17.840> this<00:03:18.170> sucker<00:03:18.410> is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
construction actually this sucker is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.820 
construction actually this sucker is
metal<00:03:19.130> all<00:03:19.310> the<00:03:19.370> way<00:03:19.970> around<00:03:20.540> the<00:03:21.410> only<00:03:21.650> thing

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
metal all the way around the only thing

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.550 
metal all the way around the only thing
that<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.100> not<00:03:22.310> metal<00:03:22.580> is<00:03:23.020> the<00:03:24.020> cover<00:03:24.260> in<00:03:24.440> front

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
that is not metal is the cover in front

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.640 
that is not metal is the cover in front
the<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:26.180> let's<00:03:26.600> check<00:03:26.810> it<00:03:26.930> out<00:03:27.020> we're<00:03:27.410> going<00:03:27.590> to

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
the so let's check it out we're going to

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.010 
the so let's check it out we're going to
turn<00:03:27.800> it<00:03:27.920> on<00:03:28.040> now<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.910> really<00:03:29.120> ah<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.900> know

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.020 
turn it on now it's really ah you know

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.449 
turn it on now it's really ah you know
you'll<00:03:30.440> need<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.709> instruction<00:03:31.130> manual<00:03:31.340> to

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
you'll need the instruction manual to

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.640 
you'll need the instruction manual to
turn<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:31.930> push<00:03:32.930> the<00:03:33.050> button<00:03:33.320> Todd<00:03:33.470> out

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
an instruction manual even comes with

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.550 
an instruction manual even comes with
this<00:03:36.860> this<00:03:37.400> is<00:03:37.580> a<00:03:37.610> really<00:03:38.209> simple<00:03:38.450> light<00:03:38.840> again

plug-and-play so I'm going to show you a
little<00:03:41.840> bit<00:03:41.959> of<00:03:42.110> what<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.440> looks<00:03:42.650> like<00:03:42.769> in

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
little bit of what it looks like in

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.920 
little bit of what it looks like in
again<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.519> got<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.700> really<00:03:44.030> nice<00:03:44.360> wide<00:03:44.660> beam

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
again it's got a really nice wide beam

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.120 
again it's got a really nice wide beam
actually<00:03:45.350> put<00:03:45.530> this<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.769> my<00:03:45.860> room

specially where the photos are over to

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.870 
specially where the photos are over to
the<00:04:17.989> right<00:04:18.140> hand<00:04:18.350> side<00:04:18.470> or<00:04:19.190> over<00:04:19.370> there<00:04:19.520> I<00:04:19.700> mean

the right hand side or over there I mean
that<00:04:20.030> really<00:04:20.480> pops<00:04:20.900> in<00:04:21.140> color<00:04:21.380> there<00:04:21.680> if<00:04:21.980> we

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
that really pops in color there if we

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.040 
that really pops in color there if we
can<00:04:22.580> zoom<00:04:22.640> up<00:04:23.030> on<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:23.300> part<00:04:23.600> of<00:04:23.660> the<00:04:23.750> clock

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
can zoom up on this part of the clock

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.220 
can zoom up on this part of the clock
here<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:25.220> actual<00:04:25.820> little<00:04:26.120> face<00:04:26.420> around<00:04:26.930> it

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
here the actual little face around it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.680 
here the actual little face around it
let's<00:04:28.010> zoom<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.460> for<00:04:28.700> just<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:29.030> second

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
let's zoom in for just a second

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.110 
let's zoom in for just a second
little<00:04:30.560> face<00:04:30.740> around<00:04:31.070> it<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.250> also<00:04:31.430> glowing<00:04:32.000> in

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
little face around it is also glowing in

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.370 
little face around it is also glowing in
nicely<00:04:32.540> again<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.810> camera<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.170> really

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
nicely again the camera is really

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.920 
nicely again the camera is really
deceiving<00:04:33.860> with<00:04:33.920> that<00:04:34.040> sort<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.310> thing<00:04:34.490> but

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
completely black and black lights and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.190 
completely black and black lights and
again<00:04:37.730> you<00:04:37.910> have<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.330> see<00:04:38.510> it<00:04:38.630> to<00:04:38.660> believe<00:04:38.780> it

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
again you have to see it to believe it

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.710 
again you have to see it to believe it
it's<00:04:39.380> not<00:04:39.920> your<00:04:40.160> traditional<00:04:40.580> you<00:04:41.420> know<00:04:41.450> like

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
set LEDs LED backlight usually just gave

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.750 
set LEDs LED backlight usually just gave
you<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.540> purple<00:04:45.290> hue<00:04:45.560> this<00:04:46.070> actually<00:04:46.580> has<00:04:46.730> a

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
you a purple hue this actually has a

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.500 
you a purple hue this actually has a
really<00:04:47.360> really<00:04:47.630> nice<00:04:47.840> glow<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.200> it<00:04:49.360> for<00:04:50.360> this

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
that in life at my knifes event for you

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.840 
that in life at my knifes event for you
so<00:05:14.870> anyways<00:05:15.140> side<00:05:15.620> by<00:05:15.770> side<00:05:16.040> or<00:05:16.400> all<00:05:16.580> days<00:05:16.760> are

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
so anyways side by side or all days are

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:20.470 
so anyways side by side or all days are
coming<00:05:16.940> up<00:05:17.150> the<00:05:18.460> these<00:05:19.460> here<00:05:19.790> have<00:05:20.180> a<00:05:20.210> wider

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:20.480 
coming up the these here have a wider

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.170 
coming up the these here have a wider
washing<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.050> UD<00:05:21.290> sixteen<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:22.460> UV<00:05:22.760> sixteen

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
washing the UD sixteen the UV sixteen

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.940 
washing the UD sixteen the UV sixteen
seem<00:05:23.390> to<00:05:23.510> really<00:05:24.020> further<00:05:24.320> throw<00:05:24.740> up<00:05:24.800> it's

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
seem to really further throw up it's

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.970 
seem to really further throw up it's
very<00:05:25.010> punchy<00:05:25.610> but<00:05:26.300> it's<00:05:26.450> narrow<00:05:26.780> so<00:05:27.560> my<00:05:27.710> idea

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
very punchy but it's narrow so my idea

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:29.200 
very punchy but it's narrow so my idea
is<00:05:28.040> going<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.370> be<00:05:28.460> as<00:05:28.550> if<00:05:28.700> this<00:05:28.820> is<00:05:28.940> going<00:05:29.090> to<00:05:29.150> be

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
is going to be as if this is going to be

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:30.760 
is going to be as if this is going to be
aimed<00:05:29.420> towards<00:05:29.810> the<00:05:29.930> front<00:05:30.200> of<00:05:30.410> the<00:05:30.470> dance

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
aimed towards the front of the dance

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.560 
aimed towards the front of the dance
floor<00:05:30.950> this<00:05:31.610> is<00:05:31.730> going<00:05:31.880> to<00:05:31.940> be<00:05:32.000> where<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:32.480> know

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
floor this is going to be where you know

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.930 
floor this is going to be where you know
it's<00:05:32.660> going<00:05:32.690> to<00:05:32.840> give<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.230> nice<00:05:33.530> even<00:05:34.100> flood<00:05:34.430> the

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
it's going to give a nice even flood the

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.760 
it's going to give a nice even flood the
UV<00:05:35.300> 16s<00:05:35.840> are<00:05:35.900> going<00:05:36.020> to<00:05:36.080> be<00:05:36.170> used<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.410> fill<00:05:36.650> in

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
UV 16s are going to be used to fill in

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.230 
UV 16s are going to be used to fill in
the<00:05:36.860> areas<00:05:37.190> where<00:05:37.220> this<00:05:37.520> is<00:05:37.670> not<00:05:37.850> going<00:05:38.060> to<00:05:38.120> hit

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
the areas where this is not going to hit

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.480 
the areas where this is not going to hit
up<00:05:38.360> this<00:05:38.810> will<00:05:39.020> go<00:05:39.140> straight<00:05:39.440> out<00:05:39.530> because<00:05:40.280> I'm

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
up this will go straight out because I'm

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.620 
up this will go straight out because I'm
not<00:05:40.580> worried<00:05:40.820> about<00:05:40.850> blinding<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.420> crowd

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
not worried about blinding the crowd

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.970 
not worried about blinding the crowd
because<00:05:41.900> really<00:05:42.080> even<00:05:42.650> though<00:05:42.710> these<00:05:42.830> are

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
because really even though these are

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:44.590 
because really even though these are
three<00:05:43.250> watt<00:05:43.400> LEDs<00:05:43.820> versus<00:05:44.090> one<00:05:44.270> watt

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
three watt LEDs versus one watt

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.420 
three watt LEDs versus one watt
because<00:05:44.900> they're<00:05:45.020> so<00:05:45.200> separated<00:05:45.890> they're<00:05:46.250> not

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
because they're so separated they're not

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.280 
because they're so separated they're not
blinding<00:05:46.910> you<00:05:47.000> as<00:05:47.180> much<00:05:47.450> so<00:05:47.840> it's<00:05:47.990> almost<00:05:48.140> like

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
blinding you as much so it's almost like

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.050 
blinding you as much so it's almost like
a<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.650> know<00:05:48.710> it's<00:05:48.770> an<00:05:49.010> LED<00:05:49.190> array<00:05:49.610> system

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
a you know it's an LED array system

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.250 
a you know it's an LED array system
you're<00:05:50.390> not<00:05:50.450> getting<00:05:50.780> hit<00:05:50.960> with<00:05:51.110> all<00:05:51.230> the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
you're not getting hit with all the

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.290 
you're not getting hit with all the
light<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:51.650> one<00:05:51.740> shot<00:05:52.130> so<00:05:52.340> this<00:05:52.730> will<00:05:52.880> be<00:05:53.150> the

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
light in one shot so this will be the

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.730 
light in one shot so this will be the
lights<00:05:53.510> of<00:05:53.660> a<00:05:53.780> me<00:05:53.840> up<00:05:53.990> towards<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.530> crowd

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
lights of a me up towards the crowd

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.100 
lights of a me up towards the crowd
whereas<00:05:55.400> the<00:05:55.520> UV<00:05:55.820> 16s<00:05:56.390> because<00:05:56.600> we<00:05:56.720> are<00:05:56.870> really

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
whereas the UV 16s because we are really

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.870 
whereas the UV 16s because we are really
brining<00:05:57.470> blinding<00:05:58.220> they're<00:05:58.340> going<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.520> end<00:05:58.760> up

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
brining blinding they're going to end up

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.460 
brining blinding they're going to end up
a<00:05:58.940> little<00:05:59.060> bit<00:05:59.240> higher<00:05:59.450> to<00:05:59.900> hit<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.200> further

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
a little bit higher to hit the further

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.860 
a little bit higher to hit the further
areas<00:06:00.860> but<00:06:01.640> let's<00:06:01.940> say<00:06:02.060> for<00:06:02.090> example<00:06:02.330> your

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
areas but let's say for example your

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.810 
areas but let's say for example your
school<00:06:03.230> or<00:06:03.650> you<00:06:03.860> know<00:06:03.890> doing<00:06:04.250> an<00:06:04.370> Alice<00:06:04.730> in

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
school or you know doing an Alice in

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.020 
Wonderland
you<00:06:06.740> could<00:06:06.950> put<00:06:07.130> these<00:06:07.340> right<00:06:07.669> here<00:06:07.820> with<00:06:07.970> a

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
you could put these right here with a

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.610 
you could put these right here with a
little<00:06:08.240> feet<00:06:08.450> standing<00:06:09.020> straight<00:06:09.290> up<00:06:09.320> or<00:06:09.560> you

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
little feet standing straight up or you

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.890 
little feet standing straight up or you
can<00:06:09.770> use<00:06:09.919> a<00:06:09.950> UV<00:06:10.160> sixteen<00:06:10.820> and<00:06:11.090> use<00:06:11.540> these<00:06:11.750> as

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
can use a UV sixteen and use these as

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.630 
can use a UV sixteen and use these as
backlight<00:06:12.560> up<00:06:12.770> lighting<00:06:13.160> to<00:06:13.310> make<00:06:13.490> their

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
backlight up lighting to make their

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.850 
backlight up lighting to make their
decorations<00:06:14.360> stand<00:06:14.690> up<00:06:14.960> now<00:06:15.440> everybody<00:06:15.500> talks

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
decorations stand up now everybody talks

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.350 
decorations stand up now everybody talks
about<00:06:15.980> how<00:06:16.130> great<00:06:16.370> up<00:06:16.490> lighting<00:06:16.850> is<00:06:16.970> and<00:06:17.270> all

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360 
about how great up lighting is and all

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.240 
about how great up lighting is and all
that<00:06:17.570> why<00:06:17.810> are<00:06:17.990> you<00:06:18.140> not<00:06:18.350> doing<00:06:18.530> black<00:06:18.980> light

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250 
that why are you not doing black light

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.800 
that why are you not doing black light
up<00:06:19.460> lights<00:06:19.730> think<00:06:19.970> about<00:06:20.120> it<00:06:20.210> now<00:06:20.540> the<00:06:20.600> best

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:20.810 
up lights think about it now the best

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.150 
up lights think about it now the best
thing<00:06:21.020> is<00:06:21.140> how<00:06:21.229> much<00:06:21.380> these<00:06:21.560> cost

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
thing is how much these cost

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.580 
thing is how much these cost
um<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:23.120> know<00:06:23.240> obviously<00:06:23.600> everybody<00:06:24.500> has

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
um you know obviously everybody has

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.440 
um you know obviously everybody has
different<00:06:24.740> dealers<00:06:25.160> different<00:06:25.580> prices<00:06:25.970> these

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
different dealers different prices these

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.690 
different dealers different prices these
things<00:06:26.750> are<00:06:26.930> stupid<00:06:27.260> cheap<00:06:27.650> at<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.610> price

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
things are stupid cheap at the price

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.130 
things are stupid cheap at the price
because<00:06:29.210> we<00:06:29.330> used<00:06:29.450> to<00:06:29.479> make<00:06:29.600> our<00:06:29.660> own<00:06:29.780> balance

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.140 
because we used to make our own balance

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.210 
because we used to make our own balance
I<00:06:30.200> really<00:06:30.410> didn't<00:06:30.560> find<00:06:30.710> a<00:06:30.740> black<00:06:30.919> light<00:06:31.100> in

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
I really didn't find a black light in

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.770 
I really didn't find a black light in
our<00:06:31.310> lifes<00:06:31.490> we<00:06:31.640> made<00:06:31.790> our<00:06:31.880> own<00:06:31.910> palace<00:06:32.390> we're

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:32.780 
our lifes we made our own palace we're

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.330 
our lifes we made our own palace we're

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
told NEPA we've got ballasts and we got

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.100 
told NEPA we've got ballasts and we got
