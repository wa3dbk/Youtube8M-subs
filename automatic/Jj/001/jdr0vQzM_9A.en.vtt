the five armies was my least favorite I
don't<00:01:34.530> know<00:01:34.650> why<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:36.090> know<00:01:36.479> why<00:01:36.689> it

don't know why it's a don't know why it

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.109 
don't know why it's a don't know why it
was<00:01:37.200> my<00:01:37.290> least<00:01:37.470> favorite<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.670> watching<00:01:38.970> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
was my least favorite I was watching it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
was my least favorite I was watching it
I<00:01:39.210> was<00:01:39.299> trying<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> understand<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.229> why<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
I was trying to understand like why it

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.770 
I was trying to understand like why it
would<00:01:40.920> be<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.369> feels<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.479> reason

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
would be but it feels like the reason

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
would be but it feels like the reason
that<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> first<00:01:43.290> two<00:01:43.500> were<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:43.860> magical<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.369> me

that the first two were so magical to me

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
that the first two were so magical to me
