00:00:01.411 --> 00:00:07.151
Alistair Overeem

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:16.044
Q:It was a total victory for you. What are your thoughts?

00:00:16.044 --> 00:00:21.637
I have no injuries and I fought a good fight.

00:00:21.637 --> 00:00:25.142
I proved how strong I am and I gained more confidence.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:56.440
Q:What did you focus on in preparation for this fight and what did you want to use?

00:00:56.577 --> 00:01:04.056
I studied my opponent a bit, but I just focused on using all of my abilities.

00:01:04.056 --> 00:01:13.779
It was no different this time. My main weapon is power, and so the goal is to see how much power I can unleash on my opponent.

00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:17.096
Trying to use that was my focus.

00:01:49.063 --> 00:02:07.896
Q:Do you think you've improved using the K-1 rules?

00:02:08.118 --> 00:02:19.553
I do feel improvement. But I learn a lot from every fight. I learn from every day of training and try to use it in matches.

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:35.770
I was able to use what I learned and so I continue to get better each time.

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:18.810
Q:You will fight again in May. Sum up your feelings.

00:03:19.195 --> 00:03:31.539
It's gonna be busy for a while, but tomorrow I go back to the Netherlands and start training on Monday.

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:40.804
My next fight is an MMA bout and so I have to practice different techniques.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:46.283
Switching to these other techniques is what I'll be working on.

00:03:46.283 --> 00:03:57.927
I'm getting stronger and so my next fight will be a good one as well.
