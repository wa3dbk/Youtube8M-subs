00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.660
 What kind of skin is it? 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:17.010
 business man hello everyone with 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.930
 your guests today I will review 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.789
 about 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.470
 14w 30 n the most important innovation is 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.240
 have added 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.289
 banners banners crafted like this 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.289
 way banners 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.790
 it's these flags here as you see them 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.730
 there are all colors 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 are they and the scenery section here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.520
 they as we see them move staggering 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.420
 downwind so far we are through them 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.440
 we can pass 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.780
 we can put them under a very large 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.059
 amount of different angles when we take 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.750
 mouse ring any of them is taken 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:59.030
 only black so let's show 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:02.750
 detailed craft correctly need a stick 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 so need wool 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.230
 we post it like this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.720
 we have this banner with him and we can do two 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.720
 things and these questions stand on the ground and 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 hang on the wall in the same way 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:22.780
 we can make different patterns like video 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:26.390
 with varnish Russia Ukraine different from the patterns 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.700
 strips of squares anything now 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.979
 I will show how to do it before seeding want 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.020
 brighten the flag of Russia 1 initially to 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.410
 it was not more convenient to paint 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:39.890
 I spend the green blue flag on top of me 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.960
 white strip then I spend it again 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.860
 we see that we have something not quite 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.300
 it turns out 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.280
 and here if we put too not 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.000
 it turns out naturally we can 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:54.380
 engine so here and choose how we 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.869
 want that is we can lay out like this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.310
 we will be a strip if we want to this 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.530
 give the flag something else we can 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.979
 spend here and so we will be attacked 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.979
 cross mark we want to center the red dot we 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.500
 we put it and we are red. will be over 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.299
 that is, how will we order 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.760
 lay it out with us and will be 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.840
 pattern will be reached. put on the body she would 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.940
 would have on the body 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.680
 let's take some 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:27.730
 red dye damn let's better 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.160
 purple put this well and add here 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.760
 husband give a square so we certainly do not 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.489
 can we 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.730
 nozzles have to choose let's 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.909
 make rom 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.280
 instead of the already round we will attack 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:44.610
 rum world you understand we can do 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.500
 a huge number of different patterns all 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.170
 It is necessary to watch the combination. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.909
 you can fold yourself 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.560
 quite a huge selection 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:56.129
 another feature is what we can 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:00.629
 craft these checkboxes with additional 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:06.360
 textures or patterns such as a vizar 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:10.950
 and head skeleton head squeaks she 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.359
 the skeleton can't be okay and bricks can 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:19.260
 do here such 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:22.220
 blanks so we can 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.370
 connect like this do it 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:29.490
 wall so what if we do like this 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 here 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.370
 we can add our own pattern let's 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.600
 let's make creepers so they added 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.280
 such a pattern 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.110
 we see what is above 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.100
 triangles let's add the same 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.500
 bottom only add red about us 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.420
 it turns out another exclusive 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.950
 flag so we download snapshot ourselves 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.770
 experiment also now in mode 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.319
 survival can knock heads creeper 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:03.080
 skeleton zombies with mobs is another 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.620
 The feature of these banners is that they are 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:09.500
 expire stacked 16 pieces 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.709
 It was said that they added a render 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.209
 this distance is maximum rnr chunks to 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:20.989
 32 but I have almost 16 even 64-bit 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.220
 java on this snapshot exhaust all 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.960
 its inference 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.210
 in principle, there was nothing else 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.210
 added sorry for not having 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.820
 the previous two or three snapshot but just 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.260
 I didnâ€™t want to do this 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.610
 that 's all thanks to everyone for watching 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.070
 channel signature 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.700
 now expect a snapshot each 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:44.889
 week they will go without delay and 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.889
 that's all for now 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.490
 there is
