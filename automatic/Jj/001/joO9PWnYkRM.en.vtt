that have a big value for every person
and<00:00:15.419> on<00:00:16.200> this<00:00:16.379> video<00:00:16.890> we're<00:00:17.250> going<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:17.520> show

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
and on this video we're going to show

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.280 
and on this video we're going to show
you<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:18.450> to<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:19.890> make<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:21.240> wheeling<00:00:22.080> much

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.290 
you how to to make your wheeling much

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.530 
you how to to make your wheeling much
better<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.040> English<00:00:23.280> wheel<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:24.270> you<00:00:24.360> can

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
better in the English wheel so you can

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.110 
better in the English wheel so you can
control<00:00:24.870> the<00:00:25.020> sheet<00:00:25.410> in<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> wheel<00:00:25.950> and<00:00:26.220> know

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
control the sheet in the wheel and know

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.570 
control the sheet in the wheel and know
where<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.420> stop<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> start<00:00:28.290> and<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.280> a<00:00:29.340> long

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
where to stop and start and for a long

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.940 
where to stop and start and for a long
time<00:00:29.850> we<00:00:30.180> had<00:00:30.360> problem<00:00:30.960> with<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.380> student

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
time we had problem with a student

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.579 
time we had problem with a student
because<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.210> was<00:00:33.420> hard<00:00:33.719> for<00:00:33.809> them<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.289> see

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:34.589 
because it was hard for them to see

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:37.610 
because it was hard for them to see
where<00:00:34.949> the<00:00:35.160> center<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.179> wheel<00:00:36.390> is<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.469> it's

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
where the center of the wheel is so it's

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860 
where the center of the wheel is so it's
that<00:00:38.039> is<00:00:38.280> exactly<00:00:39.089> in<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.329> middle<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.749> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that is exactly in the middle of the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.310 
that is exactly in the middle of the
line<00:00:40.109> on<00:00:40.649> both<00:00:40.949> ends<00:00:41.429> so<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.269> because<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.199> you

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
line on both ends so you because if you

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.959 
line on both ends so you because if you
wheel<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.800> up<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.489> cover<00:00:44.730> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
wheel this up you need to cover the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.189 
wheel this up you need to cover the
whole<00:00:45.179> area<00:00:45.210> inside<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.319> frame<00:00:47.629> if<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.899> stop

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
whole area inside this frame if you stop

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.919 
whole area inside this frame if you stop
2<00:00:49.499> inches<00:00:49.890> away<00:00:50.129> from<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> edge<00:00:50.969> because<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
2 inches away from the edge because you

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.290 
2 inches away from the edge because you
don't<00:00:52.109> see<00:00:52.379> where<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.739> center<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.609> means

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
don't see where the center is that means

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
don't see where the center is that means
that<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> frame<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.409> be<00:00:55.530> too<00:00:55.739> big<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that the frame going to be too big and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.619 
that the frame going to be too big and
it's<00:00:56.280> going<00:00:56.429> to<00:00:56.550> be<00:00:56.640> flat<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.359> didn't

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
it's going to be flat because you didn't

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.439 
it's going to be flat because you didn't
we<00:00:57.809> stretched<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.379> there<00:00:58.589> so<00:00:59.579> in<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.210> video

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
we stretched it there so in this video

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.439 
we stretched it there so in this video
I'm<00:01:00.929> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.139> show<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:02.159> we<00:01:02.309> came<00:01:03.269> out

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
I'm going to show you that we came out

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.139 
I'm going to show you that we came out
with<00:01:03.659> a<00:01:03.719> laser<00:01:04.350> point<00:01:04.920> for<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> English<00:01:05.969> wheel

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 
with a laser point for the English wheel

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:08.749 
with a laser point for the English wheel
so<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.920> last<00:01:08.130> English<00:01:08.549> wheel

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
so here you have the last English wheel

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.749 
so here you have the last English wheel
with<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.240> laser<00:01:09.450> point<00:01:10.250> I'm<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.549> turn

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
with the laser point I'm going to turn

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.020 
with the laser point I'm going to turn
this<00:01:11.969> on<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:13.590> can<00:01:13.649> see<00:01:13.860> here<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.490> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
this on and as you can see here now the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.420 
this on and as you can see here now the
line<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> centre<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> wheel<00:01:19.430> down

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
line is in the centre of the wheel down

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.620 
line is in the centre of the wheel down
there<00:01:21.469> so<00:01:22.469> that<00:01:22.500> means<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:24.060> can<00:01:24.299> see

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
there so that means that you can see

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.880 
there so that means that you can see
exactly<00:01:25.110> where<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.920> stop<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.700> start<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.890> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
exactly where to stop and start and that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.980 
exactly where to stop and start and that
really<00:01:29.340> helps<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.880> make<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> nicer

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
really helps you to make a nicer

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.969 
really helps you to make a nicer
smoother<00:01:31.469> panel<00:01:33.049> not<00:01:34.049> only<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.950> can

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
smoother panel not only that you can

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.310 
smoother panel not only that you can
also<00:01:35.340> when<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.820> turn<00:01:36.149> this<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.719> going<00:01:37.170> to

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
also when you turn this and going to

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.260 
also when you turn this and going to
wheel<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.770> zigzag<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> can<00:01:38.789> move<00:01:38.969> it<00:01:39.149> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
wheel it zigzag so you can move it and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.779 
wheel it zigzag so you can move it and
cover<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.719> whole<00:01:39.899> area<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.490> how

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
cover the whole area you can see how

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.300 
cover the whole area you can see how
much<00:01:42.000> angle<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.259> change<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.829> here

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
much angle you actually change it here

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.599 
much angle you actually change it here
so<00:01:45.179> the<00:01:45.750> tracks<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:47.009> close<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.579> each

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
so the tracks really get close to each

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:57.200 
so the tracks really get close to each
other<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.560> have<00:01:55.950> nothing<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.579> blame<00:01:56.909> on

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
other so you have nothing to blame on

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.239 
other so you have nothing to blame on
now<00:01:57.420> when<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.920> something

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
now when you have this it's something

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.779 
now when you have this it's something
that<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.850> there<00:02:00.090> but<00:02:00.359> it's<00:02:00.539> not<00:02:00.630> there<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.469> you

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
that is there but it's not there so you

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.080 
that is there but it's not there so you
it's<00:02:02.789> not<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.270> way<00:02:03.390> for<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.969> this

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
it's not in the way for you so this

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.350
