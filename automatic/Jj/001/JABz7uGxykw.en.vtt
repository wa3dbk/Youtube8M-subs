00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.780
 Welcome to Preseason Spotlight. In this video, we will introduce 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.620
 changes we make to the forest, objective, and items 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.300
 in Preseason 2015. Think of it like an outline of what happened, if you 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660
 want to know more about the details, see more in Preseason Microsite and Patch Notes. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.500
 Before we get to the topic of detail, let's go 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.340
 first discuss the focus of Preseason 2015: diversity of strategies. In words 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 others, give you various ways to win and how to 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.848
 the decision in the battle is as important as the Champion you choose. 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.760
 Okey, forest. The important part here is forest diversity. Indeed, many changes have taken place here 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 like Preseason last year, but we took a different path for 2015. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.540
 We have new items, Smite that can be upgraded, and strengthen 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.000
 the monsters so that between using Warwick or Rammi really feels the difference. 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.400
 And there are also these cute crabs. 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.480
 First, the spirit item was eliminated. Hunter's Machete can now be upgraded 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.975
 into four new items and each strengthens Smite in a unique way. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.976
 Stalker's Blade is for ganking, making it Smit 

00:01:10.989 --> 00:01:13.975
 can be used on enemy champions to deal damage and slow them down. 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.640
 Poacher's Knife is for Counterjunglers, giving you extra bonuses 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.740
 when using Smite in the opposing forest. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.180
 Skirmisher's Saber is for dueling. Smite your opponent 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.560
 and for a few seconds you become stronger when dealing with them. 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.240
 Finally, Ranger's Trailblazer is for farming, changing 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.900
 Smite effects become an area and restore Health and Mana when used. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.980
 You can also buy an Enchantment that will give you the stats you need at the end of the game. 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780
 Make sure you read more because we don't explain it here. 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.180
 We also add bonuses when you use Smite on Monsters. Smite the Raptor 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.920
 to get the True Sight buff when you are seen by your opponent's ward. Murkwolf will be a ghost who gives 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:10.060
 vision, Gromp gives you poisonous thornmail, Krugs makes your attacks periodically produce stuns on Monsters, 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.340
 and for red and blue, they will restore Health or Mana. Try to guess who restored what. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
 Finally, under the forest category, we have your favorite new camp: 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 the Scuttler Rift. This tough shelled creature always avoided fighting, 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.100
 but if you can defeat him, he will give you vision for the front area of ​​the Baron nest or 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.760
 Dragon and will be the Speed ​​Shrine for your team. Thank you, crab. 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.260
 Next, we enter objective. Everything changes to become more strategic. 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.000
 First, the Turret. Turret In having a shield that can recover 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.400
 which will also spread to nearby friends and protect them from enemy attacks. 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 And yes, as you can see, it's a laser. This is 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.140
 changes from the Turret Inhibitor, and this laser slows down 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.400
 and reduce the damage produced by anyone who was shot 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.980
 so that you are protected from the Jax who likes the Split-Pushing. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.920
 The Baron is no longer just a snack at the end of the game. He is now very awesome. Not only 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.580
 You have to know when you need to beat him, 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.620
 The Baron buff will also speed up Recall twice 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
 fold and give additional power to the Minions around you. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.960
 Dragon and Turret always have similar gifts - Gold. So that this gift feels different in terms of strategy, 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:28.180
 Dragon is now no longer giving you Gold, but will be offering permanent buffs that can stack up. This buff is getting stronger 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.840
 the more Dragon your team kills. Kill five dragons for your team 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.820
 and you will attack like a monster truck driving a bigger monster truck. 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.780
 This year, we focus on the strategy item that gives 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.260
 your team is more than individual stats. 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.320
 First, there are various new Elixirs. Ruin gives you bonus damage to the tower and increases the potential of Split 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:58.580
 Pushing, Sorcery gives you Ability Power and True Damage when attacking, Iron makes your body size increase and accelerate 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.440
 friend who followed you, then Wrath gave you Attack Damage and a little Life Steal. 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.600
 We design all of this to support the tactics that you use whenever you need it. 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.280
 Second, introduce Righteous Glory. Besides Stats, the active component of Righteous Glory gives you 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.960
 bonus Movement Speed ​​when moving towards the opposing team that is good at running away. 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.240
 After a few seconds, you will emit energy waves that slow down 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.560
 all opponent champions touch it. 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.600
 Unfortunately, bonus Movement Speed ​​is not affected 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.740
 by how annoying the opposing team is. 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.560
 In short, the dream we pursue this time is to give you various ways to win 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.560
 and various ways your team can take to win. 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.320
 And this is just the beginning. 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.080
 Preseason is a time to experiment with the League and bring it to a better state, 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.780
 and there are many more things that we didn't mention in this video. 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.600
 Make sure you study the microsite and patch notes for full details. 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.260
 And all this for Preseason Spotlight this time.
