00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.539 
diablo is unique among fantasy universes
in<00:00:03.389> that<00:00:03.600> it's<00:00:03.810> not<00:00:04.049> based<00:00:04.620> around<00:00:04.830> dwarves

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
in that it's not based around dwarves

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.240 
in that it's not based around dwarves
and<00:00:05.700> elves<00:00:05.930> but<00:00:06.930> it's<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.500> much<00:00:07.620> darker<00:00:07.890> world

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
and elves but it's a much darker world

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.020 
and elves but it's a much darker world
based<00:00:08.610> around<00:00:09.080> angels<00:00:10.080> and<00:00:10.320> demons<00:00:10.790> in<00:00:11.790> fact

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
based around angels and demons in fact

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.870 
based around angels and demons in fact
it<00:00:12.210> was<00:00:12.300> created<00:00:12.750> by<00:00:13.290> angels<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.860> demons<00:00:14.219> and

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it was created by angels and demons and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.930 
it was created by angels and demons and
now<00:00:15.509> it's<00:00:15.719> being<00:00:15.929> fought<00:00:16.199> over<00:00:16.230> by<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.940> forces

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
now it's being fought over by the forces

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.880 
now it's being fought over by the forces
of<00:00:18.060> hell<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.539> angels<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.140> lightness<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:21.890> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of hell and angels and lightness and we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.109 
of hell and angels and lightness and we
just<00:00:23.070> think<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.430> you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.640> that's<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.910> really

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
just think that you know that's a really

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.689 
just think that you know that's a really
fascinating<00:00:24.390> setting<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.529> we've<00:00:26.519> only

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
fascinating setting and we've only

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.099 
fascinating setting and we've only
scratched<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.240> surface<00:00:27.300> in<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.779> previous

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
scratched the surface in the previous

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.980 
scratched the surface in the previous
games<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> we<00:00:28.740> think<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.599> there's<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:30.869> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
games and we think that there's really a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.840 
games and we think that there's really a
lot<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.380> depth<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.309> be<00:00:32.399> mined<00:00:32.669> there

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
lot of depth that can be mined there

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.910 
lot of depth that can be mined there
that<00:00:33.059> hasn't<00:00:33.239> been<00:00:33.540> looked<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.230> previously

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that hasn't been looked into previously

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.540 
that hasn't been looked into previously
and<00:00:35.960> to<00:00:36.960> do<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.530> looked<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.950> we<00:00:38.340> have<00:00:38.430> to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and to do that we looked at we have to

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.709 
and to do that we looked at we have to
start<00:00:38.760> with<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.000> world<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.360> have<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.540> start

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
start with the world we have to start

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.619 
start with the world we have to start
somewhere<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:41.120> civilizations<00:00:42.120> don't<00:00:42.390> just

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
somewhere and civilizations don't just

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.520 
somewhere and civilizations don't just
crop<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.140> out<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> nowhere<00:00:44.719> they<00:00:45.719> are<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> result

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
crop up out of nowhere they are a result

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.040 
crop up out of nowhere they are a result
of<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.760> environment<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.629> political

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
of you know environment or political

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
of you know environment or political
forces<00:00:49.410> so<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.250> have<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.550> start<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:50.940> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
forces so we have to start with the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.750 
forces so we have to start with the
civilizations<00:00:51.719> where<00:00:51.930> do<00:00:52.020> they<00:00:52.110> come<00:00:52.320> from

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
civilizations where do they come from

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
civilizations where do they come from
what<00:00:53.760> are<00:00:53.879> their<00:00:54.000> people<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:55.230> know

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
what are their people like and you know

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.799 
what are their people like and you know
what<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.770> ruling<00:00:56.219> classes<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
what are the ruling classes and that

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.209 
what are the ruling classes and that
kind<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> thing<00:00:59.120> so<00:01:00.120> as<00:01:00.239> an<00:01:00.329> example<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.780> that

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
kind of thing so as an example of that

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.920 
kind of thing so as an example of that
we're<00:01:02.219> going<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.399> look<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:02.640> chaldean<00:01:03.239> now<00:01:03.690> Cal

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
we're going to look at chaldean now Cal

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.770 
we're going to look at chaldean now Cal

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
the government basically is there to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:30.890 
the government basically is there to

flowing so when you have a place like
that<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.900> then<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:35.159> main<00:01:35.369> city<00:01:35.820> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> area

that and then the main city of the area
which<00:01:36.840> is<00:01:36.990> correct<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.520> saw<00:01:38.759> destroyed

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
which is correct which you saw destroyed

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.870 
which is correct which you saw destroyed
in<00:01:39.329> diablo<00:01:39.720> 2<00:01:39.869> falls<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.460> government

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
in diablo 2 falls and the government

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.550 
in diablo 2 falls and the government
from<00:01:42.000> their<00:01:42.240> moves<00:01:42.540> over<00:01:42.810> chaldean<00:01:43.290> which<00:01:43.439> is

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
from their moves over chaldean which is

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.149 
from their moves over chaldean which is
what<00:01:43.740> happened<00:01:44.390> it<00:01:45.390> changes<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> place<00:01:46.649> so

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
what happened it changes a place so

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
what happened it changes a place so
that's<00:01:47.399> something<00:01:47.610> we've<00:01:47.880> explored<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.479> depth

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that's something we've explored in depth

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.569 
that's something we've explored in depth
how<00:01:49.140> does<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.320> change<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.860> culture<00:01:50.100> how<00:01:50.430> does

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
how does that change a culture how does

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.280 
how does that change a culture how does
that<00:01:50.700> change<00:01:50.759> how<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> day-to-day<00:01:51.570> life<00:01:51.780> goes

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
that change how the day-to-day life goes
