00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
part this will be the first row of

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.290 
part this will be the first row of
invisible<00:00:29.800> parts<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.220> will<00:00:30.399> break<00:00:30.640> down<00:00:30.699> this

time<00:00:42.430> I<00:00:42.460> see<00:00:42.760> someone<00:00:43.030> doing<00:00:43.180> invisible<00:00:43.629> part

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
time I see someone doing invisible part

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.509 
time I see someone doing invisible part
they<00:00:44.110> always<00:00:44.440> connect<00:00:44.860> all<00:00:45.040> of<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.339> little

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519 
they always connect all of the little

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.819 
they always connect all of the little
braids<00:00:45.850> right<00:00:46.149> here<00:00:47.110> and<00:00:47.260> it<00:00:47.350> makes<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.620> big

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
braids right here and it makes a big

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.100 
braids right here and it makes a big
huge<00:00:48.159> break<00:00:48.460> I<00:00:48.640> don't<00:00:48.670> like<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.180> so<00:00:49.780> I'm

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
huge break I don't like that so I'm

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.140 
huge break I don't like that so I'm
gonna<00:00:50.320> follow<00:00:50.619> my<00:00:50.769> typical<00:00:51.280> braiding<00:00:51.760> pattern

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
gonna follow my typical braiding pattern

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.049 
gonna follow my typical braiding pattern
which<00:00:52.869> goes<00:00:53.110> down<00:00:53.350> at<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:53.619> slant<00:00:53.949> these<00:00:54.820> will

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
which goes down at a slant these will

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.929 
which goes down at a slant these will
then<00:00:55.089> connect<00:00:55.570> into<00:00:56.530> those<00:00:56.739> braids<00:00:57.159> and<00:00:57.519> then

00:00:57.929 --> 00:00:57.939 
then connect into those braids and then

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.210 
then connect into those braids and then
as<00:00:58.180> always<00:00:58.479> I<00:00:59.049> will<00:00:59.350> connect<00:00:59.890> them<00:01:00.010> in<00:01:00.129> the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
as always I will connect them in the

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.380 
as always I will connect them in the
back<00:01:00.400> of<00:01:00.430> her<00:01:00.699> head<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:02.610> braid<00:01:03.610> up<00:01:03.790> so<00:01:04.000> I'll
