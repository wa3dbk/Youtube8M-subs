on big bikes like this soon here we take

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.590 
on big bikes like this soon here we take
a<00:00:39.300> man<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.719> we'd<00:00:39.840> cut<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.680> tunnels<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.250> put<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
a man and we'd cut the tunnels out put a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
metal cut it out to this pattern put it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.580 
metal cut it out to this pattern put it
in<00:01:30.700> there

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
in there

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.570

and now I'm bond doing over it so when

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.730 
and now I'm bond doing over it so when
this<00:01:36.729> goes<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.180> bike<00:01:37.509> there's<00:01:38.350> only<00:01:38.560> going

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
this goes on the bike there's only going

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.060 
this goes on the bike there's only going
to<00:01:38.800> be<00:01:39.000> about<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.060> half<00:01:40.360> an<00:01:40.540> inch<00:01:40.660> of<00:01:40.780> gap

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
to be about a half an inch of gap

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.540 
to be about a half an inch of gap
between<00:01:42.070> here<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.720> top<00:01:43.930> bar<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.340> can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
between here and the top bar so I can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.690 
between here and the top bar so I can
still<00:01:45.759> do<00:01:45.970> my<00:01:46.000> wire<00:01:46.600> tuck<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.280> wires<00:01:48.460> will

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
still do my wire tuck and the wires will

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.520 
still do my wire tuck and the wires will
be<00:01:48.729> all<00:01:49.030> have<00:01:49.300> them<00:01:49.450> encased<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.050> loom<00:01:50.259> so

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
be all have them encased in a loom so

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.779 
be all have them encased in a loom so
the<00:01:50.680> metal<00:01:50.950> won't<00:01:51.100> cut<00:01:51.340> through<00:01:51.369> them<00:01:51.700> or

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
the metal won't cut through them or

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.050 
the metal won't cut through them or
anything<00:01:51.910> like<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.890> should<00:01:53.890> be<00:01:54.039> enough<00:01:54.700> room

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
anything like that should be enough room

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.090 
anything like that should be enough room
for<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.390> all<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.600> happen<00:01:55.840> but<00:01:56.560> it'll<00:01:56.800> give<00:01:56.920> me<00:01:57.070> a

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
for it all to happen but it'll give me a

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.029 
for it all to happen but it'll give me a
nice<00:01:57.310> cleaner<00:01:57.910> look<00:01:58.619> because<00:01:59.619> you<00:01:59.770> won't<00:01:59.890> have

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 
nice cleaner look because you won't have

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:03.060 
nice cleaner look because you won't have
that<00:02:00.100> big<00:02:00.580> opening<00:02:01.300> up<00:02:01.420> here<00:02:01.750> see<00:02:02.530> it'll<00:02:02.979> be

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
that big opening up here see it'll be

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.730 
that big opening up here see it'll be
down<00:02:03.310> there<00:02:03.810> anyways<00:02:04.810> that's<00:02:05.380> what's<00:02:05.619> been

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
down there anyways that's what's been
