traversal<00:02:34.670> stuff<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.000> really<00:02:35.209> kind<00:02:35.540> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
traversal stuff is really kind of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.880 
traversal stuff is really kind of
awkward<00:02:36.230> how<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.490> because<00:02:38.470> you're<00:02:39.470> maybe

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
awkward how so because you're maybe

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.199 
awkward how so because you're maybe
you're<00:02:40.310> grinding<00:02:40.550> on<00:02:40.850> something<00:02:41.060> but<00:02:41.150> you're

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you're grinding on something but you're

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.820 
you're grinding on something but you're
always<00:02:41.360> like<00:02:41.570> falling<00:02:42.020> Dalton<00:02:42.410> all<00:02:42.530> for

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
always like falling Dalton all for

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.380 
always like falling Dalton all for
falling<00:02:43.190> down<00:02:43.370> or<00:02:43.640> maybe<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:43.940> get<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> end

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
falling down or maybe you get to the end

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.790 
falling down or maybe you get to the end
of<00:02:44.570> like<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> grind<00:02:45.080> and<00:02:45.320> then<00:02:45.410> you're<00:02:45.530> on<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
of like a grind and then you're on the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.530 
of like a grind and then you're on the
ground<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.310> then<00:02:46.730> you're<00:02:46.850> scrambling<00:02:47.180> to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
ground and then you're scrambling to

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.000 
ground and then you're scrambling to
find<00:02:47.690> something<00:02:48.020> that<00:02:48.140> will<00:02:48.320> bounce<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.830> back

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
find something that will bounce you back

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.650 
find something that will bounce you back
up<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.489> getting<00:02:49.700> that<00:02:49.790> sense<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.209> seamless

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
up so getting that sense of seamless

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.449 
up so getting that sense of seamless
transition<00:02:51.230> from<00:02:51.380> one<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.100> yeah<00:02:52.220> it's

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
transition from one to it yeah it's

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.910 
transition from one to it yeah it's
really<00:02:52.790> hard<00:02:53.140> so<00:02:54.140> I<00:02:54.170> would<00:02:54.470> constantly<00:02:54.860> be

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
really hard so I would constantly be

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.320 
really hard so I would constantly be
hitting<00:02:55.190> the<00:02:55.310> ground<00:02:55.459> I'd<00:02:55.640> have<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.910> find<00:02:56.120> some

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
hitting the ground I'd have to find some

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.699 
hitting the ground I'd have to find some
 to<00:02:56.510> bounce<00:02:56.780> on<00:02:56.959> but<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.200> can<00:02:57.320> bounce<00:02:57.500> on

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
 to bounce on but you can bounce on

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.460 
 to bounce on but you can bounce on
like<00:02:57.860> everything<00:02:58.160> but<00:02:58.580> you<00:02:59.120> gotta<00:02:59.270> then<00:02:59.959> once

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
like everything but you gotta then once

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.360 
like everything but you gotta then once
you're<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.739> air<00:03:00.770> you<00:03:00.980> got<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.190> kind<00:03:01.310> of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
you're in the air you got to kind of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.070 
you're in the air you got to kind of
move<00:03:01.550> towards<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.090> thing<00:03:02.270> and<00:03:02.480> hit<00:03:02.570> X<00:03:02.810> to

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
move towards the thing and hit X to

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080 
move towards the thing and hit X to
start<00:03:03.290> grinding<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:04.280> it<00:03:04.790> was<00:03:04.910> all<00:03:05.060> just

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
start grinding and and it was all just

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.600 
start grinding and and it was all just
really<00:03:05.900> awkward<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.650> you're<00:03:07.220> supposed<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
really awkward and you're supposed to

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.130 
really awkward and you're supposed to
manage<00:03:07.910> all<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.090> water<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:08.660> got<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.959> you

of an awkward infamous I feel like but I
don't<00:04:28.550> think<00:04:28.669> infamous<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.150> awkward<00:04:29.479> so<00:04:29.690> if

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
don't think infamous is awkward so if

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.540 
don't think infamous is awkward so if
it's<00:04:29.960> if<00:04:30.169> it's<00:04:30.259> like<00:04:30.440> his<00:04:30.740> infamous<00:04:31.340> but

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.170 
awkward that's kind of a red flag for me
yeah<00:04:34.340> but<00:04:34.580> maybe<00:04:34.729> because<00:04:35.060> it<00:04:35.150> was

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180
