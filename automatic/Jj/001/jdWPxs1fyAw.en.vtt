00:00:00.759 --> 00:00:02.300
 Hello the Commerzbank 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.380
 There is an exceptional case in this and in the coming week 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.740
 her exclusively videos of me 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.999
 and that was made to 1 1 I can see is 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.150
 and I want to introduce you to some of you and to make a difference 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.599
 what to say that was especially inquired several times 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.509
 and lo and behold, it's just a little difficult with four people 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.499
 not all aces are owned by Bastians 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.229
 very simple one too expensive just for a feast of this to buy me 

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:30.839
 I understand that 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.559
 and it is ideal for each one of you holding your own 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:35.730
 Looking for crime 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.070
 Today I start with the Haas Dance Foundation which was inquired for 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.520
 my Mosis too wild and that's what she looks like 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.350
 at the bond market NAS in Germany gets for her in this video on Maninger 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 and the typical design was maintained using satined Schellhaas 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.870
 these services are in the lid 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.900
 Unfortunately, this one does not contain a buddy that means you have to 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.110
 from casting in this case 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.530
 it works 30 milliliters 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.950
 and costs a whopping 42 euros 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.860
 that of which does not contain SPF so no sun protection factor so you have to 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.140
 on a small but one until the finished Dr 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.530
 Confidence is aimed at those with dry skin bit places 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.130
 not or only poorly 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880
 it is less suitable for cheap skin 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.640
 because she has her own percent balance and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.860
 It also has a certain moisture factor, it is funny 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.170
 Now the ride 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.390
 APA Scala 15 bosses are available at a rest 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.920
 and those are really nice mixed together percent beautiful 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.490
 Balanced between yellow and red 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.890
 so that it works naturally and not 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.250
 As with most companies like myself, the colors look very artificial 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.520
 as if they had been calculated by a computer and not at those 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.890
 Tested objects 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.220
 The texture of this injured is extremely fluid to do the same thing 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.020
 fastest the video above 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.209
 "This is a real Serb watery consistency and the opacity Str as 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.190
 about middle grade 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.610
 I have experimentally demonstrated it in two layers today 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.590
 come to us 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.389
 whether one can increase the opacity with several layers annually 

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:22.259
 and I have to say that unfortunately is not use, but sees the power 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:26.599
 little annoying the result is however extremely sticky around the 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.329
 Crime accumulates here in the wrinkles 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.259
 and therefore I only recommend it in one shift 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.580
 apply 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.020
 because if you really have some nice results with it is the seat extremely 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.319
 liquid 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.519
 back and forth around the age of 20 it is not the first time that lives in Vienna 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:49.889
 this is an important project 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.099
 despite carrier association before 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.620
 It is very easy to get movies are so fluid 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.359
 the injured was in Hamburg 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:29.059
 I think that is a bit percent 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.119
 already has something plastic 

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.200
 So keep a man you cover surrounded 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.559
 the texture allowed another was a wonderful atmosphere with his fist 

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:41.549
 it is very very evenly merges beautifully 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.489
 do not notice Benjamin, but it's almost too perfect 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.910
 really like having the plastic layer on top of it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.729
 face 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:55.010
 the right one also depends a lot on which child you like it as well 

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:59.349
 I am very happy with the order with the powdered things 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.259
 in this video you can see him in her 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.490
 as I said in several layers percent 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.309
 unfortunately it is not out 

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:09.829
 The result is therefore not really what to call natural because we 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.579
 Really, the closer look it will have something artificial in it 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.400
 Nonetheless it is very well used no penalties do not compare 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.579
 Beauty of the skin makes it very important to me 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.090
 and I appreciate that I give you texture alone four out of five points 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.000
 same festivity consistency a bit difficult to find 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.139
 Anette Strauss too much and that is very wasteful 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.439
 In addition to learning duel, I also simply prefer to learn which one where 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:40.270
 The opacity swimming barriers may have the durability in their case for me 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.509
 All this is one of the few Foundation actually noticed 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.050
 that during the day, even on hot days 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.650
 the result in the afternoon is still pretty good 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.840
 Sassenberg's the opacity a bit but all 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.320
 they do not gather nowhere to find eggs anymore such things 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.309
 Accumulation of product maybe not with the coach 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:02.809
 what the skin it really is still very nice that I find it very very good 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.610
 it fades Oregon a bit, so I give it here only four out of five 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.479
 In general, a few things I think about you is that 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.849
 she beautifies the skin a little little bit 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.639
 the fine that I have when insert a little give as they do 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:18.319
 gladly 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:23.279
 Nevertheless, I find it with 42 euros so very very expensive and for that 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.770
 she also does a very intimate with too little effective with the other 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.289
 should see a little to Tifferts, I think 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.590
 To indicate any perfume we would have the Marc for some 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.389
 Being in favor of me in this case is really a very long career 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.249
 per cent noticeable 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:42.389
 nobody never liked that 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.500
 I have to help it with diverse things 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.970
 maybe a bit more time at 42 euros because I want to wish me 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.910
 that maybe brings a little bit more similarity with them 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.779
 already her Mr 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:59.669
 However, when you hit the net they really only bring them to the net 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.110
 Moist consistency may have brought a shed 

00:06:03.109 --> 00:06:04.099
 Articles 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:06.300
 a not natural looking 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.120
 and then in vain only when he has an overall score of 2 out of 5 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:15.319
 she just does not do enough for the circle, personally I think 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.109
 is really something for problematic cross people 

00:06:19.109 --> 00:06:24.039
 really long to find the right of streams for themselves often find the 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:27.210
 Skin may be too dry for other products 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.370
 and who do not handle this casting consistency so well so so 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.580
 from me to this foundation 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.229
 Per cent I would not be able to purchase them after all, Messi was too 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.529
 recommend to anyone my age 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.419
 otherwise they might have had a bit of mature skin 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.089
 take a look if it will be a product for you 

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:51.189
 if they have a consistent main rival without this 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.029
 Gunnar Heinsohn made an impact 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:58.749
 until Monday morning comes the next presumptuous of me I hope that through 

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:00.360
 helped a little further 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.409
 something good
