00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.590 
and what I find is that there'll be a
lot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> reels<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> will<00:01:44.490> sort<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.850> show<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
lot of reels that will sort of show the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.030 
lot of reels that will sort of show the
same<00:01:45.840> thing<00:01:46.250> for<00:01:47.250> one<00:01:47.939> minute<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.570> two<00:01:48.750> minutes

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and you know you it may be the most

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.550 
and you know you it may be the most
amazing<00:01:52.610> bouncing<00:01:53.610> ball<00:01:53.850> or<00:01:54.149> acting<00:01:55.020> beat<00:01:55.320> or

there<00:01:58.290> it's<00:01:58.500> sort<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.070> rats<00:01:59.369> there's<00:01:59.700> a

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
there it's sort of like I rats there's a

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.670 
there it's sort of like I rats there's a
creature<00:02:00.270> show<00:02:00.600> coming<00:02:00.990> up<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.290> they'd<00:02:01.530> be

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
creature show coming up that they'd be

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
creature show coming up that they'd be
perfect<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> don't<00:02:02.520> know<00:02:02.790> if<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.030> can

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
perfect for but I don't know if they can

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.940 
perfect for but I don't know if they can
do<00:02:03.360> creatures<00:02:03.810> so<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.430> be<00:02:05.579> my<00:02:06.950> one

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
do creatures so that would be my one

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
do creatures so that would be my one
thing<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> would<00:02:08.429> suggest<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.149> you

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
thing that I would suggest is to you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.589 
thing that I would suggest is to you
know<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.810> break<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:12.150> variety

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
know like break it up with the variety

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.200 
know like break it up with the variety
of<00:02:12.629> works

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
of works

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.840 
of works
I<00:02:13.270> guess<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> really<00:02:13.720> does<00:02:14.170> sorry<00:02:14.680> guy<00:02:15.100> no<00:02:15.340> no<00:02:15.430> I

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
I guess it really does sorry guy no no I

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.190 
I guess it really does sorry guy no no I
would<00:02:16.210> say<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:17.350> does<00:02:17.560> really<00:02:17.770> boil<00:02:18.010> down<00:02:18.070> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
would say it does really boil down to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.920 
would say it does really boil down to
convincing<00:02:20.200> a<00:02:20.470> studio<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.010> you<00:02:21.370> can<00:02:21.930> do

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
convincing a studio that you can do

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.380 
convincing a studio that you can do
whatever<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.530> is<00:02:23.680> that<00:02:23.920> they<00:02:24.130> want<00:02:24.490> people<00:02:24.760> to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
whatever it is that they want people to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.750 
whatever it is that they want people to
do<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.960> for<00:02:26.170> me<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> thing<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.550> kind

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
and over again you know how fish the

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.270 
and over again you know how fish the
mechanics<00:04:10.450> of<00:04:10.600> fish<00:04:11.080> movement<00:04:11.560> you<00:04:11.950> know<00:04:12.100> or

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
mechanics of fish movement you know or

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.540 
mechanics of fish movement you know or
even<00:04:12.520> the<00:04:12.910> bird<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.330> a<00:04:13.420> bug's<00:04:13.630> life<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:14.920> even

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
even the bird in a bug's life the even

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.070 
even the bird in a bug's life the even
though<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.730> was<00:04:15.850> this<00:04:15.970> big<00:04:16.210> gigantic<00:04:16.630> monster

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
though it was this big gigantic monster

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.860 
though it was this big gigantic monster
compared<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:18.190> the<00:04:18.340> size<00:04:18.580> of<00:04:18.760> the<00:04:18.850> bugs<00:04:19.060> the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
compared to the size of the bugs the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.960 
compared to the size of the bugs the
bird<00:04:20.080> itself<00:04:20.440> you<00:04:20.859> could<00:04:21.010> tell<00:04:21.250> that<00:04:21.820> the

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
bird itself you could tell that the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.850 
bird itself you could tell that the
animators<00:04:22.450> had<00:04:22.660> studied<00:04:23.080> the<00:04:23.230> movements<00:04:23.680> of

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
animators had studied the movements of

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.280 
animators had studied the movements of
sparrows<00:04:24.580> and<00:04:24.730> so<00:04:25.360> it's<00:04:25.510> it's<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.780> cartoony

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
sparrows and so it's it's a cartoony

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.060 
sparrows and so it's it's a cartoony
film<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:26.860> with

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
film but with

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.550 
film but with
in<00:04:27.100> that<00:04:27.420> you're<00:04:28.420> framing<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.140> action

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
in that you're framing that action

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.750 
in that you're framing that action
within<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.190> know<00:04:30.280> like<00:04:30.430> an<00:04:30.550> anchor<00:04:31.020> of

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
within you know like an anchor of

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.100 
within you know like an anchor of
realism<00:04:33.760> that<00:04:33.940> you've<00:04:34.210> gone<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.990> you'd

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
realism that you've gone and you'd

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.510 
realism that you've gone and you'd
studied<00:04:35.620> nature<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.130> you've<00:04:36.250> incorporated

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
studied nature and you've incorporated

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.160 
studied nature and you've incorporated
that<00:04:36.970> into<00:04:37.180> your<00:04:37.330> work<00:04:37.540> so<00:04:37.750> that's<00:04:37.810> only<00:04:37.990> going

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
that into your work so that's only going

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:47.399 
that into your work so that's only going
to<00:04:38.230> make<00:04:38.320> your<00:04:38.530> reel<00:04:38.680> stronger<00:04:39.130> overall
