00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
something about how truly simple the

I<00:02:45.230> think<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.980> most<00:02:46.250> beautiful

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
I think one of the most beautiful

I think one of the most beautiful
products<00:02:47.450> we've<00:02:47.629> ever<00:02:47.810> designed<00:02:49.750> one<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.780> the

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
products we've ever designed one of the

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.650 
products we've ever designed one of the
key<00:02:51.230> design<00:02:51.769> decisions<00:02:52.519> that<00:02:52.970> we<00:02:53.120> made<00:02:53.330> early

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
key design decisions that we made early

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.050 
key design decisions that we made early
on<00:02:53.690> with<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.170> new<00:02:54.319> macbook<00:02:54.739> air<00:02:54.980> was<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.819> use

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
on with the new macbook air was to use

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.780 
on with the new macbook air was to use
flash<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.870> storage<00:02:57.290> we<00:02:57.980> do<00:02:58.160> flash<00:02:58.430> storage

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
flash for storage we do flash storage

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.370 
flash for storage we do flash storage
differently<00:02:59.510> than<00:02:59.720> other<00:02:59.870> computer

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
differently than other computer

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.190 
differently than other computer
manufacturers<00:03:01.450> rather<00:03:02.450> than<00:03:02.660> package<00:03:03.049> it

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
manufacturers rather than package it

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.289 
manufacturers rather than package it
inside<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.590> housing<00:03:04.160> we<00:03:04.549> place<00:03:04.849> the<00:03:05.060> chips

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
inside a housing we place the chips

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.690 
inside a housing we place the chips
directly<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.110> logic<00:03:06.500> board<00:03:06.709> so<00:03:07.250> we<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:07.579> be

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
directly on the logic board so we can be

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.610 
directly on the logic board so we can be
much<00:03:07.910> more<00:03:07.970> efficient<00:03:08.690> about<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.170> way<00:03:09.290> we<00:03:09.470> do

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
much more efficient about the way we do

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.309 
much more efficient about the way we do
space<00:03:09.950> this<00:03:10.730> gives<00:03:10.970> us<00:03:11.120> a<00:03:11.269> lot<00:03:11.510> more<00:03:11.569> room<00:03:12.019> for

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
space this gives us a lot more room for

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.610 
space this gives us a lot more room for
batteries<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:14.030> what<00:03:14.239> you<00:03:14.390> get<00:03:14.629> is<00:03:14.959> up<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.410> five
