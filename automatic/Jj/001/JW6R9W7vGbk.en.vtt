00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.150
 not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.610
 set the rear derailleur 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.180
 he is already two years old and all videos are already you 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:47.110
 you see 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:52.620
 erased need to put new fasten 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 roosters key five 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.799
 screwed the rear switch to 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.200
 check whether it is exactly worth 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:15.020
 bring him in extremely 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.780
 closest to the forest position to see and 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:24.250
 does he cling to sleep as far as he is 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.250
 such a distance he is from the spokes 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.549
 also in what position is 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.549
 relative to the smallest asterisk 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.500
 at least you can define creon 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.770
 met no here it is clear that more or less 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.670
 maybe just a little bit of course 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.350
 the wheel is closer but let's see we set a goal 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:56.280
 everything will be bad to switch there may 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.610
 Be a front installation 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 gear selector and for starters us 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.330
 need to determine the height at which will be 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.369
 mounted front derailleur me 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.590
 switched the upper thrust and on this frame 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.100
 it does not fit on that as here 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.340
 mounting hole 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.010
 bottles and I just got that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.489
 mount 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.930
 falls right on this hole 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.510
 so I had to sharpen you a little 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.910
 and install in this way not 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.910
 I wanted to buy a new switch 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.870
 rather come here on this frame 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.420
 switch from the lower thrust either 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:48.110
 switch with a whip that is attached 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.060
 right on the carriage to determine the height 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.130
 switch position must be set 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:03:00.019
 him so that when standing 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 switch over the biggest star 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:07.470
 the distance between the bottom of the switches and 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.450
 the star itself was about two 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 millimeters so first not until the end 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:20.340
 twist to fasten screwed 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.890
 raised by hand or which switch 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.650
 clings to the star means to us and stick 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.140
 under raise higher if the opposite and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.250
 the distance turned out accordingly 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.740
 we lower it a little bit lower 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.580
 also here is this extreme part 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.860
 switch 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.860
 should be parallel to the stars
