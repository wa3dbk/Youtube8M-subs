we're<00:02:19.879> struggling<00:02:20.879> to<00:02:21.030> turn<00:02:21.270> a<00:02:21.330> little<00:02:21.510> bit<00:02:21.720> so

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
we're struggling to turn a little bit so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580 
we're struggling to turn a little bit so
very<00:02:23.340> soft<00:02:23.819> in<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> front<00:02:24.360> doesn't<00:02:25.200> feel<00:02:25.470> like

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
very soft in the front doesn't feel like

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
very soft in the front doesn't feel like
it<00:02:25.739> points<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.220> well<00:02:26.400> but<00:02:26.670> let's<00:02:27.270> see<00:02:27.390> what

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
it points that well but let's see what

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.000 
it points that well but let's see what
the<00:02:27.599> rest<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.870> life<00:02:28.050> holds<00:02:28.410> first<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:28.770> little

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the rest of life holds first a little

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.490 
the rest of life holds first a little
bit<00:02:29.160> of<00:02:29.220> oversteer<00:02:29.520> there<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.120> again<00:02:30.930> brakes

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
bit of oversteer there so again brakes

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.449 
bit of oversteer there so again brakes
will<00:02:31.920> very<00:02:32.580> understeery<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.080> tell<00:02:35.069> you<00:02:35.099> it's

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
will very understeery so I tell you it's

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.400 
will very understeery so I tell you it's
a<00:02:35.550> bit<00:02:35.700> of<00:02:35.790> fun<00:02:35.819> but<00:02:36.269> in<00:02:36.780> terms<00:02:37.050> of<00:02:37.260> its

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
a bit of fun but in terms of its

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.979 
a bit of fun but in terms of its
outright<00:02:37.769> performance<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.610> reckon<00:02:38.970> we're<00:02:39.959> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
outright performance I reckon we're a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.509 
outright performance I reckon we're a
little<00:02:40.530> bit<00:02:40.620> soft<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.129> front<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.430> little

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
little bit soft in the front a little

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.930 
little bit soft in the front a little
bit<00:02:41.670> lazy<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.180> turn<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.860> I<00:02:43.860> don't<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:44.730> feel

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
bit lazy to turn and I don't really feel

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.550 
bit lazy to turn and I don't really feel
like<00:02:45.239> this<00:02:45.540> thing's<00:02:45.840> probably<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.260> car<00:02:46.440> to

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
like this thing's probably the car to

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.949 
like this thing's probably the car to
have<00:02:46.680> around<00:02:46.920> here<00:02:47.099> that's<00:02:47.370> for<00:02:47.519> sure

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
have around here that's for sure

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.210 
have around here that's for sure
anyway<00:02:48.959> let's<00:02:49.410> go<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:49.620> see<00:02:49.830> what<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.069> can

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
anyway let's go and see what we can

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.530 
anyway let's go and see what we can
compare<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:52.670> we<00:02:53.670> key<00:02:53.819> here<00:02:54.000> again<00:02:54.030> this

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
compare it to we key here again this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.449 
compare it to we key here again this
column<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.170> SS<00:02:55.440> V<00:02:55.650> Commodore<00:02:56.160> so<00:02:56.310> let's

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
column in the SS V Commodore so let's

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.130 
column in the SS V Commodore so let's
compare<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.879> to<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.150> accelerate<00:02:57.690> felt<00:02:57.959> thing

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
compare it to the accelerate felt thing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.320 
compare it to the accelerate felt thing
so<00:02:58.260> first<00:02:58.530> impressions<00:02:59.099> I<00:02:59.340> can<00:02:59.940> get<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.150> wheel

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
so first impressions I can get the wheel

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:01.790 
so first impressions I can get the wheel
high<00:03:00.510> enough<00:03:00.750> I'd<00:03:00.930> get<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> seat<00:03:01.379> low<00:03:01.530> enough

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
high enough I'd get the seat low enough

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.949 
high enough I'd get the seat low enough
so<00:03:01.860> all<00:03:02.640> murió<00:03:03.030> I'm<00:03:03.360> feeling<00:03:03.870> more

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
so all murió I'm feeling more

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:04.610 
so all murió I'm feeling more
comfortable

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
comfortable

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.259 
comfortable
I've<00:03:04.890> got<00:03:05.040> paddle<00:03:05.370> shift<00:03:05.640> which<00:03:05.879> i<00:03:05.970> think<00:03:06.030> is

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
I've got paddle shift which i think is

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.369 
I've got paddle shift which i think is
an<00:03:06.360> advantage<00:03:06.780> especially<00:03:06.840> around<00:03:07.170> this

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
an advantage especially around this

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:08.660 
an advantage especially around this
tight<00:03:07.590> little<00:03:07.620> track<00:03:08.099> alright

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
tight little track alright

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.770 
tight little track alright
putting<00:03:08.940> this<00:03:09.000> power<00:03:09.239> down<00:03:09.390> pretty<00:03:09.629> well

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
putting this power down pretty well

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.970 
putting this power down pretty well
doesn't<00:03:09.959> know<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.230> same<00:03:10.440> grump<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:10.769> I<00:03:10.860> can

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
doesn't know the same grump but I can

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.199 
doesn't know the same grump but I can
hold<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.250> flood<00:03:11.430> through<00:03:11.610> the<00:03:11.700> left-hander

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
hold it flood through the left-hander

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.059 
hold it flood through the left-hander
yeah<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.110> little<00:03:13.319> bit<00:03:13.409> more<00:03:13.560> responsive<00:03:14.040> to

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
yeah a little bit more responsive to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.610 
yeah a little bit more responsive to
turn<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:15.030> for<00:03:15.239> sure<00:03:15.269> I'm<00:03:16.260> actually<00:03:16.379> quite

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
turn that is for sure I'm actually quite

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.410 
turn that is for sure I'm actually quite
impressed<00:03:16.800> with<00:03:17.099> this<00:03:17.190> card<00:03:17.459> actually<00:03:17.760> four

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
impressed with this card actually four

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.720 
impressed with this card actually four
big<00:03:18.540> heavy<00:03:18.720> car<00:03:18.959> points<00:03:19.470> quite<00:03:19.620> well<00:03:19.950> having

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
big heavy car points quite well having

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.520 
big heavy car points quite well having
had<00:03:20.819> a<00:03:20.879> little<00:03:21.000> bit<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.180> fun<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:25.319> lap

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
had a little bit of fun now the lap

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.979 
had a little bit of fun now the lap
times<00:03:25.799> indeed<00:03:26.459> proved<00:03:26.879> interesting<00:03:27.569> showing

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
times indeed proved interesting showing

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.020 
times indeed proved interesting showing
a<00:03:28.049> difference<00:03:28.440> of<00:03:28.560> almost<00:03:28.860> two<00:03:29.159> seconds<00:03:29.849> in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the Commodores favor

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.890
