feel like anything you guys have done

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.469 
feel like anything you guys have done
off<00:02:05.619> what<00:02:06.040> your<00:02:06.189> most<00:02:06.430> recent<00:02:06.850> albums<00:02:07.299> it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
off what your most recent albums it

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.479 
off what your most recent albums it
feels<00:02:07.689> very<00:02:07.900> fresh<00:02:08.319> quite<00:02:08.619> different<00:02:09.129> to<00:02:09.310> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
feels very fresh quite different to the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.099 
feels very fresh quite different to the
other<00:02:09.909> stuff<00:02:10.149> so<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.509> this<00:02:10.599> a<00:02:10.659> change<00:02:10.929> in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.109 
other stuff so is this a change in

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:12.809 
other stuff so is this a change in
formula<00:02:11.560> as<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.799> where<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.040> album's<00:02:12.340> going<00:02:12.730> is

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
formula as is where the album's going is

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.280 
formula as is where the album's going is
it<00:02:12.909> a<00:02:12.939> different<00:02:13.269> kind<00:02:13.480> of<00:02:13.569> direction<00:02:14.109> if<00:02:14.230> you

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
it a different kind of direction if you

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.570 
it a different kind of direction if you
like<00:02:14.439> I<00:02:14.680> think<00:02:15.370> it<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.579> important<00:02:16.180> first

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
like I think it is important first

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.190 
like I think it is important first
not<00:02:18.580> replay<00:02:19.240> what<00:02:19.570> we've<00:02:19.720> done<00:02:19.840> in<00:02:19.960> the<00:02:20.050> past

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
you know I you know with another

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.240 
you know I you know with another
patients<00:02:23.080> are<00:02:23.200> another<00:02:23.410> greatest<00:02:23.860> day<00:02:24.010> it's

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
patients are another greatest day it's

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.590 
patients are another greatest day it's
important<00:02:24.610> for<00:02:24.700> us<00:02:24.760> as<00:02:24.820> a<00:02:24.970> band<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.420> keep

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
important for us as a band to keep

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.230 
important for us as a band to keep
moving<00:02:26.100> with<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.220> live<00:02:27.370> shows<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:27.970> with<00:02:28.120> the

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
moving with the live shows and with the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.560 
moving with the live shows and with the
albums<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:28.900> think<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.260> what<00:02:29.440> we<00:02:30.570> realized

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
albums and I think that what we realized

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.360 
albums and I think that what we realized
we<00:02:31.810> started<00:02:32.110> writing<00:02:32.320> at<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.650> beginning<00:02:32.920> of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
we started writing at the beginning of

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.980 
we started writing at the beginning of
this<00:02:33.610> year<00:02:33.850> but<00:02:34.030> what<00:02:34.240> we<00:02:34.390> realized<00:02:34.780> halfway

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
this year but what we realized halfway

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.630 
this year but what we realized halfway
through<00:02:35.470> is<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.680> we<00:02:35.770> wanted<00:02:36.100> to<00:02:36.280> try<00:02:36.550> and

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
through is that we wanted to try and

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:37.770 
through is that we wanted to try and
make<00:02:36.760> something<00:02:36.940> that's<00:02:37.240> positive<00:02:37.420> and

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
make something that's positive and

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.850 
make something that's positive and
optimistic<00:02:37.930> as<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.560> record<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.260> that

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
optimistic as a record and so that

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.830 
optimistic as a record and so that
that's<00:02:42.070> what<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.370> went<00:02:42.520> for<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:43.240> and<00:02:43.270> a<00:02:43.630> lot<00:02:43.810> of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
that's what we went for it and a lot of

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.690 
that's what we went for it and a lot of
the<00:02:44.020> record<00:02:44.350> is<00:02:44.500> optimistic<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.280> probably

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
the record is optimistic and probably

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.990 
the record is optimistic and probably
more<00:02:45.880> temple<00:02:46.540> maybe<00:02:46.780> than<00:02:46.990> what<00:02:47.110> people<00:02:47.260> that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
more temple maybe than what people that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.370 
more temple maybe than what people that
initially<00:02:49.000> imagined<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.170> now

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
initially imagined you know and that now

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.990 
initially imagined you know and that now
they<00:02:50.890> won't<00:02:51.070> be<00:02:51.190> because<00:02:51.550> I've<00:02:51.670> just<00:02:51.700> said

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
they won't be because I've just said

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.300 
they won't be because I've just said
that<00:02:52.209> so<00:02:52.239> another<00:02:52.600> thing<00:02:52.720> Cory<00:02:53.260> down<00:02:53.709> tempo
