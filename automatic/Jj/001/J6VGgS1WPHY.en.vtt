together right no no not really it's

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.300 
together right no no not really it's
just<00:05:33.759> that<00:05:34.210> if<00:05:34.509> you<00:05:34.719> don't<00:05:34.930> clutch<00:05:35.830> it<00:05:36.129> the

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
engine will stall when you come to a

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.170 
engine will stall when you come to a
stop<00:05:38.110> that's<00:05:38.800> all<00:05:39.069> the<00:05:39.310> engine<00:05:39.639> can't<00:05:39.879> be<00:05:40.030> at

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
stop that's all the engine can't be at

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.899 
stop that's all the engine can't be at
zero<00:05:40.479> it<00:05:40.780> has<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.110> keep<00:05:41.259> moving<00:05:41.580> right<00:05:42.580> the

00:05:42.899 --> 00:05:42.909 
zero it has to keep moving right the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:44.999 
zero it has to keep moving right the
engine<00:05:43.030> keeps<00:05:43.419> moving<00:05:43.900> and<00:05:44.139> you<00:05:44.770> have<00:05:44.860> to

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:45.009 
engine keeps moving and you have to

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:47.459 
engine keeps moving and you have to
disengage<00:05:45.430> it<00:05:45.789> from<00:05:45.819> the<00:05:46.030> wheels<00:05:46.539> think<00:05:47.229> of<00:05:47.349> it

00:05:47.459 --> 00:05:47.469 
disengage it from the wheels think of it

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.110 
disengage it from the wheels think of it
that<00:05:47.620> way<00:05:47.770> your<00:05:47.979> mechanical<00:05:48.550> right<00:05:48.789> so<00:05:49.030> it

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
that way your mechanical right so it

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.180 
that way your mechanical right so it
makes<00:05:49.300> sense<00:05:49.620> there<00:05:50.620> always<00:05:50.740> have<00:05:50.889> to<00:05:50.949> be<00:05:51.039> on

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.190 
makes sense there always have to be on

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.129 
makes sense there always have to be on
the<00:05:51.279> clutch<00:05:51.520> one<00:05:51.729> driving<00:05:52.029> the<00:05:52.270> motor<00:05:52.449> water

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
long as you don't come to zero and it

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.670 
long as you don't come to zero and it
also<00:06:07.090> depends<00:06:07.719> like<00:06:07.840> which<00:06:08.080> gear<00:06:08.409> you're<00:06:08.590> in

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
no you can't because if you drop it

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
like you know burnout basically if you

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.820 
like you know burnout basically if you
do<00:07:08.980> that<00:07:09.450> so<00:07:10.450> like<00:07:10.690> you<00:07:10.900> see<00:07:11.110> how<00:07:11.260> you're<00:07:11.470> right

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:11.830 
do that so like you see how you're right

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.770 
do that so like you see how you're right
now<00:07:11.980> you're<00:07:12.160> at<00:07:12.250> whatever<00:07:12.550> one<00:07:13.360> and<00:07:13.540> a<00:07:13.600> half

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:13.780 
now you're at whatever one and a half

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.620 
now you're at whatever one and a half
right<00:07:14.650> if<00:07:14.860> you<00:07:15.460> go<00:07:15.610> faster<00:07:16.150> then<00:07:16.360> you<00:07:16.450> can

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:16.630 
right if you go faster then you can

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:18.330 
right if you go faster then you can
change<00:07:16.930> it<00:07:17.200> basically<00:07:17.770> what<00:07:17.890> you<00:07:17.980> do<00:07:18.130> then<00:07:18.310> is

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:18.340 
change it basically what you do then is

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.390 
change it basically what you do then is
you<00:07:18.520> clutch<00:07:19.050> change<00:07:20.050> and<00:07:20.350> then<00:07:20.560> slowly<00:07:20.920> let<00:07:21.190> go

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
you clutch change and then slowly let go

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.370 
you clutch change and then slowly let go
over<00:07:21.550> the<00:07:21.700> maybe<00:07:22.180> we<00:07:22.300> should<00:07:22.480> use<00:07:22.600> not<00:07:22.870> to<00:07:22.900> slow

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:23.380 
over the maybe we should use not to slow

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.170 
over the maybe we should use not to slow
but<00:07:23.590> when<00:07:23.740> they<00:07:23.830> say<00:07:24.040> slowly<00:07:24.400> like<00:07:24.700> at<00:07:24.940> this

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
but when they say slowly like at this

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.280 
but when they say slowly like at this
pace<00:07:25.660> okay<00:07:26.130> so<00:07:27.130> here<00:07:27.340> come<00:07:27.640> to<00:07:27.820> a<00:07:27.880> stuff<00:07:28.120> again

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.930 

break<00:07:32.290> and<00:07:32.650> then<00:07:32.800> clutch<00:07:33.160> all<00:07:33.370> the<00:07:33.400> way<00:07:33.520> in<00:07:33.640> and

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:33.940 
break and then clutch all the way in and

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:36.780 
break and then clutch all the way in and
you'll<00:07:34.090> see<00:07:34.200> the<00:07:35.200> you<00:07:36.070> see<00:07:36.310> how<00:07:36.430> the<00:07:36.490> rest

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:36.790

you'll see the you see how the rest
dropped<00:07:37.180> okay<00:07:37.690> now<00:07:37.900> you<00:07:37.960> can<00:07:38.050> let<00:07:38.380> go<00:07:38.530> of<00:07:38.560> the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:38.770

now you can let it go so keep in mind if
you<00:07:42.490> want<00:07:42.670> to<00:07:42.760> let<00:07:42.880> go<00:07:42.940> of<00:07:43.150> the<00:07:43.270> clutch<00:07:43.420> if<00:07:43.720> it's

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:43.900 
you want to let go of the clutch if it's

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.560
