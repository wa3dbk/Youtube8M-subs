just<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.720> little<00:02:44.959> mini<00:02:45.200> review<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.739> this

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.920 
just a little mini review on this
mascara<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.610> like<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.120> results<00:02:47.540> that<00:02:47.630> it<00:02:47.750> gives

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
mascara I like the results that it gives

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.800 
mascara I like the results that it gives
in<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.200> end<00:02:48.410> but<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.860> takes<00:02:49.099> forever<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:50.180> work

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
in the end but it takes forever to work

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080 
in the end but it takes forever to work
with<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.319> so<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:51.680> probably<00:02:52.250> won't<00:02:52.459> buy<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.700> again

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.710 
with it so I probably won't buy it again
and<00:02:54.489> that's<00:02:55.489> what<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.880> finish<00:02:56.239> eyes<00:02:56.450> look

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
and that's what the finish eyes look

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.920 
and that's what the finish eyes look
like<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.030> then<00:02:59.030> right<00:02:59.270> here<00:02:59.540> I'll<00:02:59.690> show<00:02:59.900> you
