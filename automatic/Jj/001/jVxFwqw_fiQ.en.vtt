00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.920
 P-wave the ship yet by say Mito electric time bran cram 3 minutes Statement Castle waveform represents the excitement of patience 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.400
 It represents the nine columns Mu chopsticks produce excitement 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:20.020
 t wave is that the home delivery of bedroom wake up 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:24.910
 If there is an abnormality in the p wave, you can think that there is an abnormality in the mandrel . 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:31.150
 9 r If it is normal, you can think that there is no problem with advancing. 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:36.579
 Well this area will be important later, so let's hold it firmly 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.180
 Last time the new lens talked about the graph of electricity and time 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.590
 is not it 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.280
 It is very important to measure the time of the weather 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.950
 It is the smallest, but this is 0 seconds for 4 seconds 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 The smallest masu what was Satsuma road is 0.2 seconds 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:01:02.110
 Because this number of 0.04 seconds and the number of 0.2 seconds will be very important later 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:07.280
 Let's keep this number in mind, but after that it's about how to measure your heart rate . 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:11.030
 The monitor you look at it is if Well general of the new lens, but I is written I heart rate 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.170
 If it is so that the bottom left of the screen Kifa come to rise 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:19.820
 We may miscount the t wave as r school and double count 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.070
 So basically if you look at the r teeth and count your heart rate 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 It is a place to say 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.360
 Therefore it is useful to measure time 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.390
 0.2 seconds I talked earlier 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:35.170
 To be waiting to Ofuna masu It is a big masu 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:39.180
 If alert comes out, heart rate will be 3002 and will be 100 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:46.680
 It is decided to be 60 in 75 Komatsu by express 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:53.030
 That is the heart rate if the feeling is narrow hilarious than you come if wider width than the increase more than 60 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:57.140
 It is to say heart rate and I will know that roughly that say 60 or less 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:03.020
 New lens did talk of graph of time well though 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:06.760
 Here is it is written I reference value variety in but teachers of the circulator remember all this 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:10.330
 So it is why it is determined whether abnormal or normal 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:14.330
 In addition , it is quite difficult to remember everything 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.870
 Let's keep in mind only the Great Serpent in this 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.580
 That's right 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.440
 pq time is less than 0.2 seconds 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:28.390
 And qrs within 0.1 seconds 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.500
 These two are very important to understand the new lens, so remember by all means 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 Please give me 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:39.610
 It is also the possession with 0.4 seconds plus or minus 10 percent of the qt time it is if there is room I 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.510
 I hope you will remember and I hope to continue these stories 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:45.159
 I'm sorry 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:48.760
 It is summary p Wave of patience school lesson 9 shows the excitement of the advance 

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:51.879
 It is small, but we increase rice 0.04 seconds, but 0.2 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:57.280
 Let's put a habit to judge heart rate at rr interval 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:57.940
 pq time is less than 0.2 seconds q Remember that Ares is less than 0.1 seconds 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.750
 Please give me 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.750
 I was relieved
