and sometimes hearty focus quickly and
accurately<00:00:51.890> as<00:00:52.890> i'm<00:00:53.070> showing<00:00:53.340> here<00:00:54.800> now<00:00:55.800> this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.799 
accurately as i'm showing here now this
will<00:00:56.309> prob<00:00:56.579> be<00:00:56.610> improved<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.480> bit<00:00:57.719> of

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
will prob be improved with a bit of

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.619 
will prob be improved with a bit of
practice<00:00:58.039> but<00:00:59.039> it's<00:01:00.000> probably<00:01:00.239> not<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.510> best

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
practice but it's probably not the best

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.619 
practice but it's probably not the best
option<00:01:01.199> if<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:01.980> fast-moving<00:01:02.820> action

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
option if you want fast-moving action

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.800 
option if you want fast-moving action
shots<00:01:07.010> so<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.130> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.430> see<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:09.119> practice

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
shots so as you can see with practice

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.310 
shots so as you can see with practice
you<00:01:09.930> can<00:01:10.340> focus<00:01:11.340> relatively<00:01:12.330> quickly<00:01:13.189> but

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
you can focus relatively quickly but

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.870 
you can focus relatively quickly but
it's<00:01:16.320> obviously<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:16.890> gonna<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.340> as<00:01:17.549> good<00:01:17.820> as

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
it's obviously not gonna be as good as

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's obviously not gonna be as good as
other<00:01:18.119> shots<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.810> also<00:01:20.000> that<00:01:21.890> position<00:01:22.890> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
other shots and up also that position of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380 
other shots and up also that position of
the<00:01:23.100> focus<00:01:23.460> probably<00:01:23.820> won't<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.150> great

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
the focus probably won't be great

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.990 
the focus probably won't be great
because<00:01:24.570> rick<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.259> using<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.950> screen<00:01:26.640> as

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
because rick is then using the screen as

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270 
because rick is then using the screen as
i<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.140> beer<00:01:28.560> vendor<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.070> this

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
i do not have a beer vendor on this

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
i do not have a beer vendor on this
camera<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:30.990> on<00:01:31.290> all<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:31.799> think<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.810> very

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
camera so on all i think it's a very

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.030 
camera so on all i think it's a very
good<00:01:33.930> lens<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.799> want<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:36.829> shots<00:01:37.829> with

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
good lens if you want the shots with

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.840 
good lens if you want the shots with
movie<00:01:38.310> showed<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.060> focus<00:01:40.549> especially<00:01:41.549> if

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
movie showed up the focus especially if

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.380 
movie showed up the focus especially if
itself<00:01:42.150> stationary<00:01:42.659> objects<00:01:43.909> but<00:01:44.909> probably

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
itself stationary objects but probably

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.990 
itself stationary objects but probably
not<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.630> best<00:01:45.659> option<00:01:46.020> for<00:01:46.500> hey<00:01:47.490> speed

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
not the best option for hey speed

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
not the best option for hey speed

viewfinder<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.569> it<00:02:53.380> can<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.769> done<00:02:53.799> reasonably

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
viewfinder but it can be done reasonably

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.979 
viewfinder but it can be done reasonably
well<00:02:54.819> as<00:02:55.269> you<00:02:56.200> can<00:02:56.349> see<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.329> will<00:02:58.870> be

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
well as you can see and I can will be

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:06.240 
well as you can see and I can will be
useful<00:02:59.470> for<00:03:03.870> slow-moving<00:03:04.870> objects<00:03:05.769> because

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
useful for slow-moving objects because

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.360 
useful for slow-moving objects because
you<00:03:06.910> can<00:03:07.060> change<00:03:07.390> for<00:03:07.720> you<00:03:08.019> can<00:03:08.260> get<00:03:08.920> an<00:03:09.069> earful

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
you can change for you can get an earful

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.449 
you can change for you can get an earful
because<00:03:10.120> if<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.720> are<00:03:10.840> good<00:03:11.140> with<00:03:11.430> ours<00:03:12.430> I

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
because if you are good with ours I

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.500 
because if you are good with ours I
think<00:03:12.790> does<00:03:13.600> it<00:03:13.989> seem<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.310> focus<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:16.120> having

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
think does it seem the focus at having

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.890 
think does it seem the focus at having
dessert<00:03:16.930> we're<00:03:18.000> focused<00:03:19.000> engine<00:03:19.480> Sandy's

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
dessert we're focused engine Sandy's

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.150 
dessert we're focused engine Sandy's
surge<00:03:20.260> fault<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.329> think<00:03:22.959> good<00:03:23.620> option<00:03:23.950> if

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
surge fault so I think good option if

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.099 
surge fault so I think good option if
you<00:03:24.370> okay<00:03:24.819> so<00:03:25.000> if<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.209> have<00:03:25.359> slow<00:03:25.750> moving

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
you okay so if you have slow moving

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.699 
you okay so if you have slow moving
things<00:03:26.410> and<00:03:26.680> our<00:03:26.889> good<00:03:27.639> at<00:03:27.760> focusing<00:03:28.709> because

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
things and our good at focusing because

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.430 
things and our good at focusing because
it's<00:03:30.609> very<00:03:30.849> great<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.239> there's<00:03:31.690> no<00:03:31.870> searching

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
it's very great and there's no searching

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.280 
it's very great and there's no searching
with<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.739> focus<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.599> I<00:03:34.599> think<00:03:34.840> that's<00:03:35.019> all

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
with the focus and I think that's all

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.849 
with the focus and I think that's all
after<00:03:35.950> you<00:03:36.010> say<00:03:36.480> in<00:03:37.480> summation<00:03:37.900> Alexi<00:03:38.680> Lance

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
after you say in summation Alexi Lance

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:41.490 
after you say in summation Alexi Lance
is<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.099> good<00:03:39.730> as<00:03:40.660> long<00:03:40.870> as<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.109> prepare<00:03:41.290> to

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
is a good as long as you prepare to

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.699 
is a good as long as you prepare to
focus<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:44.549> because<00:03:45.549> they<00:03:45.669> are<00:03:45.819> credit

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
focus and because they are credit

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.770 
focus and because they are credit
actually<00:03:47.709> totally<00:03:47.919> silent<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.609> this<00:03:49.269> such<00:03:49.750> a

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
actually totally silent and this such a

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.849 
actually totally silent and this such a
variation<00:03:50.410> is<00:03:50.530> going<00:03:50.769> get<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.470> perfect<00:03:53.470> lens

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
variation is going get the perfect lens

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:01.830 
variation is going get the perfect lens
for<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.269> want<00:03:55.329> to<00:03:55.480> cheat<00:03:57.180> all<00:03:58.180> oh<00:04:00.840> it

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
for what you want to cheat all oh it

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.870 
for what you want to cheat all oh it
gets<00:04:01.959> you<00:04:02.139> full<00:04:02.349> control<00:04:02.769> of<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.310> focusing<00:04:03.730> so

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
gets you full control of the focusing so

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.360 
gets you full control of the focusing so
you<00:04:03.970> don't<00:04:04.150> have<00:04:04.269> to<00:04:04.480> away<00:04:04.720> inator<00:04:05.370> searching

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
you don't have to away inator searching

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.449 
you don't have to away inator searching
for<00:04:06.579> focus<00:04:07.030> points<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.709> think<00:04:08.859> that's<00:04:09.160> all

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
for focus points so I think that's all

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.780 
for focus points so I think that's all
have<00:04:09.639> to<00:04:09.760> say<00:04:09.880> on<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.660> I'll<00:04:10.810> as<00:04:11.669> choice<00:04:12.669> a
