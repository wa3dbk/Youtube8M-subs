00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.200 
tailor and I may look kind of weird but
that<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.860> what<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.219> mod<00:00:35.399> does<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:35.969> very

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
that is what this mod does it is very

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.299 
that is what this mod does it is very
similar<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.899> smart<00:00:37.410> moving<00:00:37.710> mod<00:00:38.010> as

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
similar to like to a smart moving mod as

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.920 
similar to like to a smart moving mod as
thing<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.270> don't<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.480> what<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.660> would

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
thing and I don't know what they would

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.930 
thing and I don't know what they would
categorize<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.739> modest<00:00:41.190> but<00:00:41.399> as<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.820> could

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
categorize this modest but as you could

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
categorize this modest but as you could
see<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.420> basically<00:00:42.719> changes<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.469> you

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
see it basically changes the way you

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.340 
see it basically changes the way you
move<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.629> animations<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.079> less<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
move and the animations more or less of

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.049 
move and the animations more or less of
when<00:00:46.739> you're<00:00:46.920> moving<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> doing<00:00:47.640> different

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
when you're moving and doing different

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.790 
when you're moving and doing different
actions<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:48.930> whip<00:00:49.079> out<00:00:49.230> my<00:00:49.350> bow<00:00:49.559> right

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
actions so if I whip out my bow right

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
actions so if I whip out my bow right
here<00:00:49.980> as<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.160> can<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.370> he's<00:00:50.910> going<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.420> ball

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750

when<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.289> look<00:00:58.440> around<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> eyes<00:00:59.160> move<00:00:59.609> as

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
when you look around the eyes move as

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.330

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
well not just his head so if you could

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.219

I<00:01:04.350> don't<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.619> there's<00:01:04.769> any<00:01:04.890> too<00:01:05.040> much

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

I don't think there's any too much
different<00:01:05.519> with<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.760> but<00:01:06.090> my<00:01:06.210> favorite<00:01:06.600> part

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840

that<00:02:21.480> I<00:02:21.630> will<00:02:21.870> probably<00:02:22.080> use<00:02:22.290> just<00:02:23.040> myself

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
that I will probably use just myself

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.949 
that I will probably use just myself
because<00:02:23.580> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> client-side<00:02:24.540> mod<00:02:24.780> I

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959

this<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.420> use<00:02:27.690> it<00:02:27.870> but<00:02:28.230> I<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:28.560> figured<00:02:28.890> I'd

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
this to use it but I just figured I'd

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.710
