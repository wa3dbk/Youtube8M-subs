00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.300
 We are now in the southern Black Forest today 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.800
 during the evening are heavy 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.860
 Storms have become possible now 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.470
 here some storm chaser gathers it 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.070

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 storm chaser from switzerland and yes 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.260
 Dominik briefly hello storm chaser too 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.769
 German you yes there are many times 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 negative picture of catastrophes tourism 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's really different in reality 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.550
 that hunt storm he had something with a hobby 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.110
 to do with fascination and has too 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.050
 a serious background how do you see 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 the same way I see it the same way we 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.860
 proud it because they 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.329
 the warning systems partly contribute to this 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.010
 far to improve 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.719
 we collect data that is ours 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.579
 Passion in areas you too have 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.050
 Also to be observed on site and size 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.660
 statistics 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.370
 with them in principle exactly 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.750
 how strong that can predict 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.180
 thunderstorm and finally becomes because 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.890
 that is today, despite the technology, which we 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.439
 today have not yet exactly 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.220
 possible and the operation team needs 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.229
 that's just the car okay yes 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.540
 maximilianpark from bavaria 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 It's extra two hours 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.220
 drove here in the black forest and you 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.259
 have really great here too 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 structures today to document how 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.369
 Do you see that with the theme of storm hunt 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.100
 yes so I see that much like 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.740
 our swiss colleagues 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 and of course it is important for us 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.990
 that we as city â€‹â€‹itself with the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.939
 Improve the warnings you contribute 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.009
 Of course we just as the people 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.409
 first on the spot are and can be so 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.000
 Of course, then exactly won in the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 end effect then maybe give us out 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.240
 the weather service said it could do that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.700
 and that happen and we'll see 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.020
 really what happens in the end 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.659
 exactly what it is about the one 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.390
 fascination with the force of nature 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.280
 Of course you try as well as 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.219
 this weather can be extreme too 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.659
 document and also the security 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.820
 Of course, always comes first 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.340
 So the picture of the crazy ones 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 storm chaser how to film it out 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.520
 know this is absolutely wrong in 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 Reality looks very different 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.480
 we are waiting here now and try 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.140
