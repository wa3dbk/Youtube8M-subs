 [Music] 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.720
 friends how are I, I'm Luis Gg and 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.170
 I want to give you the most cordial welcome 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:18.920
 to this special of the month of October the 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.930
 special 4k of louis puntocom a 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.279
 special in which we are going to talk about 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:27.710
 the different advantages of technology 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.410
 4k what's behind all this but 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.050
 especially with different tips for 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.230
 that it remains exactly clear to us how 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.030
 get the most out of it so 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.090
 we interviewed we talked rather said 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.340
 with alejandro zavala a specialist of 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.350
 sony mexico who told us about the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.390
 different details behind that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.220
 technology but especially also of 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.580
 the different technologies used by this 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.070
 company so there is a much image 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.010
 more realistic an image with more 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.020
 quality so let's start this 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.390
 special and let's know what there is 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.129
 behind 4k technology is only followed 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.930
 focusing on four main first 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.549
 where the number one is always going to be 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.870
 the image quality we always go 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.700
 in portions 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.190
 in providing the user with the best 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.920
 image experience that's why a 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.030
 television really 90% is for 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.650
 see it ok 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.690
 then we have the best search engine 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.730
 images as you said we are the 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.170
 TV with greater range of colors 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.960
 thanks to a technology called 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:30.680
 trigeminal display ok that increases the range 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.090
 of colors approaching 85 by 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.670
 about one hundred percent of what you can 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.550
 capture the human eye ok then with 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.800
 this we extend the range of greens and reds 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.720
 with which for example you see a 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
 soccer game 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.440
 of American football and you will be able to 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.210
 enjoy that green field as if 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.890
 you were in the industrial ok 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.570
 all colors are going to be expanded and 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.210
 they are going to look as if you were 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.460
 looking through a window at any scene 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.740
 what are you observing we have a point 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.600
 which is very important we have now 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.870
 we control the brightness and the 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.280
 contrast with the technology that is called 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.840
 dynamic and first in two 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.550
 different characteristics that is me 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.710
 could I be able to adjust brightness and for 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.270
 another power contrast what is the 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.980
 difference now with this here the 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.810
 difference is you are going to find 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.370
 there 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.780
 generally the TVs that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.510
 cristian shine contrast and the only thing that 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.120
 they do is increase the video in the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.709
 leds so they have more immunity what 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.730
 that we do for example in 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.640
 need like the one we 're seeing 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.040
 Now it's that when you have lights it's 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.410
 only the area that is illuminating 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.510
 is the one that will give much more luminosity 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.569
 with that you can have total control 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.390
 of each of the zones not giving more 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.950
 brightness but an intelligent brightness ok or 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.860
 let's say what it does is that 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.920
 scans the image and where it detects 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 is to say direct to the light is where 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
 will give you much more strength not 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.530
 exactly what you need it less the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.380
 it is not turned on and you are going to have blacks 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.299
 more black and white plus white one of 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.970
 the technologies that we contain in sony 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:02.890
 it's very complicated you're going to see that there 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.599
 being much faster where a 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.090
 times the covers to enjoy for 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.980
 example now with the global earthquake in 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.450
 american football game you see that 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.890
 the ball goes from one side to the other and from 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.410
 soon you lose it in the air until 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.599
 it already has a person it 's nice that 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.489
 what happens here we with much a 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.660
 flow we make all those images 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:21.880
 be much softer 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.380
 ok you will be able to see the movement of 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 much softer cameras and you're not going to 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.160
 power a detail not only in events 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.810
 sports which is where most 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.450
 take advantage in movies for example 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.180
 like amazing spider man in the tube is a 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.790
 the clear thing to cross from side to side and see 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.500
 like a slight flick with the ghosts 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.300
 abnormally clear here what is going to you 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.010
 allow is to see that image and those 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.470
 movements smoothly thanks to the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.880
 motion flower that counts is one of the 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.590
 technologies that all have 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.830
 the televisions at the beginning of the 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.540
 televisions and the market is to see each 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.460
 image is much bigger now the 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.170
 32-inch televisions switched to 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.820
 be in the kitchen or in some other 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.590
 zones in the home and nation 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.000
 entertainment the televisions above 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.220
 of 40 inches are the ones that are 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.810
 making the difference logically between 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.820
 larger televisions screens more 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.940
 large larger pixels which 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.910
 I had him on your TV after this 4k you 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.490
 you can have an 85-inch screen 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.260
 where the resolution is still 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.000
 optimal then let's say that what 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.730
 happened was that I had a screen 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.780
 60 inches but with the previous signal 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:26.350
 the only thing that was happening 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.780
 that the pixels stretched and followed 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.130
 seeing as rare the image does not enter anymore 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.200
 large is the image logically 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.009
 you started to see as if they were the 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.229
 squares 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:37.729
 the tendency for you to see the best 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:40.430
 distance for you to enjoy 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:43.159
 a television is through television sets 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.339
 40 inches separate and multiply it by 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.529
 4 and the distance would be a meter 60 ok 

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.990
 then at that distance that I started 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:52.909
 to know a bit of pixels or those 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.939
 little squares that you mention with the 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:05:00.080
 4k technology you in each full pixel 

00:04:55.939 --> 00:05:02.990
 hd m 34 ok which resolution 4k is 4 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.479
 He subtracted his lateral well 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.419
 now one of the most important myths 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:10.789
 with respect to 4k is the content that 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.309
 There is so much that we can both get 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:15.499
 benefit to those movies videos that 

00:05:13.309 --> 00:05:18.499
 they are out there and they could be or not 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:20.539
 in 4k well we 're going to discover that in 

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:23.809
 the next broadcast of this videoblog 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.969
 of this special from luis gg with respect 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:28.159
 to 4k our October special as well 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.080
 that invite you to follow the 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:32.389
 We invite you to subscribe to us 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.009
 leave comments on twitter with louis 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.439
 There is the same on Facebook 

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:39.639
