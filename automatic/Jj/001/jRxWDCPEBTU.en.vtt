00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.989
 ah 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.110
 what would the school be without the teachers 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.080
 to see the little miguelito what happens to you if you 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.209

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.050
 I cut the other ear 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.619
 and what would the school be if the students 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.060
 so you tell me the present of 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.060
 indicative of the verb nada 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.510
 please my shortest cry is good 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
 the truth is that there is no perfect school 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.960
 open miguelito as you imagine the 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.810
 ideal school 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.860
 for the perfect school as you 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.860
 imagine miguelito 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.100
 but with you in the kid 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.040
 no longer enough there are things that are not done in 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.410
 the school some students seek to fall 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.480
 well your teacher take as friends and 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:12.160
 make them the beard sometimes trying to 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.160
 buy them with gifts and other 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.490
 now that miguelito 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.880
 lamela look child to me you are not going to me 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.790
 buy with an apple so take and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.680
 says crazy things at school if 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.229
 once the teacher visa a child 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.240
 was copying in the exam was super 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.460
 crazy and again he tells the teacher like this 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.869
 waiting and careful teacher just before 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.390
 to sit in his chair and full 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.550
 of tacks was really crazy the truth I 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.979
 it was very popular as much as a time in 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.610
 that they said to me of external and my friends 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.830
 were from esther 2 and the other dexter 3 and the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.680
 I really liked my nickname, we were 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.810
 very smart is shut up and not me 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 the school is where it puts you in your support 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.050
 Sometimes it costs you work but you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.970
 you try to excel so that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.430
 put this magic nickname that you want 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.250
 they tell me the banana because once the 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.050
 mind a banana a friend once and so 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.149
 there are situations that can mark you 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.700
 for life but wait there are other nicknames 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.850
 of which I found out that a trophy for 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.010
 trompudo efe or the priest for fat the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.020
 small shop in town for a little girl but 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.940
 well your strip double nationality 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.700
 because he is from here but his teeth 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.130
 that was the comal because it warms pure 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.739
 gorditas and the almost handsome because he thinks 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.570
 handsome but it's cool already 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.010
 nicknames are part of being in school 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 but when you get to life 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.610
 university you realize that there 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.709
 more important things like joining a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:41.220
 team at school and I took classes 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 aikido and also nobody and even of classes 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.239
 of Spanish and this is a secret but you 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:48.900
 I 'm going to tell you since we're here in 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.540

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.010

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.020
 for her I did it for a while until 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.020
 that we were half a turn 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.310
 I broke a foot because sometimes I think that 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.469
 I should have practiced lighter 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.090
 a sport yes but where I did not have to 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:14.159
 make a triple mortal welcome to the 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.950
 chess club of death you know 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:21.480
 the rules and if I can already play you're already 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.750

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:27.150

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.790
 but about to pay for your defeat 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.700
 if you lose in the chess of death 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:51.280
 you die 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.280
 unless it's a game 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.060

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.210

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.459
 I was a student of the worst 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.780
 nobody loves you something that marked me a lot 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.820
 the school was when I had to 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.140
 facing an unexpected situation was 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.140
 when I had to be the hero 

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:34.180
 with this true for a most holy lack 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:39.100

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:45.190
 and open the door and everyone could leave 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:47.169
 I was the hero the next day they gave us 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.870

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.880

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.729

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.650
