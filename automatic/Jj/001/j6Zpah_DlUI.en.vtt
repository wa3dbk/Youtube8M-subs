our<00:00:13.290> mob<00:00:13.620> farm<00:00:13.980> tutorial<00:00:14.790> we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.240> to

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
our mob farm tutorial we're going to

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.300 
our mob farm tutorial we're going to
make<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> few<00:00:15.780> modifications<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.830> make<00:00:17.100> it

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
make a few modifications to make it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.340 
make a few modifications to make it
really<00:00:17.730> awesome<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.660> we're<00:00:18.750> gonna<00:00:18.840> start<00:00:19.199> by

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
really awesome so we're gonna start by

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.830 
really awesome so we're gonna start by
punching<00:00:19.710> out<00:00:20.130> a<00:00:20.160> few<00:00:20.460> blocks<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.000> putting<00:00:21.720> in

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
punching out a few blocks and putting in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.560 
punching out a few blocks and putting in
an<00:00:21.990> on/off<00:00:22.439> switch<00:00:22.470> as<00:00:23.130> well<00:00:23.460> as<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.060> piston

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
an on/off switch as well as a piston

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.870 
an on/off switch as well as a piston
pusher<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.380> retrieve<00:00:25.830> any<00:00:26.099> items<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.640> we

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
pusher to retrieve any items that we

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.259 
pusher to retrieve any items that we
can't<00:00:27.150> reach<00:00:27.590> so<00:00:28.590> get<00:00:29.189> some<00:00:29.429> sticky<00:00:29.789> pistons

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
can't reach so get some sticky pistons

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420 
can't reach so get some sticky pistons
down<00:00:30.539> like<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.019> at<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> back<00:00:31.529> put<00:00:32.399> some

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
down like that at the back put some

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.840 
down like that at the back put some
blocks<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:33.120> front<00:00:33.230> and<00:00:35.690> then<00:00:37.460> punch<00:00:38.460> out<00:00:38.700> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
blocks in front and then punch out the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
blocks in front and then punch out the
floor<00:00:41.270> put<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.300> button<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> side<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.680> a

ring of pistons

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.029 
ring of pistons
this<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.710> our<00:00:55.890> on/off<00:00:56.340> switch<00:00:57.829> put<00:00:58.829> some

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
this will be our on/off switch put some

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
this will be our on/off switch put some
dust<00:00:59.309> down<00:00:59.520> across<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.210> all<00:01:00.719> easy

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
dust down across like that all easy

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.179 
dust down across like that all easy
stuff<00:01:02.960> yep<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.500> looks<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.010> working

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
stuff yep that looks like it's working

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.530 
stuff yep that looks like it's working
pretty<00:01:05.580> well<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.290> buttons<00:01:07.710> side<00:01:08.540> some

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
pretty well on to the buttons side some

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.330 
pretty well on to the buttons side some
more<00:01:09.689> blocks<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.260> will<00:01:10.380> just<00:01:10.590> staircase<00:01:11.070> up

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
more blocks that will just staircase up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
more blocks that will just staircase up
a<00:01:11.460> couple<00:01:11.790> levels<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> then<00:01:14.369> some

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
a couple levels like this and then some

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
a couple levels like this and then some
dust<00:01:14.850> on<00:01:15.090> top<00:01:15.530> that'll<00:01:16.530> provide<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> pusher

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
dust on top that'll provide the pusher

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.550 
dust on top that'll provide the pusher
that'll<00:01:17.880> push<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.240> items<00:01:18.570> towards<00:01:19.080> us<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.409> we

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
that'll push the items towards us if we

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.640 
that'll push the items towards us if we
can't<00:01:19.770> reach<00:01:20.040> them<00:01:23.930> yep<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.320> looks<00:01:25.350> like

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
can't reach them yep that looks like

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
can't reach them yep that looks like
it's<00:01:25.799> working<00:01:25.979> really<00:01:26.400> nicely<00:01:28.220> ok<00:01:29.220> now<00:01:29.490> we're

it's working really nicely ok now we're
going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.909> get<00:01:30.030> underneath<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.780> platform

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
going to get underneath the platform

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.710 
going to get underneath the platform
where<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.220> mobs<00:01:32.430> are<00:01:32.579> gonna<00:01:32.700> fall<00:01:33.090> when<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
where the mobs are gonna fall when the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.920 
where the mobs are gonna fall when the
unit<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.170> off<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.880> case<00:01:36.150> they're<00:01:36.750> just

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
unit is off in this case they're just

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.870 
unit is off in this case they're just
gonna<00:01:37.049> fall<00:01:37.380> an<00:01:37.560> extra<00:01:37.860> couple<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> blocks<00:01:38.610> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
gonna fall an extra couple of blocks and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.899 
gonna fall an extra couple of blocks and
that'll<00:01:39.540> kill<00:01:39.780> them<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:41.100> could<00:01:41.250> put<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> larva

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that'll kill them you could put a larva

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
that'll kill them you could put a larva
blade<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.420> or<00:01:42.570> something<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.560> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
blade in or something like that if you

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
blade in or something like that if you
really<00:01:43.979> want<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> make<00:01:44.340> sure<00:01:44.399> cuz<00:01:44.820> witches<00:01:45.240> do

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
really want to make sure cuz witches do

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.420 
really want to make sure cuz witches do
have<00:01:45.659> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.899> more<00:01:46.140> health<00:01:46.409> and<00:01:46.710> they<00:01:47.220> may

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
have a little more health and they may

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.789 
have a little more health and they may
not<00:01:47.610> die<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.570> anyway<00:01:48.899> we're<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.470> going<00:01:49.770> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
not die but anyway we're just going to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.770 
not die but anyway we're just going to
construct<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.430> little<00:01:50.670> platform<00:01:51.180> down<00:01:51.420> here

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
construct a little platform down here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
construct a little platform down here
pop<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.009> chest<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.549> some<00:01:53.729> hoppers<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
pop in a chest and some hoppers to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
pop in a chest and some hoppers to
collect<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.899> items<00:01:55.079> so<00:01:55.740> they<00:01:55.860> don't<00:01:56.040> go

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
collect all the items so they don't go

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.550 
collect all the items so they don't go
to<00:01:56.250> waste<00:01:56.689> so<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> be<00:01:57.960> used<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.350> two

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
to waste so it can be used for two

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.209 
to waste so it can be used for two
purposes

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
purposes

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.920

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
else so we're just going to build a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.029 
else so we're just going to build a
platform<00:02:05.670> here<00:02:06.060> build<00:02:06.360> it<00:02:06.479> any<00:02:06.630> way<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.840> like

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
platform here build it any way you like

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.600 
platform here build it any way you like
get<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> chest<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.640> down<00:02:08.879> here<00:02:10.340> point<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> hopper

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
get a chest in down here point a hopper

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.390 
get a chest in down here point a hopper
into<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.450> another<00:02:13.020> one

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
into it and another one

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:21.509 
into it and another one
and<00:02:15.400> that's<00:02:15.760> pretty<00:02:15.970> much<00:02:16.090> job<00:02:16.720> done<00:02:20.519> some

dispenser rings already done and let's
get<00:03:46.060> a<00:03:46.090> roof<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:47.019> thing<00:03:47.489> using<00:03:48.489> half

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:48.699 
get a roof on this thing using half

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:50.490 
get a roof on this thing using half
slabs<00:03:49.120> that<00:03:49.389> prevents<00:03:49.840> any<00:03:49.989> mobs<00:03:50.290> from

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
slabs that prevents any mobs from

slabs that prevents any mobs from
spawning<00:03:50.949> on<00:03:51.310> top<00:03:51.669> and<00:03:52.560> once<00:03:53.560> you've

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
spawning on top and once you've

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:57.689 
spawning on top and once you've
completed<00:03:54.760> your<00:03:54.970> roof<00:03:55.780> we'll<00:03:56.769> connect<00:03:57.250> up<00:03:57.459> the

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699 
completed your roof we'll connect up the

completed your roof we'll connect up the
dispenser<00:03:58.449> rings<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:01.629> we'll<00:04:01.840> go<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.079> one<00:04:02.349> side

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
dispenser rings so we'll go to one side

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.979 
dispenser rings so we'll go to one side
remember<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:03.519> they<00:04:03.669> alternate<00:04:04.239> every<00:04:04.479> two

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989
