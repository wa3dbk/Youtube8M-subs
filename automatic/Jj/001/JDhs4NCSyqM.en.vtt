00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
got a mandrel on the way so I can do

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.859 
got a mandrel on the way so I can do
multiple<00:01:05.309> rings<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:06.060> once<00:01:08.659> but<00:01:10.220> first<00:01:11.220> off

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
multiple rings at once but first off

like<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.080> stuff<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.500> buy<00:01:16.710> forget<00:01:17.220> making

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
like the stuff you buy forget making

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.390 
like the stuff you buy forget making
wouldn't<00:01:19.110> eat<00:01:19.530> pins<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> then<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.950> keep<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
wouldn't eat pins and then to keep that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
wouldn't eat pins and then to keep that
from<00:01:23.580> coming<00:01:23.880> off<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.180> know<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> can't<00:01:24.659> put

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
from coming off you know you can't put

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.170 
from coming off you know you can't put
much<00:01:25.110> force<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.710> these<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.939> course

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
much force on these because of course

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.440 
much force on these because of course
they'll<00:01:27.420> break<00:01:28.549> so<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.579> just<00:01:29.880> put<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.210> bit

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
they'll break so I just put a little bit

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.230 
they'll break so I just put a little bit
of<00:01:30.509> force<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.290> lock<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:32.240> unless

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
of force there and lock that down unless

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.219 
of force there and lock that down unless
you<00:01:33.420> keep<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:37.020> then

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
you keep that from going off and then

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
you keep that from going off and then
I've<00:01:37.409> got<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.650> dremel<00:01:38.189> tool<00:01:38.400> here<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.880> carbide

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I've got a dremel tool here with carbide

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.130 
I've got a dremel tool here with carbide
face<00:01:39.840> inside<00:01:40.740> cutting<00:01:41.250> bit<00:01:41.659> i'll<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.960> turn

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
face inside cutting bit i'll just turn

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.060 
face inside cutting bit i'll just turn
this<00:01:43.350> on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.630 

dremel<00:01:49.070> tool<00:01:49.280> spends<00:01:49.909> this<00:01:50.690> direction<00:01:51.610> so<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
dremel tool spends this direction so I

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.490 
dremel tool spends this direction so I
want<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.119> lathe<00:01:53.299> spinning<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:53.990> the<00:01:54.080> opposite

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
want the lathe spinning in the opposite

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.210 
want the lathe spinning in the opposite
direction<00:01:54.650> I'm<00:01:55.190> wearing<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.549> p100<00:01:56.360> respirator

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.100 

normally<00:02:01.220> I<00:02:01.280> would<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:01.940> vet<00:02:02.330> on<00:02:02.570> behind

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
normally I would have this vet on behind

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.820 
normally I would have this vet on behind
the<00:02:03.259> lead<00:02:03.470> here<00:02:03.860> but<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.820> can<00:02:05.030> hear<00:02:05.270> me

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
the lead here but so you can hear me

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.440 
the lead here but so you can hear me
anyway<00:02:06.830> I'll<00:02:07.220> get<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.610> here<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:07.970> I'll<00:02:08.119> set

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
anyway I'll get it up here and I'll set

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.840 
anyway I'll get it up here and I'll set
it<00:02:08.479> against<00:02:08.869> this<00:02:09.050> tool<00:02:09.350> rest<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:10.550> steady

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
it against this tool rest to steady

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.090 
it against this tool rest to steady
myself<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.660> just<00:02:11.870> kind<00:02:12.080> of<00:02:12.140> go<00:02:12.290> across<00:02:12.590> and

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
myself and I just kind of go across and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:03:14.150 
myself and I just kind of go across and
don't<00:02:13.489> hit<00:02:13.760> your<00:02:14.030> chuck

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.360 

so<00:03:15.160> you'll<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:16.710> work<00:03:17.710> your<00:03:17.890> way<00:03:18.070> right<00:03:18.310> on

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370
