front<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:14.480> wrap<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.870> yarn<00:02:17.030> now<00:02:18.030> I'm<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.390> to

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
front to wrap the yarn now I'm going to

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.619 
front to wrap the yarn now I'm going to
slide<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:18.989> through<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.430> back<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.450> can

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
slide it through to the back so you can

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:24.890 
slide it through to the back so you can
see<00:02:21.870> we've<00:02:22.019> now<00:02:22.049> have<00:02:22.469> a<00:02:22.499> loop<00:02:23.689> sitting<00:02:24.689> on<00:02:24.870> our

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
see we've now have a loop sitting on our

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.740 
see we've now have a loop sitting on our
left<00:02:25.439> hand<00:02:25.709> needle

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
left hand needle

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.100 
left hand needle
then<00:02:26.930> we're<00:02:27.080> just<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.500> slide<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:28.310> old

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
then we're just going to slide the old

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.860 
then we're just going to slide the old
loop<00:02:30.110> up<00:02:30.380> and<00:02:30.770> off<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:31.790> we've<00:02:32.030> just<00:02:32.330> created<00:02:32.540> a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
loop up and off and we've just created a

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.550 
loop up and off and we've just created a
purl<00:02:33.140> stitch<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:34.070> resulting<00:02:34.670> purl<00:02:34.910> stitch<00:02:35.240> is

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
purl stitch the resulting purl stitch is

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.420 
purl stitch the resulting purl stitch is
identical<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:37.610> continental<00:02:38.480> no<00:02:38.870> difference

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
identical to a continental no difference

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.670 
identical to a continental no difference
so<00:02:40.430> now<00:02:40.610> we're<00:02:40.970> going<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.480> insert<00:02:41.870> from<00:02:42.200> left

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
so now we're going to insert from left

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.140 
so now we're going to insert from left
to<00:02:42.800> right<00:02:43.040> again<00:02:43.370> I'm<00:02:44.209> going<00:02:44.450> to<00:02:44.540> wrap<00:02:44.840> and<00:02:45.290> now

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to right again I'm going to wrap and now

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.820 
to right again I'm going to wrap and now
the<00:02:47.150> motion<00:02:47.360> can<00:02:47.690> actually<00:02:48.050> be<00:02:48.200> very<00:02:48.230> small

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the motion can actually be very small

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.470 
the motion can actually be very small
and<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> is<00:02:49.400> going<00:02:49.610> to<00:02:49.730> get<00:02:49.880> obscured<00:02:50.300> by<00:02:50.450> the

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
and it is going to get obscured by the

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.120 
and it is going to get obscured by the
camera<00:02:51.020> but<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> want<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.620> see<00:02:51.740> how<00:02:51.830> small

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
camera but I want you to see how small

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.920 
camera but I want you to see how small
that<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.400> be<00:02:52.550> one<00:02:53.090> I<00:02:55.090> came<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:56.300> with<00:02:56.330> the<00:02:56.570> same

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
that can be one I came up with the same

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.650 
that can be one I came up with the same
wrap<00:03:00.010> through<00:03:01.010> it<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.340> off<00:03:01.520> I'll<00:03:02.150> show<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.510> you

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
wrap through it and off I'll show it you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.110 
wrap through it and off I'll show it you
again<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.140> I<00:03:03.260> will<00:03:03.520> keep<00:03:04.520> the<00:03:04.730> motion<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
again and I will keep the motion a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.250 
again and I will keep the motion a
little<00:03:05.360> bigger<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.780> it<00:03:05.900> doesn't<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.320> obscured

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
little bigger so it doesn't get obscured

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.920 
little bigger so it doesn't get obscured
wrapping<00:03:09.260> around<00:03:09.970> I'm<00:03:10.970> sliding<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.720> yarn

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
wrapping around I'm sliding the yarn

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.530 
wrapping around I'm sliding the yarn
down<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.470> I'm<00:03:12.860> not<00:03:13.160> pulling<00:03:13.820> it<00:03:13.970> I'm<00:03:14.209> not

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
down and I'm not pulling it I'm not

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.850 
down and I'm not pulling it I'm not
making<00:03:14.959> the<00:03:15.110> wrap<00:03:15.560> tight<00:03:15.980> it's<00:03:16.670> a<00:03:16.880> loose<00:03:17.390> wrap

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
making the wrap tight it's a loose wrap

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.470 
making the wrap tight it's a loose wrap
whenever<00:03:18.860> we<00:03:19.070> make<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.550> stitch<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.150> want<00:03:20.390> to

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
whenever we make a stitch we want to

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.990 
whenever we make a stitch we want to
keep<00:03:20.660> our<00:03:20.930> wrap<00:03:21.200> loose<00:03:21.680> that<00:03:22.550> way<00:03:22.610> we're

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
keep our wrap loose that way we're

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.610 
keep our wrap loose that way we're
keeping<00:03:23.390> a<00:03:23.480> consistent<00:03:23.720> tension<00:03:24.230> I'm

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
keeping a consistent tension I'm

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.820 
keeping a consistent tension I'm
wrapping<00:03:27.280> through<00:03:28.280> to<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.670> back<00:03:29.350> slide<00:03:30.350> off

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:40.380 

one<00:03:34.810> two<00:03:37.000> three<00:03:38.920> four

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
one two three four

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.460 
one two three four
essentially<00:03:41.390> all<00:03:41.420> that's<00:03:41.720> happening<00:03:42.230> is<00:03:42.320> I'm

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
essentially all that's happening is I'm

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.140 
essentially all that's happening is I'm
making<00:03:42.830> a<00:03:43.010> rolling<00:03:43.640> motion<00:03:43.820> with<00:03:44.180> my<00:03:44.450> hand

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
making a rolling motion with my hand

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.870 
making a rolling motion with my hand
even<00:03:47.150> if<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.390> keep<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:47.900> bigger<00:03:48.410> notice<00:03:49.340> my<00:03:49.549> hand

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
even if I keep it bigger notice my hand

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.759 
even if I keep it bigger notice my hand
is<00:03:50.060> pretty<00:03:50.360> much<00:03:50.540> just<00:03:50.840> rolling<00:03:51.230> right<00:03:51.440> around

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
is pretty much just rolling right around

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.150 
is pretty much just rolling right around
so<00:03:52.640> when<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:52.820> keep<00:03:53.120> it<00:03:53.269> smaller<00:03:53.690> it's<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.860> same

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
so when I keep it smaller it's the same

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.199 
so when I keep it smaller it's the same
roll<00:03:56.290> but<00:03:57.290> for<00:03:57.530> terms<00:03:57.739> of<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:57.980> video<00:03:58.280> I<00:03:58.640> have

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
roll but for terms of the video I have

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.000 
roll but for terms of the video I have
to<00:03:59.360> keep<00:03:59.510> it<00:03:59.690> bigger<00:03:59.930> otherwise<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:00.739> can't

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
to keep it bigger otherwise you can't

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.580 
to keep it bigger otherwise you can't
see<00:04:01.250> anything<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:02.290> remember<00:04:03.290> that<00:04:03.440> when

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
see anything so remember that when

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.920 
see anything so remember that when
you're<00:04:03.769> making<00:04:03.920> your<00:04:04.160> stitch<00:04:04.670> your<00:04:05.390> roll<00:04:05.660> does

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
you're making your stitch your roll does

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.190 
you're making your stitch your roll does
not<00:04:06.260> have<00:04:06.500> to<00:04:06.680> be<00:04:06.950> so<00:04:07.880> pronounced<00:04:08.540> one<00:04:09.430> two

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
not have to be so pronounced one two

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.840 
not have to be so pronounced one two
three<00:04:12.200> and<00:04:12.799> four<00:04:13.610> and<00:04:14.019> that's<00:04:15.019> all<00:04:15.350> there<00:04:15.739> is

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
three and four and that's all there is

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.810 
three and four and that's all there is
to<00:04:16.850> making<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.390> purl<00:04:17.720> stitch<00:04:18.190> English<00:04:19.190> style<00:04:19.459> I
