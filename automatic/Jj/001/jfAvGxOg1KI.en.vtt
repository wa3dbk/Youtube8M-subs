here we are on the play mindcrack server

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.430 
here we are on the play mindcrack server
this<00:01:00.640> is<00:01:00.699> that's<00:01:01.390> where<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:01.690> spawn<00:01:02.050> right

can find goat simulator as we're
starting<00:01:32.200> off<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.399> world<00:01:33.780> has<00:01:34.780> been

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
starting off now this world has been

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.050 
starting off now this world has been
people<00:01:36.009> have<00:01:36.159> been<00:01:36.310> in<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:36.939> little

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
people have been in it for a little

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.910 
people have been in it for a little
while<00:01:37.149> so<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.049> has<00:01:38.229> been<00:01:38.439> a<00:01:38.469> little<00:01:38.740> bit

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
while so it has been a little bit

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.649 
while so it has been a little bit
destroyed<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.860> it's<00:01:42.070> reset<00:01:42.549> every<00:01:43.060> hour

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
destroyed but and it's reset every hour

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.050 
destroyed but and it's reset every hour
so<00:01:44.320> at<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.979> top<00:01:45.159> of<00:01:45.369> the<00:01:45.460> hour<00:01:45.579> I<00:01:45.729> guess

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
so at the top of the hour I guess

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.550 
so at the top of the hour I guess
something<00:01:46.390> like<00:01:46.509> that<00:01:46.689> or<00:01:46.899> maybe<00:01:47.170> not<00:01:47.380> who

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
something like that or maybe not who

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.950 
something like that or maybe not who
knows<00:01:47.590> it's<00:01:48.009> reset<00:01:48.460> about<00:01:48.640> every<00:01:48.880> hour<00:01:48.960> but

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
knows it's reset about every hour but

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.080 
knows it's reset about every hour but
the<00:01:50.049> best<00:01:50.170> way<00:01:50.350> to<00:01:50.380> experience<00:01:50.799> this<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.219> in<00:01:51.399> f5

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
the best way to experience this is in f5

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.209 
the best way to experience this is in f5
mode<00:01:52.360> because<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:52.899> can<00:01:53.049> see<00:01:53.259> that<00:01:53.500> you<00:01:53.710> are<00:01:53.950> a

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
mode because you can see that you are a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.160 
mode because you can see that you are a
goat<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.820> that<00:01:54.880> as<00:01:55.570> you<00:01:55.750> go<00:01:55.899> through<00:01:56.110> the
