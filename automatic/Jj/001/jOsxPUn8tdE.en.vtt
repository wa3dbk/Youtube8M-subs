00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.330
 and today we will talk about sram and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.040
 yes these assassins coming from march 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.660
 otherwise called bunch of bones in the 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.980
 dofus garden yeah I know it's not 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.810
 very elegant but it's a little bit true 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.730
 since always they have been known for 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.250
 quote on black robbers I remember 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.869
 still 29 scam his volley the icam to 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.370
 enemies it was pretty huge as an idea 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.880
 it's like the dates of the world j 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.500
 currently 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.030
 I wonder what it could 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.490
 look like cam tricks back then 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.930
 on youtube saleh everyone knows xx 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.460
 oars today a camac artist 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.830
 really I discovered this unpublished 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.080
 really subscribe to mach is unpublished 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.880
 it's super simple you make a tram 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.460
 and you make scams on your enemies 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.160
 to remove the kamas is very 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.500
 easy really factual 70 be air and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.660
 you want lots of kids around 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.430
 600 cases my part as has so here I am 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.700
 let's tell you how much it can 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.710
 give an a + and of course subscribe a 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.270
 not forward there were also the 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.560
 deadly critical strike attacks that 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.180
 was almost as powerful as the 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.100
 yop angry a lot of sram and that's 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.720
 there a chance in two to decapitate 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.340
 their enemies or there was not that it's 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.609
 also the double cheat to block 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.369
 all the enemies the dice besides aa 

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:23.200
 it was great fucking agent now 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.030
 pvp there are several styles of sram 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.859
 apart from their elements that vary 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.810
 between agility and strength a few 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.340
 times the intelligence their way of playing 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.170
 had totally different if one is 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.759
 like me there are some who play 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.409
 on erosion the big punching force 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.030
 at kathak mortals 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.950
 others try other traps of 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.880
 from time to time and else and ben they 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.859
 do not finish dead shoes 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.020
 black infinity bar we well 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:45.310
 less like that how's it going 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 I never know when it's going 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.100
 stop two countries think about it a max by 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.539
 turn is ultra relook especially that it is 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.679
 our displacements both 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.479
 seconds when this point a trap 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.729
 on my side I rather opted for 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.299
 the option to solve them trap me you 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.299
 shows the test 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.760
 on the other hand I wonder this 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.260
 would give what in real another trap where 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.060
 the agreement that the army launched 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.810
 ah yes a big network on manutan he 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.640
 be the owner 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.420
 my last season, it hurts 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.060
 that's it 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.130
 manu died poor manu otherwise there is the 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.959
 match up will be bad ram that is 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.040
 really relook the audience when 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.430
 she looks at the state well be done 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.010
 take a dump 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.680
 oulalala I think it bug not so 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.920
 just years rom view are ok this is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.269
 great as a fight that wants a merguez 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:48.540
 and let me see their fight instead 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:49.220
 like that 5 4 3 2 1 your jaws by have been 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 more strongly 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.800
 so you'll have understood sram's 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.190
 sram it's more like a cache 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.019
 hidden 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.450
 one who speak further swooning 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.860
 all these traps the maximum in pm I can 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.780
 not really good talking about it is a 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.340
 Less played classes even if that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 starts to grow with fridge this 3 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
 and some single hostage but at the level 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.470
 records leaves ram still had 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.150
 a lot of stuff 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.470
 the last ends terminator by 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.100
 example was won by a team with 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.489
 a tram the most dofus video is 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.350
 Yonne is a tram so he made 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.840
 dream more than one from elsewhere is also 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.269
 unity which is a tram that makes 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.829
 excellent editing or that's a lot 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.930
 beautiful world in women 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:30.500
 and remember the syringes are 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.500
 bad guys and 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:02.090
 nasty people are mean and go 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.090
 hurt a lot of people
