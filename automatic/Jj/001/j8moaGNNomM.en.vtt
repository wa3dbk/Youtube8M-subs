sure<00:02:15.520> but<00:02:16.030> she<00:02:16.300> wrote<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> little<00:02:16.660> note<00:02:16.750> just

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.160 
sure but she wrote a little note just
explaining<00:02:17.440> things<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:19.270> let's<00:02:19.930> see

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
explaining things and so let's see

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.280 
explaining things and so let's see
what's<00:02:20.349> in<00:02:20.470> here<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:20.890> guess<00:02:21.810> she<00:02:22.810> was<00:02:22.959> something

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
what's in here I guess she was something

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.610 
what's in here I guess she was something
hiding<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.830> here<00:02:24.180> I'm<00:02:25.180> guessing<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:25.810> paper

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
hiding in here I'm guessing this paper

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.690 
hiding in here I'm guessing this paper
is<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.130> keep<00:02:27.450> everything<00:02:28.450> from<00:02:28.840> moving<00:02:29.200> oh<00:02:29.380> I

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is to keep everything from moving oh I

think that was the yeah Michigan State

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.100 
think that was the yeah Michigan State
newspaper<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.920> nice<00:02:33.330> nice<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.569> state<00:02:34.840> news
