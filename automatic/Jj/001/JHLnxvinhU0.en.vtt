that<00:00:46.049> if<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.350> implemented<00:00:46.739> summoning

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
that if they implemented summoning

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.140 
that if they implemented summoning
sickness<00:00:47.250> antigua<00:00:47.760> they'd<00:00:47.909> have<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
sickness antigua they'd have to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.750 
sickness antigua they'd have to
restructure<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:48.780> entire<00:00:49.080> game<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.589> I<00:00:50.549> don't

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
restructure the entire game and I don't

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.619 
restructure the entire game and I don't
think<00:00:50.940> that's<00:00:51.089> something<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.449> lot<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
think that's something that a lot of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.299 
think that's something that a lot of
players<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.080> realized<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:52.949> if<00:00:53.220> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
players have realized because if you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.160 
players have realized because if you
look<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.549> magic<00:00:53.879> there<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.510> certain<00:00:54.809> monsters

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
look at magic there are certain monsters

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
look at magic there are certain monsters
that<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.500> haste<00:00:55.970> things<00:00:56.970> like<00:00:57.119> that<00:00:57.269> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
that have haste things like that the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.030 
that have haste things like that the
gain<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.659> ability<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:58.080> attack<00:00:58.290> they<00:00:58.920> would

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
gain the ability to attack they would

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.770 
gain the ability to attack they would
have<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.220> go<00:00:59.400> through<00:00:59.430> the<00:01:00.059> entire<00:01:00.150> previous

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
have to go through the entire previous

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.410 
have to go through the entire previous
Shugyo<00:01:01.379> database<00:01:02.369> of<00:01:02.519> scribes<00:01:02.729> and<00:01:02.909> they

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
Shugyo database of scribes and they

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.969 
Shugyo database of scribes and they
would<00:01:03.540> have<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.780> restructure<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.379> lot<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.680> older

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
would have to restructure a lot of older

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.700 
would have to restructure a lot of older
cards<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.580> haste<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> things<00:01:06.330> like<00:01:06.479> that

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
cards to have haste and things like that

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.780 
cards to have haste and things like that
totally<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.950> know<00:01:07.979> try<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> balance<00:01:08.490> things

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
totally you know try to balance things

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090 
totally you know try to balance things
up<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.780> think<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> would<00:01:10.320> necessarily<00:01:10.500> be

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
up and I think that would necessarily be

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.730 
up and I think that would necessarily be
bad<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.060> mean<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.810> could<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.170> little<00:01:13.290> turbo

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
bad I mean I could see little turbo

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.310 
bad I mean I could see little turbo
warrior<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.090> little<00:01:15.210> tune<00:01:15.510> guy<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.020> don't

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
warrior are the little tune guy I don't

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.660 
warrior are the little tune guy I don't
know<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.680> wheels<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.430> haste

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
know if it has wheels should have haste

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.190 
know if it has wheels should have haste
I'm<00:01:17.990> to<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> idea<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.570> thing<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:21.780> though

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
I'm to that idea but the thing is though

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.680 
I'm to that idea but the thing is though
I<00:01:22.550> think<00:01:23.550> people<00:01:23.760> are<00:01:23.940> missing<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:24.300> fact<00:01:24.510> of

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
I think people are missing the fact of

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.240 
I think people are missing the fact of
how<00:01:24.870> much<00:01:25.080> summoning<00:01:25.530> sickness<00:01:25.740> would<00:01:26.070> damage

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
how much summoning sickness would damage

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.190 
how much summoning sickness would damage
the<00:01:26.520> game<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:27.510> terms<00:01:27.660> of<00:01:27.810> happened<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the game in terms of happened to

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.320 
the game in terms of happened to
restructure<00:01:28.620> things<00:01:28.830> if<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.790> look<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.060> spell

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
restructure things if you look at spell

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.790 
restructure things if you look at spell
books<00:01:30.540> when<00:01:30.690> they<00:01:30.840> came<00:01:31.050> out<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.410> had<00:01:31.620> to<00:01:31.710> go

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
books when they came out we had to go

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.650 
books when they came out we had to go
through<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.610> fix<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.030> three<00:01:33.330> cards

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
through you know fix like three cards

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.710 
through you know fix like three cards
when<00:01:34.560> excavate<00:01:35.070> came<00:01:35.310> out<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:36.420> had<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.630> update

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
when excavate came out we had to update

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
when excavate came out we had to update
like<00:01:36.960> 30<00:01:37.620> cards<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> excavates<00:01:39.210> text<00:01:39.740> as

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
like 30 cards to have excavates text as

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.470 
like 30 cards to have excavates text as
opposed<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.370> know<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.760> being<00:01:42.060> its

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
opposed to you know it being its

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.180 
opposed to you know it being its
original<00:01:42.930> key<00:01:43.140> text<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.680> things<00:01:43.980> like<00:01:44.130> that

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
original key text and things like that

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.290 
original key text and things like that
and<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.690> know<00:01:45.840> 30<00:01:46.200> cards<00:01:47.130> isn't<00:01:47.280> really<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.820> lot

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
and you know 30 cards isn't really a lot

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.970 
and you know 30 cards isn't really a lot
but<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> mean<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.080> general<00:01:49.380> example<00:01:49.530> of

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980 
but I mean it's a general example of

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.399 
but I mean it's a general example of
what<00:01:50.130> would<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.400> to<00:01:50.430> happen<00:01:50.580> if<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:52.290> know

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
what would have to happen if you know

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.710 
what would have to happen if you know
haste<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.550> summoning<00:01:53.880> sickness<00:01:54.060> came<00:01:54.450> to
