what we had a chance to see is actually

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.400 
what we had a chance to see is actually
what<00:00:23.609> you're<00:00:23.730> seeing<00:00:23.939> now<00:00:24.230> emphasis<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.350> the

what you're seeing now emphasis on the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.109 
what you're seeing now emphasis on the
fact<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.800> it's<00:00:25.980> four<00:00:26.189> players<00:00:26.430> simultaneous

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119

action you can do two player local four
player<00:00:29.640> online<00:00:30.140> but<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> idea<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.619> all

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
player online but the idea is that all

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
player online but the idea is that all
four<00:00:32.099> turtles<00:00:32.340> are<00:00:32.669> very<00:00:33.030> much<00:00:33.149> present<00:00:33.540> are

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
four turtles are very much present are

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.240 
four turtles are very much present are
very<00:00:33.899> much<00:00:34.079> distinct<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.649> their<00:00:34.770> actions<00:00:34.950> and

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
very much distinct in their actions and

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.970 
very much distinct in their actions and
also<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:36.149> have<00:00:36.480> turtle<00:00:36.989> sort<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> combos

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
also actually have turtle sort of combos

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.080 
also actually have turtle sort of combos
that<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.489> together<00:00:38.610> which<00:00:38.969> we'll

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
that they can do together which we'll

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.150 
that they can do together which we'll
see<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.420> here<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.140> basically<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.950> gist

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
see in a bit here but basically the gist

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.069 
see in a bit here but basically the gist
is<00:00:41.340> each<00:00:41.910> Turtles<00:00:42.329> slightly<00:00:42.629> different<00:00:42.960> as

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
is each Turtles slightly different as

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
is each Turtles slightly different as
you<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.469> expect<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.040> Donny<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you would expect you know Donny is

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.330 
you would expect you know Donny is
slowest<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.390> has<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> biggest<00:00:45.870> range<00:00:46.260> leo<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
slowest but has the biggest range leo is

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.430 
slowest but has the biggest range leo is
a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.610> more<00:00:47.760> well<00:00:48.180> well<00:00:48.539> rounded<00:00:48.989> Raph<00:00:49.289> as

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
a little more well well rounded Raph as

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
a little more well well rounded Raph as
a<00:00:49.469> little<00:00:49.649> more<00:00:49.770> up<00:00:49.860> close<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.399> keys<00:00:50.579> weaker

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
a little more up close my keys weaker

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
a little more up close my keys weaker
but<00:00:51.149> quickest<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.870> sort<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.140> stuff<00:00:52.940> controls

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
but quickest that sort of stuff controls

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.700 
but quickest that sort of stuff controls
at<00:00:54.149> least<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.480> described<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.050> us<00:00:55.079> currently

old<00:01:27.810> school<00:01:28.080> movies<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.500> we<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:28.860> saw<00:01:29.009> I

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
old school movies to we actually saw I

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
old school movies to we actually saw I
think<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> couple<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.970> them<00:01:30.119> rolling<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.689> one

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
think a couple of them rolling at one

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.450 
think a couple of them rolling at one
point<00:01:31.110> doing<00:01:31.470> something<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:31.979> those<00:01:32.159> out

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
point doing something I think those out

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.039 
point doing something I think those out
of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.909> second<00:01:33.360> digit<00:01:33.630> or<00:01:33.689> there's<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> lot<00:01:34.020> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
of the second digit or there's a lot of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.060 
of the second digit or there's a lot of
stuff<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.439> right<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.890> foot

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
stuff like that right like the foot

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.560 
stuff like that right like the foot
design<00:01:35.400> some<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.939> an<00:01:36.000> extent<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.299> turtle

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
design some to an extent the turtle

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
design some to an extent the turtle
design<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.049> by<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> way<00:01:37.320> i<00:01:37.380> think<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
design which by the way i think in

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960 
design which by the way i think in
motion<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.100> look<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> lot<00:01:38.430> better<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:38.850> they

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
motion they look a lot better than they

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.490 
motion they look a lot better than they
did<00:01:39.030> in<00:01:39.119> screenshots<00:01:39.570> yeah<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.840> mean<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.259> sold

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
did in screenshots yeah I mean we sold

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.990 
did in screenshots yeah I mean we sold
some<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> those<00:01:40.890> early<00:01:41.130> shots<00:01:41.549> of<00:01:41.759> them<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
some of those early shots of them and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.370 
some of those early shots of them and
they<00:01:42.060> looked<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.479> really<00:01:42.689> awkward<00:01:43.229> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
they looked really really awkward and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020 
they looked really really awkward and
you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.770> one<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> things<00:01:44.130> that<00:01:44.369> we<00:01:44.670> asked

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
you know one of the things that we asked

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.240 
you know one of the things that we asked
the<00:01:45.479> developer<00:01:45.899> red<00:01:46.079> fly<00:01:46.290> was<00:01:46.560> like<00:01:46.710> why<00:01:46.920> did

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the developer red fly was like why did

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.980 
the developer red fly was like why did
they<00:01:47.399> look<00:01:47.610> strange<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.420> said<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.810> one

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
they look strange and they said they one

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.910 
they look strange and they said they one
of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> things<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.350> explained<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.770> that

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
of the things they explained was that

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.230 
of the things they explained was that
their<00:01:50.070> whole<00:01:50.310> facial<00:01:50.520> animation<00:01:51.060> system

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
their whole facial animation system

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
their whole facial animation system
hadn't<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:51.810> bama<00:01:51.990> now<00:01:52.140> you<00:01:52.470> can<00:01:52.590> see

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hadn't been in bama now you can see

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.719 
hadn't been in bama now you can see
they're<00:01:52.829> really<00:01:53.009> expressive<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.579> their

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
they're really expressive like their

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.160 
they're really expressive like their
eyes<00:01:53.850> go<00:01:54.240> completely<00:01:54.630> white<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
eyes go completely white like the

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.289 
eyes go completely white like the
turtles<00:01:56.100> cartoon<00:01:56.280> that's<00:01:56.670> ongoing<00:01:56.909> right<00:01:57.270> now

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
turtles cartoon that's ongoing right now

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.630 
turtles cartoon that's ongoing right now
yep<00:01:57.780> they<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.320> very<00:01:58.409> animated<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.280> had<00:01:59.369> like

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
yep they are very animated they had like

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
yep they are very animated they had like
really<00:01:59.670> expressive<00:02:00.360> faces<00:02:01.350> all<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.890> stuff

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
really expressive faces all that stuff

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.380 
really expressive faces all that stuff
and<00:02:02.280> that's<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.490> thing<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.149> is

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
and that's the thing is like so this is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
and that's the thing is like so this is
actually<00:02:03.479> based<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.290> Nickelodeon

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
actually based on the Nickelodeon

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
actually based on the Nickelodeon
cartoon<00:02:04.950> world<00:02:05.399> but<00:02:05.729> clearly<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.810> same

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
cartoon world but clearly not the same

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.990 
cartoon world but clearly not the same
visual<00:02:07.649> style<00:02:07.920> you'll<00:02:08.280> see<00:02:08.399> purple<00:02:08.580> dragons

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
visual style you'll see purple dragons

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.639 
visual style you'll see purple dragons
here<00:02:09.149> like<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> show<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.050> recently<00:02:10.410> hit<00:02:10.530> on

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
here like the show just recently hit on

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.380 
here like the show just recently hit on
that<00:02:10.709> there<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.190> hit<00:02:11.430> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.610> foot<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.030> I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
that there you hit on the foot and I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.790 
that there you hit on the foot and I
mean<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.660> that's<00:02:13.080> one<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.349> the<00:02:13.530> intro

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
mean so that's one of the intro

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.900 
mean so that's one of the intro
things<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.340> think<00:02:14.430> red<00:02:14.670> fly<00:02:14.850> is

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
things that I think red fly is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.340 
things that I think red fly is
attempting<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.570> is<00:02:15.660> they're<00:02:15.840> going<00:02:16.080> for<00:02:16.260> the

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
attempting here is they're going for the

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.950 
attempting here is they're going for the
Knicks<00:02:16.740> cartoon<00:02:17.250> licensed<00:02:18.090> world<00:02:18.450> but

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
Knicks cartoon licensed world but

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.480 
Knicks cartoon licensed world but
they're<00:02:19.410> designing<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.860> game<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.220> actually

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
they're designing this game to actually

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.570 
they're designing this game to actually
appeal<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.910> actually<00:02:21.570> gamers<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.140> us<00:02:22.650> who

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
appeal to actually gamers like us who

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.700 
appeal to actually gamers like us who
are<00:02:23.640> older<00:02:24.090> who<00:02:24.270> grew<00:02:24.450> up<00:02:24.510> with<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> Charles<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
are older who grew up with in Charles so

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:26.930 
are older who grew up with in Charles so
this<00:02:25.860> is<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.160> style<00:02:26.370> is<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> little<00:02:26.700> more

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
this is the style is a little more

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.190 
this is the style is a little more
sophisticated<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.750> gameplay<00:02:28.110> is

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
sophisticated and the gameplay is

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.510 
sophisticated and the gameplay is
supposed<00:02:28.410> to<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:28.620> more<00:02:28.770> sophisticated<00:02:29.220> change

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
supposed to be more sophisticated change

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.100 
supposed to be more sophisticated change
so<00:02:29.730> my<00:02:29.910> boy<00:02:30.030> graph<00:02:30.270> here<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:30.540> like<00:02:30.630> an<00:02:30.720> MMA

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
so my boy graph here is like an MMA

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.680 
so my boy graph here is like an MMA
fighter<00:02:31.320> just<00:02:31.760> brutalizing<00:02:32.760> dudes<00:02:33.000> exactly

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
fighter just brutalizing dudes exactly

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.960 
fighter just brutalizing dudes exactly
and<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.930> idea<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.470> you<00:02:35.070> know<00:02:35.340> control<00:02:35.820> is

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
and the idea is that you know control is

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.790 
and the idea is that you know control is
a<00:02:36.000> little<00:02:36.240> more<00:02:36.330> precise<00:02:36.810> you're<00:02:37.110> able<00:02:37.320> to<00:02:37.440> do

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
a little more precise you're able to do

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.740 
a little more precise you're able to do
more<00:02:38.070> specific<00:02:38.580> combos<00:02:39.030> more<00:02:39.300> specific

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
more specific combos more specific

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.600 
more specific combos more specific
actions<00:02:40.140> than<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:41.040> mashing<00:02:41.430> buttons

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
actions than just mashing buttons

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.610 
actions than just mashing buttons
although<00:02:42.120> presumably<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.170> do<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.410> too

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
although presumably you can do that too

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.050 
although presumably you can do that too
look<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.010> mean<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.280> didn't<00:02:44.460> get<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.640> play<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.940> as

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
look I mean we didn't get to play it as
