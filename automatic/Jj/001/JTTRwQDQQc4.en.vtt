00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello everyone with you steaks finally 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 back to mods review 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.519
 I haven't taken them off for quite a while, but I 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.910
 I am very glad that I will do it again and 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.130
 by the way please notice those old fashions on 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.840
 who did reviews they absolutely everything 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.520
 go to 0 david 009 1092 and so on then 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.590
 there are all the following versions 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.480
 so those who watch me for the first time 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.119
 be sure to check out these reviews 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.119
 Well today we have an overview of fashion and 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.759
 point it is pretty simple but useful 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.329
 to all those who constantly lose their home 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.610
 or text for those who like to travel 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.500
 generally 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 what you need to do to start set ourselves 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 mod and then left top of the screen 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.500
 w button appears 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.840
 we click on it and here we have 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.070
 close button show coordinates 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.469
 create a waypoint that is let 's go here 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.399
 Now let's go to our house we have a dog 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.159
 such an ordinary box is understandable here 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.640
 I did not really try and click on 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.090
 button w crate waypoint and now you need 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.680
 somehow call your his and point here 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.400
 new point seems to be translated as 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.150
 route or route point pancake cafe 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 who knows this no matter the general name the house 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.369
 just an ordinary Russian house works here 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.100
 tongue 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.710
 these are our coordinates ie those 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 coordinates that's where we stand here now and 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 look we have created this such point 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.020
 and now you just need to go somewhere 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.049
 shorter somewhere down now we 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.649
 I do not know well let's go he who and the sheep 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.860
 now come hi lamb and now 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.220
 press w and click on the house and 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 look from above we have such 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.930
 the arrow that she is on is a compass 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:02:01.350
 it seems in common it will show us 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.430
 how would we go where we go and here we are 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.530
 go on this arrow go go 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.420
 go in our house and here she starts in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.310
 overall spinning and that means that we both 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.440
 would come to the place where they put 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.560
 our and point 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.360
 that is, in general, we can remove it 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.760
 In general, here we press okay now 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.120
 the Japanese don't have this, that is, we never 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.310
 get lost we create this your point here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.320
 and somewhere I do not know behind the forest we go 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.930
 mine or somewhere I don't know 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.990
 here it is pressing if we like 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.380
 lost click on this w and just on 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.410
 we push this house but we can 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.730
 create some waypoints here 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:45.980
 for example, I donâ€™t know well near me 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.720
 already do not care how shorter in general near the house 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.390
 backwards 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:56.800
 here and let's not know here 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:03:00.140
 lamb where but somewhere and a beginner this egg 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:05.380
 Okay, here's the ladybug in the general type, here 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:08.950
 we stand near this box and create 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.950
 other you point 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.140
 so ok 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.510
 all we have are two in Japanese that is 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.850
 for example if we need to go home we push 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.430
 on near the house and 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.260
 that is, we can go there if 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.750
 we need cows we click on the cow 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.350
 and the arrow points to the box here 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.810
 there is also a pancake here to give it away 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:36.320
 here you can see our coordinates 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.330
 here they are happy somehow a little uncomfortable 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.340
 located because this button in order 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.820
 can't interfere in general here we have 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.930
 even the coordinates are as for the version so far 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:51.200
 Well, in general, but I have not forgotten exactly 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.269
 when we die then we automatically 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.920
 It is created in the Japanese, that is, that's how much 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:56.840
 once i already had when i was dying 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.140
 Me, I keep losing things they could not 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:03.290
 find and here if we die then arrow 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.269
 Immediately that is, that's when we flow 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.239
 appeared in the world here that we have when 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.920
 haven't slept in bed yet 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:16.459
 because if we die this arrow 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.530
 general will point that way to our 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.410
 of things 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:24.730
 Kapets that I generally carry shorter I think 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.530
 you understand what I mean as something 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:30.130
 unusually generally review mod shoot 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.790
 so much did not shoot hello doggy like 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.760
 you are doing so shorter take these 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.830
 coordinates in general it's just 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.220
 great mod especially thats how he 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.139
 The developer came up with this arrow 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.680
 still on spinning how he did it at all 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:51.460
 incomprehensible but it's just awesome just 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.120
 super so be sure to download everything 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.280
 in the archive in the description and how to install there 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.800
 Also, everything in the description is shorter. 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.850
 description if I leave a link but 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.450

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:08.830
 of my old reviews that's how fast I am 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.720
