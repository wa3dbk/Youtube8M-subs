00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.430
 ah 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.170
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.990
 I am mister daniel barrios and I was 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.000
 1,024 and as we promised this is 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.660
 our first video on theories of the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.699
 legend of zelda now yes we start in 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.860
 this time we will talk about one of the 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.320
 most mysterious and dismal games of 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.380
 the whole saga the legend of zelda 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.540
 majora's mask 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.850
 The story behind this game is 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.100
 uncertain the only thing we know is what 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.260
 it is said in the forums as for example 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.300
 that shigeru miyamoto the creator of the 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.010
 saga wanted to perform a horror game 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.750
 that was able to overcome the 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.760
 residents bolt which would not be 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.550
 approved by managers because their 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.590
 market was mainly childish but 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.960
 Siguero time soon came up with the idea 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.490
 of majora's mask where he captured many of 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.210
 the ideas of that game that was not 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.210
 accepted 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.180
 finished a town an illusion in the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.370
 depths of the lost forest is said 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.160
 that there is a path that leads to a 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.260
 alternate world is currently being discussed 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.600
 about if it ends is a real world a 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.360
 parallel world a region that is not in 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.400
 no map or a dream of the inc in what 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.400
 staff we do not agree with this 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.170
 last theory in my opinion I think it's 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.120
 a world alternate to jairo law that is 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
 directly related to the kingdom 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.100
 twilight but that will comment more 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.650
 further on I on the other hand I think it's 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.360
 a region not mapped and even 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:55.150
 I think it appears in later games 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.670
 hey by the way you already let go to I knew 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.970
 better yet I hired her as our 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.580
 helper and that so that with us is 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.370
 enough because it 's beautiful 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.220
 because since and how did you do it for 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:12.200
 convince her I told her that I would set her free 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.440
 if he agreed to come once a week to 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.240
 help us with the videos like this is no longer 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.240
 I'm left with another if I wanted to get out of that 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.750
 good closet because you do not continue with 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.780
 our theory our theory remembers 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:31.000
 that I have my own theory, my 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.000
 theory because then the diva gets angry 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.739
 it is said that the construction of the tower 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.930
 of stone was built with the purpose 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.900
 that the terms could reach the 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.640
 sacred kingdom to take the trifuerza 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.290
 for this the goddesses threw their arrows 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.659
 of light to activate the world upside down 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 making the tower go to the 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.189
 Underworld where they found the mask 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.799
 of greater but what would happen if there 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.019
 the town's punishment would have ended 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.120
 was sentenced to be destroyed as punishment 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.099
 but for what reason the goddesses 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.829
 they would have sent directly to where I was 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.810
 the most mask thanks to link this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.180
 was avoided and the goddesses having failed 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.549
 destroy the entire kingdom they cursed 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.500
 depriving them of the light for this I hold 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.299
 the theory that it ends became 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.489
 the twilight kingdom and could explain 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.859
 the resemblance to the mask of most and 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.019
 the leftover cast something that opposes 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.090
 this is that you see at the end of the game at 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.250
 happy masks seller is to take 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.379
 the biggest mask now we do not know what 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.709
 happened to him and it's very likely that he 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.739
 they could steal again besides me 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.480
 I differ for another reason the leftover 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:38.700
 it is controllable and to some extent 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.890
 answer only to me one 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.110
 on the other hand the mask of majority possesses and 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.870
 consumes everyone who uses it so 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.599
 whether they were the same measure would be 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.580
 consumed by the mask but it is not 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:52.709
 exactly the same mask because at 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.840
 end of older ones is destroyed to the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:56.430
 incarnation of greater to therefore is 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.840
 less dangerous 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.730
 besides mirna does not control it 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.800
 completely because by gathering the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.660
 pieces of the molten leftover it seems that 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.819
 loses control when it destroys 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.650
 shield that protects the castle and so 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.170
 himself loses power and loses when fighting 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.450
 against ganondorf but as the 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.459
 video title these are just theories 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.530
 can not be verified or denied 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.299
 totally until I follow do not go back to 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.700
 talk about ends up in some game 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.070
 later as you want to see in your 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.960
 comments opinions or send us a 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.360
 message arguing their pros and their 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.729
 cons on the theory also if you 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.889
 liked the video remember to visit our 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:33.960
 channel next week and if so what 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.630
 they want to recommend the video to their 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.120
 friends by the way my theory about 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.850
 ends will be explained next week 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.440
 goodbye Mr. Daniel neighborhood and heras 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.470
 min 24 up 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:49.190
 next one takes care that the trifuerza 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.190
 accompany
