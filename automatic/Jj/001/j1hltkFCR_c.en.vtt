use the following IP address now I feel

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.089 
use the following IP address now I feel
is<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:18.019> ipv4

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
is the ipv4

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:28.870 
is the ipv4
so<00:02:26.140> I'm<00:02:27.140> trying<00:02:27.319> inside<00:02:27.739> was<00:02:27.920> ups<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.340> see<00:02:28.549> it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
so I'm trying inside was ups to see it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.390 
so I'm trying inside was ups to see it
Oh<00:02:32.590> 192.168<00:02:34.750> 0<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:36.200> then<00:02:36.530> this<00:02:36.860> last<00:02:37.040> number

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
Oh 192.168 0 and then this last number

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.350 
Oh 192.168 0 and then this last number
can<00:02:37.910> be<00:02:37.940> anything<00:02:38.360> so<00:02:38.660> for<00:02:39.560> example<00:02:39.950> one<00:02:40.069> could

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
can be anything so for example one could

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.539 
can be anything so for example one could
assume<00:02:41.360> that<00:02:41.390> map<00:02:41.780> subnet<00:02:42.709> mask<00:02:42.980> just<00:02:43.310> click

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
assume that map subnet mask just click

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.140 
assume that map subnet mask just click
your<00:02:44.420> default<00:02:44.780> gateway<00:02:45.340> right<00:02:46.400> what<00:02:46.940> should

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
your default gateway right what should

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.650 
your default gateway right what should
