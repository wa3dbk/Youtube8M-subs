00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
wheel is we move that pin out a half

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.559 
wheel is we move that pin out a half
inch<00:02:31.510> further<00:02:32.019> away<00:02:32.349> I<00:02:32.910> say<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> half<00:02:34.299> inch

foot now you've pre relaxed it that's
much<00:03:20.950> better<00:03:21.190> than<00:03:21.340> putting<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.030> hot<00:03:22.239> water

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560

then put your PVC in there now then you

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.150 
then put your PVC in there now then you
still<00:03:49.000> have<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.359> stress<00:03:49.750> this<00:03:49.780> on<00:03:50.290> but<00:03:50.980> it's

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
still have to stress this on but it's

still have to stress this on but it's
going<00:03:51.370> to<00:03:51.430> be<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.609> lot<00:03:51.970> easier<00:03:52.239> stretching<00:03:53.200> it

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
going to be a lot easier stretching it

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.009 
going to be a lot easier stretching it
when<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.980> allow<00:03:54.190> that<00:03:54.250> wheel<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.630> do<00:03:55.840> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
when you allow that wheel to do the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.409 
when you allow that wheel to do the
realest<00:03:56.380> pression<00:03:56.950> for<00:03:57.250> you<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:58.060> go<00:03:58.299> ahead

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
realest pression for you just go ahead

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.890

and keep running around like this and as
you<00:04:02.200> do<00:04:02.379> make<00:04:02.859> sure<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.160> bring<00:04:03.549> that<00:04:03.760> your

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
you do make sure you bring that your

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.009 
you do make sure you bring that your

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
in the back urethane I said it doesn't

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.449 
in the back urethane I said it doesn't
have<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.790> good<00:04:13.060> memory<00:04:13.290> well<00:04:14.290> if<00:04:14.980> you<00:04:15.220> just

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459

pause here for a moment it'll be a lot

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:18.750 
pause here for a moment it'll be a lot
easier

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
easier

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.450 
easier

things tires now I'm going to tell you
one<00:04:35.140> other<00:04:35.320> thing<00:04:35.470> leave<00:04:36.100> that<00:04:36.340> in<00:04:36.550> there<00:04:36.820> you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
one other thing leave that in there you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.530 
one other thing leave that in there you
know<00:04:37.810> when<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.140> stretched<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.890> on<00:04:39.100> I<00:04:39.490> was<00:04:40.270> really

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
know when I stretched it on I was really

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.050 
know when I stretched it on I was really
stretching<00:04:41.380> it<00:04:41.530> a<00:04:41.650> lot<00:04:41.860> more<00:04:42.250> on<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.730> last

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
stretching it a lot more on that last

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.430 
stretching it a lot more on that last
half<00:04:43.840> so<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:45.100> section<00:04:45.880> has<00:04:46.240> been<00:04:46.290> what<00:04:47.290> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
half so that section has been what you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.820 
half so that section has been what you
might<00:04:47.470> say<00:04:47.950> localized<00:04:48.720> stretched<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:50.590> going

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
might say localized stretched it's going

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.800 
might say localized stretched it's going
to<00:04:50.890> be<00:04:51.010> stretched<00:04:51.430> little<00:04:51.760> more<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.420> what<00:04:52.630> we

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
to be stretched little more so what we

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.410 
to be stretched little more so what we
have<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.230> here<00:04:53.560> is<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.250> ability<00:04:54.520> to<00:04:54.820> take<00:04:55.150> and

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
have on here is the ability to take and

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.200 
have on here is the ability to take and
run<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:56.230> around<00:04:56.560> like<00:04:56.800> this<00:04:57.130> or<00:04:57.850> you<00:04:58.090> can

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
run that around like this or you can

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.670 
run that around like this or you can
just<00:04:58.390> put<00:04:58.690> like<00:04:58.840> this<00:04:59.050> right<00:04:59.320> here<00:04:59.530> what

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
just put like this right here what

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.770 
just put like this right here what
that's<00:04:59.890> going<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.250> do<00:05:00.520> is<00:05:01.060> that's<00:05:01.360> going<00:05:01.660> to

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
that's going to do is that's going to

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.200 
that's going to do is that's going to
equalize<00:05:02.470> the<00:05:02.500> stretch<00:05:03.160> all<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.520> way<00:05:03.790> around

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
equalize the stretch all the way around

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:12.690 
equalize the stretch all the way around
the<00:05:04.360> tire<00:05:05.400> now<00:05:06.400> then<00:05:06.730> that<00:05:10.890> that<00:05:11.890> last<00:05:12.220> thing<00:05:12.580> I

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 
the tire now then that that last thing I
