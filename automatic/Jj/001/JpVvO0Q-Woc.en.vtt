00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
absinthe you see when absinthe is

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.740 
absinthe you see when absinthe is
distilled<00:01:01.469> there<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.579> comes<00:01:02.879> out<00:01:03.090> clear<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
distilled there it comes out clear and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.630 
distilled there it comes out clear and
then<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> final<00:01:04.290> coloring<00:01:05.010> process

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
herbs into the absinthe and let it soak

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.690 
herbs into the absinthe and let it soak
there<00:01:10.470> that's<00:01:10.860> what<00:01:11.070> gives<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> its

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
there that's what gives it its

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.490 
there that's what gives it its
distinctive<00:01:12.299> color<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> also<00:01:12.869> changes<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
white opaque color like this that luging

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.680 
white opaque color like this that luging
happens<00:01:53.500> when<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.220> oils<00:01:54.760> inside<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.600> the
