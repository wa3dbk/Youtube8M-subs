for a DC brushless motor it's actually a

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.959 
for a DC brushless motor it's actually a
three-phase<00:00:13.340> motor<00:00:14.340> even<00:00:14.730> though<00:00:14.820> it's

three-phase motor even though it's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.680 
three-phase motor even though it's
called<00:00:15.330> DC<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:17.070> we're<00:00:17.520> looking<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.150> the

probe attached to it it's been
compensated<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.609> frequency<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:31.080> we're<00:00:31.199> going

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
compensated for frequency so we're going

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.650 
compensated for frequency so we're going
to<00:00:31.349> start<00:00:31.619> right<00:00:32.009> now<00:00:32.189> there's<00:00:32.460> no<00:00:32.940> RPM<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
to start right now there's no RPM on the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.450 
to start right now there's no RPM on the
motor<00:00:33.870> you're<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.739> hear<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.010> start<00:00:35.309> up

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.060 
motor you're going to hear it start up
here<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.329> see<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.930> waveform<00:00:37.410> is

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
here you can see the waveform is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.979 
here you can see the waveform is
essentially<00:00:38.760> peak<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.180> peak<00:00:39.210> equal<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
essentially peak to peak equal to the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.049 
essentially peak to peak equal to the
battery<00:00:40.559> voltage<00:00:40.649> which<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.370> this<00:00:41.489> case<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
battery voltage which in this case is a

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.139 
battery voltage which in this case is a
two<00:00:42.420> cell<00:00:42.719> lithium<00:00:43.620> polymer<00:00:44.070> so<00:00:44.760> that's<00:00:44.969> at

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
two cell lithium polymer so that's at

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.139 
two cell lithium polymer so that's at
seven<00:00:45.450> point<00:00:45.660> four<00:00:45.989> volts<00:00:46.760> what<00:00:47.760> you'll<00:00:47.910> see

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
seven point four volts what you'll see

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
seven point four volts what you'll see
here<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.629> moment<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:50.340> output

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
here in a moment is that the output

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.930 
here in a moment is that the output
waveform<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> phases<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> combination

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
waveform for the phases is a combination

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.889 
waveform for the phases is a combination
of<00:00:53.969> a<00:00:54.539> frequency<00:00:55.850> modulation<00:00:56.850> as<00:00:57.300> well<00:00:57.629> as<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of a frequency modulation as well as a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.349 
of a frequency modulation as well as a
pulse<00:00:58.410> width<00:00:58.649> modulation<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.699> waveform

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
pulse width modulation the waveform

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.319 
pulse width modulation the waveform
you're<00:01:00.539> seeing<00:01:00.809> now<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:02.430> made<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.059> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
you're seeing now is actually made up of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.450 
you're seeing now is actually made up of
the<00:01:03.449> series<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:05.030> square<00:01:06.030> waves<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:07.010> as<00:01:08.010> this

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the series of square waves and as this

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.780 
the series of square waves and as this
motor<00:01:09.150> speed<00:01:09.930> increases<00:01:10.710> we'll<00:01:10.979> be<00:01:11.520> able<00:01:11.700> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
motor speed increases we'll be able to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.700 
motor speed increases we'll be able to
we<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> zoom<00:01:12.479> out<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.200> take<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> look<00:01:13.470> at

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we can zoom out there and take a look at

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.870 
we can zoom out there and take a look at
those<00:01:13.830> individual<00:01:14.520> pulses

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.130 

synched<00:01:18.880> up<00:01:18.970> now<00:01:19.210> that's<00:01:19.480> getting<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.990> little

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
synched up now that's getting a little

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.490 
synched up now that's getting a little
more<00:01:20.350> clear<00:01:21.000> right<00:01:22.000> now<00:01:22.030> just<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.290> reference

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
more clear right now just for reference

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.240 
more clear right now just for reference
there's<00:01:24.490> one<00:01:24.790> millisecond<00:01:25.570> per<00:01:26.470> division<00:01:26.800> and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
there's one millisecond per division and

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.570 
there's one millisecond per division and
you're<00:01:27.910> seeing<00:01:28.210> one<00:01:28.750> two<00:01:29.200> three<00:01:30.010> little<00:01:30.400> less

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
you're seeing one two three little less

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.450 
you're seeing one two three little less
than<00:01:30.820> three<00:01:31.090> milliseconds<00:01:32.130> total<00:01:33.130> peak<00:01:33.310> to

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
than three milliseconds total peak to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.430 
than three milliseconds total peak to
peak<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.880> can<00:01:34.090> see<00:01:34.270> is<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:34.690> motor<00:01:35.020> speed

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
peak you can see is the motor speed

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.620 
peak you can see is the motor speed
increases<00:01:36.160> that<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.460> frequency<00:01:37.030> output<00:01:37.510> of

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
increases that the frequency output of

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.830 
increases that the frequency output of
the<00:01:37.720> controller<00:01:37.900> also<00:01:38.650> increases<00:01:39.430> for<00:01:40.210> it<00:01:40.270> for

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
the controller also increases for it for

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.070 
the controller also increases for it for
at<00:01:40.960> full<00:01:41.200> speed<00:01:41.560> there<00:01:42.600> I'm<00:01:43.600> going<00:01:43.750> to<00:01:43.810> crank

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
at full speed there I'm going to crank

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.950 
at full speed there I'm going to crank
this<00:01:44.290> out<00:01:44.530> there's<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:45.010> half<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.960> millisecond

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
this out there's a half a millisecond

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.570 
this out there's a half a millisecond
per<00:01:47.110> division<00:01:47.380> or<00:01:48.040> five<00:01:48.400> hundred

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
per division or five hundred

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.060 
per division or five hundred
microseconds<00:01:49.390> per<00:01:49.450> division<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:50.680> we're<00:01:50.979> at

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
microseconds per division so we're at

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.380 
microseconds per division so we're at
one<00:01:51.369> two<00:01:51.850> right<00:01:52.090> at<00:01:52.300> two<00:01:53.130> milliseconds<00:01:54.390> go

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
one two right at two milliseconds go

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.300 
one two right at two milliseconds go
ahead<00:01:55.600> and<00:01:55.720> slow<00:01:55.990> it<00:01:56.020> down<00:01:56.140> so<00:01:56.560> we<00:01:56.590> don't<00:01:56.710> burn

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
ahead and slow it down so we don't burn

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.130 
ahead and slow it down so we don't burn
things<00:01:57.640> up<00:01:57.880> here<00:01:58.150> I'm<00:01:58.540> going<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.750> crank<00:01:58.960> this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
things up here I'm going to crank this

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.730 
things up here I'm going to crank this
out<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.650> you<00:01:59.680> can<00:01:59.979> see<00:02:00.220> these<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:02.080> modulated

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
out so you can see these the modulated

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.400 
out so you can see these the modulated
pulse<00:02:02.770> widths<00:02:03.550> on<00:02:04.300> here

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.390 

if<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.250> can<00:02:09.430> get<00:02:09.910> a<00:02:09.940> good<00:02:10.180> display

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.150 

it's<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:14.150> complicated<00:02:14.989> waveform<00:02:15.890> as<00:02:16.069> you

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
it's a very complicated waveform as you

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.220 
it's a very complicated waveform as you
can<00:02:16.340> see<00:02:16.610> and<00:02:17.360> slow<00:02:17.630> this<00:02:17.810> down<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:18.110> little<00:02:18.410> bit

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.420 

okay

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
okay

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.890 
okay
so<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> can<00:02:24.360> see<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.720> aliasing<00:02:25.470> going<00:02:26.129> on

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
so you can see the aliasing going on

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.500 
so you can see the aliasing going on
inside<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:29.269> pulses<00:02:30.299> all<00:02:30.750> right

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
inside the pulses all right

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.050 
inside the pulses all right
that's<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.260> word<00:02:33.500> 50<00:02:34.010> microseconds<00:02:34.879> per

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
that's the word 50 microseconds per

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.570 
that's the word 50 microseconds per
division<00:02:35.360> there<00:02:36.170> so<00:02:37.040> you've<00:02:37.220> seen<00:02:37.430> about

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
division there so you've seen about

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.710 
division there so you've seen about
eighty<00:02:37.970> microseconds<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.799> pulse<00:02:40.099> period

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
eighty microseconds is the pulse period

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.539 
eighty microseconds is the pulse period
on<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.870> waveform<00:02:42.080> I'm<00:02:42.980> gonna<00:02:43.129> go<00:02:43.310> ahead<00:02:43.400> and

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
on the waveform I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.750 
on the waveform I'm gonna go ahead and
vary<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.090> frequency<00:02:44.239> you<00:02:44.720> can<00:02:44.900> see<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.290> pulse

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
vary the frequency you can see the pulse

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.610 
vary the frequency you can see the pulse
width<00:02:46.760> increasing<00:02:47.569> while<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.989> period<00:02:48.440> is

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
width increasing while the period is

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.320 
width increasing while the period is
staying<00:02:49.069> roughly<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.730> same<00:02:49.970> there's<00:02:50.299> a

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
staying roughly the same there's a

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.640 
staying roughly the same there's a
little<00:02:50.540> bit<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.750> shift<00:02:50.959> in<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.260> display

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
little bit of shift in the display

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.509 
little bit of shift in the display
because<00:02:52.099> the<00:02:52.540> sync<00:02:53.540> on<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:54.340> display<00:02:55.340> is

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
because the sync on the display is

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:01.509 
because the sync on the display is
changing<00:02:56.620> but<00:02:58.870> you<00:03:00.010> can<00:03:01.010> see<00:03:01.250> there's<00:03:01.459> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
changing but you can see there's a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.190 
changing but you can see there's a
pretty<00:03:01.790> good<00:03:02.030> capture<00:03:02.510> of<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:02.720> that's<00:03:02.900> a<00:03:02.930> very

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
pretty good capture of it that's a very

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.930 
pretty good capture of it that's a very
low<00:03:03.440> speed<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:04.190> you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.459> see<00:03:04.640> it's<00:03:04.790> got<00:03:04.910> a

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
low speed here you can see it's got a

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.420 
low speed here you can see it's got a
kind<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.269> a<00:03:05.360> step<00:03:05.629> but<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.989> can<00:03:06.170> watch<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
kind of a step but you can watch the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.759 
kind of a step but you can watch the
overall<00:03:07.940> pulse<00:03:08.510> width<00:03:08.810> increasing<00:03:09.560> as<00:03:09.739> the

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
overall pulse width increasing as the

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.410 
overall pulse width increasing as the
speed<00:03:10.870> increases<00:03:11.870> and<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.290> you<00:03:12.410> go<00:03:12.530> back

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
speed increases and as you go back

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.080 
speed increases and as you go back
towards<00:03:14.420> zero<00:03:14.980> rpm<00:03:15.980> there's<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.730> a<00:03:16.849> very

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
towards zero rpm there's just a very

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.339 
towards zero rpm there's just a very
very<00:03:17.450> slight<00:03:17.930> pulse<00:03:18.379> width<00:03:19.480> okay<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.170> that's

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
very slight pulse width okay so that's

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.559 
very slight pulse width okay so that's
it<00:03:21.500> I'm<00:03:21.620> going<00:03:21.739> to<00:03:21.769> turn<00:03:21.920> it<00:03:22.099> off<00:03:22.280> now<00:03:22.549> and<00:03:23.390> I'll

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
it I'm going to turn it off now and I'll

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:26.559 
it I'm going to turn it off now and I'll
turn<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.290> overhead<00:03:24.410> light<00:03:24.980> and<00:03:25.370> I'll<00:03:25.579> show

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
turn on the overhead light and I'll show

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.039 
turn on the overhead light and I'll show
you<00:03:26.599> what<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.590> setup<00:03:27.859> looks<00:03:28.280> here<00:03:28.930> looks<00:03:29.930> like

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
you what the setup looks here looks like

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.140 
you what the setup looks here looks like
there<00:03:33.049> we<00:03:33.170> are<00:03:33.200> that's<00:03:34.069> just<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.670> two<00:03:34.849> cell

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
there we are that's just the two cell

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
focusing very well and there we just

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:49.240 
focusing very well and there we just
have<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:46.069> couple<00:03:46.519> of<00:03:46.669> test<00:03:47.150> leads<00:03:47.739> patched<00:03:48.739> into
