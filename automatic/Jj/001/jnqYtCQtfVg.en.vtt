00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.620
 to turn this right here is 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.900
 it turned around just in front of the barricade 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.470
 we turned up there a few 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.260
 too many 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.850
 and yes I have to say that's alright 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.850
 really fun when we play the pc 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.920
 beautiful 1080p cape the church 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 real friends that was really cool me 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.530
 hope that's the same on the console 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.830
 looks reasonably but I think 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 beautiful 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.400
 that has already hinspiel com end of october 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.950
 out I buy one hundred percent 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.709
 friends really really 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.549
 got really good and he was there 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.030
 I do not really praise anymore 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.680
 pronounce and return to mode 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.019
 Here you see, I'm still here 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 in the middle of it was no water 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.920
 car could so through and the whole thing 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.300
 if you are now 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.160
 the police has deposed at this time 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.020
 then the whole look widens her 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.790
 also the same time , the time is upside down 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.200
 let's get four more minutes 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.500
 and there you can go on and you 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.860
 look for this tank down one 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.510
 moment I wanted to just that again 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.350
 tooth status shows exactly that et een is 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.900
 currently on 4 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.630
 There are a maximum of six driving steps and me 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 I think I know 5 but I do not know 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.700
 I think that's where they come from 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.010
 helicopter for use 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.580
 and then it will not let go 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.410
 circles of friends and say yes to everyone 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.489
 case that makes the graphic friends is 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.130
 the absolute bomb 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.209
 you drive you drive just every bite 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.430
 then already in the tunnel 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 you're in the game for me 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.950
 really cool 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.739
 that's super cool and now you see that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 straight from high culture it cool down 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.519
 which means I am the police now in 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.110
 come and sit here on the top left 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.330
 the whole expands plus 4 minutes 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.019
 and you go on I have it 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:28.980
 canceled 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.110
 I want something different again 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.940
 show it looks like it looks 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.019
 with the vehicle change sees 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.019
 as follows 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.820
 you see or are on the often 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.290
 you will find hidden cars all over the match 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.070
 like this one is just around here 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.630
 with the sign 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.579
 then you can simply press y to 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.440
 example on the xbox and then you can 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.959
 get in the car and drive off 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.090
 a really good thing really fine 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.269
 I did not do that now I was 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.829
 again briefly by the thank you new 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:58.530
 paint pick up here yellow I think 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:01.550
 Exactly and now I am calm 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.550
 and what's next 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.120
 yes friends seen now 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.350
 before every race finds neck or 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.550
 I also find an intro shown 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.860
 cool because you can be such a 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.040
 mentally run bit ever to 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.020
 to adjust 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.020
 So I felt that now 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.330
 So it runs when the race 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.800
 the minimap and left or one displayed 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.480
 can of course also press start and 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.600
 then on web then you can see that too 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.240
 and then you go there it is thus 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.350
 check water is displayed then 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.229
 what a race 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.830
 whether it is simple means one learns 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:01.919
 simply there 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.440
 then you press lte and lte was that 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.060
 now also xbox controller expresses you 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.979
 a bit longer at the same time 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.530
 There he makes a bit of gas here 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.200
 karre and then be jumped into the 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.850
 race the intro runs off you can 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.410
 I should prepare mentally for it 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.790
 Therefore to find as said and then 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.350
 it starts as well as here 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:21.960
 We're driving here visibly 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.460
 change as far as I know and yes the opponents 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.590
 But they were not that easy so that has to be 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.789
 I also say I have a medium race 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.070
 I think I drove or on 

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:31.590
 stage means joy the goods are already quite 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.390
 pretty aggressive the guys and I think 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.210
 well really have to say when 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.070
 only point of criticism not now 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.400
 with respect to this run but 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.590
 the general point of criticism is little bit less 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.390
 So cars are generally the 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.460
 Traffic is really low 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.900
 I do not know if you can do that now 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.340
 in the options can adjust 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.380
 That's what you think a need for 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:56.610
 speed part could stop traffic 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.460
 on their how little medium and many that 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.580
 yes that is still a bit 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.560
 noticed 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:06.030
 but otherwise there is nothing to complain about 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.400
 friends play the game smoothly like ariel one 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.289

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.880
 Ariane gives you with carol 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:16.080

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.409
 said you can then there are 50 53 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.899
 cars 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.649
 the whole map on the whole web 

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:22.629
 are hidden 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:24.879
 and the first would have to find girlfriend 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:27.189
