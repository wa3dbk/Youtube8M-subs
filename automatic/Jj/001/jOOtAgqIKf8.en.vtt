staff chat plugin that i have on my

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
server so basically there's only one

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.600 
server so basically there's only one
command<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> there's<00:00:56.160> nothing<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.489> really

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
command so there's nothing you really

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.299 
command so there's nothing you really
need<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.030> worry<00:00:57.180> about<00:00:57.270> it's<00:00:57.539> really<00:00:57.809> simple

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
need to worry about it's really simple

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.619 
need to worry about it's really simple
basically<00:00:59.309> you're<00:00:59.879> gonna<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.329> plug-in

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
basically you're gonna want this plug-in

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.049 
basically you're gonna want this plug-in
if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.289> have<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:02.070> decent<00:01:02.820> amount<00:01:02.910> of

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
if you have like a decent amount of

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.660 
if you have like a decent amount of
people<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.480> your<00:01:03.570> staff<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:05.010> want<00:01:05.189> them

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
people on your staff and you want them

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.070 
people on your staff and you want them
to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.970> able<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.240> talk<00:01:06.420> without<00:01:06.630> having<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> all

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
to be able to talk without having to all

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.460 
to be able to talk without having to all
message<00:01:07.470> each<00:01:07.619> other<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.490> big<00:01:08.700> cluster

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
message each other and one big cluster

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.050 
message each other and one big cluster
so<00:01:10.470> basically<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:10.979> like<00:01:11.040> an<00:01:11.189> alternate<00:01:11.670> chat

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
so basically it's like an alternate chat

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
so basically it's like an alternate chat
that<00:01:12.270> only<00:01:12.890> specified<00:01:13.890> groups<00:01:14.430> or<00:01:14.760> players

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
that only specified groups or players

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
that only specified groups or players
can<00:01:15.600> see<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:18.439> basically<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.799> works

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
can see so basically the way this works

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.160 
can see so basically the way this works
is<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.340> gonna<00:01:20.430> go<00:01:20.640> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> cone<00:01:21.030> con<00:01:21.509> they

in<00:02:49.209> but<00:02:50.519> that's<00:02:51.519> pretty<00:02:51.790> much<00:02:51.910> it<00:02:52.209> to<00:02:52.239> be

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
in but that's pretty much it to be

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.360 
in but that's pretty much it to be
honest<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.470> can<00:02:53.650> change<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.100> it<00:02:54.220> says

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370

anything<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.850> want<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.209> I<00:02:55.420> might

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
anything you want I think I might

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
actually make my own different I think I

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.550

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
a space between the colon and the chat

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.410 
a space between the colon and the chat
cuz<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> looks<00:03:03.549> really<00:03:03.850> Dungy<00:03:04.180> and<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.360> don't

for<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.320> be<00:03:14.470> honest<00:03:14.860> I<00:03:15.190> can't<00:03:15.910> really

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
for this to be honest I can't really

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.780 
for this to be honest I can't really
think<00:03:17.019> of<00:03:17.230> anything<00:03:17.650> else<00:03:18.900> if<00:03:19.900> you're<00:03:20.109> using

I don't know how to add commands but for

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.520 
I don't know how to add commands but for
me<00:03:25.239> I<00:03:25.269> use<00:03:25.810> group<00:03:26.769> manager<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.400> what<00:03:27.519> I<00:03:27.549> did<00:03:27.970> is

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
me I use group manager and what I did is

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.620 
me I use group manager and what I did is
mink<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:32.010> bank<00:03:33.010> add<00:03:33.250> P<00:03:33.489> which<00:03:33.730> means<00:03:33.970> add<00:03:34.390> a

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
mink and bank add P which means add a

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.050 
mink and bank add P which means add a
permission<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.280> group<00:03:36.609> that's<00:03:36.850> what<00:03:36.970> the

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
permission to a group that's what the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.490 
permission to a group that's what the
G's<00:03:37.299> for<00:03:37.570> and<00:03:38.070> then<00:03:39.070> you<00:03:39.400> do<00:03:39.640> space<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.500> say

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
G's for and then you do space and say

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.330 
G's for and then you do space and say
I'm<00:03:41.650> doing<00:03:42.150> mod<00:03:43.150> so<00:03:43.690> we<00:03:43.780> do<00:03:43.930> mod<00:03:44.140> and<00:03:44.470> then

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
I'm doing mod so we do mod and then

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.970 
I'm doing mod so we do mod and then
whatever<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:46.540> thing<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:46.870> so<00:03:47.350> like<00:03:47.530> if<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.859> was

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
whatever the thing is so like if it was

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.550 
whatever the thing is so like if it was
fly<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:49.180> send<00:03:50.370> chills<00:03:51.370> stops<00:03:51.730> fly<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.410> I'm

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
fly you do send chills stops fly so I'm

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.180 
fly you do send chills stops fly so I'm
guessing<00:03:53.890> it's<00:03:54.040> something<00:03:54.489> like<00:03:55.680> staff<00:03:56.680> chat

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
guessing it's something like staff chat

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.809 
guessing it's something like staff chat
or<00:03:57.880> staff<00:03:58.329> Chat<00:03:58.630> Chat<00:03:58.660> Chat<00:03:59.190> or<00:04:00.190> something<00:04:00.609> I

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
or staff Chat Chat Chat or something I

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.640 
or staff Chat Chat Chat or something I
don't<00:04:01.269> know<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:02.140> it's<00:04:02.260> gonna<00:04:02.319> be<00:04:02.440> on<00:04:02.620> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
don't know but it's gonna be on the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.080 
don't know but it's gonna be on the
screen<00:04:02.890> like<00:04:03.100> I<00:04:03.130> said<00:04:03.459> well<00:04:04.470> that<00:04:05.470> congestion

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
screen like I said well that congestion

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.430 
screen like I said well that congestion
but<00:04:07.090> yeah<00:04:09.090> that's<00:04:10.090> pretty<00:04:10.269> much<00:04:10.480> how<00:04:10.750> it<00:04:10.780> works

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:11.440 
but yeah that's pretty much how it works

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.140 
but yeah that's pretty much how it works
that's<00:04:11.889> how<00:04:12.070> I<00:04:12.100> add<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.639> permission<00:04:13.000> of<00:04:13.120> my

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
that's how I add the permission of my

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.309 
that's how I add the permission of my
groups<00:04:13.540> if<00:04:13.780> you<00:04:13.810> use

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
groups if you use

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.599 
groups if you use
