00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.150
 my part is okay so 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.200
 today we find ourselves for a whole 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.119
 new video 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.560
 so today we find ourselves all 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:22.580
 just for my secret color 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.590
 number 21 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.000
 so it's really a beautiful 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.950
 color for me that I find it 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.230
 is really pretty enough so it's a 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.480
 subscriber who introduced me to this color in 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.040
 private party when I was on gta and 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.620
 I found them really not bad so he 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.780
 gave me his color and then I 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.339
 really does not look bad so if 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.679
 you kiffer feel free to drop a 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:44.510
 maximum of blue thumb to this video 

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.160
 and then I remember more of your 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.079
 nickname so I'm sorry so big and 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.449
 10 cases that you will recognize yourself in 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.190
 this video do not hesitate to te 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.960
 show in the comments so there we 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.089
 goes the main color teeth we're going 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.170
 the teeth metallized and we will put them 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.789
 the night move so bad 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.580
 night and then to the air after we go them 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.020
 put in created a red so I do not 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.450
 do not know what red I had yesterday 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.520
 right after so the night purple 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.100
 we go in pearly and then we'll go 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.170
 in the wheels the game so I 'm going to you 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 to say that she red we will put so I 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.000
 believe it's torino red so 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.620
 here is the red torino so here it is 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.640
 I think it's pretty good 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.910
 that it must be completely customized 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.010
 to see what that gives so in 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.840
 secondary colors I advise you 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.340
 careful to put the wrong option either 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380
 red torino so after you do 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.630
 as you wish me for my part 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.430
 I will put red torino so I 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.930
 find that it's a little more out 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.630
 the Red 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.970
 purple and then that's what makes 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.660
 dark with lightning so I find that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.100
 it's still not bad at all 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.080
 do not hesitate to tell me again 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.820
 your opinions in the comments so you 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.560
 see that when and customize 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.550
 she is really quite 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.360
 everything with what I put as 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:05.720
 customization in any case that's it 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.430
 does really well enough so for my 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.630
 share well I really find it 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.520
 magnificent 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.040
 so then we will end up at 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.690
 the outside of the los santos custom for 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.090
 see what it gives to the light and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.300
 and then you see that it's pretty good 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.220
 so it's a bit blue because of 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.709
 night mode and a little of the bottom of the red 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.070
 thanks to the pearly so it's a little 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.570
 spider-man car in quotation marks 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.780
 that's it for those who know so 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.630
 I hope that this color will have you 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:38.720

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:42.380

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.130

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.970

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.280

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.750
 propose them in commentary so that the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.880

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.440
