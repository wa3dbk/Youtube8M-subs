okay<00:00:47.920> we<00:00:48.760> did<00:00:48.910> one<00:00:49.120> fold<00:00:49.420> now<00:00:49.780> we're<00:00:49.930> going<00:00:50.020> to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:50.110 
okay we did one fold now we're going to

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:59.250 
okay we did one fold now we're going to
fold<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.620> other<00:00:50.650> way<00:00:50.980> too

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.990 

and<00:01:00.260> we<00:01:00.350> have<00:01:00.500> two<00:01:00.770> diagonal<00:01:01.370> folds<00:01:01.790> this

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
and we have two diagonal folds this

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.730 
and we have two diagonal folds this
corner<00:01:02.330> to<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.510> corner<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:03.200> this<00:01:03.320> corner<00:01:03.680> to

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740

this corner and we also have a full

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.760 
this corner and we also have a full
across<00:01:07.940> the<00:01:08.120> middle<00:01:08.420> that<00:01:09.170> folds<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.620> other

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
across the middle that folds the other

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.140 
across the middle that folds the other
direction<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:10.729> that<00:01:10.760> we<00:01:11.000> can<00:01:11.530> take<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.710> paper

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.150 
direction so that we can take the paper

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.930 
direction so that we can take the paper
push<00:01:14.150> in<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:15.530> straight<00:01:15.950> line<00:01:16.340> through<00:01:16.670> the

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
push in the straight line through the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.350 
push in the straight line through the
middle<00:01:16.970> and<00:01:17.920> fold<00:01:18.920> out<00:01:19.280> the<00:01:19.640> diagonal<00:01:20.119> lines

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
middle and fold out the diagonal lines

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.080 
middle and fold out the diagonal lines
so<00:01:20.900> you<00:01:20.990> end<00:01:21.140> up<00:01:21.290> with<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:24.880> okay<00:01:25.880> now<00:01:26.030> the

piece and take these bottom corners and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:40.600 
piece and take these bottom corners and
fold<00:01:32.119> them<00:01:32.330> up<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:33.280> the<00:01:34.280> top<00:01:34.520> center<00:01:39.369> like<00:01:40.369> that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:40.610 
fold them up to the top center like that

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.080 
fold them up to the top center like that
and<00:01:41.350> do<00:01:42.350> that<00:01:42.560> to<00:01:42.740> all<00:01:42.950> four<00:01:43.399> corners<00:01:43.430> there's

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
and do that to all four corners there's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.570 
and do that to all four corners there's
two<00:01:44.270> on<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.509> front<00:01:44.810> and<00:01:44.930> two<00:01:45.350> on<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.530> back
