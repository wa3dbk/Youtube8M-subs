we're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.109> be<00:00:16.230> talking<00:00:16.470> about<00:00:16.740> another

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
we're going to be talking about another

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.189 
we're going to be talking about another
interesting<00:00:17.940> topic<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.600> this<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.109> actually

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
interesting topic and this one actually

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
interesting topic and this one actually
concerns<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.189> appearance<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.970> Phantoms

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
concerns the appearance of the Phantoms

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
concerns the appearance of the Phantoms
now<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.199> they<00:00:22.350> seem<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.710> have<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:23.039> kind

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
now we see they seem to have this kind

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.580 
now we see they seem to have this kind
of<00:00:23.369> black<00:00:23.730> dripping<00:00:24.359> or<00:00:24.630> some<00:00:25.109> kind<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.350> burnt

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
of black dripping or some kind of burnt

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.050 
of black dripping or some kind of burnt
appearance<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> them<00:00:26.369> we<00:00:26.670> kind<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.880> want<00:00:27.000> to

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
appearance to them we kind of want to

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.900 
appearance to them we kind of want to
speculate<00:00:27.359> why<00:00:27.810> we<00:00:28.080> think<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.590> might<00:00:28.859> be<00:00:28.910> yes

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
speculate why we think this might be yes

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.730 
speculate why we think this might be yes
and<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.420> links<00:00:30.750> back<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.260> five<00:00:31.500> nights

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
and this links back to the five nights

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.549 
and this links back to the five nights
at<00:00:31.920> Freddy's<00:00:32.279> 2<00:00:32.309> trailer<00:00:33.090> yes<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.960> does<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.500> are

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
at Freddy's 2 trailer yes it does we are

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.350 
at Freddy's 2 trailer yes it does we are
going<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.890> be<00:00:34.950> talking<00:00:35.130> about<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.730> song<00:00:36.000> Scott

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
going to be talking about the song Scott

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.270 
going to be talking about the song Scott
chose<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.780> use<00:00:37.020> which<00:00:37.320> goes<00:00:37.559> over<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.010> top<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
chose to use which goes over the top of

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
chose to use which goes over the top of
the<00:00:38.670> trailer<00:00:39.090> now<00:00:39.329> when<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.079> went

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the trailer now when we first went

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.930 
the trailer now when we first went
reduce<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.829> it<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.100> think<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.430> lot<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> people

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
reduce to it I think a lot of people

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.250 
reduce to it I think a lot of people
were<00:00:42.059> more<00:00:42.270> interested<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.780> trying<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> find

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
were more interested in trying to find

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.869 
were more interested in trying to find
the<00:00:43.410> secret<00:00:43.680> message<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.160> might<00:00:44.489> kill<00:00:44.760> or

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
the secret message if might kill or

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.830 
the secret message if might kill or
wasn't<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.329> yes<00:00:49.730> it's<00:00:50.730> actually<00:00:50.940> playing<00:00:51.660> it

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
wasn't it yes it's actually playing it

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990 
wasn't it yes it's actually playing it
forward<00:00:52.289> offers<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> bit<00:00:52.770> more<00:00:53.010> crucial<00:00:53.670> under

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
forward offers a bit more crucial under

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
forward offers a bit more crucial under
I<00:00:54.239> suppose<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.840> could<00:00:54.930> say<00:00:55.110> reliable<00:00:55.620> evidence

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
I suppose we could say reliable evidence

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.639 
I suppose we could say reliable evidence
now<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.760> actual<00:00:57.149> basis<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.840> London<00:00:58.230> Bridge<00:00:58.350> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
now the actual basis of London Bridge is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
now the actual basis of London Bridge is
falling<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.789> song<00:01:00.030> is

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
falling down that is the song is

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.910 
falling down that is the song is
actually<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.750> correlation<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> Great

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
actually in correlation with the Great

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.009 
actually in correlation with the Great
Fire<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> London<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.480> guys<00:01:03.629> can<00:01:03.840> search

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
Fire of London and you guys can search

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.119 
Fire of London and you guys can search
that<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.439> was<00:01:04.530> quite<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> catastrophic

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
that up but it was quite a catastrophic

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.340 
that up but it was quite a catastrophic
fire<00:01:05.729> now<00:01:06.030> would<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.540> just<00:01:06.780> make<00:01:06.930> perfect

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
fire now would it not just make perfect

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.600 
fire now would it not just make perfect
sense<00:01:07.530> for<00:01:07.710> now<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.280> we<00:01:08.369> know<00:01:08.460> these

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
sense for now that we know these

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.679 
sense for now that we know these

yes and this links on to who we play as
in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> actual<00:01:17.640> five<00:01:18.000> nights<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> Freddy's<00:01:18.630> 3

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.590 
in the actual five nights at Freddy's 3
game<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:20.009> usually<00:01:20.430> night<00:01:20.880> guards<00:01:21.270> new

game because usually night guards new
night<00:01:21.869> guard<00:01:21.900> I'll<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.799> quotes

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
night guard I'll do that with quotes

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.940 
night guard I'll do that with quotes
either<00:01:23.729> side<00:01:23.970> supposedly<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.439> new<00:01:25.710> night

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
either side supposedly is a new night

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.359 
either side supposedly is a new night
guard<00:01:25.979> so<00:01:26.880> what<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.689> in<00:01:27.869> fact<00:01:28.140> he's<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> previous

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
guard so what if in fact he's a previous

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.819 
guard so what if in fact he's a previous
night<00:01:29.579> guard<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.150> why<00:01:31.020> would<00:01:31.259> he<00:01:31.409> know<00:01:31.590> what

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
night guard and why would he know what

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
night guard and why would he know what
these<00:01:31.950> animatronics<00:01:32.579> look<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:33.000> if<00:01:33.210> he's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
these animatronics look like if he's

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.399 
these animatronics look like if he's
never<00:01:33.570> seen<00:01:33.840> them<00:01:34.049> before

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
never seen them before

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.890 
never seen them before
yeah<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:35.040> mean<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> suppose<00:01:35.579> one<00:01:36.479> thing<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
yeah I mean I suppose one thing that

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
yeah I mean I suppose one thing that
people<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.380> say<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:37.860> there's<00:01:38.040> a<00:01:38.100> big

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
people could say is that there's a big

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.399 
people could say is that there's a big
box<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.610> animatronics<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.570> there<00:01:39.840> but<00:01:40.110> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
box of animatronics right there but you

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.319 
box of animatronics right there but you
know<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.920> still<00:01:41.400> doesn't<00:01:41.610> entirely<00:01:42.150> make

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
know it still doesn't entirely make

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
know it still doesn't entirely make
sense<00:01:42.840> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.229> white<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.470> know<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.860> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
sense kind of white you know and you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.230 
sense kind of white you know and you
have<00:01:44.040> these<00:01:44.189> hallucinations<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.090> things

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
have these hallucinations and things

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
them in a burn state I thought maybe I

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.170 
them in a burn state I thought maybe I
missed<00:01:52.560> something<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.520> don't<00:01:53.610> know<00:01:53.790> say<00:01:54.060> it

same<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.509> me<00:01:54.600> as<00:01:54.720> well<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> didn't<00:01:55.200> really<00:01:55.290> I

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.359 
same for me as well it didn't really I
was<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.680> kind<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> looking<00:01:56.130> at<00:01:56.250> them

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
was just kind of looking at them

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.219 
was just kind of looking at them
thinking<00:01:56.520> who<00:01:56.939> are<00:01:56.969> these<00:01:57.360> guys<00:01:57.600> but<00:01:57.869> we<00:01:58.110> can

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
thinking who are these guys but we can

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.450 
thinking who are these guys but we can
clearly<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.680> they're<00:01:58.829> from<00:01:58.979> five<00:01:59.130> nights<00:01:59.340> at

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
clearly see they're from five nights at

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.889 
clearly see they're from five nights at
Freddy's<00:01:59.729> 2<00:01:59.759> and<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.060> think<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.390> link<00:02:00.630> with<00:02:00.780> the

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
Freddy's 2 and I think the link with the

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.420 
Freddy's 2 and I think the link with the
song<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.469> now<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.710> appearance<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.250> these

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
song and now the appearance of these

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.950 
song and now the appearance of these
characters<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> it's<00:02:03.390> almost<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.750> bit<00:02:03.899> too

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
characters is it's almost a bit too

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499 
characters is it's almost a bit too
coincidental<00:02:04.530> for<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.640> unintentional

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
coincidental for it to be unintentional

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.300 
coincidental for it to be unintentional
isn't<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.840> yeah<00:02:07.200> most<00:02:07.530> definitely

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
isn't it yeah most definitely

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.309 
isn't it yeah most definitely
I<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.670> as<00:02:08.940> Ryan's<00:02:09.509> already<00:02:09.629> said<00:02:09.929> about<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
I think as Ryan's already said about the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.280 
I think as Ryan's already said about the
night<00:02:10.500> guy<00:02:10.679> we<00:02:10.860> may<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.039> actually<00:02:11.400> playing<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
night guy we may be actually playing a

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.050 
night guy we may be actually playing a
someone<00:02:12.829> who's<00:02:13.069> already<00:02:13.340> had<00:02:13.640> previous

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
someone who's already had previous

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.209 
someone who's already had previous
experience<00:02:14.659> with<00:02:14.840> this<00:02:15.110> kind<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.469> scenario

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.219 
experience with this kind of scenario

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.580 
experience with this kind of scenario
and<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:16.969> think<00:02:17.209> the<00:02:17.329> two<00:02:17.569> candidates<00:02:18.230> for<00:02:18.439> this

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and I think the two candidates for this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.770 
and I think the two candidates for this
what<00:02:18.950> mike<00:02:19.280> is<00:02:19.519> of<00:02:19.700> course<00:02:19.939> one<00:02:20.209> he<00:02:20.450> actually

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
what mike is of course one he actually

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.390 
what mike is of course one he actually

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
tampering with the animatronics as well

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.569 
tampering with the animatronics as well
so<00:03:05.540> then<00:03:05.989> yeah<00:03:06.169> Lincoln<00:03:06.829> it<00:03:07.069> could<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.430> code

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
so then yeah Lincoln it could be a code

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.069 
so then yeah Lincoln it could be a code
or<00:03:07.669> Lincoln<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.060> mean<00:03:08.239> Fritz<00:03:08.480> Smith<00:03:08.629> everyone

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
or Lincoln I mean Fritz Smith everyone

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.690 
or Lincoln I mean Fritz Smith everyone
was<00:03:09.200> kind<00:03:09.409> of<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.560> bit<00:03:09.739> skeptical<00:03:10.370> about<00:03:10.400> who

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
was kind of a bit skeptical about who

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.009 
was kind of a bit skeptical about who
this<00:03:10.849> guy<00:03:11.060> was<00:03:11.090> we<00:03:11.419> definitely<00:03:11.720> know<00:03:11.840> much

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
this guy was we definitely know much

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.659 
this guy was we definitely know much
about<00:03:12.049> him<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.739> lot<00:03:12.889> of<00:03:12.980> people<00:03:13.220> were<00:03:13.310> just<00:03:13.340> kind

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:13.669 
about him a lot of people were just kind

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:15.009 
about him a lot of people were just kind
of<00:03:13.760> confused<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.480> it<00:03:14.569> might<00:03:14.689> actually<00:03:14.810> be

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
of confused and it might actually be

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.750 
of confused and it might actually be
that<00:03:15.349> he<00:03:15.530> could<00:03:15.739> be<00:03:15.859> this<00:03:15.980> new<00:03:16.159> security<00:03:16.609> guard

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
that he could be this new security guard

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.860 
that he could be this new security guard
at<00:03:16.970> least<00:03:17.150> that's<00:03:17.329> what<00:03:17.479> I'm<00:03:17.540> speculating

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
at least that's what I'm speculating

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.839 
at least that's what I'm speculating
here<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.620> just<00:03:18.979> think<00:03:19.340> as<00:03:19.489> I've<00:03:19.639> said<00:03:19.790> before

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
here I just think as I've said before

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:20.979 
here I just think as I've said before
and<00:03:20.209> we've<00:03:20.329> been<00:03:20.449> saying<00:03:20.690> throughout<00:03:20.810> this

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
and we've been saying throughout this

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.180 
and we've been saying throughout this
whole<00:03:21.169> video<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.620> link<00:03:21.799> between<00:03:21.949> the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
whole video the link between the

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.619 
whole video the link between the
animatronics<00:03:22.699> looking<00:03:23.000> in<00:03:23.120> there<00:03:23.239> kind<00:03:23.449> of

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
animatronics looking in there kind of

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.140 
animatronics looking in there kind of
withered<00:03:24.079> burnt<00:03:24.620> State<00:03:25.220> it<00:03:25.609> doesn't<00:03:26.000> make<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
withered burnt State it doesn't make a

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.030 
withered burnt State it doesn't make a
whole<00:03:26.389> lot<00:03:26.449> of<00:03:26.690> sense<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.109> correlation<00:03:27.650> to<00:03:27.799> you

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
whole lot of sense in correlation to you

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.469 
whole lot of sense in correlation to you
know<00:03:28.159> if<00:03:28.340> he's<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.489> new<00:03:28.760> night<00:03:29.000> guard<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.359> he's

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:29.479 
know if he's a new night guard and he's

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.879 
know if he's a new night guard and he's
just<00:03:29.629> came<00:03:29.870> into<00:03:30.049> this<00:03:30.199> establishment<00:03:30.349> I'm

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
life that's another thing as well I

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:58.330 
life that's another thing as well I
really<00:03:57.349> want<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.530> pick<00:03:57.620> up<00:03:57.739> on<00:03:57.919> is<00:03:58.129> you<00:03:58.250> know

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
really want to pick up on is you know

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.009 
really want to pick up on is you know
when<00:03:58.519> the<00:03:58.639> ventilation<00:03:59.329> system<00:03:59.659> can<00:03:59.810> error

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
when the ventilation system can error

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.740 
when the ventilation system can error
yeah<00:04:00.709> yeah<00:04:01.400> if<00:04:01.549> you<00:04:01.639> leave<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:01.939> too<00:04:02.120> long<00:04:02.359> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
yeah yeah if you leave it too long the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.140 
yeah yeah if you leave it too long the
place<00:04:03.139> actually<00:04:03.319> starts<00:04:03.799> to<00:04:03.919> kind<00:04:04.069> of<00:04:04.220> smog<00:04:04.909> up

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
place actually starts to kind of smog up

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.939 
place actually starts to kind of smog up
now<00:04:05.449> why<00:04:05.870> would<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:06.109> be<00:04:06.229> some<00:04:06.379> kind<00:04:06.560> of<00:04:06.650> smoke

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949 
now why would the be some kind of smoke

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:08.409 
now why would the be some kind of smoke
entering<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:07.549> rooms<00:04:07.760> if<00:04:07.939> there<00:04:08.060> wasn't<00:04:08.269> any

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
entering the rooms if there wasn't any

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:10.899 
entering the rooms if there wasn't any
relation<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.019> fire<00:04:09.379> yeah<00:04:10.129> it<00:04:10.189> is<00:04:10.489> still<00:04:10.699> it's

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909 
relation to a fire yeah it is still it's

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.699 
relation to a fire yeah it is still it's
a<00:04:10.970> bit<00:04:11.120> coincidental<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.870> honesty<00:04:12.259> and<00:04:12.470> I

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
a bit coincidental in honesty and I

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.020 
a bit coincidental in honesty and I
think<00:04:12.919> the<00:04:12.979> final<00:04:13.159> thing<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.549> we're<00:04:13.879> now

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
think the final thing that we're now

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.550 
think the final thing that we're now
going<00:04:14.180> to<00:04:14.269> end<00:04:14.479> this<00:04:14.659> video<00:04:14.840> on<00:04:15.139> is<00:04:15.290> something

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
going to end this video on is something

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.960 
going to end this video on is something
which<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:15.739> actually<00:04:15.889> contrast<00:04:16.579> this<00:04:16.729> whole

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
which I actually contrast this whole

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.550 
which I actually contrast this whole
theory<00:04:17.419> and<00:04:17.509> actually<00:04:17.630> say<00:04:18.049> the<00:04:18.320> fire

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
theory and actually say the fire

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.110 
theory and actually say the fire
happened<00:04:18.769> in<00:04:19.039> five<00:04:19.220> nights<00:04:19.430> at<00:04:19.519> freddys<00:04:19.820> one

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
happened in five nights at freddys one

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.789 
happened in five nights at freddys one
now<00:04:20.539> a<00:04:20.570> lot<00:04:20.989> of<00:04:21.079> people<00:04:21.320> have<00:04:21.409> been<00:04:21.469> kind<00:04:21.709> of

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
now a lot of people have been kind of

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.230 
now a lot of people have been kind of
seeing<00:04:22.099> that<00:04:22.310> the<00:04:22.550> five<00:04:22.760> nights<00:04:22.880> at<00:04:23.029> Freddy's

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
seeing that the five nights at Freddy's

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.339 
seeing that the five nights at Freddy's
2<00:04:23.270> animatronics<00:04:23.960> are<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.110> ones<00:04:24.260> who

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
2 animatronics are the ones who

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.960 
2 animatronics are the ones who
experienced<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.860> hallucinations<00:04:25.490> with<00:04:25.639> an

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
experienced the hallucinations with an

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.280 
experienced the hallucinations with an
five<00:04:26.180> nights<00:04:26.390> at<00:04:26.450> freddy's<00:04:26.690> one<00:04:26.870> characters

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
five nights at freddy's one characters

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.740 
five nights at freddy's one characters
have<00:04:27.440> kind<00:04:27.650> of<00:04:27.710> become<00:04:27.800> the<00:04:28.070> props<00:04:28.340> yes<00:04:28.970> yeah

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
have kind of become the props yes yeah

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.510 
have kind of become the props yes yeah
okay<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.470> need<00:04:30.680> to<00:04:30.830> ask<00:04:30.950> you<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.130> question<00:04:31.280> about

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
okay I need to ask you a question about

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.610 
okay I need to ask you a question about
chica<00:04:32.180> now<00:04:32.480> which<00:04:32.720> version<00:04:33.020> of<00:04:33.080> chica<00:04:33.410> do<00:04:33.530> we

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
chica now which version of chica do we

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.830 
chica now which version of chica do we
see<00:04:33.800> oh<00:04:34.010> that<00:04:34.970> would<00:04:35.090> be<00:04:35.180> the<00:04:35.330> five<00:04:35.480> nights<00:04:35.720> at

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
see oh that would be the five nights at

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.660 
see oh that would be the five nights at
Freddy's<00:04:36.110> one<00:04:36.320> version<00:04:36.860> yeah<00:04:37.070> it<00:04:37.280> would<00:04:37.460> be

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670 
Freddy's one version yeah it would be

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.330 
Freddy's one version yeah it would be
and<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:37.970> chica<00:04:38.720> is<00:04:38.840> incredibly<00:04:39.350> burnt<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.130> I

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
and that chica is incredibly burnt so I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.250 
and that chica is incredibly burnt so I
suppose<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.970> could<00:04:41.150> mean<00:04:41.330> that<00:04:41.390> perhaps<00:04:42.020> these

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
suppose it could mean that perhaps these

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.720 
suppose it could mean that perhaps these
animatronics<00:04:43.040> because<00:04:43.280> we<00:04:43.370> know<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:43.520> there

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
animatronics because we know that there

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.610 
animatronics because we know that there
was<00:04:43.790> an<00:04:43.910> extra<00:04:44.420> room<00:04:44.720> in<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.170> five<00:04:45.380> nights<00:04:45.410> at

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
was an extra room in the five nights at

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.230 
was an extra room in the five nights at
Freddy's<00:04:45.860> one<00:04:46.040> establishment<00:04:46.640> what<00:04:46.880> about<00:04:47.120> if

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
Freddy's one establishment what about if

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.460 
Freddy's one establishment what about if
these<00:04:47.390> animatronics<00:04:47.690> were<00:04:48.050> actually<00:04:48.320> being

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
these animatronics were actually being

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.320 
these animatronics were actually being
stored<00:04:48.830> back<00:04:49.010> there<00:04:49.310> and<00:04:49.520> what<00:04:50.060> might<00:04:50.210> have

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
stored back there and what might have

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.030 
stored back there and what might have
Mike<00:04:50.540> actually<00:04:51.020> set<00:04:51.260> the<00:04:51.380> fire<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.860> place

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
Mike actually set the fire to the place

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.560 
Mike actually set the fire to the place
so<00:04:52.430> for<00:04:52.790> example<00:04:53.090> we<00:04:53.150> could<00:04:53.240> actually<00:04:53.390> be

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
so for example we could actually be

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.930 
so for example we could actually be
playing<00:04:53.780> as<00:04:53.900> Mike<00:04:54.140> well<00:04:54.830> quite<00:04:55.490> possibly<00:04:55.520> I

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
playing as Mike well quite possibly I

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.390 
playing as Mike well quite possibly I
was<00:04:56.180> thinking<00:04:56.540> that<00:04:56.570> maybe<00:04:56.810> because<00:04:57.710> they<00:04:58.190> say

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
was thinking that maybe because they say

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.340 
was thinking that maybe because they say
that<00:04:58.640> the<00:04:58.820> end<00:04:59.030> minigame<00:04:59.570> we<00:04:59.720> see<00:04:59.930> is<00:05:00.050> from<00:05:00.230> the

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
that the end minigame we see is from the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:01.840 
that the end minigame we see is from the
end<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.650> five<00:05:00.800> nights<00:05:00.950> at<00:05:01.130> Freddy's<00:05:01.400> 1<00:05:01.550> don't

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:01.850 
end of five nights at Freddy's 1 don't

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.280 
end of five nights at Freddy's 1 don't
they<00:05:02.060> yeah<00:05:02.480> a<00:05:02.510> lot<00:05:02.870> of<00:05:02.930> people<00:05:03.080> are<00:05:03.170> saying

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
they yeah a lot of people are saying

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:04.750 
they yeah a lot of people are saying
that<00:05:03.380> the<00:05:03.560> kind<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.860> layout<00:05:04.070> looks<00:05:04.400> too<00:05:04.730> much

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
that the kind of layout looks too much

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.280 
that the kind of layout looks too much
like<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.300> five<00:05:05.450> nights<00:05:05.600> at<00:05:05.750> Freddy's<00:05:05.990> one

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
like the five nights at Freddy's one

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:08.740 
like the five nights at Freddy's one
layout<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.920> for<00:05:07.310> it<00:05:07.400> not<00:05:07.520> to<00:05:07.670> be<00:05:07.820> almost<00:05:07.970> back

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
layout to for it not to be almost back

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.660 
layout to for it not to be almost back
in<00:05:08.930> the<00:05:09.020> olden<00:05:09.260> days<00:05:09.290> I<00:05:09.500> finished<00:05:09.830> use<00:05:10.070> fire<00:05:10.400> to

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
in the olden days I finished use fire to

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.850 
in the olden days I finished use fire to
kind<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:10.970> like<00:05:11.210> parish<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.930> souls<00:05:12.260> of<00:05:12.620> things

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
kind of like parish the souls of things

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.980 
kind of like parish the souls of things
so<00:05:13.190> maybe<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.640> animatronics<00:05:14.300> themselves

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
so maybe the animatronics themselves

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.180 
so maybe the animatronics themselves
burn<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.680> place<00:05:15.860> down

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
burn the place down

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.090 
burn the place down
to<00:05:16.370> kind<00:05:16.580> of<00:05:16.670> you<00:05:16.820> know<00:05:16.940> free<00:05:17.240> themselves<00:05:18.100> it's

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
to kind of you know free themselves it's

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.130 
to kind of you know free themselves it's
a<00:05:19.220> very<00:05:19.400> strange<00:05:19.640> concept<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:20.450> mean<00:05:20.930> with<00:05:21.020> these

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
a very strange concept I mean with these

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.659 
a very strange concept I mean with these
animatronics<00:05:21.410> looking<00:05:21.919> possessed<00:05:22.280> and<00:05:22.550> I

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
animatronics looking possessed and I

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.100 
animatronics looking possessed and I
suppose<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.240> once<00:05:23.450> again<00:05:23.660> all<00:05:23.750> relates<00:05:23.990> back

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
suppose this once again all relates back

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.450 
suppose this once again all relates back
to<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.320> marionette<00:05:24.650> like<00:05:24.919> kind<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.280> because

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
to the marionette like kind of because

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.800 
to the marionette like kind of because
we<00:05:25.610> see<00:05:25.730> the<00:05:25.850> marionette<00:05:26.150> and<00:05:26.210> cami<00:05:26.450> when

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
we see the marionette and cami when

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.680 
we see the marionette and cami when
she's<00:05:27.020> while<00:05:27.410> he<00:05:27.620> is<00:05:27.940> unwitting<00:05:28.940> at<00:05:29.510> all<00:05:29.630> he

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
she's while he is unwitting at all he

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.150 
she's while he is unwitting at all he
looks<00:05:29.840> the<00:05:29.930> exact<00:05:30.200> same<00:05:30.260> so<00:05:30.680> could<00:05:30.980> he<00:05:31.070> have

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
looks the exact same so could he have

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.500 
looks the exact same so could he have
possessed<00:05:31.520> these<00:05:31.760> animatronics<00:05:32.060> and<00:05:32.360> made

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
possessed these animatronics and made

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.210 
possessed these animatronics and made
him<00:05:32.630> set<00:05:32.840> the<00:05:32.930> place<00:05:33.080> on<00:05:33.260> fire<00:05:33.320> was<00:05:33.800> he<00:05:33.980> kind<00:05:34.100> of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
him set the place on fire was he kind of

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:36.130 
him set the place on fire was he kind of
escapes<00:05:34.550> in<00:05:34.669> the<00:05:34.760> safety<00:05:35.000> that's<00:05:35.630> always<00:05:35.870> been

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
escapes in the safety that's always been

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.990 
escapes in the safety that's always been
a<00:05:36.200> strong<00:05:36.440> theory<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.950> yeah<00:05:37.340> you're<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:37.820> sight

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 
a strong theory of yeah you're the sight

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.880 
a strong theory of yeah you're the sight
you've<00:05:38.150> made<00:05:38.360> yeah<00:05:38.660> yeah<00:05:39.169> I<00:05:39.470> think<00:05:39.620> that's

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
you've made yeah yeah I think that's

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.650 
you've made yeah yeah I think that's
always<00:05:40.010> a<00:05:40.130> possibility<00:05:40.310> but<00:05:40.910> I<00:05:41.120> think<00:05:41.540> in

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
always a possibility but I think in

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.090 
always a possibility but I think in
terms<00:05:41.870> of<00:05:42.020> this<00:05:42.110> theory<00:05:42.350> guys<00:05:42.560> that's<00:05:42.860> about

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
terms of this theory guys that's about

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:45.130 
terms of this theory guys that's about
what<00:05:43.310> we<00:05:43.340> can<00:05:43.580> run<00:05:43.760> on<00:05:43.850> here<00:05:44.060> before<00:05:44.450> we<00:05:44.870> start

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140 
what we can run on here before we start

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.570 
what we can run on here before we start
using<00:05:45.290> sources<00:05:45.800> which<00:05:45.950> aren't<00:05:46.190> properly

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
using sources which aren't properly

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.430 
using sources which aren't properly
fought<00:05:46.850> through<00:05:47.210> so<00:05:47.660> guys<00:05:47.840> let<00:05:48.080> us<00:05:48.110> know<00:05:48.229> what

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
fought through so guys let us know what

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.540 
fought through so guys let us know what
you<00:05:48.560> actually<00:05:48.650> think<00:05:48.860> about<00:05:49.190> this<00:05:49.310> why<00:05:49.520> are

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
you actually think about this why are

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
you actually think about this why are
these<00:05:49.820> animatronics

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
these animatronics

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:52.180 
these animatronics
in<00:05:50.660> there<00:05:50.840> kind<00:05:51.020> of<00:05:51.110> burnt<00:05:51.350> with<00:05:51.500> its<00:05:51.650> state<00:05:51.950> I

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
in there kind of burnt with its state I

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.610 
in there kind of burnt with its state I
mean<00:05:52.220> if<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:53.150> firing<00:05:53.600> of<00:05:53.840> the<00:05:54.050> 500x

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
mean if the firing of the 500x

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.050 
mean if the firing of the 500x
reestablishment<00:05:55.340> hasn't<00:05:55.760> actually<00:05:55.850> happened

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
reestablishment hasn't actually happened

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.120 
reestablishment hasn't actually happened
yet<00:05:56.419> I<00:05:56.660> mean<00:05:56.870> he<00:05:57.169> won't<00:05:57.380> be<00:05:57.500> seeing<00:05:57.770> these<00:05:57.950> the

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
yet I mean he won't be seeing these the

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:00.130 
yet I mean he won't be seeing these the
way<00:05:58.250> they<00:05:58.400> are<00:05:58.550> so<00:05:58.880> I<00:05:58.910> think<00:05:59.150> that<00:05:59.419> alone<00:05:59.870> tells

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.140 
way they are so I think that alone tells

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.960 
way they are so I think that alone tells
me<00:06:00.410> something<00:06:00.770> fishy's<00:06:01.160> going<00:06:01.190> on<00:06:01.520> here

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970 
me something fishy's going on here

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.700 
me something fishy's going on here
definitely<00:06:02.600> yeah<00:06:02.780> and<00:06:02.960> the<00:06:03.260> fact<00:06:03.440> also<00:06:03.590> that

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
definitely yeah and the fact also that

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.380 
definitely yeah and the fact also that
they<00:06:03.919> regarded<00:06:04.250> as<00:06:04.370> hallucinations<00:06:04.580> kind<00:06:05.300> of

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
they regarded as hallucinations kind of

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.030 
they regarded as hallucinations kind of
relates<00:06:05.750> back<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.020> to<00:06:06.500> make<00:06:06.620> happen<00:06:06.860> in<00:06:06.919> the

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
relates back to to make happen in the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.409 
relates back to to make happen in the
past<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:07.400> bring<00:06:07.520> it<00:06:07.669> forward<00:06:07.700> again<00:06:08.030> doesn't

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
past and bring it forward again doesn't

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.020 
past and bring it forward again doesn't
it<00:06:08.450> yeah<00:06:08.750> exactly<00:06:08.870> yeah<00:06:09.560> yeah<00:06:10.220> so<00:06:10.790> alright
