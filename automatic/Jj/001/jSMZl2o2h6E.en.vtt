wheel<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> other<00:00:56.640> side

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
wheel I think was the other side

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
wheel I think was the other side
actually<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.300> was<00:00:57.390> bad<00:00:57.570> but<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.050> painted<00:00:58.379> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
actually that was bad but I painted the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.389 
actually that was bad but I painted the
wheels<00:00:58.910> painted<00:00:59.910> the<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.120> ones<00:01:00.359> again

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
wheels painted the back ones again

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
wheels painted the back ones again
installed<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.670> fender<00:01:03.030> flares<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.660> what

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
installed some fender flares and what

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.390 
installed some fender flares and what
this<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.949> actually<00:01:05.430> lawn<00:01:06.270> edging<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.400> what

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is is actually lawn edging and what

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.240 
this is is actually lawn edging and what
I<00:01:08.430> did<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:09.060> I<00:01:09.479> basically<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.470> rolled<00:01:11.070> these

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
I did was I basically just rolled these

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
I did was I basically just rolled these
fenders<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.939> cut<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> series<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.260> snips<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:13.979> then

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
fenders I cut a series of snips and then

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.160 
fenders I cut a series of snips and then
bent<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> steel<00:01:15.119> under<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.720> had<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> flat

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
bent the steel under so I had a flat

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.810 
bent the steel under so I had a flat
surface<00:01:16.409> because<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:16.979> comes<00:01:17.220> down<00:01:17.400> straight

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
surface because this comes down straight

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.080 
surface because this comes down straight
as<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.450> can<00:01:18.600> see<00:01:19.070> so<00:01:20.070> I<00:01:20.100> used<00:01:20.369> pop<00:01:20.610> rivets<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
as you can see so I used pop rivets and

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.810 
as you can see so I used pop rivets and
washers<00:01:21.650> after<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.680> bent<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> steel<00:01:23.310> down<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
washers after I bent the steel down and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.240 
washers after I bent the steel down and
just<00:01:24.720> pop<00:01:24.869> riveted<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.320> whole<00:01:25.560> thing<00:01:25.799> right

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
just pop riveted the whole thing right

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
just pop riveted the whole thing right
to<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.460> tractor<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.030> it's<00:01:27.689> it's<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.530> there

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
to the tractor and it's it's on there

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.770 
to the tractor and it's it's on there
really<00:01:28.860> sturdy<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.400> fairly<00:01:29.759> rigid<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.659> it's

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
really sturdy it's fairly rigid but it's

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
really sturdy it's fairly rigid but it's
it's<00:01:31.110> pliable<00:01:31.590> because<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.250> rubber<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.270> it's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
it's pliable because it's rubber so it's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
it's pliable because it's rubber so it's
pretty<00:01:33.570> cool<00:01:33.810> because<00:01:34.049> if<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.619> hit<00:01:34.829> stuff<00:01:35.070> it'll

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
pretty cool because if I hit stuff it'll

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
pretty cool because if I hit stuff it'll
just<00:01:35.549> kind<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:35.939> Bend<00:01:36.119> out<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> way<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> not

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
just kind of Bend out of the way and not

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.410 
just kind of Bend out of the way and not
break<00:01:37.110> off<00:01:37.320> or<00:01:37.680> rip<00:01:37.860> off<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.939> hopefully<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
break off or rip off but hopefully this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.260 
break off or rip off but hopefully this
will<00:01:39.540> go<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> long<00:01:39.930> way<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.909> keeping<00:01:41.909> me<00:01:42.180> from

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
will go a long way to keeping me from

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.910 
will go a long way to keeping me from
getting<00:01:42.450> completely<00:01:42.990> covered<00:01:43.259> in<00:01:43.350> mud<00:01:43.530> as<00:01:43.799> you

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
getting completely covered in mud as you

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.800 
getting completely covered in mud as you
can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.340> over<00:01:44.579> hang<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.820> tires<00:01:45.030> just<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
can see they over hang the tires just a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.760 
can see they over hang the tires just a
