hit me in the rear like a jet and you're
on<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.450> railroad<00:01:24.900> tracks<00:01:25.229> coming<00:01:25.710> over<00:01:25.979> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
on just railroad tracks coming over to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.899 
on just railroad tracks coming over to
the<00:01:26.190> headlights<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.760> show<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the headlights I want to show you

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.310 
the headlights I want to show you
something<00:01:27.150> about<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.869> headlights<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
something about the headlights the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.080 
something about the headlights the
headlights<00:01:28.619> come<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> wider<00:01:29.369> angle<00:01:29.549> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
headlights come out to a wider angle and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.690 
headlights come out to a wider angle and
one<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> reasons<00:01:30.720> for<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.409> normal<00:01:32.340> hid

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
one of the reasons for that normal hid

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.850 
one of the reasons for that normal hid
headlights<00:01:33.210> they<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> direct<00:01:34.229> beam<00:01:34.470> these

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
headlights they have a direct beam these

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.350 
headlights they have a direct beam these
they're<00:01:35.189> designed<00:01:35.580> to<00:01:35.760> have<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> wider<00:01:36.240> angle

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
they're designed to have a wider angle

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.450 
they're designed to have a wider angle
so<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.170> no<00:01:37.380> moving<00:01:37.650> parts<00:01:37.770> there's<00:01:38.280> less

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
so there's no moving parts there's less

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.429 
so there's no moving parts there's less
mechanical<00:01:38.700> parts<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.570> when<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:40.140> design

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
mechanical parts and when they design

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.899 
mechanical parts and when they design
this<00:01:40.560> car<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.920> all<00:01:41.070> about<00:01:41.220> weight<00:01:41.460> savings

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
this car it's all about weight savings

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.300 
this car it's all about weight savings
it's<00:01:42.119> all<00:01:42.210> about<00:01:42.420> being<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:43.110> fast<00:01:43.439> as<00:01:44.070> light

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
it's all about being very fast as light

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.160 
it's all about being very fast as light
as<00:01:44.460> possible<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.119> very<00:01:45.420> efficient<00:01:45.840> also

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
as possible and be very efficient also

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.469 
as possible and be very efficient also
with<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.439> drag<00:01:46.680> co-efficient<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.479> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
with the drag co-efficient see so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.120 
with the drag co-efficient see so
there's<00:01:48.900> less<00:01:49.080> moving<00:01:49.409> parts<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.799> there<00:01:49.950> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
there's less moving parts in there so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's less moving parts in there so
it's<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.340> much<00:01:50.610> wider<00:01:50.909> angle<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.570> you're

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
it's a much wider angle so if you're

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.870 
it's a much wider angle so if you're
going<00:01:51.810> around<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.350> dark<00:01:52.740> horse<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.759> if

you're going around at night in a wooded

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.230 
you're going around at night in a wooded

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
applications of this paint on the

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.620 
applications of this paint on the
vehicle<00:03:09.400> that's<00:03:09.910> why<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:10.540> a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
vehicle that's why it's a

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.140 
vehicle that's why it's a
three-thousand-dollar<00:03:11.170> option<00:03:12.150> another

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
three-thousand-dollar option another

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.310 
three-thousand-dollar option another

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
thing i want to touch on is right down

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.110 
thing i want to touch on is right down
here<00:03:14.350> on<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.620> side<00:03:14.800> of<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.920> doors<00:03:15.100> some<00:03:15.820> some

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
here on the side of the doors some some

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.910 
here on the side of the doors some some
vehicles<00:03:16.570> some<00:03:16.750> car<00:03:16.930> manufacturers<00:03:17.410> might<00:03:17.800> do

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
vehicles some car manufacturers might do

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.199 
vehicles some car manufacturers might do
something<00:03:18.160> like<00:03:18.340> this<00:03:18.520> you<00:03:18.730> know<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> kind<00:03:19.090> of

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
something like this you know the kind of

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.180 
something like this you know the kind of
copy<00:03:19.420> and<00:03:19.630> imitate<00:03:19.990> a<00:03:20.020> sports<00:03:20.350> car<00:03:20.590> there's<00:03:21.100> a

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
copy and imitate a sports car there's a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.920 
copy and imitate a sports car there's a
reason<00:03:21.550> why<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.700> is<00:03:22.000> on<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> sports<00:03:22.510> car<00:03:22.720> right

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
reason why this is on a sports car right

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:27.330 
reason why this is on a sports car right
here<00:03:22.959> this<00:03:23.940> area<00:03:24.940> right<00:03:24.970> here<00:03:26.070> heat<00:03:27.070> is<00:03:27.220> coming

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
here this area right here heat is coming

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.620 
here this area right here heat is coming
down<00:03:27.610> the<00:03:27.700> sides<00:03:27.910> of<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.150> body<00:03:28.270> of<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.510> car

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
down the sides of the body of the car

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.030 
down the sides of the body of the car
there's<00:03:28.930> a<00:03:28.990> reason<00:03:29.260> for<00:03:29.290> that<00:03:29.530> there<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.010> a

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
there's a reason for that there is a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.090 
there's a reason for that there is a
reason<00:03:30.459> why<00:03:30.910> they<00:03:31.030> have<00:03:31.209> that<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:31.540> reason<00:03:31.840> why

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
reason why they have that the reason why

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.780 
reason why they have that the reason why
is<00:03:33.100> because<00:03:33.160> when<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:35.370> cold<00:03:36.370> air<00:03:36.550> is<00:03:36.670> much

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
is because when a cold air is much

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.090 
is because when a cold air is much
denser<00:03:37.060> than<00:03:37.750> hot<00:03:38.020> air<00:03:38.230> and<00:03:38.770> this<00:03:38.860> actually

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
denser than hot air and this actually

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.940 
denser than hot air and this actually
helps<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.300> vehicle<00:03:40.660> cut<00:03:40.900> through<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.770> wind

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
helps the vehicle cut through the wind

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.620 
helps the vehicle cut through the wind
and<00:03:42.580> I<00:03:42.640> might<00:03:42.790> seem<00:03:42.970> kind<00:03:43.180> of<00:03:43.239> weird<00:03:43.300> at<00:03:43.600> first

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
and I might seem kind of weird at first

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.449 
and I might seem kind of weird at first
but<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.140> you<00:03:44.260> if<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.620> do<00:03:44.739> some<00:03:44.920> research<00:03:45.070> on

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
but if you if you do some research on

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.760 
but if you if you do some research on
that<00:03:45.489> there's<00:03:46.360> a<00:03:46.450> reason<00:03:46.870> why<00:03:47.110> they<00:03:47.620> designed

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
that there's a reason why they designed

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.410 
that there's a reason why they designed
that<00:03:48.070> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.340> side<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.550> buy<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:48.850> car<00:03:49.150> at<00:03:49.360> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
that on the side to buy the car at the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.449 
that on the side to buy the car at the
angles<00:03:49.870> that<00:03:49.930> they<00:03:50.080> did<00:03:50.290> it<00:03:50.800> comes<00:03:51.040> down<00:03:51.310> the

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
angles that they did it comes down the

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.010 
angles that they did it comes down the
sides<00:03:51.670> of<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.820> body<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> car<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:52.540> like<00:03:52.900> I

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
sides of the body of the car and like I

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.780 
sides of the body of the car and like I
said<00:03:53.080> it<00:03:53.350> helps<00:03:53.530> car<00:03:53.920> cut<00:03:54.190> through<00:03:54.370> the<00:03:54.459> wind<00:03:54.580> a

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
said it helps car cut through the wind a

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.729 
said it helps car cut through the wind a
lot<00:03:54.940> quicker<00:03:55.209> so<00:03:56.020> let's<00:03:56.200> go<00:03:56.320> ahead<00:03:56.350> and<00:03:56.500> take<00:03:56.620> a

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.410 

we'll<00:06:14.979> go<00:06:15.190> down

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:16.420 
we'll go down

we'll go down
let's<00:06:16.930> do<00:06:17.460> torque<00:06:18.460> split<00:06:18.610> let's<00:06:19.120> do<00:06:19.210> that<00:06:19.830> all

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
let's do torque split let's do that all

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.500 
let's do torque split let's do that all
right<00:06:21.010> so<00:06:21.490> while<00:06:21.670> we're<00:06:21.790> driving<00:06:21.880> it's<00:06:22.330> going

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
right so while we're driving it's going

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.080 
right so while we're driving it's going
to<00:06:22.540> let<00:06:22.690> us<00:06:22.840> know<00:06:22.990> what<00:06:23.620> our<00:06:23.650> boost<00:06:23.890> is<00:06:24.100> what

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
to let us know what our boost is what

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.690 
to let us know what our boost is what
our<00:06:25.180> coolant<00:06:25.420> temperature<00:06:25.660> and<00:06:26.430> the<00:06:27.430> own

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:27.700 
our coolant temperature and the own

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.030 
our coolant temperature and the own
drive<00:06:27.940> split<00:06:28.240> so<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.690> torque<00:06:28.900> since<00:06:29.470> this<00:06:29.860> is

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:30.040 
drive split so the torque since this is

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.780 
drive split so the torque since this is
an<00:06:30.160> ala<00:06:30.310> drive<00:06:30.550> vehicle<00:06:31.530> and<00:06:32.530> if<00:06:33.400> we<00:06:33.520> scroll

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
an ala drive vehicle and if we scroll

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:36.810
