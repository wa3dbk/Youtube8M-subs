00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
pulling out some flyaways I think it's

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.690 
pulling out some flyaways I think it's
pretty<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:37.990> frames<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.380> face<00:02:38.470> I'm<00:02:39.010> just

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
pretty and it frames the face I'm just

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.640

loosing<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.150> up<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.360> little<00:02:40.510> bit<00:02:40.630> so<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.350> more

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
loosing it up a little bit so it's more

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.710 
loosing it up a little bit so it's more
I<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.340> know<00:02:42.430> loose<00:02:42.820> and<00:02:43.180> not<00:02:43.270> so<00:02:43.480> tight

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.660 
I don't know loose and not so tight
