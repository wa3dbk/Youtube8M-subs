think<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.300> hardest<00:03:50.600> trick<00:03:50.810> was<00:03:51.170> probably<00:03:52.090> the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
think the hardest trick was probably the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.440 
think the hardest trick was probably the
air<00:03:53.360> over<00:03:54.260> from<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:55.370> mini<00:03:55.550> bowl<00:03:55.820> into<00:03:56.150> the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
air over from the mini bowl into the

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.990 
air over from the mini bowl into the
balloons<00:03:56.840> it<00:03:57.380> was<00:03:57.500> just<00:03:57.650> scary<00:03:57.740> cuz<00:03:58.220> just

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
balloons it was just scary cuz just

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.900 
balloons it was just scary cuz just
landing<00:03:59.390> on<00:03:59.480> those<00:03:59.690> ones<00:04:00.020> you<00:04:00.440> don't<00:04:00.560> know<00:04:00.910> if
