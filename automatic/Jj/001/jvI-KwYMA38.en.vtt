had<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> second<00:01:50.850> tape<00:01:51.030> do<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.450> same<00:01:51.659> thing

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
had a second tape do the same thing

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.600 
had a second tape do the same thing
while<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.649> first<00:01:52.890> thing<00:01:53.070> just<00:01:53.100> sat<00:01:53.460> in<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
while the first thing just sat in the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.800 
while the first thing just sat in the
corner<00:01:53.850> with<00:01:54.090> his<00:01:54.329> anima<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.460> thanked<00:01:56.460> him<00:01:56.810> we

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
corner with his anima and thanked him we

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.450 
corner with his anima and thanked him we
actually<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.469> think<00:01:58.560> we<00:01:58.799> got<00:01:58.920> away<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.130> three

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
actually I think we got away with three

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.770 
actually I think we got away with three
tanks<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.060> because<00:02:00.270> all<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.630> really

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
tanks on this because all you really

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.440 
tanks on this because all you really
need<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> do<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.649> you'll<00:02:02.490> have<00:02:02.640> by<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.210> time

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
need to do is you'll have by the time

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.700 
need to do is you'll have by the time
you're<00:02:03.630> done<00:02:03.659> using<00:02:03.930> our<00:02:04.170> strat<00:02:04.439> you'll<00:02:04.590> have

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
you're done using our strat you'll have

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.109 
you're done using our strat you'll have
two<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> large<00:02:05.310> ones<00:02:05.579> up<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.030> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
two of the large ones up and then you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.399 
two of the large ones up and then you
activate<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.600> dark<00:02:06.810> animus

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
activate the dark animus

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.749 
activate the dark animus
the<00:02:07.590> reason<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.890> don't<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.250> activate<00:02:08.610> dark

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the reason you don't want activate dark

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880 
the reason you don't want activate dark
animus<00:02:09.149> early<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.289> fight<00:02:10.500> is<00:02:10.709> because

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
animus early in this fight is because

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070 
animus early in this fight is because
what<00:02:11.250> happens<00:02:11.640> is<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.030> more<00:02:12.209> little<00:02:12.510> ads<00:02:12.720> or

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
what happens is the more little ads or

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.380 
what happens is the more little ads or
ads<00:02:13.290> period<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.160> are<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.400> when<00:02:14.910> he<00:02:15.030> does<00:02:15.209> his

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
ads period that are up when he does his

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.059 
ads period that are up when he does his
animus<00:02:15.810> safe<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.200> he<00:02:16.290> will<00:02:16.410> absorb<00:02:16.739> all<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
animus safe and he will absorb all the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.070 
animus safe and he will absorb all the
anima<00:02:17.400> into<00:02:17.700> him<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.450> want<00:02:18.690> to<00:02:18.750> try<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> get

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
anima into him so you want to try to get

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.690 
anima into him so you want to try to get
as<00:02:19.170> many<00:02:19.349> of<00:02:19.470> these<00:02:19.530> little<00:02:19.860> ads<00:02:20.040> absorbed

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
as many of these little ads absorbed

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.280 
as many of these little ads absorbed
into<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> two<00:02:21.299> big<00:02:21.510> heads<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:21.840> you<00:02:21.959> possibly

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
into the two big heads as you possibly

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.280 
into the two big heads as you possibly
can<00:02:22.470> before<00:02:22.620> activating<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.640> dark<00:02:23.849> anima

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
can before activating the dark anima

can before activating the dark anima
once<00:02:25.290> he<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.670> do<00:02:26.819> not<00:02:26.940> really<00:02:27.150> worried

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
once he is up you do not really worried

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.789 
once he is up you do not really worried
about<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:27.780> ads<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.290> burn<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> boss

over to dark animus and burn him down
it's<00:02:43.470> also<00:02:43.650> probably<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.400> good<00:02:44.579> recommend<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it's also probably a good recommend a

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.610 
it's also probably a good recommend a
strategy<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.480> leave<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.780> second<00:02:46.230> little<00:02:46.410> one
