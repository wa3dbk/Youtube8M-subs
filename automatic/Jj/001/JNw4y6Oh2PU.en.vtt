 talked about the whole team that we decided 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.100
 to finally go it costs anyway 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 a little bit expensive facts that we all

 lucky there in history but yeah 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.580
 but what exactly is this process 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 know it to go play in a team 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.719
 all the European teams 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.640
 close to worst kind the chance to perform 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.260
 for days and then if you are 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.690
 selected you will play you will play 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.550
 in a league in italy beh if I am 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.379
 really lucky since I opened my 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.699
 best game to have a contract then 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.350
 I could I could find myself 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.390
 good years but who knows no luck 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.600
 if your talent between your two is going to be 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.839
 lucky not luck but yeah we 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.000
 can say that 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.439
 inspires an email failing but yeah but 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.640
 you're going to say it because there is 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.950
 would only have two in canada 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.929
 so it's something and then everything plays 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.179
 which team is currently playing 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.039

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:20.049
 competition just finished who is 

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:21.670
 next year I see that is what 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.810
 will happen there in our plans everything is 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.709
 what it was a dream for all to go 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.619
 play in europe 

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:27.939
 but in italy I join past this is 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.380
 sure all the players they have 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:31.450
 always a dream to play with the real 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.619
 madrid does all that but yeah but there 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.069
 I'm really happy that it 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.500
 I happen 

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:36.069
 you know you're interac game 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.720
 professional 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.819
 yeah that's always been my dream since 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.679
 always that the efforts to build 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.310
 now that these rewards and I 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:48.369
 account is what you said about her 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.869
 bendel is samuel eto'o play him little 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.179
 in europe and georges here now but 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.469
 according to the director is going to be very 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.899
 Happy is his favorite player 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.829
 oh yeah that's why they like it 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.810
 as it is what they play at the same 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.579
 position yourself well no actually you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 do not play the same position at all and 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:05.079
 attacker since the defender but 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.060
 that's the way it works it gives 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:08.679
 money his country that just like his 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.810
 salary and then I really like this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.899
 attitude sometimes we will wish good 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.899
 luck
