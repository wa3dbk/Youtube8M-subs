purchased that is just rude too strong

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
purchased that is just rude too strong
so<00:00:28.619> I've<00:00:28.710> been<00:00:28.800> looking<00:00:28.890> for<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.490> use<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
so I've been looking for a way to use it

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.609 
so I've been looking for a way to use it
up<00:00:30.210> without<00:00:30.390> having<00:00:30.660> to<00:00:30.900> put<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.199> in<00:00:31.289> my<00:00:31.410> mouth

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
up without having to put it in my mouth

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.370 
up without having to put it in my mouth
so<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.070> said<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.120> perfect<00:00:33.780> for<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.050> let

me give it a shot normally what I would

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.450 
me give it a shot normally what I would
do<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:37.020> test<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> then

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
do is just test it out first and then

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580

coming<00:02:20.400> off<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.380> some<00:02:22.830> dead<00:02:23.100> skin

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
coming off and there was some dead skin

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.160 
coming off and there was some dead skin
in<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:24.810> pail<00:02:25.350> there<00:02:25.890> as<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.910> saw<00:02:27.210> and<00:02:27.600> like

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
in the pail there as you saw and like

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.680 
in the pail there as you saw and like
right<00:02:28.440> here<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.040> heel<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:30.180> can<00:02:30.330> see<00:02:30.540> that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
right here on my heel you can see that

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.620 
right here on my heel you can see that
there<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:30.960> some<00:02:31.200> dead<00:02:31.440> skin<00:02:32.240> but<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.450> not

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
there is some dead skin but it's not

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.480 
there is some dead skin but it's not
exactly<00:02:33.810> coming<00:02:34.530> off<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.950> its<00:02:35.220> own

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
exactly coming off on its own

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.790 
exactly coming off on its own
you<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.270> I<00:02:36.300> will<00:02:36.570> need<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.900> take<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.380> pumice

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
you know I will need to take a pumice

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.670 
you know I will need to take a pumice
stone<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.520> afterwards<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.960> it<00:02:40.080> did<00:02:40.230> loosen

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
stone to it afterwards but it did loosen

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.680 
stone to it afterwards but it did loosen
it<00:02:40.770> up<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.160> lot<00:02:41.400> more<00:02:41.640> than<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:41.850> had<00:02:42.090> expected<00:02:42.209> it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
it up a lot more than I had expected it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.900 
it up a lot more than I had expected it
to<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.590> there's<00:02:43.920> what<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> water<00:02:44.400> looks<00:02:44.640> like

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
to and there's what the water looks like

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.470 
to and there's what the water looks like
after<00:02:45.390> took<00:02:45.540> my<00:02:45.690> feet<00:02:45.930> out<00:02:46.610> you<00:02:47.610> can<00:02:47.760> see<00:02:47.940> some

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
after took my feet out you can see some

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.130 
after took my feet out you can see some
dead<00:02:48.900> skin<00:02:49.170> floating<00:02:49.830> emitter<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.570> did<00:02:52.020> it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
dead skin floating emitter so did it

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.699 
dead skin floating emitter so did it
work<00:02:52.250> yeah<00:02:53.510> it's<00:02:54.510> not<00:02:54.720> one<00:02:55.020> of<00:02:55.050> those<00:02:55.170> mixtures

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
work yeah it's not one of those mixtures

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.979 
work yeah it's not one of those mixtures
that<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:56.100> will<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.610> likely<00:02:56.640> go<00:02:57.150> back<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
that I will more likely go back to to

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.630 
that I will more likely go back to to
remove<00:02:58.290> dead<00:02:58.530> skin<00:02:58.739> for<00:02:59.070> my<00:02:59.190> feet<00:02:59.459> I'll

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
remove dead skin for my feet I'll

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.790 
remove dead skin for my feet I'll
probably<00:02:59.910> rely<00:03:00.330> more<00:03:00.630> on<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.870> pumice<00:03:01.290> stone<00:03:01.320> or

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
probably rely more on a pumice stone or

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.280 
probably rely more on a pumice stone or
the<00:03:02.400> pedegg<00:03:02.640> like<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.180> normally<00:03:03.239> do<00:03:03.780> to<00:03:03.959> remove

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
the pedegg like I normally do to remove

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.340 
the pedegg like I normally do to remove
the<00:03:04.560> dead<00:03:04.739> skin<00:03:04.770> from<00:03:05.040> my<00:03:05.310> feet<00:03:05.700> well<00:03:06.540> hello<00:03:06.900> I

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
the dead skin from my feet well hello I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.680 
the dead skin from my feet well hello I
feel<00:03:08.100> like<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.550> reason<00:03:08.730> I<00:03:09.090> didn't<00:03:09.480> see

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
feel like the reason I didn't see

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.170 
feel like the reason I didn't see
instant<00:03:10.470> results<00:03:11.070> is<00:03:11.220> probably<00:03:11.640> because<00:03:12.000> I

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
instant results is probably because I

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.260 
instant results is probably because I
did<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:12.900> do<00:03:13.230> my<00:03:13.440> feet<00:03:13.709> very<00:03:14.130> recently<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:15.090> get

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
did just do my feet very recently to get

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.470 
did just do my feet very recently to get
the<00:03:15.600> excess<00:03:16.020> skin<00:03:16.200> off<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.830> them<00:03:17.070> so<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:18.209> is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the excess skin off of them so that is

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.090 
the excess skin off of them so that is
another<00:03:18.750> reason<00:03:19.020> why<00:03:19.380> there<00:03:19.620> probably<00:03:19.890> wasn't

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
another reason why there probably wasn't

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
another reason why there probably wasn't
a<00:03:20.190> lot<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.370> dead<00:03:20.640> skin<00:03:20.670> for<00:03:21.120> me<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.390> if<00:03:21.510> you're

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
a lot of dead skin for me so if you're

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.630 
a lot of dead skin for me so if you're
someone<00:03:22.170> that<00:03:22.320> doesn't<00:03:22.650> do<00:03:23.010> your<00:03:23.220> feet<00:03:23.459> that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
someone that doesn't do your feet that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.910 
someone that doesn't do your feet that
often<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.720> might<00:03:24.900> actually<00:03:25.140> benefit<00:03:25.680> more

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
often you might actually benefit more

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.590 
often you might actually benefit more
from<00:03:25.980> doing<00:03:26.489> something<00:03:26.700> like<00:03:26.820> this<00:03:27.150> than<00:03:27.420> I

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
from doing something like this than I

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.550 
from doing something like this than I
did<00:03:27.930> but<00:03:28.320> so<00:03:29.310> will<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.610> do<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.910> again<00:03:30.560> probably

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
did but so will I do it again probably

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.340 
did but so will I do it again probably
not<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:32.180> enjoyed<00:03:33.180> doing<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.660> experiment<00:03:34.290> I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
not I enjoyed doing the experiment I

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.930 
not I enjoyed doing the experiment I
enjoyed<00:03:34.650> sharing<00:03:34.920> it<00:03:35.220> with<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:35.730> if<00:03:35.850> you

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
enjoyed sharing it with you here if you

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.060 
enjoyed sharing it with you here if you
want<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> try<00:03:36.420> it<00:03:36.480> definitely<00:03:37.110> try<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.440> it<00:03:37.739> does

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
want to try it definitely try it it does

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.390 
want to try it definitely try it it does
leave<00:03:38.400> your<00:03:38.640> feet<00:03:38.910> feeling<00:03:39.330> very<00:03:39.660> cool<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:40.470> it

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
leave your feet feeling very cool and it

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.190 
leave your feet feeling very cool and it
actually<00:03:41.850> relieves<00:03:42.510> a<00:03:42.780> little<00:03:43.020> bit<00:03:43.140> of

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
actually relieves a little bit of

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.410 
actually relieves a little bit of
attention<00:03:43.410> and<00:03:43.739> I<00:03:43.860> think<00:03:44.070> that

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
attention and I think that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.660 
attention and I think that
from<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.750> Listerine<00:03:45.200> mixture<00:03:45.680> that's<00:03:45.860> put<00:03:46.550> in

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
from the Listerine mixture that's put in
there<00:03:46.880> so<00:03:47.120> do<00:03:47.690> give<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.960> try<00:03:48.319> if<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.709> have<00:03:48.860> extra
