00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello and good day welcome too 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.980
 Notebook help center to a new one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.599
 follow in a new year 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.540
 I wish you a happy first 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.260
 new year and I hope you are 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.010
 slipped healthier into the year than me 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.650
 my voice is a bit funny 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:26.340
 but it works so I will this time 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:29.429
 explain how to make a laptop specific 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 I have sony vaio now 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.980
 you take those back again 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.059
 put on the factory state or on 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.260
 I'll show you fresh 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.300
 There are just two different variants 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.899
 So then we first see the laptop 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.820
 old 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:53.210
 on the laptop is a key that is 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:56.879
 pink inscribed there is assist on it 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.430
 once the computer is not on 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.800
 press the button a club but 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.570
 simply on the assist victim is knopp 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.450
 press once and wait 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.659
 the laptop is then tackle the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.229
 option on the screen was ok 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.509
 Rescue mode from which we choose 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.939
 then either with the mouse or the 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.850
 Restore keyboard system or 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.330
 maintain or press f10 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.409
 if that also happens next, it will appear 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.810
 window calm keyboard layout select 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.640
 there you will be his 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.479
 keyboard from me German 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.820
 English or whatever the language 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.920
 We would like to take a break 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.420
 German 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 then it goes on to the next one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.729
 Select window option 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.310
 as long as we see then continue 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.220
 device use problem treatment and pc 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.450
 turn off because we have a problem 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.759
 we go to the problem treatment in the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.310
 next window we will see the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.439
 option pc refresh original 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.259
 recreate settings like that 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.840
 Manufacturing maintenance and advanced 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.630
 options so I explain that completely 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.270
 short 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.970
 Refresh pc is an option you can 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.490
 should choose if you just the pc 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.460
 to say so once 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.500
 So want klien renovate clean 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.740
 On top of that I know so little 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.890
 fault drivers or such 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.020
 little things 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.980
 then you can not do that 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.020
 data lost 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.900
 So there you do not need to be afraid 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.720
 neither your own pictures nor the music 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.320
 still the videos or programs go 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
 lost 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.220
 the single the only point where it stops 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.680
 a bit critical if you are 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.810
 has installed programs then go 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.390
 so to speak, flutes because the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.280
 Registry database refreshed 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.440
 was reset to the standard 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.970
 But in most cases it can 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.680
 one then still holds the programs 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.560
 use even if not registered 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.600
 you have to stop on the computer 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 watch 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:05.440
 otherwise just reinstall otherwise 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:09.490
 as I said the pictures and so stay 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.500
 the most important thing always so original 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.630
 restore settings that is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.440
 turn a little differently 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.420
 then really pictures videos music all 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.750
 possible data away that means, so to speak 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.310
 simply original resistance of this 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.960
 comes original setting again 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.580
 produce as in the factory state so there 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.290
 it does not need to tell any more 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.870
 restoration and maintenance 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.640
 that's a bit more complicated 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.340
 I will definitely be in another 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.650
 video something to tell if 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.270
 interest is simply one 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.580
 Write a comment below 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.160
 I will take care of it and you 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.540
 help so we choose then 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.440
 of course original settings again 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.209
 make out and the rest done 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.560
 then so to speak by itself and so 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.750
 then pay attention to the screen 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.060
 keep pushing old read a bit and 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:10.200
 the computer will then stop number 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.200
 Reboot installs of may 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.849
 That's it, that's it 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.859
 The most important problem is always this 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:22.180
 actually come in the rest of the menu 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.260
 then do it yourself as that 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.600
 It would actually be from my side 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.820
 from I thank you that you again 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.780
 have watched as I hope I could 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:34.449
 you do a great favor with it and 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.800
 I'm glad that if you in the next 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.930
 be back in the video 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.289
 There are always interesting things 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.810
 When I ask, I am very open and ask 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.919
 you write me comments below 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.889
 She subscribes and you are always 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:54.880
 on the latest addition to the latest 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.949
 stood so then I wish you still 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.949
 have a nice day and stay healthy
