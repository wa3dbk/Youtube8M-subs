00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
left in that onion will want to keep

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.459 
left in that onion will want to keep
growing<00:01:28.649> so<00:01:29.069> it'll<00:01:29.460> pull<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.789> moisture<00:01:30.469> out

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:31.469

growing so it'll pull the moisture out
of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.920> onions<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.399> the<00:01:32.520> onion<00:01:32.789> bulb<00:01:32.999> will<00:01:33.149> dry

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
of the onions so the onion bulb will dry

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
of the onions so the onion bulb will dry
up<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.840> shrivel<00:01:33.899> up<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.560> you'll<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.280> a

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
up and shrivel up and you'll get a

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.300 
up and shrivel up and you'll get a
little<00:01:35.609> green<00:01:35.850> chute<00:01:36.799> so<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:37.979> one's<00:01:38.130> not

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
little green chute so that one's not

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.020 
little green chute so that one's not
ready<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.729> store<00:01:40.100> so<00:01:41.100> these<00:01:41.310> these<00:01:41.969> are

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
ready to store so these these are

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
ready to store so these these are
perfect<00:01:42.649> several<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> these<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:43.889> here<00:01:44.219> are

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
perfect several of these in here are

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
perfect several of these in here are
ready<00:01:45.170> but<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.289> they<00:01:46.409> stay<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> ground<00:01:47.009> a

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
ready but if they stay in the ground a

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.370 
ready but if they stay in the ground a
few<00:01:47.219> extra<00:01:47.670> days<00:01:47.850> it's<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.020> going<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> hurt

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
few extra days it's not going to hurt

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
few extra days it's not going to hurt
anything<00:01:50.899> the<00:01:51.899> red<00:01:52.079> onions<00:01:52.639> they're<00:01:53.639> a<00:01:53.670> little

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
anything the red onions they're a little

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.469 
anything the red onions they're a little
smaller<00:01:55.249> some<00:01:56.249> of<00:01:56.369> them<00:01:56.490> already<00:01:56.579> some<00:01:57.149> aren't

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
smaller some of them already some aren't

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.300 
smaller some of them already some aren't
I<00:01:58.399> experimented<00:01:59.399> over<00:01:59.789> here<00:02:00.920> with<00:02:01.920> cutting

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
I experimented over here with cutting

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.580 
I experimented over here with cutting
the<00:02:02.459> tops<00:02:02.789> off<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> them<00:02:03.420> because<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.840> had<00:02:04.259> heard

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the tops off of them because I had heard

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.699 
the tops off of them because I had heard
that<00:02:05.459> that<00:02:05.639> would<00:02:05.789> make<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.090> bulbs<00:02:06.420> bigger

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
that that would make the bulbs bigger

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.169 
that that would make the bulbs bigger
