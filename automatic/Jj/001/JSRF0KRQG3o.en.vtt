so<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.190> we<00:01:17.280> go<00:01:17.310> now<00:01:17.670> I'm<00:01:18.660> not<00:01:18.930> going<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so there we go now I'm not going to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.930 
so there we go now I'm not going to
extend<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.620> fully<00:01:19.890> because<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.610> don't<00:01:20.790> have

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
extend it fully because I don't have

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.220 
extend it fully because I don't have
that<00:01:21.180> much<00:01:21.420> space<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.900> my<00:01:21.930> room<00:01:22.430> but<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.230> 166

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
centimeters it's actually about 164 65

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.610 
centimeters it's actually about 164 65
ish<00:01:31.860> okay<00:01:32.160> so<00:01:32.670> it's<00:01:32.850> not<00:01:32.970> quite<00:01:33.290> all<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.500> way

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
ish okay so it's not quite all the way

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.420 
ish okay so it's not quite all the way
to<00:01:34.680> 166<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.410> it's<00:01:37.410> nearly<00:01:37.710> right<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> box

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to 166 but it's nearly right on the box

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.540 
to 166 but it's nearly right on the box
and<00:01:39.620> so<00:01:40.700> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.000> one<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:43.410> this<00:01:43.950> part<00:01:44.280> is
