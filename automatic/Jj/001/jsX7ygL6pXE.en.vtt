00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.170
 just like football like the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.670
 taekwondo like karate we see 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.040
 that in this sport you need to warm up 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.990
 at the beginning and take certain exercises 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.940

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.219

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.820
 what we call resistance 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.220
 to the explosive force we see that many 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.990
 times in football we are a long time 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 static we stood for a long time 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.760
 playing the football game here in the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.340
 boxing we are not in constant motion 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.880
 we are not static as I was saying in the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.890
