replace your regulator if you've got one
of<00:00:23.880> those<00:00:23.970> big<00:00:24.359> old<00:00:24.720> red<00:00:24.960> regulators<00:00:25.619> that's

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
of those big old red regulators that's

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.830 
of those big old red regulators that's
about<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.580> big<00:00:26.640> with<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> big<00:00:27.330> knob<00:00:27.539> on<00:00:27.810> it

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
about this big with the big knob on it

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.450 
about this big with the big knob on it
get<00:00:28.650> rid<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.890> it

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
get rid of it

get rid of it
they're<00:00:30.029> very<00:00:30.240> slow<00:00:30.570> they<00:00:31.439> don't<00:00:31.650> put<00:00:31.830> out

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
they're very slow they don't put out

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.069 
they're very slow they don't put out
enough<00:00:32.219> psi<00:00:32.730> they<00:00:33.030> don't<00:00:33.210> let<00:00:33.570> enough<00:00:33.840> gas

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
enough psi they don't let enough gas

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.139 
enough psi they don't let enough gas
flow<00:00:34.410> up<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> machine<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.910> allow

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
flow up to the machine to really allow

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.440 
flow up to the machine to really allow
that<00:00:36.210> machine<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.930> get<00:00:37.380> popping<00:00:37.829> good<00:00:38.450> one

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that machine to get get popping good one

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.000 
that machine to get get popping good one
of<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> critical<00:00:40.020> things<00:00:40.290> when<00:00:40.860> you're

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
of the critical things when you're

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
of the critical things when you're
popping<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.760> make<00:00:41.910> sure<00:00:41.940> that<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.450> popcorn

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
popping is to make sure that the popcorn

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
popping is to make sure that the popcorn
is<00:00:43.110> hit<00:00:43.260> with<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> lot<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.739> heat<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.730> pops<00:00:45.000> up

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is hit with a lot of heat and it pops up

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.440 
is hit with a lot of heat and it pops up
quickly<00:00:45.809> okay<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.280> popcorn<00:00:47.520> blows<00:00:48.149> up

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
quickly okay and the popcorn blows up

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
quickly okay and the popcorn blows up
big<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.320> looks<00:00:49.500> fantastic<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.399> their

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
big and that looks fantastic in their

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.729 
big and that looks fantastic in their
bags<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.079> helps<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.710> only

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
bags and it just it helps out not only

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.319 
bags and it just it helps out not only
that<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.219> it<00:00:53.340> increases<00:00:53.820> your<00:00:53.850> revenue

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that but it increases your revenue

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.930 
that but it increases your revenue
because<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:54.989> machines<00:00:55.350> much<00:00:55.649> faster<00:00:56.160> okay<00:00:56.850> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
because your machines much faster okay I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
because your machines much faster okay I
want<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> show<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.390> something<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.829> our
