okay she is there's no gap here okay
next<00:03:25.790> time<00:03:26.030> I'm<00:03:26.780> going<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.170> show<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.440> how<00:03:28.400> to

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
next time I'm going to show you how to

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.270 
next time I'm going to show you how to
take<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:29.120> apart<00:03:29.900> for<00:03:30.620> example<00:03:31.010> if<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.250> make

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
take this apart for example if you make

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.730 
take this apart for example if you make
a<00:03:31.520> mistake<00:03:31.790> what<00:03:32.720> do<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.900> do<00:03:33.080> this<00:03:33.320> is<00:03:33.470> very

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740 
a mistake what do you do this is very

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.260 
a mistake what do you do this is very
tough<00:03:34.900> so<00:03:35.900> we'll<00:03:36.140> do<00:03:36.470> is<00:03:36.890> use<00:03:37.250> the<00:03:37.970> combination

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
tough so we'll do is use the combination

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:46.150 
tough so we'll do is use the combination
of<00:03:38.690> fire

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.550 

and<00:03:46.490> maybe<00:03:49.150> use<00:03:50.150> this<00:03:50.420> to<00:03:50.720> take<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.110> out<00:03:53.560> see

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
and maybe use this to take this out see

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.340 
and maybe use this to take this out see
this<00:03:54.980> 45<00:03:55.520> degree<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:56.000> like<00:03:56.210> this<00:03:56.420> if<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.170> want

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
this 45 degree is like this if you want

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.780 
this 45 degree is like this if you want
to<00:03:57.470> take<00:03:57.620> that<00:03:58.240> use<00:03:59.240> this<00:03:59.860> hammer<00:04:02.770> and<00:04:03.790> then

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
to take that use this hammer and then

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.010 
to take that use this hammer and then
afterwards<00:04:05.450> we<00:04:05.810> use<00:04:06.110> this<00:04:06.350> to<00:04:07.070> take<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.370> down

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
afterwards we use this to take it down

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:20.650 
afterwards we use this to take it down
there's<00:04:11.350> another<00:04:18.850> how<00:04:19.850> do<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.120> leave<00:04:20.450> this

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:20.660 
there's another how do you leave this

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:26.650 
there's another how do you leave this
out<00:04:21.190> you<00:04:22.190> have<00:04:22.250> to<00:04:23.080> interleave<00:04:24.080> them<00:04:25.660> for

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
out you have to interleave them for

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:38.140 
out you have to interleave them for
example<00:04:27.080> interleaf<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:28.190> certain<00:04:29.530> laws<00:04:37.150> yeah

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
example interleaf in certain laws yeah

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.750 
example interleaf in certain laws yeah
so<00:04:38.420> you<00:04:38.510> have<00:04:38.600> to<00:04:38.780> plan<00:04:39.650> ahead<00:04:39.920> because<00:04:40.310> this

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
so you have to plan ahead because this

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.450 
so you have to plan ahead because this
when<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:41.300> get<00:04:41.480> this<00:04:41.690> up<00:04:41.990> or<00:04:42.260> not<00:04:42.920> be<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.250> same

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
when you get this up or not be the same

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.840 
when you get this up or not be the same
length<00:04:43.730> but<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:44.810> cut<00:04:45.050> different<00:04:45.500> lines<00:04:45.850> so

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
length but it's cut different lines so

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.380 
length but it's cut different lines so
you<00:04:47.380> need<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.500> start<00:04:48.830> from<00:04:49.010> where<00:04:49.220> one<00:04:49.790> end<00:04:50.180> and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390 
you need to start from where one end and

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.410 
you need to start from where one end and
introduce<00:04:51.200> them<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.890> have<00:04:52.130> a<00:04:52.160> different<00:04:52.730> lens

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
introduce them and have a different lens

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.970 
introduce them and have a different lens
and<00:04:54.400> plan<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.670> whole<00:04:55.880> row<00:04:56.180> first<00:04:56.720> before<00:04:57.410> you

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
and plan the whole row first before you

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:19.150 
and plan the whole row first before you
nail<00:04:58.190> them

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:06:02.300 

everything<00:05:19.940> lined<00:05:20.210> up

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:14.290 

I

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:22.899 

Oh

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:22.909 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.589 

what<00:06:23.300> you<00:06:23.389> do<00:06:23.629> is<00:06:24.020> use<00:06:24.860> the<00:06:25.069> table<00:06:25.459> saw<00:06:25.639> to<00:06:26.360> cut

00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 
what you do is use the table saw to cut

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:36.040 
what you do is use the table saw to cut
a<00:06:27.080> strip<00:06:27.469> of<00:06:27.529> this<00:06:34.119> together<00:06:35.119> and<00:06:35.509> use<00:06:35.749> some

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
a strip of this together and use some

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.449 
a strip of this together and use some
glue<00:06:36.349> to<00:06:36.379> glue<00:06:36.830> them<00:06:37.209> that's<00:06:38.209> just<00:06:38.330> one<00:06:38.779> tip

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:39.459 
glue to glue them that's just one tip

00:06:39.459 --> 00:06:46.350 
glue to glue them that's just one tip
when<00:06:40.459> you<00:06:40.580> have<00:06:40.699> a<00:06:40.729> good<00:06:40.939> tool<00:06:41.179> if<00:06:42.399> you<00:06:43.399> have<00:06:43.699> a

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:46.360 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.309 

town<00:06:47.360> to<00:06:47.389> town<00:06:47.929> what<00:06:48.229> do<00:06:48.349> you<00:06:48.469> do<00:06:50.319> that's

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 
town to town what do you do that's

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:55.659 
town to town what do you do that's
another<00:06:51.919> thing<00:06:52.369> is<00:06:52.639> that<00:06:52.969> is<00:06:53.209> easy<00:06:54.369> so<00:06:55.369> first

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669 
another thing is that is easy so first

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:57.669 
another thing is that is easy so first
you<00:06:55.849> need<00:06:56.059> to<00:06:56.089> use<00:06:56.269> the<00:06:56.389> tables<00:06:56.749> saw<00:06:57.169> take<00:06:57.499> the

00:06:57.669 --> 00:06:57.679 
you need to use the tables saw take the

00:06:57.679 --> 00:07:02.909 
you need to use the tables saw take the
town<00:06:57.919> house<00:06:58.189> and<00:06:58.569> then<00:06:59.919> flip<00:07:00.919> this<00:07:01.189> this<00:07:02.149> way

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 
town house and then flip this this way

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.040 
town house and then flip this this way
so<00:07:03.919> the<00:07:04.159> table<00:07:04.580> saw<00:07:04.789> will<00:07:05.179> kind<00:07:05.419> of<00:07:05.539> groove<00:07:05.869> to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
so the table saw will kind of groove to

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.459 
so the table saw will kind of groove to
here<00:07:06.399> so<00:07:07.399> one<00:07:07.639> of<00:07:07.669> them<00:07:08.059> can<00:07:08.629> be<00:07:08.689> tough<00:07:09.080> and<00:07:09.409> the

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
here so one of them can be tough and the

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:16.329 
here so one of them can be tough and the
other<00:07:09.679> one<00:07:09.979> you<00:07:10.519> need<00:07:10.699> to<00:07:10.789> create<00:07:11.089> a<00:07:11.119> groove<00:07:15.339> a

00:07:16.329 --> 00:07:16.339 
other one you need to create a groove a

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:19.659 
other one you need to create a groove a
very<00:07:17.300> easy<00:07:18.110> effective<00:07:18.800> way<00:07:18.979> to<00:07:19.039> create<00:07:19.279> a<00:07:19.459> nice

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
very easy effective way to create a nice

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:22.959 
very easy effective way to create a nice
floor<00:07:20.029> dr.<00:07:20.539> John<00:07:20.749> here<00:07:21.080> has<00:07:21.589> put<00:07:22.429> in<00:07:22.639> all<00:07:22.939> of
