00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.670
 when a person who is overweight or 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.130
 Obesity enter a gym or start 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.440
 do some physical activity first 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.510
 what he's going to do is make an emphasis 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 Bashar almost all his training almost 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.720
 all your physical activity in exercises 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.739
 aerobics like running like being in the 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 treadmill on the elliptical bike 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:27.360
 cardio more than anything 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:31.520
 and this is a mistake I'm going to tell you 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.450
 because first of all 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.880
 a person even if he has excess fat 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.800
 body should be doing 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.410
 Strength and resistance exercises 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.790
 physical the muscular endurance should 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.760
 be doing these exercises if you 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.770
 has the idea or the belief that at 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.930
 do these exercises the fat is going to 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.040
 transform into muscle are going to be 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.750
 muscles like spotlights is going to have this 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.080
 strange bodily modification that by 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.379
 some physiological reason will happen what 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.379
 which does not happen but you have this belief 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.500
 the exercise of strength something that is going to 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.470
 toast is going to be a hormonal stimulus going 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.170
 to be a muscular stimulus 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.050
 and you have to remember that the more 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.680
 muscle have a person his metabolism 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:27.020
 basal will be more effective will burn 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.690
 more calories for the simple fact of 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.060
 be alive for having more muscle 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.430
 so how big does it compensate not and this 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.550
 it's a very big benefit for 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.980
 people for all but in specific 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.140
 for these people who want to lose 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.270
 large amounts of body fat by 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.119
 other side 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.909
 too much cardio could 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.649
 causing the opposite could cause a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.590
 muscle loss I'm talking about 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.450
 in excess a cardiovascular exercise 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.579
 excessive could cause a loss of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.920
 muscle mass and it would happen just what 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.380
 contrary to what I already mentioned and what is 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.929
 what is desirable then is another aspect that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.149
 we have to take into account that we 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.950
 it can harm 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.560
 another point is for example if it is a 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.090
 person who has a lot of excess weight 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:22.250
 and it's running 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.810
 joints knees could 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.150
 and charge bill for so much impact 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.530
 then it is another point against that is 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.690
 what we intend what is what 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.580
 pretend in a matter of training 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.180
 we pretend to load weight we pretend 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.850
 load a lot and we pretend to load well 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.070
 Strength and resistance exercises 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.550
 muscle are the most effective for 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.530
 lose weight rather to lose fat 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.150
 body because the weight and fat are 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.440
 two different things then if one 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.959
 person is overweight does not 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 they have to be based on the weight in 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.819
 yes but rather in the percentage of 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.849
 fat that is what you want to lower 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.889
 finally in a matter of food 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:08.420
 It's useless if the person makes two 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:12.489
 cardio hours and eat the 500 600 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.519
 calories that you lost in the exercise the 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:17.950
 recover so to speak of food not 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.989
 so good in energy matters 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.810
 we would equal 600 calories 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 lose 600 calories are earned here 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.629
 then that is the point to take 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.650
 into account and the feeding is going to be what 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:35.659
 most important for the modification of 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.120
 body composition if the person 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.879
 you want to lose fat you have to make one 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.659
 strength training and two one 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.659
 feeding 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.420
 basically low in carbohydrates that 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.239
 So low is very subjective and depends on 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.610
 the person but basically low in 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.340
 moderate fat carbohydrates proteins 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:00.849
 moderate elevations in the same way as 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.709
 so much is quite subjective low in 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.300
 Carbohydrates for me can be something 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.390
 totally very different from low in 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:12.460
 carbohydrates for a person who runs 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:15.040
 marathons is a good example 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:18.240
 I hope you have served them and spoke to them very 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.240
 soon chao
