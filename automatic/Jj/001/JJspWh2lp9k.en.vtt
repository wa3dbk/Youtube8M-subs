00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
fiber art shaped shook it at the same

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.680 
fiber art shaped shook it at the same
time<00:00:35.309> I<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:35.610> working<00:00:35.969> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.120> crown<00:00:36.360> Mountain

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
time I was working on the crown Mountain

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.600 
time I was working on the crown Mountain
Farms<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.200> Atlantis<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> just<00:00:38.250> got<00:00:38.399> done

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
Farms the Atlantis that I just got done

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.530 
Farms the Atlantis that I just got done
so<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> said<00:00:39.780> why<00:00:39.930> don't<00:00:39.989> we<00:00:40.610> split<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.850> whatever

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
so I said why don't we split it whatever

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.330 
so I said why don't we split it whatever
we<00:00:42.719> end<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:43.020> finishing<00:00:43.230> let's<00:00:43.710> split<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
we end up finishing let's split it in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.220 
we end up finishing let's split it in
switch<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.090> then<00:00:45.420> we<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.719> keep<00:00:45.870> doing<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
switch and then we can keep doing that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.310 
switch and then we can keep doing that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
gosh having to spend another eight

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.730 
gosh having to spend another eight
ounces<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:48.149> would<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.810> we<00:01:48.930> would<00:01:49.140> split

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
ounces we would take and we would split

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
ounces we would take and we would split
the<00:01:49.860> fiber<00:01:50.189> beforehand<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.000> we<00:01:51.180> could<00:01:51.329> each

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the fiber beforehand so we could each

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810 
the fiber beforehand so we could each
spin<00:01:51.869> our<00:01:52.140> own<00:01:52.380> four<00:01:52.799> ounces<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:53.670> we're

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
spin our own four ounces and then we're

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.859 
spin our own four ounces and then we're
going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.000> do<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.570> comparison<00:01:55.229> shots<00:01:55.500> of
