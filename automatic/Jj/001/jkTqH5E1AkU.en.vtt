00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
I love about it is that it's got a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.740 
I love about it is that it's got a
patent<00:01:34.860> pending<00:01:35.009> design<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.240> back<00:01:36.420> you

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750

oh and there's one other thing I wanted
to<00:02:08.179> tell<00:02:08.450> you<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.709> product<00:02:10.099> also<00:02:10.489> has<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so you don't have to have a perfect 90

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.940 
so you don't have to have a perfect 90
degree<00:02:17.510> angle<00:02:17.900> again<00:02:18.290> that's<00:02:18.500> another<00:02:18.620> reason

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
degree angle again that's another reason

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.790 
degree angle again that's another reason
why<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.280> styrofoam<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:20.390> great<00:02:20.629> it'll<00:02:21.590> be<00:02:21.769> a

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
why the styrofoam is so great it'll be a

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.979 
why the styrofoam is so great it'll be a
little<00:02:21.980> flexible<00:02:22.330> for<00:02:23.330> these<00:02:23.450> old<00:02:23.720> houses

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
little flexible for these old houses

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.280 
little flexible for these old houses
that<00:02:24.290> we<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.860> but<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:27.260> actually

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
go on a vaulted ceiling as well so if

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.710 
go on a vaulted ceiling as well so if
your<00:02:30.160> ceiling<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.340> quite<00:02:31.819> 90<00:02:32.150> degrees<00:02:32.450> if

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
your ceiling is not quite 90 degrees if

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.680
