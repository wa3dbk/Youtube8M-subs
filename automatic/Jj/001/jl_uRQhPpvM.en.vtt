00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello this time I will show you very 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.200
 unusual and original hair weaving 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.599
 such a pigtail looks beautiful and 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.620
 loose hair and if hair 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.620
 collected in the tail 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.500
 separate the hair strand by dividing it by 2 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.890
 halves 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.690
 you now have the top and bottom strand behind 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:33.360
 see the top order under the bottom then 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:38.070
 place it between the strands and tie 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.410
 spin together now change hide and seek 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.680
 in some places so that the upper strand becomes 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.140
 lower strand shifting the upper strand to 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:53.070
 right hand and lower hand to left hand 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.830
 separate now strand on top start her 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.659
 under the bottom strand which consists of two 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:03.570
 place order 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:09.090
 upper strand between the beds and tie 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.729
 these strands together again change strands 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:18.570
 places that the upper strand turned 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:23.640
 again from the bottom then separate the following 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 strand on top we get it under the lower strand 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.310
 which also consists of two halves 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 put it between the beds 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.580
 and tie the strands together as we change 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.580
 hide and seek places 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:47.370
 separate the next strand from above start 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.370
 her under the bottom strand 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.320
 tie strands together change hide and seek 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.390
 places that the upper strand again 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:07.570
 turned out to be the bottom and so we continue 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.450
 weave further we separate also a lock of hair 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.420
 from above as you see with us always in 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.990
 weaving 2 main strands top and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.050
 we always enclose the upper strand 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.800
 under the bottom strand and and put between 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 strands 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.760
 tying them together we change the strands in some places 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.760
 so that the upper part is right below 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.170
 as you see weaving we get 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.859
 as if diagonally 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:52.469
 for this we just strand taken from above 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:52.469
 leave each time the length and 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.750
 separating the last strand from the edge 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.890
 fix it with all weave 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.890
 hair elastics 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.620
 now you can properly correct 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.620
 hide and seek 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:41.650
 It looks like our weaving on 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:48.129
 loose hair and so if you collect 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:50.859
 hair ponytail with side on it all 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:54.750
 thanks for watching and see you soon 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.750
