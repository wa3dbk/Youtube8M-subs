00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 

I'm<00:00:34.469> using<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.920> simply<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> basic<00:00:36.750> momentary

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
I'm using it simply as a basic momentary

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.540 
I'm using it simply as a basic momentary
switch<00:00:37.590> such<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> such<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.399> when

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
switch such that when so such that when

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.549 
switch such that when so such that when
the<00:00:41.640> Z<00:00:41.879> carriage<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.020> upward<00:00:43.200> position

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
the Z carriage is in the upward position
touching<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> switch<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.210> kills<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> laser

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
touching the switch it kills the laser

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.760 
touching the switch it kills the laser
it's<00:00:46.590> connected<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.250> TTL<00:00:48.379> pin<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
it's connected to the TTL pin on the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.840 
it's connected to the TTL pin on the
laser<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.899> pulls<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.559> ground<00:00:52.890> when

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
laser and it pulls that to ground when

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
laser and it pulls that to ground when
the<00:00:54.030> switch<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.360> depressed<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.949> makes<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the switch is depressed that makes it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.740 
the switch is depressed that makes it
such<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:58.219> it's<00:00:59.219> sort<00:00:59.609> of<00:00:59.699> default<00:01:00.120> position

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
such that it's sort of default position

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.160 
such that it's sort of default position
the<00:01:01.020> laser<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.649> off<00:01:02.359> when<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> Z<00:01:03.809> moves

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the laser is off when the Z moves

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
the laser is off when the Z moves
downward<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:04.920> just<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.460> fraction<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.119> inch

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
downward by just a fraction of an inch

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.359 
downward by just a fraction of an inch
and<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.570> mean<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> in<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.830> eight<00:01:08.070> one

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
and I mean like in like eight one

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.789 
and I mean like in like eight one
hundredths<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> an<00:01:08.939> inch<00:01:09.090> or<00:01:10.020> less<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.680> will

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
hundredths of an inch or less it will

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.560 
hundredths of an inch or less it will
fire<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.220> laser<00:01:11.960> so<00:01:13.549> let's<00:01:14.549> test<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.909> shall<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
fire the laser so let's test it shall we

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.359 
fire the laser so let's test it shall we
we're<00:01:16.259> gonna<00:01:16.350> turn<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.650> laser<00:01:16.799> but<00:01:17.100> hopefully

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
we're gonna turn the laser but hopefully

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.890 
we're gonna turn the laser but hopefully
this<00:01:17.520> won't<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:17.880> turn<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> laser<00:01:18.540> I

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.050 

don't<00:01:21.900> see<00:01:22.049> any<00:01:22.170> dot<00:01:22.350> on<00:01:22.680> my<00:01:23.070> camera<00:01:23.720> awesome

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
don't see any dot on my camera awesome

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.810 
don't see any dot on my camera awesome
okay<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.299> don't<00:01:28.170> see<00:01:28.380> any<00:01:28.500> smoke<00:01:28.670> now<00:01:29.670> we're

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
okay I don't see any smoke now we're

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
okay I don't see any smoke now we're
going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.970> set<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.450> jog<00:01:30.689> rate<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.140> one<00:01:31.850> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
going to set the jog rate to one and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.240 
going to set the jog rate to one and
we're<00:01:32.970> gonna<00:01:33.060> jog<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.750> z-axis<00:01:34.710> down<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
we're gonna jog this z-axis down just a

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.620 
we're gonna jog this z-axis down just a
little<00:01:35.280> bit<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.479> should<00:01:36.509> fire<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.049> laser

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
little bit and it should fire the laser

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:47.030 
little bit and it should fire the laser
whoa<00:01:41.750> back<00:01:42.750> up<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:43.200> lasers<00:01:43.500> off<00:01:44.329> well<00:01:45.979> as<00:01:46.979> a

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
whoa back up and lasers off well as a

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.620 
whoa back up and lasers off well as a
successful<00:01:47.490> test<00:01:48.020> the<00:01:49.020> idea<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:50.600> what<00:01:51.600> I

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
successful test the idea is that what I

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
successful test the idea is that what I
was<00:01:51.720> doing<00:01:51.780> before<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.500> cut<00:01:52.649> stuff<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.130> was

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
was doing before to cut stuff that I was

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.160 
was doing before to cut stuff that I was
having<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.579> move<00:01:53.729> way<00:01:54.090> up<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.600> by<00:01:54.930> like

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
having it move way up and down by like

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.410 
having it move way up and down by like
an<00:01:55.380> inch<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:56.820> was<00:01:56.939> doing<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.270> that

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
an inch and what that was doing is that

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.859 
an inch and what that was doing is that
was<00:01:57.540> having<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> object<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.500> focus<00:01:59.450> for<00:02:00.450> only

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
was having the object in focus for only

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.770 
was having the object in focus for only
a<00:02:00.979> second<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.100> then<00:02:02.189> moving<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.880> focus<00:02:03.119> so

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a second and then moving out of focus so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.389 
a second and then moving out of focus so
laser<00:02:03.990> was<00:02:04.200> constantly<00:02:04.770> illuminating<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
laser was constantly illuminating the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.449 
laser was constantly illuminating the
target<00:02:05.820> but<00:02:06.229> but<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.500> know<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.829> of<00:02:07.890> focus

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
target but but you know out of focus

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.710 
target but but you know out of focus
until<00:02:08.789> it<00:02:08.879> wanted<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> cut<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.629> would

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
until it wanted to cut and it would

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
until it wanted to cut and it would
bring<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.959> into<00:02:10.080> focus<00:02:10.489> now<00:02:11.489> I<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.849> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
bring it into focus now I don't have to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:12.990 
bring it into focus now I don't have to
do<00:02:12.090> that

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
do that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.030 
do that
now<00:02:13.120> I<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.360> just<00:02:13.480> move<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.900> Z<00:02:14.110> by<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:14.950> a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
now I can just move the Z by just a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.400 
now I can just move the Z by just a
little<00:02:15.310> bit<00:02:15.490> and<00:02:15.850> it'll<00:02:16.540> turn<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:17.560> laser<00:02:18.000> on

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
little bit and it'll turn that laser on

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.040 
little bit and it'll turn that laser on
and<00:02:20.410> off<00:02:23.040> beautiful
