00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's fantastic the gearshift is so

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.130 
it's fantastic the gearshift is so
savage<00:01:33.260> so<00:01:33.740> nice<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:35.360> actually<00:01:35.660> don't<00:01:35.840> miss

miss that and then you have all the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.810 
miss that and then you have all the
electronic<00:01:40.070> systems<00:01:40.460> you<00:01:40.580> know<00:01:40.670> the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
electronic systems you know the

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.510 
electronic systems you know the
four-wheel<00:01:41.300> steer<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.840> active<00:01:42.619> engine<00:01:43.310> mates

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
four-wheel steer the active engine mates

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.940 
four-wheel steer the active engine mates
and<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.720> go<00:01:44.900> into<00:01:45.140> things<00:01:45.290> like<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.650> thinking

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
and I go into things like that thinking

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.700 
and I go into things like that thinking
ok<00:01:46.190> that's<00:01:46.400> going<00:01:46.550> to<00:01:46.610> work<00:01:46.790> against<00:01:47.119> my<00:01:47.710> my

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
ok that's going to work against my my

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.010 
ok that's going to work against my my
driving<00:01:49.160> that's<00:01:49.580> gonna<00:01:49.760> fight<00:01:50.690> what<00:01:50.900> I'm

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
driving that's gonna fight what I'm

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.840 
driving that's gonna fight what I'm
trying<00:01:51.290> to<00:01:51.320> do<00:01:51.440> with<00:01:51.560> the<00:01:51.650> car<00:01:51.830> and<00:01:52.070> there

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
trying to do with the car and there

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.560 
trying to do with the car and there
wasn't<00:01:53.090> a<00:01:53.150> bit<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.360> it

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
wasn't a bit of it

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.260 
wasn't a bit of it

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
it was just perfection you couldn't feel

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.300 
it was just perfection you couldn't feel
any<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:56.630> them<00:01:56.810> they<00:01:56.930> just<00:01:56.960> work<00:01:57.350> in<00:01:57.619> perfect

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
any of them they just work in perfect

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.130 
any of them they just work in perfect

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
car it's got all the feelings of a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.050 
car it's got all the feelings of a
Porsche<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.100> know<00:02:04.280> that<00:02:04.400> lineage<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.910> can

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
Porsche you know that lineage you can

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.670 
Porsche you know that lineage you can
feel<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.450> through<00:02:05.600> all<00:02:05.869> of<00:02:05.900> them<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.320> this<00:02:06.440> one

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
feel it through all of them but this one

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.120 
feel it through all of them but this one
the<00:02:07.670> front<00:02:07.880> end<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:08.270> incredible<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.100> had<00:02:10.100> a

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
the front end is just incredible I had a

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.650 
the front end is just incredible I had a
tiny<00:02:10.429> bit<00:02:10.640> of<00:02:10.729> understeer<00:02:11.150> and<00:02:11.270> some<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.570> the

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
tiny bit of understeer and some of the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.840 
tiny bit of understeer and some of the
higher<00:02:11.780> speed<00:02:12.080> corners<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:13.430> I<00:02:13.459> could

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
higher speed corners but I could

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.930 
higher speed corners but I could
actually<00:02:15.130> affect<00:02:16.130> that<00:02:16.370> with<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.670> way<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:16.790> was

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
actually affect that with the way I was

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.430 
actually affect that with the way I was
driving<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.330> car<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.959> medium<00:02:18.380> and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
driving the car and in the medium and

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.960 
driving the car and in the medium and
low<00:02:18.590> speed<00:02:18.800> corners

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
low speed corners

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.540 
low speed corners
the<00:02:20.090> front<00:02:20.660> I<00:02:20.930> felt<00:02:21.890> like<00:02:21.980> I<00:02:22.040> needed<00:02:22.220> more<00:02:22.400> and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
the front I felt like I needed more and

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.070 
the front I felt like I needed more and
more<00:02:22.670> laps<00:02:22.880> because<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.180> just<00:02:23.390> never<00:02:23.600> overcame

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
more laps because I just never overcame

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.960 
more laps because I just never overcame
the<00:02:24.230> front<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:24.620> just<00:02:24.650> get<00:02:25.070> to<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.370> apex<00:02:25.460> oh

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
the front and just get to the apex oh

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.530 
the front and just get to the apex oh
well<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:26.650> then<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.860> rear<00:02:28.310> was<00:02:28.580> get<00:02:29.360> few

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
well and then the rear was get few

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.360 
well and then the rear was get few
little<00:02:29.720> snaps<00:02:29.990> but<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.530> predictable<00:02:31.100> just

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
little snaps but so predictable just

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.270 
little snaps but so predictable just
talking<00:02:31.850> to<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.180> whole<00:02:32.210> time

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
talking to you the whole time

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.090 
talking to you the whole time
as<00:02:34.280> I<00:02:34.430> say<00:02:34.610> just<00:02:34.640> over<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> curbs<00:02:35.840> it<00:02:35.960> was

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
as I say just over the curbs it was

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.350 
as I say just over the curbs it was
doesn't<00:02:37.100> see<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.400> club's<00:02:37.700> carefully<00:02:38.210> well

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
doesn't see the club's carefully well

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.210 
doesn't see the club's carefully well
but<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:38.930> was<00:02:39.050> actually<00:02:39.290> good<00:02:39.440> fun<00:02:39.650> we<00:02:40.040> got<00:02:40.190> a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
but that was actually good fun we got a

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.950 
but that was actually good fun we got a
great<00:02:40.400> shot<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.940> car<00:02:41.120> sort<00:02:41.420> of<00:02:41.480> up<00:02:41.570> on<00:02:41.690> two

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
great shot of the car sort of up on two

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.910 
great shot of the car sort of up on two
wheels<00:02:42.070> over<00:02:43.070> one<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.760> big<00:02:43.910> curbs<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.770> was

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
wheels over one of the big curbs it was

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.800 
wheels over one of the big curbs it was
just<00:02:46.100> such<00:02:46.250> an<00:02:46.400> involving<00:02:46.850> drivers<00:02:47.090> as<00:02:47.540> I<00:02:47.600> see

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
just such an involving drivers as I see

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.620 
just such an involving drivers as I see
it<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:47.990> many<00:02:48.170> electronic<00:02:49.240> systems<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.420> now

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
it so many electronic systems on it now

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.630 
it so many electronic systems on it now
but<00:02:50.900> it's<00:02:51.050> just<00:02:51.110> so<00:02:51.470> involving<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.160> drive<00:02:52.400> and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
but it's just so involving to drive and

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.190 
but it's just so involving to drive and
just<00:02:52.850> came<00:02:53.210> out<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.420> it<00:02:53.510> with<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.630> massive<00:02:53.840> grant

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
just came out of it with a massive grant

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.840 
just came out of it with a massive grant
it<00:02:54.590> just<00:02:54.800> doesn't<00:02:55.100> see<00:02:55.190> ultimate<00:02:55.670> right
