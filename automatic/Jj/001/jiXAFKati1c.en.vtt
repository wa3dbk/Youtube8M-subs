00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.000 
with a graver on the lathe or various
other<00:02:13.810> techniques<00:02:14.410> but<00:02:14.620> that's<00:02:14.800> always

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
other techniques but that's always

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.040 
other techniques but that's always
dangerous<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.760> might<00:02:15.940> actually<00:02:16.210> cut<00:02:16.900> the

dangerous you might actually cut the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.900 
dangerous you might actually cut the
balance<00:02:17.410> wheel<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:17.800> half<00:02:17.980> so<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> actually<00:02:18.550> like

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
balance wheel in half so I actually like

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.660 
balance wheel in half so I actually like
this<00:02:19.150> method<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:21.160> what<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.400> know<00:02:21.520> what

the staking said you have to make sure
that<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.520> hole<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.880> centered<00:02:25.240> so<00:02:25.450> you<00:02:25.510> want<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
that the hole is centered so you want to

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.110 
that the hole is centered so you want to
use<00:02:26.080> your<00:02:26.230> center<00:02:26.560> plunger<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.760> make<00:02:27.910> sure

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
use your center plunger to make sure

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.530

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
those now you use these to form the

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:21.659 
those now you use these to form the
rivet<00:05:19.319> okay<00:05:20.319> first<00:05:20.620> of<00:05:20.770> all<00:05:20.860> I<00:05:20.979> will<00:05:21.280> put<00:05:21.490> on

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669 
rivet okay first of all I will put on

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.029 
rivet okay first of all I will put on
will<00:05:22.479> put<00:05:22.690> these<00:05:22.930> you<00:05:23.470> want<00:05:23.650> to<00:05:23.680> make<00:05:23.740> sure<00:05:23.860> of

will put these you want to make sure of
course<00:05:24.340> that<00:05:24.490> you've<00:05:24.880> lined<00:05:25.120> this<00:05:25.419> all<00:05:25.630> up<00:05:25.840> as

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
course that you've lined this all up as

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.939 
course that you've lined this all up as
you<00:05:26.169> did<00:05:26.349> before

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
you did before

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
so I've already lined it up for

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.920 
so I've already lined it up for
simplicity<00:05:29.729> so<00:05:30.729> now<00:05:30.880> I'll<00:05:31.060> put<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:33.930> balanced

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
simplicity so now I'll put the balanced

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:45.200 
simplicity so now I'll put the balanced
way<00:05:35.139> along<00:05:35.849> and<00:05:36.849> I'll<00:05:37.030> take<00:05:37.300> my<00:05:37.539> flat<00:05:37.810> punch

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.330 

and<00:05:45.780> I'll<00:05:45.900> simply<00:05:46.289> tap<00:05:46.530> a<00:05:46.560> couple<00:05:46.949> of<00:05:47.009> times<00:05:47.190> to

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
and I'll simply tap a couple of times to

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:55.290 
and I'll simply tap a couple of times to
make<00:05:47.520> sure<00:05:47.699> it's<00:05:47.880> on<00:05:47.970> there<00:05:48.180> real<00:05:48.360> good

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.230 

okay<00:05:55.900> the<00:05:56.020> formula<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:57.069> actually<00:05:57.520> form<00:05:58.060> and

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
okay the formula and actually form and

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.920 
okay the formula and actually form and
spread<00:05:58.509> the<00:05:58.660> rivet<00:05:58.990> we<00:05:59.979> usually<00:06:00.690> around<00:06:01.690> those

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
spread the rivet we usually around those

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:14.350

punch

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.930 

and<00:06:15.360> it's<00:06:15.570> you'll<00:06:16.050> learn<00:06:16.200> how<00:06:16.620> much<00:06:16.940> pounding

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
and it's you'll learn how much pounding

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.180 
and it's you'll learn how much pounding
force<00:06:18.270> it<00:06:18.480> takes<00:06:18.720> that's<00:06:19.350> what<00:06:19.560> takes<00:06:20.040> the

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
force it takes that's what takes the

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.040 
force it takes that's what takes the
touch<00:06:20.430> you'll<00:06:20.700> have<00:06:20.850> to<00:06:20.970> actually<00:06:21.330> practice

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
touch you'll have to actually practice

and get used to that some stairs or the
larger<00:06:24.780> staff<00:06:24.990> takes<00:06:25.290> a<00:06:25.650> little<00:06:25.919> bit<00:06:26.100> more
