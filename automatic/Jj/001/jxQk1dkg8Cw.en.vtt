00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
know I just think that there's just a

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.780 
know I just think that there's just a
lot<00:04:47.440> of<00:04:47.500> things<00:04:47.889> from<00:04:48.040> a<00:04:48.280> marketing

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
lot of things from a marketing

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.060 
lot of things from a marketing
standpoint<00:04:49.090> in<00:04:49.510> a<00:04:49.570> business<00:04:50.020> standpoint<00:04:50.260> that

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
standpoint in a business standpoint that

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.790 
standpoint in a business standpoint that
2k<00:04:51.340> could<00:04:51.760> really<00:04:52.090> fix<00:04:52.360> about<00:04:52.630> this<00:04:52.960> game<00:04:53.200> that

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
2k could really fix about this game that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.280 
2k could really fix about this game that
can<00:04:54.400> make<00:04:54.610> it<00:04:54.850> not<00:04:55.419> only<00:04:55.660> something<00:04:56.110> that

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
can make it not only something that

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.070 
can make it not only something that
would<00:04:56.560> last<00:04:56.590> into<00:04:57.250> next<00:04:57.280> year<00:04:58.030> but<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.600> think

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
would last into next year but I think

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.800 
would last into next year but I think
give<00:04:59.500> them<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> opportunity<00:05:00.040> to<00:05:00.510> have<00:05:01.510> enough

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
give them the opportunity to have enough

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.629 
give them the opportunity to have enough
money<00:05:02.020> to<00:05:02.200> make<00:05:02.320> some<00:05:02.530> serious<00:05:02.860> changes<00:05:03.100> to

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
money to make some serious changes to

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.540 
money to make some serious changes to
the<00:05:03.760> game<00:05:03.970> that<00:05:04.560> it'll<00:05:05.560> really<00:05:05.860> really<00:05:06.310> I
