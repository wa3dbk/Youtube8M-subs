make some juice you juice them up I
always<00:01:03.120> like<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> take<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.809> little<00:01:03.989> edges

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
always like to take these little edges

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.440 
always like to take these little edges
off<00:01:04.979> with<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.220> knife<00:01:05.460> just<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.939> clean<00:01:06.270> them

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
off with a knife just just clean them

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.630 
off with a knife just just clean them
off<00:01:06.600> take<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.650> knife<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:07.979> take<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.310> edges

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
off take your knife and take the edges

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.020 
off take your knife and take the edges
off<00:01:08.869> they<00:01:09.869> contain<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> lot<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.530> tannin<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.310> then

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
off they contain a lot of tannin so then

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.179 
off they contain a lot of tannin so then
some<00:01:12.240> people<00:01:12.770> shouldn't<00:01:13.770> eat<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> lot<00:01:14.159> of

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
some people shouldn't eat a lot of

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.410 
some people shouldn't eat a lot of
tannin<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.700> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> good<00:01:15.000> idea<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.270> take<00:01:15.360> it

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
tannin so it's a good idea to take it

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
tannin so it's a good idea to take it
out<00:01:15.710> anyway<00:01:16.710> we're<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.520> look<00:01:17.610> down<00:01:17.670> here

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
out anyway we're going to look down here

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.310 
out anyway we're going to look down here
and<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.210> we<00:01:18.390> doing<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.900> down<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
and see we doing some more down on this

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.039 
and see we doing some more down on this
side<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:20.280> take<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.549> peek<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:20.970> there<00:01:21.570> we<00:01:21.689> go

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
side and take a peek at it there we go

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
side and take a peek at it there we go
so<00:01:22.830> again<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> twenty<00:01:23.820> five<00:01:24.000> gallon

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so again this is a twenty five gallon

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.700 
so again this is a twenty five gallon
container<00:01:24.650> it's<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.830> drip<00:01:26.630> so<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.869> two

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
container it's on a drip so you have two

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.530 
container it's on a drip so you have two
drip<00:01:28.950> emitters<00:01:29.250> there<00:01:29.780> on<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:31.430> slow<00:01:32.430> drip<00:01:32.729> no

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
drip emitters there on a slow drip no

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.090 
drip emitters there on a slow drip no
need<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.900> drip<00:01:34.110> today<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:34.770> raining

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
need to drip today because it's raining

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.410 
need to drip today because it's raining
and<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.280> kind<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.820> tree<00:01:36.060> is<00:01:36.090> probably

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and it's kind of this tree is probably

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.039 
and it's kind of this tree is probably
in<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> container<00:01:38.150> 510<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.659> know<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
in the container 510 so you know this

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.480 
in the container 510 so you know this
tree<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.590> six<00:01:40.829> feet<00:01:40.950> tall<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
tree is just about six feet tall in the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.639 
tree is just about six feet tall in the
pot<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.439> really

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
pot and as you can see it's not really

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.230 
pot and as you can see it's not really
that<00:01:43.680> wide<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.280> mean<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.759> probably<00:01:44.939> got<00:01:45.180> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
that wide I mean it's probably got a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.569 
that wide I mean it's probably got a
four<00:01:45.450> foot<00:01:45.689> width<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:47.340> tree<00:01:47.549> is

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
four foot width if that and the tree is

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.670 
four foot width if that and the tree is
looking<00:01:47.759> really<00:01:48.090> really<00:01:48.210> nice<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
looking really really nice so if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
looking really really nice so if you
want<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.950> grow<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> carambola<00:01:50.700> tree<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> pot

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
want to grow a carambola tree in a pot

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
want to grow a carambola tree in a pot
this<00:01:51.750> is<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.229> ones<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.710> easily

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
this is one of the ones you can easily

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
this is one of the ones you can easily
grow<00:01:53.310> not<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.299> big<00:01:54.570> deal<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.110> really<00:01:55.770> easy

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
grow not a big deal at all really easy
