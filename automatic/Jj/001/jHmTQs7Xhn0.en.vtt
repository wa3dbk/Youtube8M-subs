00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
me no I think that one might be fully

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.620 
me no I think that one might be fully
grown<00:04:34.940> but<00:04:35.920> will<00:04:36.920> check<00:04:37.280> in<00:04:38.000> a<00:04:38.060> minute<00:04:38.090> here

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
grown but will check in a minute here

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
grown but will check in a minute here
and<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.980> believe<00:04:40.280> we<00:04:40.430> have<00:04:40.520> just<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.000> 10<00:04:41.650> 10

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
and I believe we have just to the 10 10

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.390 
and I believe we have just to the 10 10
minutes<00:04:43.010> I<00:04:43.190> think<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.210> don't<00:04:44.570> know<00:04:45.100> heck<00:04:46.100> if<00:04:46.250> I

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
minutes I think I don't know heck if I

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.100 
minutes I think I don't know heck if I
know<00:04:47.440> looks<00:04:48.440> like<00:04:48.590> we<00:04:48.770> got<00:04:48.800> once<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.610> left

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110
