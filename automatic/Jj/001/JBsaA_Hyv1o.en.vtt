getting results so again if that's to
gain<00:00:14.070> muscle<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.730> example<00:00:15.320> you're<00:00:16.320> gaining

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
gain muscle for example you're gaining

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.260 
gain muscle for example you're gaining
you're<00:00:16.890> gaining<00:00:17.220> slowly<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.730> steady<00:00:18.029> and

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
you're gaining slowly and steady and

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.849 
you're gaining slowly and steady and
then<00:00:18.660> all<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.900> sudden<00:00:19.230> you<00:00:19.289> just<00:00:19.439> take<00:00:19.740> her

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
then all of a sudden you just take her

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.490 
then all of a sudden you just take her
off<00:00:20.210> and<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:21.390> don't<00:00:21.600> go<00:00:21.720> negative<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.410> you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
off and you don't go negative but you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.380 
off and you don't go negative but you

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
just you keep trying and keep pushing

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.210 
just you keep trying and keep pushing
and<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.140> don't<00:00:25.289> get<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> same<00:00:25.740> results

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
that you were once getting the biggest

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.220 
that you were once getting the biggest
thing<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.519> know<00:00:29.670> about<00:00:29.699> plateaus<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.900> that

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
thing to know about plateaus is that

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.720 
thing to know about plateaus is that
they<00:00:31.439> will<00:00:31.740> happen<00:00:32.099> they<00:00:32.340> happen<00:00:32.369> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
they will happen they happen to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.729 
they will happen they happen to
everybody<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.360> happen<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.780> me<00:00:33.989> happen<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
everybody that happen to me happen to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
everybody that happen to me happen to
everybody<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.520> know<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.390> will<00:00:36.630> happen

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
everybody that I know and it will happen

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.020 
everybody that I know and it will happen
to<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.230> too<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.129> need<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.489> prepared<00:00:38.700> for

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to you too you need to be prepared for

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.819 
to you too you need to be prepared for
it<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> second<00:00:40.739> biggest

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
it because this is the second biggest

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
it because this is the second biggest
reason<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.790> people<00:00:42.030> leave<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.600> gym<00:00:42.840> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
reason I see people leave the gym the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.750 
reason I see people leave the gym the
biggest<00:00:43.680> reason<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.430> gym<00:00:44.610> just

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
biggest reason is that the gym just

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
biggest reason is that the gym just
wasn't<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.210> them<00:00:45.270> in<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.690> place<00:00:45.780> they

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
wasn't for them in the first place they

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
wasn't for them in the first place they
come<00:00:46.950> they<00:00:47.070> sign<00:00:47.309> up<00:00:47.460> for<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> year<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.149> within

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
come they sign up for a year and within

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.779 
come they sign up for a year and within
a<00:00:48.510> few<00:00:48.690> weeks<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:49.079> gone<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> second

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
a few weeks they're gone the second

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.209 
a few weeks they're gone the second
biggest<00:00:50.940> reason<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.620> after<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:52.920> could<00:00:53.100> be

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
biggest reason is after it could be

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.799 
biggest reason is after it could be
eight<00:00:53.399> weeks<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.969> could<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.239> three<00:00:54.449> months<00:00:54.719> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
eight weeks it could be three months it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.650 
eight weeks it could be three months it
could<00:00:54.899> be<00:00:55.020> six<00:00:55.230> months<00:00:56.210> people<00:00:57.210> hit<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> plateau

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
could be six months people hit a plateau

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.229 
could be six months people hit a plateau
and<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:59.010> start<00:00:59.309> saying<00:00:59.550> well<00:00:59.609> why<00:01:00.059> am<00:01:00.180> i

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
and they start saying well why am i

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.700 
and they start saying well why am i
coming<00:01:00.570> here<00:01:00.750> pushing<00:01:01.020> really<00:01:01.289> hard<00:01:01.379> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
getting any results and they start

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
getting any results and they start
