Solomon Islands has been actually doing

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.670 
Solomon Islands has been actually doing
the<00:04:15.360> job<00:04:15.600> and<00:04:15.840> seeing<00:04:16.080> it<00:04:16.200> all<00:04:16.320> come<00:04:16.350> together

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
the job and seeing it all come together

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.500

and I'm really enjoying it and I know

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.390 
and I'm really enjoying it and I know
there's<00:04:18.750> still<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.200> much<00:04:19.410> more<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.890> learn<00:04:20.070> I

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
there's still so much more to learn I

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.220

that you can actually look out in the

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.840 
that you can actually look out in the
community<00:04:25.650> and<00:04:25.830> see<00:04:26.070> that<00:04:26.250> what<00:04:26.400> you're<00:04:26.550> doing
