00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 dark behind such a simple name 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.450
 stealth game about vampires 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.550
 which is simply impossible to play and neither 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.410
 not exaggerating those rules 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.880
 who impose dark do not work 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.040
 rather they work but only in 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.480
 learning mission in the game you need to constantly 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.400
 hiding in the dark hiding by 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.779
 shelters and wait unbearably long 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.820
 the moment when the enemy is from you 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.859
 turn away opponents of these darkness 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 hiding places are horribly crooked 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 so you always find someone 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.980
 eyes and this despite the fact that the movement 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.960
 enemies looped and predictable and even 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.759
 At first I think that you can go quietly 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.530
 sometimes it even happens but then 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 faced with the fact that one plot 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.430
 constantly looked through two enemies and 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.410
 sometimes the enemy is stupid and looks 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.120
 passage through which you need to go 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.500
 therefore it is necessary to raise the alarm 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.030
 beat everyone in the open 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.649
 but due to skew control kill 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.629
 opponent 's melee is awesome 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.120
 the problem is that they all die from 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.770
 one strike and at least a little tenacious 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.539
 but also die pretty quickly 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.210
 so the game makes you hide 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.340
 but it is impossible and with this almost nothing 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 can't be done by almost i mean 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.030
 their abilities are not many 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.799
 quite strong but half from the floor 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 just useless and the second half 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.909
 rarely be able to use the case 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.890
 that abilities take niku scale of force 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.810
 which is performed by sucking the blood of the neck 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.130
 the enemy and it seems there was one perry 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.229
 blood will be your part 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.150
 but firstly the process of sucking 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200
 quite long secondly is the ability 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.270
 just like everyone else 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.159
 produces a retractable noise only after 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.930
 a certain leveling 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.880
 that to drink blood you need to behave 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.610
 covertly but you will fail 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.770
 paradox in this game there is not a single 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.689
 plus a completely picture though 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.430
 stylized comic causes an eerie 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.900
 disgust all my life here is not so much 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.909
 intelligible and how much can there be at all 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.530
 Need balloon characters to flip over 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.119
 jokes in the bodies and not having 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.619
 staging videos will instantly 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 paralysis of the nervous system 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.920
 the game is constantly throwing new ones on you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.450
 enemies that are old 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.829
 just notices you faster also 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.780
 killing faster and by the way here 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.850
 opens just on and a messy moment 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.500
 games when you survived numerous 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.189
 torment with horns running friend 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.530
 are dying 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.479
 you are thrown back so much from 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.299
 chest breaks involuntary in the field of the hand 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.759
 themselves stretch the keys alt f4 in this game 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.649
 it's impossible to play but if you are notorious 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.690
 masochist you can buy it here and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.290
 remember in 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.290
 intermingled
