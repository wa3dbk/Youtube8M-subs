bedroom 300 bucks when heating the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.060 
bedroom 300 bucks when heating the
outdoors<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.960> don't<00:00:16.590> know<00:00:16.680> that's<00:00:16.830> what<00:00:16.949> my

especially cold in my bedroom and I want
to<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.480> why<00:00:30.929> is<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.800> bedroom<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
to know why is it in my bedroom that

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.100 
to know why is it in my bedroom that
seems<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.210> culture<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.630> right<00:00:33.809> now<00:00:33.840> it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
seems to be the culture and right now it

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.600 
seems to be the culture and right now it
seems<00:00:34.140> weird<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> be<00:00:34.770> talking<00:00:34.800> about<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.370> cold

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
seems weird to be talking about the cold

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.340 
seems weird to be talking about the cold
because<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.030> been<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.360> warm<00:00:36.570> outside<00:00:36.840> but

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
because it's been so warm outside but

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.430 
because it's been so warm outside but
it's<00:00:37.590> gonna<00:00:37.800> Swift<00:00:38.280> no<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.450> it's<00:00:40.230> good

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
it's gonna Swift no it is it's good

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.889 
it's gonna Swift no it is it's good
relative<00:00:41.040> yeah<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:42.090> zero<00:00:42.420> degree<00:00:42.750> weather

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
relative yeah to zero degree weather

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.049 
relative yeah to zero degree weather
we've<00:00:43.350> had<00:00:43.610> let's<00:00:44.610> figure<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:44.969> why<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.360> is

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
we've had let's figure out why it is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.279 
we've had let's figure out why it is
yeah<00:00:48.059> because<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.510> thinking<00:00:48.840> there's<00:00:48.989> got<00:00:49.170> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
yeah because I'm thinking there's got to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
yeah because I'm thinking there's got to
be<00:00:49.320> something<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.739> can<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:50.309> maybe<00:00:50.489> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
be something we can do or maybe a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.389 
be something we can do or maybe a
problem<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.539> an<00:00:51.629> issue<00:00:51.780> going<00:00:52.710> on<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.129> my<00:00:53.219> house

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
problem or an issue going on in my house

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.600 
problem or an issue going on in my house
so<00:00:53.699> Tony<00:00:54.230> from<00:00:55.230> Lee's<00:00:55.500> heating<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.489> air

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
so Tony from Lee's heating and air

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.520 
so Tony from Lee's heating and air
conditioning<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:57.239> here<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.840> what's<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> deal

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
conditioning is here so what's the deal

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
conditioning is here so what's the deal
here<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.129> always<00:00:59.370> cold<00:00:59.730> as<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.239> how

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
here what I'm always cold as it is how

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.670 
here what I'm always cold as it is how
do<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.480> feel<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:00.840> hands<00:01:01.050> yeah<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> know<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
do you feel my hands yeah I know I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.340 
do you feel my hands yeah I know I
actually<00:01:02.489> use<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.030> infrared<00:01:03.600> thermal

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
actually use the infrared thermal

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.840 
actually use the infrared thermal
imaging<00:01:04.439> camera<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.220> figure<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> out<00:01:05.670> now

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
imaging camera to figure it out now

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.789 
imaging camera to figure it out now
you're<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> 80<00:01:06.479> degrees<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.170> hands<00:01:07.500> and

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
you're like 80 degrees on your hands and

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.980 
you're like 80 degrees on your hands and
so<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.460> imaging<00:01:09.030> thermal<00:01:09.659> camera

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
so you have this imaging thermal camera

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.359 
so you have this imaging thermal camera
that'll<00:01:10.200> go<00:01:10.380> in<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.799> give<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.130> hot

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
that'll go in there and give you the hot

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
that'll go in there and give you the hot
spots<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> cold<00:01:12.090> spots<00:01:12.330> in<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.540> house<00:01:12.659> and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
spots the cold spots in the house and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.179 
spots the cold spots in the house and
those<00:01:13.170> are<00:01:13.290> give<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.439> trouble<00:01:13.710> areas<00:01:14.070> that

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
those are give you trouble areas that

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.490 
those are give you trouble areas that
either<00:01:14.400> yeah<00:01:14.909> fix<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.299> windows<00:01:15.659> or<00:01:15.900> what<00:01:16.110> well

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
either yeah fix the windows or what well

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.380 
either yeah fix the windows or what well
what's<00:01:16.770> going<00:01:16.920> on<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.340> first<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> all<00:01:18.000> to

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
what's going on is first of all to

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
what's going on is first of all to
figure<00:01:18.659> out<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.960> need<00:01:19.110> to<00:01:19.140> actually<00:01:19.740> look<00:01:20.009> at

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
figure out we need to actually look at

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.590 
figure out we need to actually look at
the<00:01:20.220> system<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> see<00:01:20.850> what's<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.390> like

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the system to see what's going on like

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.450 
the system to see what's going on like
at<00:01:21.720> your<00:01:21.869> house<00:01:22.110> yeah<00:01:22.439> Kelly<00:01:22.799> we<00:01:23.009> need<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.280> see

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
at your house yeah Kelly we need to see

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
at your house yeah Kelly we need to see
so<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.119> can't<00:01:24.360> connect<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.630> camera<00:01:24.990> so

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
so you just can't connect the camera so

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.450 
so you just can't connect the camera so
that's<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.650> you'd<00:01:25.860> have<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> go<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> look

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
that's just it you'd have to go and look

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.249 
that's just it you'd have to go and look
at<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.700> furnace<00:01:27.420> make<00:01:27.869> sure<00:01:28.020> that<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
at the furnace make sure that the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.960 
at the furnace make sure that the
furnace<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.650> operating<00:01:29.070> properly<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
furnace is operating properly and is the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.300 
furnace is operating properly and is the
operating<00:01:30.450> efficient<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.560> know<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.860> find<00:01:32.159> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
operating efficient you know we find it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.219 
operating efficient you know we find it
all<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> time<00:01:32.700> where<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> unit<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.720> oversized

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
all the time where the unit is oversized

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.069 
all the time where the unit is oversized
and<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.579> different<00:01:35.909> things<00:01:36.030> where<00:01:36.689> it

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and a lot of different things where it

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.200 
and a lot of different things where it
either<00:01:37.710> needs<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> toned<00:01:38.700> down<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.970> little

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
either needs to be toned down a little

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.880 
either needs to be toned down a little
bit<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.259> runs<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.500> little<00:01:40.560> bit<00:01:40.740> more

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
bit so that it runs a little bit more

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
bit so that it runs a little bit more
often<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:42.090> makes<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> more<00:01:42.509> consistent<00:01:43.079> like

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
often it makes it more consistent like

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.359 
often it makes it more consistent like
your<00:01:43.500> bedroom<00:01:43.649> well<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.250> your<00:01:44.399> but<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.610> know

your bedroom well as your but you know

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.679 
your bedroom well as your but you know
it's<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:47.909> this<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.210> probably<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it's all the time this is probably the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.510 
it's all the time this is probably the
number<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.439> we<00:01:49.530> have<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:50.460> our

number one thing that we have at our

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.950 
number one thing that we have at our
business<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.119> questions<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.570> we<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.780> is

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
business the questions that we get is

homes yeah they might more a little more
drafty<00:02:02.579> not<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.149> much<00:02:03.270> insulation<00:02:03.659> newer

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
drafty not as much insulation newer

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
drafty not as much insulation newer
homes<00:02:04.399> you<00:02:05.399> know<00:02:05.460> but<00:02:06.060> then<00:02:06.420> it's<00:02:06.630> may<00:02:06.750> be

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
homes you know but then it's may be

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.770 
homes you know but then it's may be
inadequate<00:02:07.140> duct<00:02:07.619> or<00:02:08.119> improperly<00:02:09.119> installed

inadequate duct or improperly installed

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.010 
inadequate duct or improperly installed
you<00:02:10.020> know<00:02:10.140> equipment<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.849> can<00:02:12.030> be<00:02:12.150> both

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you know equipment so it can be both

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.540 
you know equipment so it can be both
so<00:02:13.230> when<00:02:13.410> you<00:02:13.530> come<00:02:13.770> in<00:02:13.920> what<00:02:14.100> are<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.310> first

things you look for you go down to the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.450 
things you look for you go down to the
furnace<00:02:16.380> like<00:02:16.530> you<00:02:16.650> said<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:16.950> check<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.280> out

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
furnace like you said you check it out

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.040 
furnace like you said you check it out
yeah<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:17.880> checked<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.180> furnace<00:02:18.450> like<00:02:18.780> on<00:02:18.930> the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
yeah we checked the furnace like on the

showing a picture of a furnace that was

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.320 
showing a picture of a furnace that was
actually<00:02:22.920> not<00:02:23.160> properly<00:02:23.730> installed<00:02:23.940> too

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
actually not properly installed too

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
actually you know the temperatures are

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.880 
actually you know the temperatures are
back<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.600> making<00:02:31.080> sure<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.710> right

have<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.220> same<00:03:05.400> problem<00:03:05.850> with<00:03:05.940> air<00:03:06.090> condition

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
have the same problem with air condition

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
have the same problem with air condition
of<00:03:06.540> why<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:07.320> have<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> understand<00:03:07.860> that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
of why you have to understand that

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.100 
of why you have to understand that

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
because if it happens in heating air

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.200 
because if it happens in heating air
conditioning<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:11.190> has<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.490> blow<00:03:11.640> harder<00:03:12.060> it's

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
conditioning it has to blow harder it's

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.700 
conditioning it has to blow harder it's
