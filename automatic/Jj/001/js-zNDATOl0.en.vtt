00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 
bookings for adults Christmas parties I

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.180 
bookings for adults Christmas parties I
think<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.090> was<00:01:15.179> Christmas<00:01:15.420> dinners<00:01:16.190> alright

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
think it was Christmas dinners alright

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.120 
think it was Christmas dinners alright
so<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:17.910> that<00:01:18.899> is<00:01:18.929> some<00:01:19.410> glue<00:01:19.619> into<00:01:19.920> my

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
so there we go that is some glue into my

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.530 
so there we go that is some glue into my
bottle<00:01:20.520> as<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.080> glue<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.530> very

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
bottle as you can see the glue is very

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.960 
bottle as you can see the glue is very
liquid<00:01:24.540> so<00:01:25.530> it's<00:01:26.009> probably<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.430> lot<00:01:26.580> runnier

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
liquid so it's probably a lot runnier

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
liquid so it's probably a lot runnier
than<00:01:27.060> glues<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> you're<00:01:27.750> used<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.560> does

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
than glues that you're used to it does

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.510 
than glues that you're used to it does
take<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.369> bit<00:01:29.520> of<00:01:29.700> practice<00:01:30.229> but<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.860> find

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
take a little bit of practice but I find

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.179 
take a little bit of practice but I find
it's<00:01:32.939> just<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.479> good<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:34.590> lot<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> more

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
it's just as good as a lot of a more

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.300 
it's just as good as a lot of a more
expensive<00:01:35.520> glues<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.680> at<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.860> price<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
expensive glues and at the price it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
expensive glues and at the price it
comes<00:01:38.549> out<00:01:38.729> it's<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.150> much<00:01:39.390> cheaper<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
comes out it's so much cheaper I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.609 
comes out it's so much cheaper I
couldn't<00:01:40.950> say<00:01:41.100> no<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:42.119> there<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.600> go<00:01:42.630> right<00:01:43.320> so

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
couldn't say no so there we go right so

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.190 
couldn't say no so there we go right so
at<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> moment<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.460> got<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.850> cap<00:01:45.600> tip<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
at the moment it's got the cap tip the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.109 
at the moment it's got the cap tip the
seal<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.310> let's<00:01:47.490> stop<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> glue<00:01:47.880> coming

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
seal on it so let's stop the glue coming

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.319 
seal on it so let's stop the glue coming
out<00:01:48.329> we're<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.780> going<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:48.990> untwist<00:01:49.470> that

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
them happy and this is the shorter and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.509 
them happy and this is the shorter and
slightly<00:02:13.350> wider<00:02:13.560> you<00:02:13.769> can<00:02:13.829> still<00:02:14.160> see<00:02:14.370> it's

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
slightly wider you can still see it's

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:18.530 
slightly wider you can still see it's
extremely<00:02:14.640> fine<00:02:15.620> that's<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:17.100> 20<00:02:17.850> gauge<00:02:18.060> pink

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
extremely fine that's the 20 gauge pink

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.300 
extremely fine that's the 20 gauge pink
tip<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.079> that's<00:02:19.290> much<00:02:19.530> shorter<00:02:19.560> which<00:02:20.160> I

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
tip and that's much shorter which I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.810 
tip and that's much shorter which I
actually<00:02:20.459> prefer<00:02:20.959> now<00:02:21.959> these<00:02:22.950> as<00:02:23.370> you<00:02:23.459> can<00:02:23.489> see

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
actually prefer now these as you can see

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.770 
actually prefer now these as you can see
they<00:02:24.480> just<00:02:24.690> fit<00:02:24.959> onto<00:02:25.350> that<00:02:25.440> little<00:02:26.480> lid<00:02:27.480> there

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
they just fit onto that little lid there

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.240 
they just fit onto that little lid there
you<00:02:27.810> twist<00:02:28.260> them<00:02:28.410> on

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
you twist them on

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.890 
you twist them on
and<00:02:29.310> these<00:02:29.460> are<00:02:29.670> used<00:02:29.850> in<00:02:30.270> machine<00:02:31.140> industry

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
and these are used in machine industry

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.650 
and these are used in machine industry
applications<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.860> extremely<00:02:35.700> tough

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
applications so they are extremely tough

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.600 
applications so they are extremely tough
not<00:02:36.990> that<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.200> advise<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.920> start<00:02:38.250> squeezing

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
not that I advise you to start squeezing

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.920 
not that I advise you to start squeezing
this<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.180> how<00:02:39.390> hard<00:02:39.630> it<00:02:39.810> will<00:02:39.990> actually

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
this to see how hard it will actually

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.960 
this to see how hard it will actually
stay<00:02:42.930> on<00:02:42.960> under<00:02:43.680> pressure<00:02:43.950> but<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.550> good

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
stay on under pressure but it's good

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.260 
stay on under pressure but it's good
enough<00:02:45.000> excuse<00:02:45.870> me<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.320> pull<00:02:46.500> off<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> sleeve

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
enough excuse me you pull off a sleeve

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.730 
enough excuse me you pull off a sleeve
okay<00:02:48.270> so<00:02:50.540> this<00:02:51.540> glue<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.200> said<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.680> very

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
okay so this glue as I said it's very

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.550 
okay so this glue as I said it's very
runny<00:02:53.250> but<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.209> nice<00:02:54.390> thing<00:02:54.420> about<00:02:54.990> these

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
runny but the nice thing about these

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.350 
runny but the nice thing about these
applicator<00:02:56.459> tips<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.270> do

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
applicator tips is you can do

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.590 
applicator tips is you can do
beautifully<00:02:58.200> fine<00:02:59.010> dots<00:02:59.370> you<00:03:00.060> see<00:03:00.090> how<00:03:00.360> tiny

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
beautifully fine dots you see how tiny

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:06.550 
beautifully fine dots you see how tiny
those<00:03:00.870> are<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:02.550> can<00:03:02.670> do<00:03:03.140> nice<00:03:04.140> little

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
those are and you can do nice little

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.940 
those are and you can do nice little
lines<00:03:07.560> and<00:03:08.220> swirls<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:09.300> twirls<00:03:10.220> now<00:03:12.500> it<00:03:13.500> will

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
lines and swirls and twirls now it will

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.080 
lines and swirls and twirls now it will
probably<00:03:14.640> take<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:14.880> little<00:03:15.150> bit<00:03:15.390> longer<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:16.140> dry

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
probably take a little bit longer to dry

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.170 
probably take a little bit longer to dry
than<00:03:18.090> it<00:03:18.870> would<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:19.500> you<00:03:19.709> were<00:03:19.830> doing<00:03:20.180> brush

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
than it would if you were doing brush

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.280 
than it would if you were doing brush
application<00:03:21.840> onto<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:23.510> little<00:03:24.510> tattoo<00:03:24.690> stencil

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
application onto a little tattoo stencil

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.720 
application onto a little tattoo stencil
which<00:03:25.440> I<00:03:25.560> suspect<00:03:25.770> is<00:03:26.070> what<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> lot<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.580> you

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
which I suspect is what a lot of you

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.930 
which I suspect is what a lot of you
will<00:03:26.850> have<00:03:26.910> done<00:03:27.500> but<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.890> get<00:03:29.130> into

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
will have done but you can get into

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.460 
will have done but you can get into
practice<00:03:30.330> it<00:03:30.510> won't<00:03:30.660> take<00:03:30.870> quite<00:03:31.050> as<00:03:31.200> long<00:03:31.320> to

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
practice it won't take quite as long to

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.620 
practice it won't take quite as long to
dry<00:03:31.680> and<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.670> other<00:03:32.760> thing<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.180> can<00:03:33.390> do

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
dry and the other thing that you can do

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.680 
dry and the other thing that you can do
is<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.890> can<00:03:35.160> kind<00:03:35.370> of<00:03:35.489> smooth<00:03:35.910> it<00:03:36.090> out<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.330> bit

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
is you can kind of smooth it out a bit

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.440 
is you can kind of smooth it out a bit
and<00:03:36.810> widen<00:03:37.290> lines<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:38.489> by<00:03:38.700> spreading<00:03:39.120> it

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
and widen lines just by spreading it

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.740 
and widen lines just by spreading it
with<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.840> end<00:03:40.080> of<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.470> tip<00:03:41.450> okay<00:03:42.450> I'll<00:03:42.630> let

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
with the end of your tip okay I'll let

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.840 
with the end of your tip okay I'll let
that<00:03:42.780> dry<00:03:43.110> for<00:03:43.140> a<00:03:43.380> second<00:03:43.769> I'll<00:03:44.280> just<00:03:44.519> show<00:03:44.790> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
that dry for a second I'll just show you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:55.140 
that dry for a second I'll just show you
the<00:03:45.239> tip

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.890 

as<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:55.959> see<00:03:56.200> that<00:03:56.379> is<00:03:56.530> much<00:03:56.950> much<00:03:57.489> longer

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
as you can see that is much much longer

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.660 
as you can see that is much much longer
it<00:03:58.900> just<00:03:59.110> depends<00:03:59.439> what's<00:03:59.560> up<00:03:59.680> to<00:03:59.799> you<00:03:59.890> so<00:04:00.159> I

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
it just depends what's up to you so I

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.130 
it just depends what's up to you so I
would<00:04:00.939> advise<00:04:01.180> maybe<00:04:01.480> getting<00:04:01.810> one<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:02.049> each

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
would advise maybe getting one of each

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.750 
would advise maybe getting one of each
to<00:04:02.349> start<00:04:02.590> with<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:03.040> see<00:04:03.129> which<00:04:03.310> you<00:04:03.459> prefer

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
to start with and see which you prefer

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.179 
to start with and see which you prefer
and<00:04:04.480> when<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:04.659> know<00:04:04.780> which<00:04:04.959> you<00:04:05.110> prefer<00:04:05.189> have

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:06.189 
and when you know which you prefer have

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:07.979 
and when you know which you prefer have
a<00:04:06.220> couple<00:04:06.549> of<00:04:06.610> those<00:04:06.790> in<00:04:06.970> your<00:04:07.060> working<00:04:07.329> kit<00:04:07.750> so

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
a couple of those in your working kit so

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.059 
a couple of those in your working kit so
you've<00:04:08.110> got<00:04:08.230> a<00:04:08.260> couple<00:04:08.470> the<00:04:08.680> right<00:04:08.799> size<00:04:09.040> just

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
you've got a couple the right size just

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:10.800 
you've got a couple the right size just
in<00:04:09.400> case<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.640> blockage<00:04:09.970> occurs<00:04:10.090> or<00:04:10.510> something

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
in case of blockage occurs or something

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.210 
in case of blockage occurs or something
goes<00:04:10.959> wrong<00:04:11.579> so<00:04:12.579> again<00:04:13.799> squeeze<00:04:14.799> it<00:04:15.010> gently

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
goes wrong so again squeeze it gently

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.830 
goes wrong so again squeeze it gently
and<00:04:15.700> you're<00:04:16.509> almost<00:04:18.419> dragging<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.630> flow

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
and you're almost dragging the flow

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.100 
and you're almost dragging the flow
you're<00:04:20.109> hardly<00:04:20.530> touching<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.100> skin<00:04:21.370> I<00:04:25.020> mean<00:04:26.020> I

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
you're hardly touching the skin I mean I

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.659 
you're hardly touching the skin I mean I
think<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.500> whole<00:04:26.680> idea<00:04:26.710> with<00:04:27.370> glitter

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
think the whole idea with glitter

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:29.580 
think the whole idea with glitter
tattoos<00:04:28.120> at<00:04:28.330> least<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.600> way<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.750> do<00:04:28.900> them<00:04:29.380> is

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
tattoos at least the way I do them is

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.480 
tattoos at least the way I do them is
you're<00:04:30.100> not<00:04:30.310> wanting<00:04:30.990> huge<00:04:31.990> layers<00:04:32.410> of<00:04:32.949> huge

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
to be working flat out so the glue never

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:12.519 
to be working flat out so the glue never
actually<00:06:10.589> gets<00:06:10.830> a<00:06:10.919> chance<00:06:11.069> to<00:06:11.249> dry<00:06:11.550> in<00:06:11.729> a<00:06:11.819> nib
