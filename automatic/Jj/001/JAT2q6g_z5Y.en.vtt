00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.240 

so<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.410> good<00:00:04.680> thing<00:00:04.860> to<00:00:04.980> do<00:00:05.130> is<00:00:07.010> start<00:00:08.010> with<00:00:08.100> it

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
so a good thing to do is start with it

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.080 
so a good thing to do is start with it
on<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.550> OOP

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
on the OOP

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.070 
on the OOP
the<00:00:09.240> tick<00:00:09.450> side<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:10.530> sides<00:00:10.799> fixed<00:00:11.190> so

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
the tick side that sides fixed so

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.530 
the tick side that sides fixed so
obviously<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.260> just<00:00:13.440> goes<00:00:13.590> around<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.700> it's

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
obviously it just goes around and it's

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.240 
obviously it just goes around and it's
off-center<00:00:16.110> so<00:00:16.290> if<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.619> put<00:00:16.800> your<00:00:16.920> hips<00:00:17.189> I

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
off-center so if you put your hips I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.620 
off-center so if you put your hips I
usually<00:00:20.250> wrap<00:00:20.400> my<00:00:20.610> foot<00:00:20.850> around<00:00:21.090> it<00:00:21.270> like<00:00:21.420> that

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
usually wrap my foot around it like that

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
usually wrap my foot around it like that
a<00:00:21.900> little<00:00:22.590> bit<00:00:22.710> in<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.100> hand<00:00:23.310> here<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.640> here

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
a little bit in one hand here and here

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.920 
a little bit in one hand here and here
but<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.240> know<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> can<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:24.660> them<00:00:24.779> wherever

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but you know you can put them wherever

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.590 
but you know you can put them wherever
you<00:00:25.080> want<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.710> then<00:00:26.520> this<00:00:27.180> will<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.390> give

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:27.600 
you want and then this will just give

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.490 
you want and then this will just give
you<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> idea<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.199> like<00:00:28.350> how<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.710> gonna<00:00:28.800> move

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
you the idea of like how it's gonna move

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:38.960 
you the idea of like how it's gonna move
this<00:00:31.500> way<00:00:35.210> but<00:00:36.210> then<00:00:36.710> once<00:00:37.710> once<00:00:38.550> you're<00:00:38.729> doing

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
this way but then once once you're doing

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.200 
this way but then once once you're doing
that<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.720> actually<00:00:39.870> take<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.710> leg<00:00:40.890> off

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.710 

and<00:00:46.729> but<00:00:47.729> you<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.970> actually<00:00:48.120> start<00:00:48.449> turning

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720 
and but you can actually start turning

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:59.299 
and but you can actually start turning
your<00:00:48.809> body<00:00:57.650> you<00:00:58.650> could<00:00:58.769> actually<00:00:58.979> get<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
your body you could actually get it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.890 
your body you could actually get it
going<00:00:59.519> around<00:00:59.729> and<00:00:59.940> then<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.180> back<00:01:00.690> hip

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
going around and then do back hip

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.960 
going around and then do back hip
circles<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.379> this<00:01:01.589> thing<00:01:01.830> and<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:03.320> once<00:01:04.970> you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
circles on this thing and then once you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810 
circles on this thing and then once you
have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.150> feeling<00:01:06.420> for<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.369> see<00:01:08.369> if<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.520> can<00:01:08.670> get
