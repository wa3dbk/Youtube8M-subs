00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
of course they can do this with any

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.960

it's just the way they just the way they
make<00:02:48.290> these<00:02:48.440> systems<00:02:48.860> they're<00:02:49.160> just<00:02:49.459> they're

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
make these systems they're just they're

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:51.670 
make these systems they're just they're
just<00:02:50.540> out<00:02:50.690> there<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.079> know<00:02:51.200> they're<00:02:51.380> just<00:02:51.590> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
just out there you know they're just the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.750 
just out there you know they're just the
best<00:02:51.950> in<00:02:52.130> the<00:02:52.220> world<00:02:52.370> at<00:02:53.269> doing<00:02:53.329> what<00:02:53.810> they<00:02:53.900> do

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
cutting this system in in a couple of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.400 
cutting this system in in a couple of
weeks<00:03:44.150> time<00:03:45.549> it's<00:03:46.549> a<00:03:46.669> light<00:03:47.169> light<00:03:48.169> density

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
weeks time it's a light light density

weeks time it's a light light density
system<00:03:48.829> and<00:03:50.349> so<00:03:51.349> when<00:03:51.500> this<00:03:51.620> goes<00:03:51.769> on<00:03:51.950> its

midlife crisis going on with the blonde

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.790 
midlife crisis going on with the blonde
but<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:34.070> know<00:04:35.050> it's<00:04:36.050> the<00:04:36.140> same<00:04:36.320> sort<00:04:36.500> of<00:04:36.590> thing

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
but you know it's the same sort of thing

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.190 
but you know it's the same sort of thing
that's<00:04:37.460> a<00:04:37.550> little<00:04:37.580> bit<00:04:37.940> better<00:04:38.770> where<00:04:39.770> I<00:04:39.800> focus

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
that's a little bit better where I focus

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.370 
that's a little bit better where I focus
any<00:04:42.200> Botox<00:04:42.620> right<00:04:43.460> so<00:04:44.120> there<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:44.360> go<00:04:44.450> so<00:04:44.780> it's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
any Botox right so there you go so it's

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.160 
any Botox right so there you go so it's
basically<00:04:45.800> the<00:04:45.980> same<00:04:46.010> sort<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.720> effect<00:04:47.720> this

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
basically the same sort of effect this

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:51.400 
basically the same sort of effect this
system<00:04:48.560> actually<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.100> did<00:04:49.220> a<00:04:49.250> video<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:50.230> of<00:04:51.230> me
