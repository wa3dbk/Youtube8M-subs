00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
200 and we also try to make more lenses

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:49.190 
200 and we also try to make more lenses
single<00:00:41.720> focal<00:00:42.170> lengths<00:00:42.500> in<00:00:42.650> the<00:00:42.739> future

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.530 

well<00:00:50.200> at<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.830> moment<00:00:50.980> we<00:00:51.850> also<00:00:54.180> try<00:00:55.180> to<00:00:55.210> make

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
well at the moment we also try to make

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.799 
well at the moment we also try to make
these<00:00:55.810> single<00:00:56.320> focal<00:00:56.650> length<00:00:56.830> with<00:00:57.820> a<00:00:57.850> high

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
these single focal length with a high

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.220 
these single focal length with a high
aperture<00:01:00.120> but<00:01:01.120> currently<00:01:01.540> we<00:01:01.660> don't<00:01:02.050> have

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
aperture but currently we don't have

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.390 
aperture but currently we don't have
much<00:01:02.410> power<00:01:02.680> to<00:01:02.860> do<00:01:03.100> it<00:01:03.130> but<00:01:03.790> we<00:01:04.570> were<00:01:04.750> still

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
much power to do it but we were still

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.020 
much power to do it but we were still
considering<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.580> do<00:01:06.700> it<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.450> future

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.999 

at<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> moment<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.630> don't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.049> such<00:01:16.680> plan

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
at this moment we don't have such plan

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.850 
at this moment we don't have such plan
to<00:01:17.219> do<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.899> will<00:01:19.229> be<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.619> big

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to do it but if there will be the big

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.959 
to do it but if there will be the big
demand<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.399> that<00:01:20.610> area<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:21.750> are<00:01:22.340> sure<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.369> we

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:23.969 
demand on that area we are sure that we

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:32.940 
demand on that area we are sure that we
will<00:01:24.149> go<00:01:24.420> into<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.020> area<00:01:25.259> too

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.980 

we<00:01:33.950> noticed<00:01:34.820> that<00:01:35.210> there<00:01:35.480> are<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:35.840> many
