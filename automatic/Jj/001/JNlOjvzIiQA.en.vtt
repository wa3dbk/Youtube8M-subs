00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.450
 Lemgo here so once the professional cleaning and with 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.370
 Led chips Manner first put this test 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 the poker 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.110
 For example, in July, the print should look like this 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.779
 the pressure has to be cleaned often 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.580
 That is to say we take the per capita consumption are jerking 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.700
 Wiesent 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 Vienna KAP already the fans 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.680
 made with the blog 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.770
 Except Toko 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.920
 the Ã¶vp under 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.220
 Grant set faster 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.410
 and saucer 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.160
 Munich 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.570
 then you feel three to four millimeters 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.500
 Cleaning fluid pure 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.630
 and leave the printer hostile 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 just stand still 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.549
 in time you can just get the cleaning unit of poker 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520
 some 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.340
 you take the pipette 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.450
 Winter storms to help the basic is Christine Jackel 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.090
 below the freedom of association 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.750
 in spite of the moment 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.740
 Scheld her printer easy 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.290
 August 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.290
 the pump once by reason 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.010
 not cleaning his equipment 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.570
 to the group stops with twelve hours then I'll be back soon 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 Zoom after twelve hours 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.860
 Let's take the printer post at one year 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.150
 Make use of the work for every underground 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.459
 and you look away 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.459
 Colors make jewelry 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
 Fourth the way 

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:21.239
 and then again in the Bucher when printing if then again 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.639
 for 12 hours in the more expensive cleaner 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.199
 then I'll call you again soon 

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:48.840
 As good as 24 hours later, some should have done their job 

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:50.289
 to have 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.779
 with the jerk costs some 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.779
 Stars again on the ZOW Philipp high 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.829
 she can not hurt 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.989
 come out clearly better 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.989
 so FotoTV dried up 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:32.829
 This drying of Prettiner therefore important so it just does not short circuit 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.369
 going 

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:36.459
 and then you can put the pressure on 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:39.449
 League one 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:42.389
 Head in 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.389
 Patron only once 

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:03.589
 close thick 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.009
 this test 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:12.379
 either over the poker now practice or just granted now percent lies 

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:16.759
 Paper output button as long as dead so far twice flashes 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.120
 probably there a little 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.120
 Do you stop this text 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.710
 the constant theme is to keep hamburger 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.759
 Hayek completes the jets 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.180
 neither by 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.180
 Pumping must continue with it in the air Clements 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.719
 and prove that 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.719
 takes that up 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.669
 how to get the result 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.000
 the cleaner has his night work 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.469
 done 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:34.620
 Snoop of course perfectly 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.220
 that is not always so if it just should not be okay with 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.449
 to this 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.580
 then percent just repeat that around again 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.789
 Lately per capita Mar 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.669
 12 to 24 hours in which some exist
