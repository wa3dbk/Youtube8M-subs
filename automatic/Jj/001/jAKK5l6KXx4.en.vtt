the market or on the beauty market and
basically<00:00:21.970> putting<00:00:22.300> it<00:00:22.450> into<00:00:22.600> question<00:00:23.140> and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.290 
basically putting it into question and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.000 
basically putting it into question and
going<00:00:23.650> does<00:00:23.890> it<00:00:24.040> work<00:00:24.220> does<00:00:24.460> it<00:00:24.640> say<00:00:24.990> its

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
going does it work does it say its

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.800 
going does it work does it say its
lengthens<00:00:27.010> and<00:00:27.160> volumizes<00:00:27.970> blood<00:00:28.240> above<00:00:28.510> that
