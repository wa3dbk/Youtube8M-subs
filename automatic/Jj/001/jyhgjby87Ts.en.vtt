00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
then left and right I would say at the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.729 
then left and right I would say at the
moment<00:00:38.850> it's<00:00:39.270> pretty<00:00:40.170> sensitive

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
moment it's pretty sensitive

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.610 
moment it's pretty sensitive
particularly<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.600> I'm<00:00:42.840> reading<00:00:43.410> out

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
particularly on they go I'm reading out

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
particularly on they go I'm reading out
already<00:00:44.149> particularly<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.329> those<00:00:45.510> lateral

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
already particularly on those lateral

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.740 
already particularly on those lateral
and<00:00:46.200> vertical<00:00:46.230> thrusters<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.190> tiny<00:00:47.879> bit<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and vertical thrusters a tiny bit of

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
and vertical thrusters a tiny bit of
pressure<00:00:48.960> on<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.260> stick<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.829> I'm<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:51.030> out

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
pressure on that stick and I'm going out

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200 
pressure on that stick and I'm going out
pretty<00:00:51.510> much<00:00:51.600> maximum<00:00:52.230> acceleration<00:00:53.059> so<00:00:54.059> that

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
pretty much maximum acceleration so that

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.850 
pretty much maximum acceleration so that
needs<00:00:54.420> some<00:00:54.570> adjusting<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.410> can<00:00:55.530> see<00:00:55.710> just

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
needs some adjusting you can see just

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
needs some adjusting you can see just
putting<00:00:56.219> tiny<00:00:56.550> amounts<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.180> pressure<00:00:57.390> just<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
putting tiny amounts of pressure just a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.279 
putting tiny amounts of pressure just a
finger<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.920> stick<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.460> my<00:01:00.390> pilot<00:01:01.079> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
finger on that stick and my pilot is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.979 
finger on that stick and my pilot is
gonna<00:01:02.160> yep<00:01:02.850> there<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.300> he<00:01:03.390> starts<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> read

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
gonna yep there we go he starts to read

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
gonna yep there we go he starts to read
out<00:01:04.110> pretty<00:01:04.559> easily<00:01:04.830> just<00:01:05.549> from<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.790> sorry

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
out pretty easily just from what sorry

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
out pretty easily just from what sorry
any<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.510> pressure<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.200> vertical

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
any bit of pressure on that vertical

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.190 
any bit of pressure on that vertical
thrust<00:01:08.369> there<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.900> needs<00:01:10.049> some

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
thrust there so that needs some

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.370 
thrust there so that needs some
adjusting<00:01:10.740> I'd<00:01:11.310> say<00:01:11.670> but<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.659> promising<00:01:12.900> I

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
adjusting I'd say but it's promising I

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
adjusting I'd say but it's promising I
like<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.909> control

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
like that you can have that control

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.929 
like that you can have that control
there's<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.509> lot<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.900> options<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:17.549> configure

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
there's a lot of options to configure

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.219 
there's a lot of options to configure
your<00:01:18.240> controls<00:01:18.590> so<00:01:19.590> let's<00:01:19.860> jump<00:01:20.100> into<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:21.229> race

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
your controls so let's jump into a race

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:31.660 
your controls so let's jump into a race
map<00:01:22.830> Pinal<00:01:23.189> try<00:01:23.970> this<00:01:24.030> set<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.340> mode

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.660 

so<00:01:32.540> I'll<00:01:32.690> point<00:01:33.260> out<00:01:33.440> I<00:01:33.500> do<00:01:33.680> actually<00:01:34.460> have<00:01:34.610> a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
so I'll point out I do actually have a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.899 
so I'll point out I do actually have a
set<00:01:35.030> of<00:01:35.470> Thrustmaster<00:01:36.470> racing<00:01:37.100> pedals<00:01:37.430> onto

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
set of Thrustmaster racing pedals onto

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.180 
set of Thrustmaster racing pedals onto
my<00:01:38.030> desk<00:01:38.300> which<00:01:39.200> in<00:01:39.380> elite<00:01:39.620> dangerous<00:01:39.800> I<00:01:40.130> do

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
my desk which in elite dangerous I do

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
my desk which in elite dangerous I do
use<00:01:40.640> for<00:01:41.090> my<00:01:41.920> forward<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.040> reverse<00:01:43.310> thrusters

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
use for my forward and reverse thrusters

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.530 
use for my forward and reverse thrusters
that's<00:01:45.170> not<00:01:45.409> currently<00:01:45.680> supported<00:01:46.360> so<00:01:47.360> what

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
that's not currently supported so what

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.290 
that's not currently supported so what
I'm<00:01:47.630> doing<00:01:47.660> is<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:49.040> thrust<00:01:49.250> master<00:01:49.729> has<00:01:49.940> a

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
I'm doing is the thrust master has a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.469 
I'm doing is the thrust master has a
small<00:01:51.259> FRA<00:01:52.009> tool<00:01:52.190> dial<00:01:52.430> just<00:01:53.090> on<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:53.300> base

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
small FRA tool dial just on the base

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.760 
small FRA tool dial just on the base
behind<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.140> joystick<00:01:54.470> there<00:01:54.619> I'm<00:01:54.680> actually

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
behind the joystick there I'm actually

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.790 
behind the joystick there I'm actually
placing<00:01:55.280> my<00:01:55.400> palm<00:01:55.930> onto<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.050> throttle<00:01:57.380> and

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
placing my palm onto that throttle and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.180 
placing my palm onto that throttle and
then<00:01:58.610> using<00:01:58.909> my<00:01:58.940> fingers<00:01:59.479> just<00:01:59.780> to<00:01:59.930> apply<00:02:00.530> tiny

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
then using my fingers just to apply tiny

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.160 
then using my fingers just to apply tiny
bits<00:02:01.400> of<00:02:01.460> pressure<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.479> vertical<00:02:03.080> and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
bits of pressure to the vertical and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.630 
bits of pressure to the vertical and
lateral<00:02:03.350> thrusters<00:02:03.979> as<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.190> go<00:02:04.340> through<00:02:04.369> the

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
lateral thrusters as I go through the

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.700 
lateral thrusters as I go through the
gates<00:02:04.930> which<00:02:05.930> is<00:02:06.080> all<00:02:06.200> you<00:02:06.350> need<00:02:06.470> at<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
gates which is all you need at the

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.199 
gates which is all you need at the
moment<00:02:06.740> because<00:02:07.130> it's<00:02:07.399> so<00:02:07.520> sensitive

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
moment because it's so sensitive

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.690 
moment because it's so sensitive
so<00:02:08.720> I'm<00:02:08.810> able<00:02:08.959> to<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.320> that<00:02:09.580> hopefully<00:02:10.580> in

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
so I'm able to do that hopefully in

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.170 
so I'm able to do that hopefully in
future<00:02:10.970> updates<00:02:11.510> they<00:02:11.690> will<00:02:11.870> add<00:02:12.080> support<00:02:12.860> for

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
future updates they will add support for

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.440 
future updates they will add support for
pedals<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:15.459> adjust<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.550> sensitivity<00:02:16.850> and

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
pedals and adjust the sensitivity and

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.630 
pedals and adjust the sensitivity and
the<00:02:17.959> curves<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.590> these<00:02:18.800> joystick<00:02:19.250> controls

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
the curves on these joystick controls

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.180 
the curves on these joystick controls
here<00:02:19.910> to<00:02:20.060> make<00:02:20.180> it<00:02:20.269> a<00:02:20.660> little<00:02:21.080> less<00:02:21.410> sensitive

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
here to make it a little less sensitive

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.470 
here to make it a little less sensitive
that<00:02:22.760> little<00:02:22.970> easier<00:02:23.269> to<00:02:23.390> control<00:02:25.420> but<00:02:26.420> I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
that little easier to control but I

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.570 
that little easier to control but I
would<00:02:26.690> say<00:02:26.900> in<00:02:27.230> its<00:02:27.709> race<00:02:27.920> mode<00:02:28.100> it<00:02:28.220> is<00:02:28.280> quite<00:02:28.550> a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
would say in its race mode it is quite a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.840 
would say in its race mode it is quite a
nice<00:02:28.850> way<00:02:29.269> to<00:02:29.709> play<00:02:30.709> this<00:02:30.860> game<00:02:30.950> I<00:02:31.370> haven't

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
nice way to play this game I haven't

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.550 
nice way to play this game I haven't
really<00:02:32.239> touched<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.660> game<00:02:32.930> yet<00:02:33.200> I've<00:02:33.410> been

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
really touched this game yet I've been

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.810 
really touched this game yet I've been
sticking<00:02:33.739> mainly<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.400> elite<00:02:34.610> dangerous

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
sticking mainly to elite dangerous

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.460 
sticking mainly to elite dangerous
because<00:02:35.450> I<00:02:35.660> haven't<00:02:35.840> been<00:02:36.019> able<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.230> adjust

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
because I haven't been able to adjust

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.940 
because I haven't been able to adjust
the<00:02:36.650> controls<00:02:37.070> in<00:02:37.280> this<00:02:37.370> game<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:38.950> interesting

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the controls in this game to interesting

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.600 
the controls in this game to interesting
set<00:02:40.220> ups<00:02:40.370> like<00:02:40.519> this<00:02:41.530> but<00:02:42.530> suddenly<00:02:43.250> in<00:02:43.370> the

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
set ups like this but suddenly in the

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.460 
set ups like this but suddenly in the
racing<00:02:44.090> mode<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:44.420> getting<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> lot<00:02:44.989> more<00:02:45.049> fun

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
racing mode it's getting a lot more fun

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.470 
racing mode it's getting a lot more fun
and<00:02:45.500> interesting<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.220> play<00:02:46.370> requires<00:02:47.209> some

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
and interesting to play requires some

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.330 
and interesting to play requires some
optimization<00:02:48.200> however<00:02:48.530> and<00:02:49.040> running<00:02:49.280> a

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
optimization however and running a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.509 
optimization however and running a

fairly fairly beefy system that should

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
be able to run this I'm actually

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.130 
be able to run this I'm actually
