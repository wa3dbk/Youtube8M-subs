00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.580
 Welcome to our video was too 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.700
 slip in the heroic 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 difficulty level and we have that 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:27.720
 whole with two tanks three spawn and 5d 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.490
 s made and taken in the ground 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.519
 not great unlike that 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.290
 normal difficulty as usual 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:35.610
 Let's just look at the hci aspects of the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 it must be that means we explain 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.080
 not the basic tactic anymore 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 assume that if her to 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.760
 when you wanted to do that already in the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.250
 have laid bus in the north sea or 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.320
 at least the tactics knows if that 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.059
 should not be like that then is in the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.360
 video description again our money 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.470
 to the nrc mode of mosques and otherwise 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.769
 I say we are laying with that now 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.239
 actual guide frees the post 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.689
 of course more harm and has more 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.729
 Life 

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:04.140
 but that's basically true 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.030
 the biggest change will be here now 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.100
 So we made it for that 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.520
 have decided another 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.450
 to make order when going down 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.850
 otherwise we always did that we did 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.439
 always an idea and a cask or tank 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.189
 doing so have not two ds 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:22.560
 there are many downstairs and many are up there 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.109
 come this time we make tick differently 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.899
 we now have 2d it at the same time 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:29.670
 lothar sent there we have one 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.799
 look a little bit you can also calm 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.359
 send two cds under we are off 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.359
 of course, is that you always have your years 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:42.240
 afford teaches you to shine more 

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.490
 The boss in the NCR had one time 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.170
 little more time and there it was not 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.259
 so bad that not all dds directly 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.420
 Of course, March was free 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.490
 but yes there would have to stop as I said 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.899
 announce 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.149
 the ones below are that they are above 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.679
 know it now come like 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 Of course the little ones kick and 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.810
 Kill the big ones often hang and kill 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.789
 and then stop these purple balls 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.499
 Collect the dds just before they collect 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.580
 go down that means he shares before the 

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:12.170
 boxing match 1 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:16.770
 who goes down when and optimally 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.320
 yes, the group or the people no matter if the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.960
 Dating or healer not down now 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.960
 go next to the then stop the ball 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.030
 recently fallen if if 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.860
 Of course, those in need now 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.740
 not extra to wait until then big 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.800
 center environment only if now just as 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.570
 environment and then the next group 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.740
 which then goes down the takes then stop 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.960
 the ball with it directly us 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.030
 have to be rescued in between 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:50.700
 of course, the tanks down as well 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:52.920
 used to alone with it again 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.730
 your two lives and then to the emergency too 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.770
 could pick up balls again that would be 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.240
 quite important that right abwer who 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.240
 when which ball takes who and when 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.310
 goes down and so on harm the 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.660
 on her it makes the well goes on 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.550
 The boss is as I said lingered 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.930
 there are also more balls with time 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.230
 that means there are also several players 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.590
 at the same time as only two speaks 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.910
 There a bit off as I said in the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.990
 The reason is not taken 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.480
 you can also send down for ds 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:33.660
 then march comes up when you have the 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.320
 the damage is done to the boss 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:39.180
 It may not be as advisable four cds 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.310
 to send under because then have up there 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.080
 another one would have to be all purpose 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.380
 make that is a pretty nonsense 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.770
 but as you said, you can just stop 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.110
 as I said several the ds at the same time 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.320
 then they send a lot to 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.610
 pick because you do not have to have to create 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.140
 it is enough if you all the 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.980
 make it break then you get too 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.900
 hurt the boss 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:06.560
 which is still important who was with us 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.520
 very close to the topic 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.220
 that means we have to hurt properly 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.560
 go with it the form who saw then still 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.019
 finish the creek down to the youth 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:20.280
 Basically it was the bus 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:23.450
 then in hc more can than in nrc is only 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:26.520
 a small conversion as I think 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.720
 of course you can theoretically also the 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.450
 tactics continue to play in her then 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:38.550
 have you done NRC looks just as I said 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:40.140
 halt to the year with the theme by 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.940
 so far cold that you get out of there 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:44.550
 That's why we have as I said 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:50.280
 several ddr sent under that the 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:53.130
 always have their bar free and speaks 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:58.070
 with these bullets that collect from the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.510
 big network that yes are relatively 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:03.870
 thus causing damage 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.400
 Actively hurt a lot that you always 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.690
 one you have collected one and then 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.040
 as soon as possible either staked out and 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.860
 then again to make maximum damage 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.330
 or maximum cure and so on and so on 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.090
 of course, the tanks can open 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:21.900
 Which one but eventually they have to 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.970
 just stick it out it does not matter if 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.120
 you on the bus or on it goes like 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.410
 He said he does not need the bus focus 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.169
 is rather calm on the ads of the damage 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.040
 Vital as mentioned before also Offenburgs 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.150
 transfer 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.990
 then we have the fight in the last 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.790
 third of the bosses life 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:45.930
 So if you're so close to that 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:47.870
 last third of his life is easy 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.770
 pull without a fight 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.600
 besides, she may have it 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.820
 we cuddle together 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:56.470
 that the cure is just better for her 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.340
 Can it from bombarding the tanks 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:02.020
 here that the calls derive great meaning 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.720
 then when the ray comes 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.520
 if necessary together back and forth 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.199
 make a little for the healing 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:13.530
 easier and yes as I said then im 

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.850
 the last third about the fight out 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.639
 because here come again 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:23.169
 Regularly the big net does not matter if below 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:27.370
 one who killed it did not come there 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:29.470
 then regularly that means big and how 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.780
 a quick turn around just kr 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:35.380
 and otherwise just full on the boss 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.180
 go is not really much different 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:39.100
 what we already mentioned the 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.210
 interphase stay in the big one too 

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:45.340
 all just more harm more 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.820
 live and so on but that will be you 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.229
 not so the problem we prepare 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:52.780
 have the faith second two direct 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.160
 that means a bit 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.960
 then it will work 

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.760
 biggest problem will be that of the 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.000
 owner sown we have that 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:04.720
 relatively short but as I said that is 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.949
 Relatively easy in the a10 is still here and there 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.930
 already worked for the second part 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:11.160
 as I said it was with us should 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:14.780
 for you not so the problem represents 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.310
 that our money to third boss on hc 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:19.710
 I thank you with my pictures 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:22.500
 humor and over you for seeing me 

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:24.600
 have still two videos suggestions for 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.980
 if you have not seen it yet 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.690
 have a look then 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.700

 my girlfriend
