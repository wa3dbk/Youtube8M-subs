and oh another new feature is going to

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.510 
and oh another new feature is going to
be<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.360> screen<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:29.020> going<00:04:29.319> to<00:04:29.380> be<00:04:29.470> four<00:04:30.220> times

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
be the screen is going to be four times

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.879 
be the screen is going to be four times
better<00:04:30.970> than<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.389> 3gs<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.960> resolution<00:04:32.680> it's

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
better than the 3gs the resolution it's

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.260 
better than the 3gs the resolution it's
going<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> be<00:04:33.780> 326<00:04:34.780> pixels<00:04:35.020> per<00:04:35.650> inch<00:04:35.919> and<00:04:36.340> that

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
going to be 326 pixels per inch and that

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.450 
going to be 326 pixels per inch and that
is<00:04:37.599> about<00:04:37.930> as<00:04:38.110> good<00:04:38.500> as<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.710> gets<00:04:38.919> because

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
is about as good as it gets because

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.990 
is about as good as it gets because
Steve<00:04:40.389> Jobs<00:04:40.810> claimed<00:04:41.229> that<00:04:41.500> the<00:04:42.400> human<00:04:42.819> eye

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
Steve Jobs claimed that the human eye

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.790 
Steve Jobs claimed that the human eye
can<00:04:43.509> only<00:04:44.370> capture<00:04:45.449> 300<00:04:46.449> pixels<00:04:46.930> per<00:04:47.050> inch<00:04:47.259> and

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
can only capture 300 pixels per inch and

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.839 
can only capture 300 pixels per inch and
I'm<00:04:48.610> not<00:04:48.819> exactly<00:04:49.389> sure<00:04:49.599> what<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.870> means<00:04:50.139> but

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
I'm not exactly sure what that means but

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:54.749 
I'm not exactly sure what that means but
and<00:04:52.020> that's<00:04:53.020> just<00:04:53.110> what<00:04:53.410> he<00:04:53.620> said<00:04:53.650> uh<00:04:54.190> I'm

00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:56.760 
and that's just what he said uh I'm
she's<00:04:55.599> probably<00:04:55.810> right<00:04:56.169> because<00:04:56.440> he<00:04:56.530> probably

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
she's probably right because he probably

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.820 
she's probably right because he probably
looked<00:04:57.009> it<00:04:57.130> up<00:04:57.220> for<00:04:57.430> someone<00:04:57.639> but<00:04:58.590> yeah<00:04:59.590> I'm

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.969 
camera that's a really big improvement
and<00:05:51.030> then<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.659> design<00:05:53.199> it's<00:05:53.560> not<00:05:53.710> going<00:05:53.800> to<00:05:53.889> be

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
and then the design it's not going to be

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:56.839 
and then the design it's not going to be
curved<00:05:54.310> it<00:05:54.520> looks<00:05:55.000> a<00:05:55.060> little<00:05:55.150> more<00:05:55.360> boxy<00:05:55.960> and

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:56.849 
curved it looks a little more boxy and

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:02.610 
curved it looks a little more boxy and
uh<00:05:59.370> you<00:06:00.370> know<00:06:00.460> glass<00:06:00.819> on<00:06:01.150> the<00:06:01.240> back<00:06:01.479> too<00:06:01.840> so<00:06:02.319> it

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
uh you know glass on the back too so it

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.620 
uh you know glass on the back too so it
seems<00:06:02.919> like<00:06:03.130> a<00:06:03.159> pretty<00:06:03.400> fragile<00:06:03.819> device<00:06:04.330> I

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
seems like a pretty fragile device I

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.879 
seems like a pretty fragile device I
really<00:06:05.050> wouldn't<00:06:05.259> want<00:06:05.380> to<00:06:05.500> drop<00:06:05.650> one<00:06:05.860> of
