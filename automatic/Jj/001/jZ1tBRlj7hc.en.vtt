00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
sounds like something that requires a

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.290 
sounds like something that requires a
lot<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:49.980> skill<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:50.490> when<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.700> comes<00:02:50.940> down<00:02:51.240> to

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
lot of skill but when it comes down to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.449
