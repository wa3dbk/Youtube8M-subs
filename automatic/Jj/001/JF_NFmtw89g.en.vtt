a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.189> bit<00:01:11.400> about<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.790> actual<00:01:12.119> process<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
a little bit about the actual process of

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
a little bit about the actual process of
performance<00:01:13.740> analysis<00:01:14.280> well<00:01:14.820> performance<00:01:15.420> we

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
performance analysis well performance we

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.660 
performance analysis well performance we
all<00:01:16.020> start<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.500> capture<00:01:17.100> process<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
all start with the capture process and

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
all start with the capture process and
capturing<00:01:18.180> an<00:01:18.270> actor<00:01:18.659> whether<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> exists

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
capturing an actor whether that exists

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
capturing an actor whether that exists
live<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.060> on<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> motion<00:01:21.960> capture

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
live and we do that on a motion capture

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.410 
live and we do that on a motion capture
stage<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> voiceover<00:01:23.280> booth<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:24.090> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
stage and a voiceover booth or that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.969 
stage and a voiceover booth or that's
actually<00:01:24.780> taking<00:01:25.140> footage<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.740> already

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
actually taking footage that already

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.560 
actually taking footage that already
exists<00:01:26.490> we<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> work<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.180> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
exists we can work with that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.140 
exists we can work with that
so<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.290> capture<00:01:29.070> process<00:01:29.220> wants<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.909> done

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
so the capture process wants that done

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.910 
so the capture process wants that done
we<00:01:30.360> feed<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> footage<00:01:31.229> wherever<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.680> comes

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
we feed that footage wherever that comes

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
we feed that footage wherever that comes
from<00:01:32.130> into<00:01:32.549> our<00:01:32.729> proprietary<00:01:33.509> technology

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
from into our proprietary technology

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140 
from into our proprietary technology
that<00:01:34.170> analyzes<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.040> image<00:01:35.340> pixel<00:01:36.030> by<00:01:36.119> pixel

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that analyzes that image pixel by pixel

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
that analyzes that image pixel by pixel
and<00:01:36.630> tracking<00:01:37.049> every<00:01:37.560> movement<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> face

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
and tracking every movement on the face

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.429 
and tracking every movement on the face
then<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.119> artist<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.140> in

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
then we have an artist that are in

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.690 
then we have an artist that are in

3d model and then what we export to the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.139 
3d model and then what we export to the
client<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.530> animation<00:01:50.070> curves<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.850> they're

guess<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:58.619> could<00:01:58.950> define<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.460> you<00:02:00.119> know<00:02:00.210> we're

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
guess we could define is you know we're

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.030 
guess we could define is you know we're
moving<00:02:00.750> from<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.990> cartoon<00:02:01.320> performance<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
moving from a cartoon performance and

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.550 
moving from a cartoon performance and
moving<00:02:02.310> more<00:02:02.520> into<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:04.020> closer<00:02:04.229> we<00:02:04.439> can

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
moving more into the the closer we can

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
moving more into the the closer we can
get<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.890> human<00:02:05.280> real<00:02:05.549> performance<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.329> photo

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
get to a human real performance of photo

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419 
get to a human real performance of photo
real<00:02:06.719> performance<00:02:07.200> usually<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:07.920> creepier<00:02:08.310> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
real performance usually the creepier is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:08.990 
real performance usually the creepier is
gets

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
gets

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.249 
gets
and<00:02:09.090> that's<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.540> Valley<00:02:09.810> you're<00:02:10.020> kind<00:02:10.200> of

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and that's that Valley you're kind of

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.660 
and that's that Valley you're kind of
cross<00:02:10.440> and<00:02:10.680> there's<00:02:10.800> things<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.310> are<00:02:11.430> off

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
cross and there's things that are off

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.580 
cross and there's things that are off
you<00:02:12.000> might<00:02:12.150> not<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.510> exactly<00:02:12.960> why<00:02:13.200> but<00:02:13.260> it's

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you might not know exactly why but it's

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
you might not know exactly why but it's
it<00:02:14.040> doesn't<00:02:14.310> look<00:02:14.640> exactly<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.360> way<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.780> human

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it doesn't look exactly the way a human

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.920 
it doesn't look exactly the way a human
acts<00:02:16.710> and<00:02:17.040> performs<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.330> Emily<00:02:18.660> video

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
acts and performs so the Emily video

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.360 
acts and performs so the Emily video
that<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.260> guys<00:02:19.290> just<00:02:19.440> recently<00:02:20.130> released

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that you guys just recently released

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.150 
that you guys just recently released
then<00:02:20.820> that's<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.930> has<00:02:22.110> totally<00:02:22.650> surpassed

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
then that's that has totally surpassed

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.940 
then that's that has totally surpassed
the<00:02:23.580> uncanny<00:02:24.180> valley<00:02:24.360> where<00:02:25.110> we<00:02:25.500> believe<00:02:25.770> you

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the uncanny valley where we believe you

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.140 
the uncanny valley where we believe you
know<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.070> we're<00:02:26.490> very<00:02:26.520> proud<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.940> we're

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
know that we're very proud that we're

kind of on that on the cutting edge of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.490 
kind of on that on the cutting edge of

that and pushing pushing the envelope

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.080 
that and pushing pushing the envelope
across<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.710> valley<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.220> know<00:02:32.490> by<00:02:32.670> any<00:02:32.790> means

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
across the valley you know by any means

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030 
across the valley you know by any means
you<00:02:33.360> know<00:02:33.660> we're<00:02:33.810> getting<00:02:34.260> closer<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> we're

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
you know we're getting closer and we're

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.190 
you know we're getting closer and we're
getting<00:02:35.310> there<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:36.090> Emily<00:02:36.330> project<00:02:36.750> totally

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
getting there the Emily project totally

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.870 
getting there the Emily project totally
caught<00:02:37.350> my<00:02:37.500> attention<00:02:37.920> online<00:02:38.070> links<00:02:38.730> were

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
caught my attention online links were

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
caught my attention online links were
flying<00:02:39.300> around<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.600> internet<00:02:39.810> like<00:02:40.050> crazy<00:02:40.350> um

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
flying around the internet like crazy um

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.560 
flying around the internet like crazy um
I<00:02:41.340> definitely<00:02:41.580> want<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.000> go<00:02:42.090> check<00:02:42.330> out<00:02:42.450> the

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
I definitely want to go check out the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.390 
I definitely want to go check out the
lab<00:02:42.750> so<00:02:42.990> if<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.170> take<00:02:43.350> us<00:02:43.440> around<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:44.160> after

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
lab so if you take us around more after

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.620 
lab so if you take us around more after
the<00:02:44.459> show<00:02:44.640> all<00:02:44.760> right<00:02:44.850> let's<00:02:45.000> go<00:02:50.390> Pete<00:02:51.390> I<00:02:51.570> am

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
the show all right let's go Pete I am

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.080 
the show all right let's go Pete I am
now<00:02:51.810> modeling<00:02:52.350> one<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.010> head<00:02:53.550> cams<00:02:53.820> here

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
now modeling one of the head cams here

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.880 
now modeling one of the head cams here
head<00:02:54.330> Mountain<00:02:54.660> camera<00:02:54.990> okay<00:02:55.290> so<00:02:55.350> what<00:02:55.740> we

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
head Mountain camera okay so what we

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.860 
head Mountain camera okay so what we
have<00:02:56.040> here<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.490> just<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.790> small<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.540> small<00:02:57.840> just

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
have here is just a small so small just

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.600 
have here is just a small so small just
the<00:02:58.200> actual<00:02:58.560> standard<00:02:58.860> definition<00:02:59.310> camera

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
the actual standard definition camera

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.430 
the actual standard definition camera
like<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.940> said<00:03:00.150> we<00:03:00.270> can<00:03:00.450> capture<00:03:00.840> performance

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
like I said we can capture performance

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.780 
like I said we can capture performance
for<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> traditional<00:03:02.160> tripod<00:03:02.610> like<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
for the traditional tripod like a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.310 
for the traditional tripod like a
live-action<00:03:03.030> scenario<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:03.870> why<00:03:04.020> we

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
live-action scenario but why we

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.990 
live-action scenario but why we
developed<00:03:04.770> the<00:03:04.830> head<00:03:05.010> cam<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.490> so<00:03:05.700> that<00:03:05.880> we

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
developed the head cam just so that we

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.640 
developed the head cam just so that we
can<00:03:06.209> work<00:03:06.810> in<00:03:06.959> like<00:03:07.080> a<00:03:07.110> motion<00:03:07.500> capture

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
can work in like a motion capture

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.110 
can work in like a motion capture
environment<00:03:08.280> where<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> studio<00:03:08.790> wants<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
environment where a studio wants to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.420 
environment where a studio wants to
capture<00:03:09.360> all<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.110> body<00:03:10.470> movement<00:03:10.770> now<00:03:11.070> we<00:03:11.130> can

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
capture all the body movement now we can

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.040 
capture all the body movement now we can
capture<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.880> facial<00:03:12.209> performance<00:03:12.690> all<00:03:12.810> right

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
capture the facial performance all right

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.449 
capture the facial performance all right
so<00:03:13.200> we<00:03:13.320> could<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.620> feel<00:03:13.800> a<00:03:13.860> little<00:03:13.980> behind

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
so we could just feel a little behind

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.580 
so we could just feel a little behind
the<00:03:14.550> scenes<00:03:14.790> on<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> Emily<00:03:15.480> project<00:03:15.930> yeah<00:03:16.200> so

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
the scenes on the Emily project yeah so

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.560 
the scenes on the Emily project yeah so
um<00:03:16.890> like<00:03:17.519> I<00:03:17.640> was<00:03:17.760> explaining<00:03:18.000> what<00:03:18.300> we<00:03:18.420> did

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
um like I was explaining what we did

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.120 
um like I was explaining what we did
with<00:03:18.750> Emily<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.140> we<00:03:19.260> capture<00:03:19.620> her<00:03:19.769> from<00:03:19.950> two

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
with Emily is we capture her from two

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.280 
with Emily is we capture her from two
different<00:03:20.250> angles<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.820> you<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.269> here<00:03:21.540> her

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
different angles as you can see here her

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
different angles as you can see here her
face<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.709> very<00:03:22.830> nicely<00:03:23.160> evenly<00:03:23.790> lit<00:03:23.970> we<00:03:24.239> can

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
face is very nicely evenly lit we can

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.210 
face is very nicely evenly lit we can
see<00:03:24.570> and<00:03:24.810> capture<00:03:25.230> all<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.440> her<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:25.860> subtle

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
see and capture all of her little subtle

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.770 
see and capture all of her little subtle
details<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.880> her<00:03:27.030> performance<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
details and her performance that you

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.259 
details and her performance that you
gave<00:03:28.019> this<00:03:28.709> is<00:03:28.860> real<00:03:29.160> Emily<00:03:29.489> giving<00:03:30.120> that

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
gave this is real Emily giving that

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.150 
gave this is real Emily giving that
performance<00:03:30.420> so<00:03:31.110> this<00:03:31.230> is<00:03:31.440> basically<00:03:31.800> set<00:03:32.070> the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
performance so this is basically set the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.920 
performance so this is basically set the
bar<00:03:32.340> for<00:03:32.370> what<00:03:32.760> we<00:03:32.880> were<00:03:33.060> trying<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:33.420> omit<00:03:33.810> in

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
bar for what we were trying to omit in

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.720 
bar for what we were trying to omit in
the<00:03:34.050> end<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.100> we<00:03:35.190> go<00:03:35.340> from<00:03:35.640> image<00:03:36.239> analysis<00:03:36.930> to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
the end so we go from image analysis to

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.830 
the end so we go from image analysis to
performance<00:03:38.730> transfer<00:03:39.120> wellness<00:03:39.420> transfer

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840

part<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.140> our<00:03:40.230> process<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.890> right<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.640> what<00:03:41.760> we

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
part of our process all right so what we

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.729 
part of our process all right so what we
did<00:03:41.940> with<00:03:42.120> Emily<00:03:42.390> as<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.630> can<00:03:42.780> see<00:03:42.930> here<00:03:43.170> we've

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
did with Emily as you can see here we've

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:45.800 
did with Emily as you can see here we've
taken<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.250> image<00:03:44.489> analysis<00:03:45.000> data<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.570> if<00:03:45.690> we

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
taken that image analysis data and if we

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.900 
taken that image analysis data and if we
targeted<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.620> model<00:03:46.950> in<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.160> middle<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.700> her

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
targeted the model in the middle of her

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.720 
targeted the model in the middle of her
kind<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.269> floating<00:03:48.600> head<00:03:48.989> is<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.340> 3d<00:03:50.340> model

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
kind of a floating head is a 3d model

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.030 
kind of a floating head is a 3d model
that<00:03:51.480> we've<00:03:51.630> retargeted<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.650> that<00:03:52.830> data

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
that we've retargeted that that data

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.530 
that we've retargeted that that data
that<00:03:53.280> we've<00:03:53.459> fed<00:03:53.730> in<00:03:53.880> from<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.209> image

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
that we've fed in from the image

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.229 
that we've fed in from the image
analysis<00:03:55.019> process<00:03:55.440> so<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.730> controls<00:03:57.120> that

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
analysis process so the controls that

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.240 
analysis process so the controls that
our<00:03:57.540> animators<00:03:58.320> have<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.620> do<00:03:58.739> on<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.100> right

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
our animators have to do on the right

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.979 
our animators have to do on the right
side<00:03:59.519> is<00:03:59.760> those<00:03:59.970> little<00:04:00.269> blue<00:04:00.420> controls<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
side is those little blue controls you

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.259 
side is those little blue controls you
can<00:04:01.049> actually<00:04:01.440> drive<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:02.100> face<00:04:02.489> to

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
can actually drive that face to

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.390 
can actually drive that face to
basically<00:04:03.600> mimic<00:04:04.049> her<00:04:04.200> performance<00:04:04.799> what

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
basically mimic her performance what

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.650 
basically mimic her performance what
we're<00:04:05.580> looking<00:04:05.910> at<00:04:06.030> here<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.269> our<00:04:06.390> final

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
we're looking at here is our final

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.960 
we're looking at here is our final
output<00:04:07.040> final<00:04:08.040> render<00:04:08.340> that<00:04:08.519> is<00:04:08.640> basically

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
output final render that is basically

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.940 
output final render that is basically
taking<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.690> performance<00:04:10.260> transfer<00:04:10.650> part<00:04:10.860> of

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
taking the performance transfer part of

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.370 
taking the performance transfer part of
our<00:04:11.040> process<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.640> animation<00:04:12.200> combining<00:04:13.200> with

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
our process the animation combining with

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.250 
our process the animation combining with
our<00:04:13.730> lighting<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:14.970> render<00:04:15.180> set<00:04:15.390> up<00:04:15.540> for<00:04:16.229> all

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
our lighting and render set up for all

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.220 
our lighting and render set up for all
the<00:04:16.440> shots<00:04:16.650> that<00:04:16.769> we<00:04:16.859> did

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
the shots that we did

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.660 
the shots that we did
and<00:04:17.350> take<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:17.950> through<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.190> performance

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
and take you through the performance

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.650 
and take you through the performance
here<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.570> that<00:04:19.660> you<00:04:19.750> can<00:04:19.900> see<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:22.450> we<00:04:22.570> have

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
here so that you can see that we have

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.910 
here so that you can see that we have
matched<00:04:22.870> from<00:04:23.080> what<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.350> saw<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:23.770> the

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
matched from what you saw on the

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.730 
matched from what you saw on the
performance<00:04:24.430> analysis<00:04:24.910> side<00:04:25.500> this<00:04:26.500> is

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
performance analysis side this is

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.640 
performance analysis side this is
actually<00:04:27.190> a<00:04:27.220> CG<00:04:27.640> model<00:04:28.000> of<00:04:28.210> Emily<00:04:28.660> doing<00:04:29.470> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
actually a CG model of Emily doing the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.110 
actually a CG model of Emily doing the
same<00:04:29.830> performance<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.490> she<00:04:30.610> was<00:04:30.730> doing<00:04:31.000> in

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
same performance that she was doing in

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.220 
same performance that she was doing in
live-action<00:04:31.300> in<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.870> live-action<00:04:32.080> world<00:04:32.620> Wow

all right well we learned a lot about

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:38.610 
all right well we learned a lot about
