00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 with the supreme dream of bolivar came the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.620
 progress for port sandino and its 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.420
 localities and is that the construction of 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.009
 the refinery already contributes with the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.959
 socio-economic development with 

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:14.730
 creation of direct jobs and better 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.740
 access to the area 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 the government may have given it this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 opportunity to get ahead because 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.630
 here hardly gave employment to women 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.470
 look to have enough project because 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.080
 missing already say a refinery 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.210
 part that project yet and here 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.860
 also quite work 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.590
 people have where options for 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.350
 decide to work 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.270
 and we hope that this dream is more 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.190
 that a dream awakens with the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.840
 Villalba construction will be guaranteed 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.270
 the conditions to the labor that 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.390
 will be in charge of this project in the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.199
 citadel or the dormitory city which 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.739
 in its different stages it has also been 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.110
 achieved practically conclude there goes to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.470
 have a capacity to house by the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.350
 order of 700 workers the supreme 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.850
 bolívar's dream is divided into three phases 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.440
 it is expected that the first phase of this 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 mega project is completed in the year 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.910
 2015 this will have a capacity of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.320
 storage and distribution of more than 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.530
 one million barrels of products 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.240
 refined here have been removed more than 60 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.240
 apples where the 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.910
 storage tanks is already a work 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.210
 which is awarded then we have 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:31.490
 let's say here 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 subcontractor this is doing 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.130
 the civil works once we 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 we have finished the design of the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.970
 duly certified terraces has been 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.490
 made a delivery to the company in charge 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.800
 of the construction and right now they are 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.870
 preparing the conditions where they are going to 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.560
 come let's say what we call the 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.770
 rings of tanks on about 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.300
 which are going to be and are going to get up 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.400
 the capacity of storing and ringing 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:05.210
 the scope of this first phase in the 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.310
 construction of everything from a plant 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:11.210
 reception storage and distribution 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.240
 of one million 80 barrels of fuel 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.220
 we are talking about the types of five 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:21.800
 types of fuel with the case of 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.900
 diesel petrol full 10 today and the ep the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.750
 second and third phase will be built in 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.950
 140 apples also the project is projected 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.870
 construction of the plant 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.320
 fuel and refinery distribution 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.340
 we would have the capacity of 1 million 80 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.599
 barrels would have 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.209
 the say the biggest terminal 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:45.180
 built at a level that even at the 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.120
 Central American where you are 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.160
 dispatching this type of these five 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.810
 types of products nationally going to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.690
 be a refinery of 100 thousand barrels 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.610
 by day true the first impact that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 we have is the direct impact 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.390
 of direct labor and all 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.190
 commercial activity that generates this 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.720
 construction stage here we are 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.780
 talking about buying and moving and charter 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.310
 is of any type of equipment in the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.260
 construction of the refinery in its 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.090
 Total investment is more than 4 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.489
 billion dollars that translate 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.079
 in more development for the country this 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.970
 achievement is possible thanks to the 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.560
 solidarity and good relations with 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.079
 the brother town of venezuela 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.079
