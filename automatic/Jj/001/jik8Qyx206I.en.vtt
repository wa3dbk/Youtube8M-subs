00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.340
Hmmm... Hmmm...

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
Hmmm... Mmmm... Ha ha ha... ha ha ha....

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.980
One day while Krishna was playing with Balaram,

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.860
and his other friends...

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.540
He heard the voice of a woman cried out in the street.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.880
Fruits, bananas, mangoes, oranges,  Guavas.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.100
Fruits, Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Guavas.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.860
Immediately Krishna wanted to buy some of them.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.740
When the fruit seller saw Krishna,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.300
She became completely absorbed in his wonderful sight.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.500
Oh dear lady!

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.720
I want to eat fruits.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.540
Give me some of them.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.920
What will you give me in return?

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.580
Immediately, Krishna wanted to buy some of them.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.380
But he had no money.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.720
His eager eyes noticed

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.560
a huge heap of grains stocked nearby.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.520
He collected a handful of grains in his tiny hands and ran to the street.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.080
The fruit seller was waiting outside the gate.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.160
I have brought lots of grains with me.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.220
You can take them for the fruits.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.680
Oh boy!

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.040
There are no grains in your hands.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.660
Krishna looked at his hands,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.740
and was surprised to see that all the grains were gone.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.580
The fruit seller looked at the Krishna's face and said,

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.740
If u call me mother, and sit on my lap

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.840
You may take all the fruits that you like.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.480
krishna looked around to see, Is anyone was around?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.860
He quickly jumped into the Lady's lap and said "Mother".

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.440
Then, immediately he jumped out of the lap and demanded,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.560
Maa, you should give me the fruits

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.780
The fruit seller Lady was delighted.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.160
She wanted to give him everything all of a fruits.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.040
He held fruits against his chest both hands,

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.340
and went off dancing as small boys do.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.420
When she went home and looked into her basket,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.460
She could not believe her eyes,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.380
The basket was full of  jewels and golds.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.700
By performing this miracle, Krishna showed,

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.440
that anything offered to him with love and affection,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.020
Returns to the devotees, a thousand fold increased.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.680
Son...

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.220
it is your birthday today.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.380
Go and bring a female calf here and worship her.
