once<00:04:18.880> so<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.120> guess<00:04:19.419> because<00:04:19.720> some<00:04:19.900> people<00:04:20.260> does

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
once so I guess because some people does

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.570 
once so I guess because some people does
not<00:04:20.590> work<00:04:20.799> for<00:04:21.070> I<00:04:21.310> and<00:04:22.000> I<00:04:22.360> don't<00:04:22.539> know<00:04:22.630> why<00:04:22.810> but
