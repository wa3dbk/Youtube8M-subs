00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
they started using it illegally I think

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.930 
they started using it illegally I think

there's three types of people who can
use<00:02:19.090> marijuana<00:02:19.450> our<00:02:20.350> three<00:02:20.830> types<00:02:21.100> of

use marijuana our three types of
potheads<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:21.940> guess<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.180> could<00:02:22.240> say<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:23.170> first

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
potheads I guess you could say the first

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.250 
potheads I guess you could say the first
is<00:02:23.620> people<00:02:24.370> whose<00:02:24.910> lies<00:02:25.150> are<00:02:25.420> not<00:02:25.600> changed<00:02:26.170> at

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
is people whose lies are not changed at

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.570 
is people whose lies are not changed at
all<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.560> fact<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.920> occasionally<00:02:27.460> make

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
all the fact that occasionally make

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.670 
all the fact that occasionally make
smoke<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.880> little<00:02:28.000> weed<00:02:28.290> their<00:02:29.290> lives<00:02:29.530> are

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
smoke a little weed their lives are

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.810 
smoke a little weed their lives are
pretty<00:02:29.770> much<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.980> same<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.670> do

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
pretty much the same that it's do

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.030 
pretty much the same that it's do
exactly<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:31.960> they<00:02:32.110> always<00:02:32.350> did<00:02:32.650> except

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
exactly what they always did except

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.410 
exactly what they always did except
occasionally<00:02:33.460> the<00:02:33.760> weekends<00:02:34.120> they<00:02:34.180> get<00:02:34.300> high

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
occasionally the weekends they get high

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.070 
occasionally the weekends they get high
I<00:02:34.800> think<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:36.070> lot<00:02:36.100> of<00:02:36.310> some<00:02:36.730> other<00:02:36.850> people<00:02:37.180> can

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
I think a lot of some other people can

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.840 
I think a lot of some other people can
smoke<00:02:38.380> a<00:02:38.410> little<00:02:38.590> bit<00:02:38.770> of<00:02:38.860> weed<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.250> their

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
smoke a little bit of weed and their

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.090 
smoke a little bit of weed and their
lives<00:02:39.970> are<00:02:40.150> actually<00:02:40.480> improved<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.740> they

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
lives are actually improved because they

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.740 
lives are actually improved because they
help<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.610> physical<00:02:42.910> or<00:02:43.000> mental<00:02:43.150> ailments

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
help the physical or mental ailments

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.660 
help the physical or mental ailments
that<00:02:43.810> they<00:02:44.050> may<00:02:44.230> have<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.620> think<00:02:44.920> some<00:02:45.340> people

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
that they may have I think some people

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.330 
that they may have I think some people
can<00:02:46.060> overdo<00:02:46.480> it<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.810> do<00:02:47.650> nothing<00:02:47.890> but<00:02:48.130> smoke

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
can overdo it and do nothing but smoke

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.010 
can overdo it and do nothing but smoke
weed<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.790> make<00:02:48.910> some<00:02:49.090> slower<00:02:49.300> stupider<00:02:49.840> in

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
weed and to make some slower stupider in

weed and to make some slower stupider in
Rome<00:02:50.500> as<00:02:50.620> your<00:02:50.740> lives<00:02:50.920> but<00:02:51.489> I<00:02:51.520> think<00:02:51.640> that's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
Rome as your lives but I think that's

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.120 
Rome as your lives but I think that's
