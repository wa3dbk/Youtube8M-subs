00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480 

so<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:00.870> get<00:00:01.050> questioned<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.500> lot<00:00:01.680> about<00:00:01.860> the

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so I get questioned a lot about the

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.010 
so I get questioned a lot about the
various<00:00:02.760> protein<00:00:03.210> products<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:03.720> come<00:00:03.870> out

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
various protein products that come out

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.230 
various protein products that come out
over<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> last<00:00:05.069> decade<00:00:05.490> we've<00:00:05.520> we've<00:00:05.970> seen

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
over the last decade we've we've seen

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.940 
over the last decade we've we've seen
way<00:00:06.359> concentrate<00:00:06.960> come<00:00:07.140> onto<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.440> market<00:00:07.529> and

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
way concentrate come onto the market and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.700 
way concentrate come onto the market and
then<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:08.160> went<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.429> weigh<00:00:08.580> isolates<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:10.139> now

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
then it went to weigh isolates and now

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.709 
then it went to weigh isolates and now
it<00:00:11.340> seems<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.759> one<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> popular<00:00:12.480> things

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
it seems like one of the popular things

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.140 
it seems like one of the popular things
as<00:00:12.870> protein<00:00:13.259> blends<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.950> lot<00:00:14.759> of<00:00:14.849> what's<00:00:15.000> being

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
as protein blends a lot of what's being

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
as protein blends a lot of what's being
said<00:00:15.420> about<00:00:15.450> those<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.139> talking<00:00:16.980> about

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
said about those is talking about

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.029 
said about those is talking about
proteins<00:00:17.820> some<00:00:18.539> of<00:00:18.660> which<00:00:18.810> are<00:00:19.080> absorbed

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
proteins some of which are absorbed

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.570 
proteins some of which are absorbed
quickly<00:00:20.189> some<00:00:20.699> are<00:00:21.029> absorbed<00:00:21.510> slowly<00:00:21.810> and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
quickly some are absorbed slowly and

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.710 
quickly some are absorbed slowly and
there's<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.640> lot<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.880> verbiage<00:00:24.269> out<00:00:24.449> there

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
there's a lot of verbiage out there

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.150 
there's a lot of verbiage out there
about<00:00:25.939> they're<00:00:26.939> actually<00:00:27.480> being<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
about they're actually being a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.510 
about they're actually being a
sensibility<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.609> having<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:30.449> these<00:00:31.520> some

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
sensibility to having these these some

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.209 
sensibility to having these these some
proteins<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.300> absorb<00:00:33.809> slowly<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.980> fact

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
proteins that absorb slowly but the fact

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.740 
proteins that absorb slowly but the fact
of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.430> matter<00:00:35.489> is<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.059> more<00:00:36.210> slowly<00:00:36.510> of

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
of the matter is the more slowly of

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.110 
of the matter is the more slowly of
protein<00:00:37.230> absorbs<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> less<00:00:38.460> likely<00:00:38.730> you<00:00:38.969> are

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
protein absorbs the less likely you are

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.450 
protein absorbs the less likely you are
to<00:00:39.540> actually<00:00:40.290> get<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.649> protein<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.340> your

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
to actually get that protein into your

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.139 
to actually get that protein into your
blood<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.239> tissues<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:44.059> you<00:00:45.059> know

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
blood and into your tissues so you know

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.940 
blood and into your tissues so you know
I<00:00:45.180> hear<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.539> stuff<00:00:45.780> about<00:00:45.899> blends<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950 
I hear this stuff about blends and and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.680 
I hear this stuff about blends and and
the<00:00:49.950> fact<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.520> there's<00:00:51.239> some<00:00:51.420> science

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the fact of it is there's some science

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.889 
the fact of it is there's some science
there<00:00:52.399> that<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.640> isn't<00:00:53.820> being<00:00:54.149> used<00:00:54.239> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
there that just isn't being used it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.900 
there that just isn't being used it's
not<00:00:55.050> being<00:00:55.260> utilized<00:00:55.500> there<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:56.730> are

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
not being utilized there there there are

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.880 
not being utilized there there there are
gimmicks<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.989> are<00:00:58.109> ways<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.410> slow<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
gimmicks there are ways to slow a

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.459 
gimmicks there are ways to slow a
protein<00:00:59.399> down<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.629> have<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.930> end<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.350> in

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
protein down and not have it end up in

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689 
protein down and not have it end up in
the<00:01:01.590> colon<00:01:01.800> where<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.070> can't<00:01:02.280> do<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.520> any<00:01:02.550> good

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
the colon where it can't do you any good

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.690 
the colon where it can't do you any good
but<00:01:03.510> those<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.589> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> technology<00:01:05.100> isn't

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
but those that kind of technology isn't

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.750 
but those that kind of technology isn't
in<00:01:05.970> any<00:01:06.090> products<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:06.720> now<00:01:07.760> secondarily

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
in any products right now secondarily

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.330 
in any products right now secondarily
there's<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.360> no<00:01:09.770> reason<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.159> do<00:01:11.310> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
there's really no reason to do that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
there's really no reason to do that
because<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.689> absorb<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
because if you can absorb all of the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.679 
because if you can absorb all of the
protein<00:01:14.130> quickly<00:01:14.640> there's<00:01:15.119> no<00:01:15.270> reason<00:01:15.659> to

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
protein quickly there's no reason to

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.780 
protein quickly there's no reason to
extend<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.530> over<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.860> four<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.369> five-hour

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
extend it out over a four or five-hour

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.020 
extend it out over a four or five-hour
period<00:01:18.110> which<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.439> cannot<00:01:19.890> do<00:01:20.220> with<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
period which you cannot do with the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.260 
period which you cannot do with the
current<00:01:21.240> blend<00:01:22.340> products<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.180> them

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
current blend products and a lot of them

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.910 
current blend products and a lot of them
that<00:01:24.509> are<00:01:24.540> currently<00:01:25.290> being<00:01:25.439> called<00:01:25.710> my<00:01:25.860> cell

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
metabolic response from the protein

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
metabolic response from the protein
supplement<00:01:46.500> why<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.149> anything

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
supplement why would you take anything

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.929 
supplement why would you take anything
but<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.990> hydrolyzed<00:01:49.560> protein<00:01:49.799> you<00:01:50.460> take<00:01:50.700> all

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
but a hydrolyzed protein you take all
