coming out and I just hated the fourth

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.870 
coming out and I just hated the fourth
book<00:01:29.229> I<00:01:29.409> thought<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.710> was<00:01:29.770> terrible<00:01:30.310> he

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.430 
book I thought it was terrible he
definitely<00:01:31.180> concluded<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> series<00:01:32.229> after

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
definitely concluded the series after

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.289 
definitely concluded the series after
the<00:01:32.590> third<00:01:32.860> book<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.430> with<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> fourth<00:01:33.940> one<00:01:34.150> I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
just didn't see any point in why he

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.780 
just didn't see any point in why he

myself<00:02:56.209> buying<00:02:56.840> the<00:02:57.170> second<00:02:57.470> book<00:02:57.620> i<00:02:57.769> think<00:02:58.099> if

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
myself buying the second book i think if

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.039

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.700 
the writing isn't that good um I just
really<00:05:24.580> like<00:05:24.700> the<00:05:24.850> setting<00:05:25.210> so<00:05:25.840> I<00:05:26.260> think<00:05:26.380> I'm

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
really like the setting so I think I'm

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.980 
really like the setting so I think I'm
just<00:05:26.950> done<00:05:27.130> with<00:05:27.160> that<00:05:27.460> one<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.210> last<00:05:28.720> series

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
just done with that one and last series

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.130 
just done with that one and last series
that<00:05:29.169> I<00:05:29.200> probably<00:05:29.860> won't<00:05:30.430> be<00:05:30.760> finishing<00:05:31.180> which

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
that I probably won't be finishing which

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.640 
that I probably won't be finishing which
I<00:05:32.350> might<00:05:32.590> get<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:32.950> most<00:05:33.450> hate<00:05:34.450> for<00:05:34.780> would<00:05:35.470> be

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
I might get the most hate for would be

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.190 
I might get the most hate for would be
the<00:05:35.830> shadow<00:05:36.100> me<00:05:36.310> series<00:05:36.580> by<00:05:36.730> tana<00:05:37.000> mafi<00:05:37.390> I<00:05:37.600> read

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
about it and I don't really feel the

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.469 
about it and I don't really feel the
same<00:05:54.040> at<00:05:54.550> least<00:05:54.700> like<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.970> first<00:05:55.210> book

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.100 
everyone was like it was so amazing and
I<00:05:57.400> just<00:05:57.430> kind<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:57.970> liked<00:05:58.210> it<00:05:58.360> it<00:05:58.630> didn't<00:05:58.930> think

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
I just kind of liked it it didn't think

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.740 
I just kind of liked it it didn't think
it<00:05:59.229> was<00:05:59.320> like<00:05:59.620> some<00:06:00.010> fantastic<00:06:00.910> work<00:06:01.120> of

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
it was like some fantastic work of

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.480 
it was like some fantastic work of
literature<00:06:02.050> anything<00:06:02.830> I<00:06:02.979> didn't<00:06:03.220> think<00:06:03.400> it

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
literature anything I didn't think it

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.950 
literature anything I didn't think it
was<00:06:03.550> a<00:06:03.610> must-read<00:06:04.180> um<00:06:04.570> I<00:06:06.270> don't<00:06:07.270> know<00:06:07.450> I<00:06:07.479> liked

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 
was a must-read um I don't know I liked

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.260 
was a must-read um I don't know I liked
this<00:06:08.260> book<00:06:08.919> but<00:06:09.250> i<00:06:09.310> don't<00:06:09.610> i<00:06:09.850> don't<00:06:09.970> know<00:06:10.240> i

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
this book but i don't i don't know i

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.740 
this book but i don't i don't know i
just<00:06:10.390> don't<00:06:10.690> really<00:06:11.760> see<00:06:12.760> myself<00:06:12.940> really

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
just don't really see myself really

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.420 
just don't really see myself really
pushing<00:06:14.200> myself<00:06:14.350> to<00:06:14.710> finish<00:06:14.860> it<00:06:15.130> and<00:06:15.310> i<00:06:15.400> think

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
pushing myself to finish it and i think

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.340 
pushing myself to finish it and i think
i<00:06:15.760> have<00:06:15.789> so<00:06:16.120> many<00:06:16.150> series<00:06:16.660> open<00:06:16.960> that<00:06:17.110> i<00:06:17.140> would

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:17.350 
i have so many series open that i would

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:20.480 
i have so many series open that i would
rather<00:06:18.010> read<00:06:18.370> than<00:06:18.430> that

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:20.490 
rather read than that

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.980 
rather read than that
so<00:06:21.490> those<00:06:22.060> are<00:06:22.090> the<00:06:22.270> series<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:22.810> I'm

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
so those are the series that I'm

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.130 
so those are the series that I'm
probably<00:06:23.410> not<00:06:23.860> going<00:06:24.010> to<00:06:24.130> finish<00:06:25.110> in<00:06:26.110> the

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
probably not going to finish in the

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.600 
probably not going to finish in the
