that I have to use these drops with

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.429 
that I have to use these drops with
every<00:01:40.500> form<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> liquid<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> mentioned

every form of liquid that I mentioned
this<00:01:43.439> does<00:01:43.710> not<00:01:43.860> work<00:01:44.130> very<00:01:44.189> well<00:01:44.520> with<00:01:44.790> me

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
this does not work very well with me

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.539 
this does not work very well with me
with<00:01:45.360> beauty<00:01:45.780> oils<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.740> those<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> you<00:01:47.340> that

are<00:01:47.670> extremely<00:01:48.299> dry<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.220> may<00:01:50.399> work

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640

are extremely dry I think it may work
for<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.630> reason<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.500> doesn't

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
for you the reason I think it doesn't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.980 
for you the reason I think it doesn't
work<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:52.920> me<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.329> do<00:01:54.630> have<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
work for me is because I do have a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.899 
work for me is because I do have a
little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.290> more<00:01:55.439> oil<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:55.979> t-zone<00:01:56.280> and

little bit more oil in my t-zone and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
these drops has really given me a great

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.970 
these drops has really given me a great
coverage<00:04:57.180> that's<00:04:57.780> given<00:04:58.080> me<00:04:58.169> the<00:04:58.290> glow<00:04:58.560> this

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
coverage that's given me the glow this

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.280 
coverage that's given me the glow this
is<00:04:59.130> more<00:04:59.370> of<00:04:59.610> like<00:04:59.880> a<00:05:00.030> satin<00:05:00.720> to<00:05:00.930> Matt<00:05:01.110> if

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.659 
is more of like a satin to Matt if
oil-free<00:05:01.919> so<00:05:02.790> I<00:05:03.650> think<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:05.100> if<00:05:05.220> your<00:05:05.400> dry

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
oil-free so I think that if your dry

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.760 
oil-free so I think that if your dry
skin<00:05:05.730> since<00:05:06.720> you're<00:05:06.870> mixing<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.440> to<00:05:07.620> your

oil-free<00:05:19.350> and<00:05:19.620> it's<00:05:20.400> not<00:05:20.550> super<00:05:20.790> matte<00:05:21.240> but

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
oil-free and it's not super matte but

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.840 
oil-free and it's not super matte but
I'm<00:05:22.350> sure<00:05:22.680> if<00:05:22.740> you<00:05:22.830> mix<00:05:23.130> it<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:23.340> something

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
I'm sure if you mix it with something

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.430 
I'm sure if you mix it with something
that's<00:05:24.000> more<00:05:24.240> mattes<00:05:24.540> it's<00:05:24.870> going<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.290> give

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
that's more mattes it's going to give

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.260 
that's more mattes it's going to give
you<00:05:25.530> more<00:05:25.919> amount<00:05:26.070> of<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.280> coverage<00:05:26.640> because

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
you more amount of a coverage because

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.110 
you more amount of a coverage because
you're<00:05:27.419> customizing<00:05:27.870> it<00:05:28.229> so<00:05:28.830> I<00:05:29.130> did<00:05:29.340> demo<00:05:29.580> me

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:30.120 
you're customizing it so I did demo me

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
just like I explained what works best

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.870 
just like I explained what works best
for<00:06:16.449> me<00:06:16.750> is<00:06:16.960> something<00:06:17.740> that<00:06:18.070> is<00:06:18.220> more<00:06:18.520> of<00:06:18.699> a

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
for me is something that is more of a

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.100 
for me is something that is more of a
lotion<00:06:19.120> texture<00:06:19.810> or<00:06:20.020> foundations<00:06:21.840> the<00:06:22.840> oils

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
lotion texture or foundations the oils

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.260 
lotion texture or foundations the oils
didn't<00:06:23.440> work<00:06:23.560> so<00:06:23.590> much<00:06:23.919> for<00:06:24.280> me<00:06:24.370> or<00:06:24.580> a<00:06:24.610> silicone

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 
didn't work so much for me or a silicone

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.960 
didn't work so much for me or a silicone
base<00:06:25.510> but<00:06:26.290> I've<00:06:26.740> heard<00:06:27.040> that<00:06:27.100> some<00:06:27.669> people

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
base but I've heard that some people

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.390

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
the other video there are 25 shades

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:44.969 
the other video there are 25 shades

ranging from pink neutral and golden so

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:46.140 
ranging from pink neutral and golden so

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:48.639 
shade there are point 5 ounces in this

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.390 
shade there are point 5 ounces in this
jar<00:06:49.320> which<00:06:50.320> is<00:06:50.350> less<00:06:50.800> than<00:06:51.010> a<00:06:51.040> normal

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 
jar which is less than a normal

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.040 
jar which is less than a normal
foundation<00:06:51.580> but<00:06:52.180> remember<00:06:52.570> this<00:06:52.690> is<00:06:52.870> more

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
foundation but remember this is more

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.960
