00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.710
 here 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.660

 so today 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.190
 good I'll show you a little 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.640
 my house to finish here is the night I 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.640
 makes a small garden with a walk 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:01.000
 to keep I like idea 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.000
 small trees 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.220
 I did everything for 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.610
 so that you appreciate your set 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.610
 video 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.500
 so 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.250
 I also built a 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 here is the hut 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.150
 the slippery carpet with small jets 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.340
 of water these new hut 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.690
 the slippery carpet so here we go 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.120
 go down 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.590
 here is the camera with stairs 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.800
 Spiral 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.370
 that's new so I did a 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.370
 wine cellar 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.850
 a little 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.960
 we have some tricks to do some sculpture 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.920
 on the left you see in 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.920
 kind of records 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.060
 and the voice 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.200
 good i feel at peace 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.470
 I think it's the other side that is 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.600
 we will hand over 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.550
 everything correctly 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.020
 and I made myself 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.020
 a kind of small lab 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.450
 Metallic fears really to give 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.460
 the impression that you must not enter 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.940
 it's dangerous 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.720
 all that 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.550
 and I made a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.060
 we establish as you 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.250
 come to see it is a small office 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.150
 to do experiments a computer 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.840
 laptop in a computer I do not know 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.840
 if I have a thousand computers 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.310
 so 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.250
 ben me I 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 let me look a little here is my 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.730
 character as you have it 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.730
 and here is the girl I created 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.030
 1 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.940
 so 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.330
 I'm going to cut I cut a lot 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.060
 video because 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.560
 no it lasts a long time 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.850
 so we forced 2 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.550
 to delete some scenes 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.230
 so here I do the code testing check in 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.739
 to hot bled for 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.739
 gift 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.760
 to disable needs like that 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.690
 for the needs of the video it's going to be 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.510
 easier 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.980
 So here we start again because sanaa 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.980

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.350
 bad clothes 

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.449
