00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.810
 this goes by levels and by cups in the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.900

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.370
 go attacking in a player and you compete 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.590
 against the console you can say so 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.030
 an excellent game to hang out and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.430

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 very fun game and I recommend it 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.820
 it's clear it's big and it's free in the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.160

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.990
 game that is crazy taxi here as 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.810
 we can see this is the classic game of 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.570
 play 1 I think play 2 of crazy taxi 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.000

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.920
 put works three minutes here as you see 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.220
 this game has a nice interface and 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.550
 is very well adapted to what it is 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.410
 the May platform is here by 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.570
 example I chose that driver that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.780
 This game is about you being a taxi driver 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.210
 and you have to go picking up people and you 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.520

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.240
 little green arrow that is in the part 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.490
 superior and good also as you can see 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.090
 a time limit that in this case 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.400
 I still have 240 seconds the truth that 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.730
 It is a very entertaining game 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.070

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.990
 example this driver pays me equal we 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.660
 I go down the street for example here I grab 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:11.650
 this one that is on the other side and good here 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.120
 he also asks me to go there 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.230
 well the truth is a very game 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.930
 entertaining is called crazy taxi and has 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.360
 a cost in the costs in the I will be 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.819
 putting on the screen we continue with 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.709
 the post 98 that are called traffic 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.069

 example and have to be able to buy 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.230
 different cars and here in this case of 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.480
 I have in the first truck that they are 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.670

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.430

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.200
 it's very easy to play it in the part 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.819
 right is the button to accelerate and in 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.459
 the left part is the button for 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.489
 slow down just like the button is for 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.590
 whistle and turn on the lights here we 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.680
 we have to go through the obstacles of 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.530
 the cars as good if we do not 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.739
 we brake we are giving more points well 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.539
 that we have to go carefully 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.570
 going through all the cars and not crashing 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.210
 with one here are four lanes two of 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.080
 come and two of coming and good the truth 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.440
 is and this game becomes a bit 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.720
 addictive and when you can play it 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.930
 is good but here such here 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.880
 I have 7,500 points and good here 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.699
 also this goes of records as it comes already 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.620
 shock and they're giving you money with all 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.479
 the things that you did and well 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.419
 You can also buy cars and 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:48.789
 improving your truck etc. this is 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:51.760
 the game of tribes ryser is free in 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.320
 the period we have it with position 96 that 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.840
 it's call of duty 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.120
 ward war zombies we can call of duty 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.520
 world at war zombies as you see this is the 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.590
 type the typical play 2 call game 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.450
 of duty the truth is a very game 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.420
 entertained as for example here I 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.280
 I was in a game she started and 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:11.620
 well this obviously every time he goes 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.780
 raising the level as it goes back 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.500
 harder so for those who do not 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:19.480
 know of call of duty when you 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.180
 try to kill zombies and when you are 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.180
 here you could say locked in this 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.880
 thing and good are not you see they are coming and 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.450
 because obviously every time you gain 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.850
 level then the zombies and they will be increasing 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.370
 and also here you can buy weapons by 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.040
 example that I can buy this weapon and 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.440
 I can also open doors here 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.200
 in my case I can open up 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.810
 it costs a thousand points but I still do not 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.120
 reaches and here also for example here 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:50.920
 another door that costs a thousand points but 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.790
 Well I still can not open it because 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.650
 I do not have enough money 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.980
 here for example is announcing the 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.830
 level 2 and well we wait for them to arrive 

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.770
 the zombies this game there are different 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:08.340
 maps and different gameplay is either 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:10.110
 is regular or records and are those of 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.400
 these different maps you can also 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.210
 play with your friends 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:17.220
 in wifi mode or in bluetooth mode this is 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.160
 the call of duty game zombies world 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.910
 at war the number 95 that is this game 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.360
 real box and that for me this game is the 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.180
 best boxing game for ios the truth 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:32.670
 It has very good graphics and it has very 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:37.020
 good gameplay because basically this 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:40.500
 it is boxing game we can 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.170

 we can play in multiplayer and we can 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:52.230
