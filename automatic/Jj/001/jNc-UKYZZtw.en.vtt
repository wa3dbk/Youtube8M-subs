00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.920 
right so the one I'm wearing right now
is<00:01:08.869> peach<00:01:09.800> kiss

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.810 

and<00:01:14.710> I<00:01:15.040> thought<00:01:15.190> this<00:01:15.310> one<00:01:15.460> was<00:01:15.490> going<00:01:15.670> to<00:01:15.730> be

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
and I thought this one was going to be

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.250 
and I thought this one was going to be
my<00:01:15.910> favorite<00:01:16.300> because<00:01:16.420> it's<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.750> nude<00:01:16.990> color

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
my favorite because it's a nude color

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.320 
my favorite because it's a nude color
but<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:18.250> actually<00:01:18.490> my<00:01:18.610> least<00:01:18.910> favorite

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
but it's actually my least favorite

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.450 
but it's actually my least favorite
because<00:01:19.570> my<00:01:19.870> lips<00:01:20.230> are<00:01:20.350> pretty<00:01:20.710> pigmented

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
because my lips are pretty pigmented

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.860 
because my lips are pretty pigmented
already<00:01:23.730> and<00:01:24.730> this<00:01:24.940> doesn't<00:01:25.120> really<00:01:25.450> show<00:01:25.720> up

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
already and this doesn't really show up

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.660 
already and this doesn't really show up
that<00:01:26.080> well<00:01:26.200> for<00:01:26.410> me<00:01:26.470> like<00:01:27.190> you<00:01:27.310> can<00:01:27.430> hardly

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
that well for me like you can hardly

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.850 
that well for me like you can hardly
tell<00:01:27.880> I'm<00:01:28.060> wearing<00:01:28.300> it<00:01:28.530> if<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.680> have<00:01:29.830> a

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
and I'll super good so I'll write these

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.559 
and I'll super good so I'll write these
things<00:02:18.739> like<00:02:18.980> an<00:02:19.099> eight<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.459> a<00:02:19.489> half<00:02:19.519> nine<00:02:20.030> out

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
things like an eight and a half nine out

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.470 
things like an eight and a half nine out
of<00:02:20.599> ten<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.760> mean<00:02:22.760> there's<00:02:22.940> not<00:02:23.060> really<00:02:23.239> any

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
of ten I mean there's not really any

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.479 
of ten I mean there's not really any
cons<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:24.349> but<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
cons to it but I just think the

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:28.330 
cons to it but I just think the
moisturizing<00:02:26.379> aspect<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.650> isn't<00:02:27.799> like<00:02:28.099> a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
moisturizing aspect of it isn't like a

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.930 
moisturizing aspect of it isn't like a
wow<00:02:29.090> factor<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.049> I<00:02:30.860> hope<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.129> review<00:02:31.459> helps

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
wow factor so I hope this review helps
