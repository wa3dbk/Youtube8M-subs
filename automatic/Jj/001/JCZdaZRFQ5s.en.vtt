angle<00:02:03.470> move<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.619> about<00:02:05.300> usually<00:02:06.300> a<00:02:06.509> ride<00:02:06.720> with

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
angle move it about usually a ride with

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:17.420 
angle move it about usually a ride with
it<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:12.170> check<00:02:13.170> it<00:02:13.200> out<00:02:13.500> see<00:02:16.430> if

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
it about there check it out see if

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.880 
it about there check it out see if
you've<00:02:17.790> got<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> typical<00:02:18.630> normal<00:02:19.200> full<00:02:19.680> face

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
you've got a typical normal full face

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.670 
you've got a typical normal full face
helmet<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.430> this<00:02:20.610> wouldn't<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:21.620> such<00:02:22.620> a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
helmet then this wouldn't be such a

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:30.410 
helmet then this wouldn't be such a
great<00:02:22.950> idea<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.910> can't<00:02:24.239> do<00:02:24.450> it<00:02:29.090> this<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.239> only

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
great idea you can't do it this is only

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.630 
great idea you can't do it this is only
a<00:02:30.540> temporary<00:02:30.780> solution<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.920> until<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.340> find

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
a temporary solution really until I find

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:40.280 
a temporary solution really until I find
myself<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:33.860> GoPro<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.700> splash<00:02:38.700> proof<00:02:39.290> to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
myself a GoPro it is a splash proof to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.430 
myself a GoPro it is a splash proof to
an<00:02:40.410> extent<00:02:40.769> because<00:02:41.070> then<00:02:42.080> you've<00:02:43.080> got<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
an extent because then you've got the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.860 
an extent because then you've got the
peak<00:02:43.920> over<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> top<00:02:44.519> of<00:02:44.549> it<00:02:44.760> here<00:02:45.000> but<00:02:45.810> it's

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
peak over the top of it here but it's

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.530 
peak over the top of it here but it's
not<00:02:46.709> waterproof<00:02:47.160> I<00:02:47.700> wouldn't<00:02:48.030> recommend

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
not waterproof I wouldn't recommend

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.620 
not waterproof I wouldn't recommend

a<00:02:51.750> small<00:02:52.080> light<00:02:52.290> shell<00:02:52.590> wouldn't<00:02:53.250> harm<00:02:53.489> it

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.700
