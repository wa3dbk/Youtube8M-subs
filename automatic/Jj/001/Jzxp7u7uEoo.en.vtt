00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.159
 you can have simply exposed without 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.119

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.890
 deactivating what I'm going to teach now 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.079
 how it is done so that you see it is very 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.909
 easy we can buy it here we do not have 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.399

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.720
 there is a bookshelf, and there the 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.640
 we can buy vale as having 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.920

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
 there are also different things but 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.429
 how are you seeing here night vision 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.929
 that what else are you asking me what 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.520
 we make the purchase once the 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.649
 we buy we will not have to go to 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.390
 inventory ok we left here from the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.130
 ammunition and once we get out of here 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.409
 what we do we give inventory 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.539
 to be able to place or activate it 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.129
 how are you looking at inventory what 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.660
 we also have accessories and a 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.960
 accessory will put us vision equipment 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.810
 night as you see 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.070
 appears activate or deactivate the square 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.450
 what are we going to do if the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.160
 we want to activate the square if the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.290
 we want to deactivate the square too 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.570
 we can have it turned off 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.220
 now we can have it activated 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.420
 the law what I'm going to do to activate it 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.490
 so you can see how we are going to burst 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 vehicles we give circles circles 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.450
 circles we closed the inventory and already the 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.700
 we have activated as you see they look very 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.070
 well, if you look at a light, everything looks 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.720
 with thermal camera is worth if you look at a 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.280
 You will already see without a thermal camera 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.830
 because the truth looks like more 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.710
 reflected by being there as a something 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.720

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.560
 weapon and it's very easy to see the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.510
