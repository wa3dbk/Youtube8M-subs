why<00:04:08.620> mine<00:04:09.010> idiot<00:04:10.110> okay<00:04:11.130> starting<00:04:12.130> over<00:04:12.280> from

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
why mine idiot okay starting over from

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.820 
why mine idiot okay starting over from
scratch<00:04:12.870> because<00:04:13.870> that's<00:04:14.410> the<00:04:14.680> most

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
scratch because that's the most

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:32.730 
scratch because that's the most
efficient<00:04:15.340> thing<00:04:15.370> to<00:04:15.519> do<00:04:15.760> I'm<00:04:15.910> sure

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.490

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
and then let's lower it down to the

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.850 
and then let's lower it down to the
ground<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:36.130> see<00:04:36.880> what<00:04:37.150> happens<00:04:37.630> with<00:04:38.050> this

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
ground and see what happens with this

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:49.140 
ground and see what happens with this
current<00:04:39.190> design<00:04:43.860> l<00:04:46.920> well<00:04:47.920> nothing<00:04:48.550> nothing

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
current design l well nothing nothing

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.120 
current design l well nothing nothing
