00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.920 
you'll see the four gifts or still there
and<00:01:13.110> I'll<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.280> reject<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.360> gift<00:01:15.659> again

and then right away I sign her out and

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.810 
and then right away I sign her out and
this<00:01:21.600> prevents<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.439> game<00:01:22.619> from<00:01:22.920> saving<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this prevents the game from saving the

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
this prevents the game from saving the
rejection<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.479> then<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.290> get<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.799> my<00:01:25.830> main

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
rejection and then I get on my main

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.340 
rejection and then I get on my main
character<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.500> accept<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.650> gift<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:30.350> you'll

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
see I'm getting more money and then I

see I'm getting more money and then I
continue<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.170> do<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> same<00:01:37.470> process<00:01:38.310> again

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
continue to do the same process again

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.710 
continue to do the same process again
and<00:01:40.220> this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.369> very<00:01:41.640> simple<00:01:41.970> as<00:01:42.240> long<00:01:42.450> as<00:01:42.570> you

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and this is very simple as long as you

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.819 
and this is very simple as long as you
get<00:01:43.670> signed<00:01:44.670> out<00:01:44.909> before<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:45.930> saves<00:01:46.290> then

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
get signed out before it saves then

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.679 
get signed out before it saves then
you'll<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.100> fine<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.579> bill<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.390> much

you'll be fine your bill to get as much

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.720 
you'll be fine your bill to get as much
money<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730

and signing out and again this is a
really<00:02:41.060> simple<00:02:41.750> process<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
really simple process and this is the

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.440 
really simple process and this is the
last<00:02:43.760> part<00:02:44.390> where<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:44.750> actually<00:02:45.230> ended<00:02:45.830> up

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
last part where I actually ended up

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.330 
last part where I actually ended up
being<00:02:47.450> done<00:02:47.750> with<00:02:47.990> doing<00:02:48.710> this<00:02:48.830> method<00:02:49.310> for

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
being done with doing this method for

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.670 
being done with doing this method for
getting<00:02:49.760> cold<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:51.050> can<00:02:51.230> do<00:02:51.320> this<00:02:51.410> all<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
getting cold you can do this all the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.710 
getting cold you can do this all the
time<00:02:51.800> if<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.370> want<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:53.740> this<00:02:54.740> was<00:02:54.950> my<00:02:55.160> last

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
time if you want to this was my last

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.590 
time if you want to this was my last
down<00:02:56.720> to<00:02:56.900> my<00:02:57.050> last<00:02:57.260> gift<00:02:57.620> so<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.640> rejected<00:02:59.390> that

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
down to my last gift so I rejected that

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.300 
down to my last gift so I rejected that
and<00:03:01.480> I<00:03:02.480> think<00:03:02.600> I'd<00:03:03.140> tried<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.709> do<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.980> again<00:03:04.280> but

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and I think I'd tried to do it again but

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.510 
and I think I'd tried to do it again but
it<00:03:04.880> didn't<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.450> actually<00:03:06.170> no<00:03:06.800> actually<00:03:06.830> this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
it didn't it actually no actually this

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.240 
it didn't it actually no actually this
time<00:03:07.580> I<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:07.940> did<00:03:08.330> allowed<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.290> just<00:03:09.470> say<00:03:09.709> I<00:03:09.950> was
