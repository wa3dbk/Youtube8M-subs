00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
latest job for vapor blasting I also

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.239 
latest job for vapor blasting I also
have<00:00:37.499> the<00:00:37.649> cylinders<00:00:38.690> but<00:00:39.859> I'm<00:00:40.859> not<00:00:41.039> showing

work<00:00:45.179> I<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.479> to<00:00:45.569> work<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.109> figured<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
work I got to work on I figured this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.950 
work I got to work on I figured this
would<00:00:46.859> be<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> good<00:00:47.159> example<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:48.269> show<00:00:48.299> you<00:00:48.539> what

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
would be a good example to show you what

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.289 
would be a good example to show you what
vapor<00:00:49.170> blasting<00:00:49.769> can<00:00:49.949> do<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.969> can<00:00:50.999> see

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:51.299 
vapor blasting can do as you can see

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:58.250 
vapor blasting can do as you can see
this<00:00:52.760> this<00:00:53.760> part<00:00:54.059> here<00:00:54.299> is<00:00:54.469> pretty<00:00:56.989> pretty<00:00:57.989> bad

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
this this part here is pretty pretty bad

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
this this part here is pretty pretty bad
the<00:00:58.679> corrosion<00:00:59.010> but<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.519> pitted<00:00:59.909> or

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the corrosion but it's not pitted or

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.029 
the corrosion but it's not pitted or
anything<00:01:00.209> as<00:01:00.870> far<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.319> can<00:01:01.379> tell<00:01:01.679> there's<00:01:01.949> no

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
anything as far as I can tell there's no

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.850 
anything as far as I can tell there's no
deep<00:01:02.309> pits<00:01:03.260> well<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.320> looks<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.589> it's

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
deep pits well it looks like it's

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.960 
deep pits well it looks like it's
someone<00:01:05.129> cleaning<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.610> then<00:01:05.729> put

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
someone cleaning it and then put

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.420 
someone cleaning it and then put
aluminum<00:01:06.960> brightener<00:01:07.530> on<00:01:07.740> here

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.110 

aluminum<00:01:11.430> brightener<00:01:11.930> works<00:01:13.820> some<00:01:14.820> things

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
aluminum brightener works some things

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.760 
aluminum brightener works some things
but<00:01:15.450> on<00:01:15.540> these<00:01:15.690> Japanese<00:01:16.020> castings<00:01:16.910> they<00:01:18.770> tend

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
but on these Japanese castings they tend

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.350 
but on these Japanese castings they tend
to<00:01:19.860> turn<00:01:19.980> black<00:01:20.310> if<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> leave<00:01:20.850> them<00:01:20.940> on<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.330> a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
to turn black if you leave them on for a

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.500 
to turn black if you leave them on for a
while<00:01:21.620> so<00:01:22.620> unfortunately<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:24.330> that's

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
while so unfortunately I think that's

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.910 
while so unfortunately I think that's
what<00:01:24.690> happened<00:01:25.080> here<00:01:25.260> but<00:01:25.440> this<00:01:25.590> will<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.800> a

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
what happened here but this will be a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.140 
what happened here but this will be a
bum<00:01:26.640> down<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.090> would<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.300> a<00:01:27.330> big<00:01:27.600> contrast

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
bum down here would be a big contrast

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.520 
bum down here would be a big contrast
when<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.690> how<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:31.020> turns<00:01:31.260> out<00:01:32.390> okay<00:01:33.530> I'm

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
when you see how it turns out okay I'm

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.300 
when you see how it turns out okay I'm
going<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.010> start<00:01:35.220> working<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.150> then

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
going to start working on these and then

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.550 
going to start working on these and then
then<00:01:38.310> do<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.060> short<00:01:39.510> video<00:01:39.660> on<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.080> potty<00:01:40.320> turn

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
then do a short video on the potty turn

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.330 
then do a short video on the potty turn
up<00:01:41.720> well<00:01:42.720> just<00:01:43.470> out<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.860> vapor<00:01:44.040> blaster

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
up well just out of the vapor blaster

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.540 
up well just out of the vapor blaster
are<00:01:44.910> these<00:01:45.360> cases<00:01:46.070> that<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.130> showed<00:01:47.370> you
