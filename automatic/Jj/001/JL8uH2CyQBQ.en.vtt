hi<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.829> Kayla<00:00:02.159> me<00:00:02.399> and<00:00:03.000> I<00:00:03.090> would<00:00:03.210> like<00:00:03.360> to

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hi I'm Kayla me and I would like to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.849 
hi I'm Kayla me and I would like to
teach<00:00:03.689> you<00:00:03.870> about<00:00:03.990> functional<00:00:04.620> groups

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
teach you about functional groups

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.039 
teach you about functional groups
because<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.240> reason<00:00:06.420> why<00:00:06.690> I<00:00:06.720> made<00:00:07.020> it

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
because that is the reason why I made it

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.839 
because that is the reason why I made it
through<00:00:07.290> miss<00:00:07.529> Adrian's<00:00:08.040> biological

the tricks that I use to learn them and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.090 
the tricks that I use to learn them and
use<00:00:33.480> them<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.719> Miss<00:00:34.380> Adrian's<00:00:34.860> class<00:00:37.850> first<00:00:38.960> is

it<00:01:37.170> looks<00:01:38.170> familiar<00:01:38.380> doesn't<00:01:38.830> it<00:01:39.780> that's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
it looks familiar doesn't it that's

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:49.050 
it looks familiar doesn't it that's
because<00:01:41.229> an<00:01:41.409> amide<00:01:46.619> looks<00:01:47.619> just<00:01:48.130> like<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.940> I

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
because an amide looks just like and I

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.830 
because an amide looks just like and I
mean<00:01:49.299> just<00:01:50.049> with<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> carbonyl<00:01:50.740> group<00:01:50.799> attached

the<00:01:55.840> only<00:01:56.049> difference<00:01:56.380> between<00:01:56.500> you<00:01:56.770> two<00:01:56.950> is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
the only difference between you two is

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:03.710 
the only difference between you two is
the<00:01:57.280> carbonyl<00:01:57.759> group<00:02:00.569> the<00:02:01.569> next<00:02:01.869> one<00:02:02.049> is

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
the carbonyl group the next one is

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.259 
the carbonyl group the next one is
aldehyde<00:02:04.720> in<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.020> ketone<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.130> one<00:02:09.399> they

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
aldehyde in and ketone now this one they

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.240 
aldehyde in and ketone now this one they
both<00:02:10.539> have<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:12.150> carbonyl<00:02:13.150> group<00:02:14.099> but<00:02:15.099> the

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
both have a carbonyl group but the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.020 
both have a carbonyl group but the
difference<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:17.040> aldehyde<00:02:18.040> has<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.310> hydrogen

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
difference is aldehyde has a hydrogen

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.000 
difference is aldehyde has a hydrogen
and<00:02:19.959> a<00:02:20.799> ketone<00:02:21.810> is<00:02:22.810> simply<00:02:23.320> in<00:02:23.440> between<00:02:23.769> two

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
and a ketone is simply in between two

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:33.410 
and a ketone is simply in between two
carbon

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.360 

I<00:02:34.760> was<00:02:35.760> remembered<00:02:36.270> and<00:02:36.450> aldehyde<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.709> the<00:02:38.250> H

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I was remembered and aldehyde that the H

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:46.640 
I was remembered and aldehyde that the H
likes<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.850> hide<00:02:43.850> next<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:46.170> next<00:02:46.319> one<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
likes to hide next the next one is

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.470 
likes to hide next the next one is
confusing<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.420> name<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.430> ether

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.360 

sounds<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.600> an<00:02:54.720> ester<00:02:55.110> but<00:02:56.010> they're<00:02:56.160> two

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
sounds like an ester but they're two

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.180 
sounds like an ester but they're two
different<00:02:56.550> things

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
different things

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.979 
different things
ether<00:02:59.190> is<00:02:59.370> an<00:02:59.880> oxygen<00:03:00.360> in<00:03:00.510> between<00:03:00.810> two
