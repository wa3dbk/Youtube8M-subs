you'll see in just a moment though

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.760

because<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> middle<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
because this was the middle of the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
because this was the middle of the
half-term<00:01:23.400> holidays<00:01:24.000> there<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:24.869> awful

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
half-term holidays there was an awful

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.469 
half-term holidays there was an awful
lot<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.530> people<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:26.130> over<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.640> place<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.150> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
lot of people all over the place and you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.300 
lot of people all over the place and you
can<00:01:27.780> imagine<00:01:27.990> that<00:01:28.320> places<00:01:28.799> such<00:01:29.009> as<00:01:29.189> the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
can imagine that places such as the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.850 
can imagine that places such as the
aqueduct<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.570> tunnels<00:01:31.020> draw<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> huge

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
aqueduct and the tunnels draw a huge

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
aqueduct and the tunnels draw a huge
amount<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.280> people<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> area<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.810> I

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
amount of people to the area so I

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
amount of people to the area so I
thought<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.350> would<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.530> throw<00:01:35.340> in<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.610> clip

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
thought I would just throw in a clip

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
thought I would just throw in a clip
here<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.390> can<00:01:36.600> see<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.810> proper<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.439> at

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
here so you can see a proper look at

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.920 
here so you can see a proper look at
what<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> aqueduct<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> viaduct<00:01:39.659> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
what the aqueduct and the viaduct the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
what the aqueduct and the viaduct the
higher<00:01:40.140> one<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.680> there<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.130> really<00:01:41.520> like

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
higher one just there is really like
