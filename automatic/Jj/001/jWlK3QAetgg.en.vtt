as you can see no valve so
put<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> valve<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.260> it<00:02:59.410> before<00:02:59.880> do<00:03:00.880> anything<00:03:01.480> so

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
put a valve in it before do anything so

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.950 
put a valve in it before do anything so
that's<00:03:01.990> another<00:03:02.230> idea<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:03.700> my<00:03:04.090> Harbor
