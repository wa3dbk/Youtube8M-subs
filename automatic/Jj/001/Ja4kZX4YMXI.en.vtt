00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
use your body weight to really stretch

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.600 
use your body weight to really stretch
it<00:00:44.850> out<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.120> helps<00:00:45.570> distract<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.340> the<00:00:47.340> femur

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610

it out it helps distract the the femur
bone<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:48.059> they're<00:00:48.300> really<00:00:48.539> good<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
bone back they're really good and you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.959

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
can get a good stretch and just improve

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.459 
can get a good stretch and just improve
that<00:00:51.210> position<00:00:51.690> another<00:00:51.960> thing<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.289> works

powerlifting and what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.499 
powerlifting and what I'm doing is I'm
just<00:01:41.100> trying<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> improve<00:01:41.759> my<00:01:41.970> hip<00:01:42.210> mobility

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
just trying to improve my hip mobility

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
just trying to improve my hip mobility
you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.110> those<00:01:43.259> adductors<00:01:43.860> rotate<00:01:44.430> they

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
you know those adductors rotate they

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.639 
you know those adductors rotate they
actually<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.899> really<00:01:46.170> some<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> them

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
actually they don't really some of them

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.399 
actually they don't really some of them
they<00:01:46.770> some<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.640> adductor<00:01:48.149> Magnus<00:01:48.659> rotates<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
they some the adductor Magnus rotates to

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.950 
they some the adductor Magnus rotates to
the<00:01:49.439> femur<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> little<00:01:50.490> bit<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.750> what

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
the femur a little bit but really what

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.899 
the femur a little bit but really what
they<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.799> help<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.220> actually<00:01:53.700> cause

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
they do is they help them actually cause

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.520 
they do is they help them actually cause
restriction<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.840> glutes<00:01:55.140> from

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
restriction and the glutes from

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
restriction and the glutes from
externally<00:01:56.219> rotating<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.670> hip<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:56.969> time<00:01:57.149> so

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
externally rotating the hip at time so

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.880 
externally rotating the hip at time so
you<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.719> stretch<00:01:58.350> them<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.619> so<00:01:58.799> that

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
you have to stretch them out so that

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.950 
you have to stretch them out so that
your<00:01:59.040> glutes<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.430> fire<00:01:59.759> properly<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.869> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
your glutes can fire properly and you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.359 
your glutes can fire properly and you
can<00:02:01.079> see<00:02:01.259> how<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.409> use<00:02:01.619> these<00:02:01.770> little<00:02:01.829> mats<00:02:02.219> here

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
can see how I use these little mats here

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.340 
can see how I use these little mats here
to<00:02:02.490> slide<00:02:02.759> my<00:02:02.880> knees<00:02:03.060> apart<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.930> just<00:02:04.170> sit

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
to slide my knees apart and I just sit

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.840 
to slide my knees apart and I just sit
and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.560> camp<00:02:04.799> out<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> stretch<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.670> out

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
and I camp out and I just stretch it out

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.340 
and I camp out and I just stretch it out
and<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.119> really<00:02:06.509> does<00:02:06.780> make<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.049> big<00:02:07.170> difference

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
and it really does make a big difference

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
and it really does make a big difference
this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.829> probably<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> most<00:02:08.520> effective

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
this is probably one the most effective

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.880 
this is probably one the most effective
stretches<00:02:09.270> I<00:02:09.390> do<00:02:09.450> that<00:02:10.110> really<00:02:10.349> help<00:02:10.560> improve

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
stretches I do that really help improve

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.010 
stretches I do that really help improve
my<00:02:11.039> glute<00:02:11.250> function<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.360> really<00:02:12.599> recommend

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
my glute function and I really recommend

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.640 
my glute function and I really recommend
that<00:02:13.080> you

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
