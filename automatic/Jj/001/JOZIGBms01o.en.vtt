00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.760
 our final conclusion 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.200
 nikon has one with the d5000 300 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 revised version of d5000 200 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.680
 brought the market in comparison to 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 predecessor model made 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.830
 improvements are not all too good 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.539
 strong weight on this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.250
 special features has been waiting 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.399
 but still happy about it 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
 this applies, for example, to the video mode with bis 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.610
 to 60 full frames per second in 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.250
 full hd resolution includes in the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.739
 the 5300 too many camera models of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 Panasonic and Sony on the update of the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.760
 Video mode can therefore be on this point 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.140
 be described as successful as well 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.089
 we like the very good picture quality 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.010
 the video footage and that I both 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.140
 connect a microphone as well as level 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.969
 leaves incomprehensible remains 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.440
 the fact that the blind during the 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.829
 Video recording does not change 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.629
 can 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.519
 This is a real disadvantage for everyone 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.940
 report manually in video mode 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:02.010
 want 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.690
 could also better the autofocus 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.640
 work in the live for or in the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.229
 Video mode often goes by too much time 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
 focus much faster 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.940
 Focused live autofocus with only 0 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.630
 27 seconds 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.610
 serial images stores the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.900
 SLR camera with 45 images per 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.850
 second in every picture format 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.409
 the buffer is with a maximum of six 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 pictures in sequence but too small 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.119
 The picture quality of the d5000 300 falls 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.310
 by the dx image sensor very good with 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.420
 she can also fine her 24 megapixels 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.460
 resolve details 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.680
 the image noise is only at sensor 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.509
 sensitivities of iso 12.800 and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.159
 about a bigger problem 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.450
 an advantage by omitting the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.149
 However, we see low-pass filters 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.740
 can this be increased to 32 inches 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.659
 display is its dimensions very much 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.369
 good for image control also suitable 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.899
 with 10 4 million to the pixel high 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.729
 resolution provides for joy 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.530
 because you turn the lcd free and pan 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.420
 can it be, for example, for 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.920
 shooting with outstretched arm or 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.680
 to use for self portraits 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.119
 the camera body of the d5000 300 tegut in 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.250
 the hand the operation should also 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.450
 beginners not difficult successful 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 supplements in comparison to 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.530
 predecessor the 5200 are the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.009
 added has come wireless module and gps 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.070
 receiver 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.630
 the latter needed or with 50 or 60 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.270
 full frames per second would like to film 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.130
 gets a solid with the d5000 300 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.130
 update from the 5200 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.300
 the d camera the test judgments to the camera
