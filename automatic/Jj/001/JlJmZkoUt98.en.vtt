well<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.500> makes<00:01:04.710> sense<00:01:04.830> after<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.460> PlayBook

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850

was<00:01:06.030> pretty<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.479> pure<00:01:07.020> dud<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.500> then

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
was pretty much a pure dud but then

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.520 
was pretty much a pure dud but then
we've<00:01:08.250> got<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.390> tent<00:01:09.750> which<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> actually

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
we've got a you tent which is actually

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.140 
we've got a you tent which is actually
bigger<00:01:10.860> than<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> z10<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:11.939> we've<00:01:12.119> got

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
bigger than the z10 and then we've got

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.899 
bigger than the z10 and then we've got
in<00:01:12.479> our<00:01:12.630> tent<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> bigger<00:01:13.979> than<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> q10

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
in our tent which is bigger than the q10

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.060 
in our tent which is bigger than the q10
confused<00:01:15.630> already<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.710> well<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
confused already and then well the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.320 
confused already and then well the
interesting<00:01:17.280> part<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.729> apparently<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
interesting part is apparently that

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
interesting part is apparently that
aside<00:01:18.600> from<00:01:18.720> these<00:01:18.900> devices<00:01:19.229> being<00:01:19.530> bigger

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
aside from these devices being bigger

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.920 
aside from these devices being bigger
than<00:01:20.070> their<00:01:20.340> predecessors<00:01:20.520> their<00:01:21.420> displays

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
than their predecessors their displays

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.740 
than their predecessors their displays
look<00:01:22.200> curved<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:23.009> again<00:01:23.490> this<00:01:23.700> roadmap<00:01:24.150> does

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
look curved so again this roadmap does

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.210 
look curved so again this roadmap does
seem<00:01:24.960> interesting<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.619> stay<00:01:25.799> tuned<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
seem interesting to stay tuned for the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
seem interesting to stay tuned for the
rumors<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.600> let's<00:01:27.810> talk<00:01:28.049> about<00:01:28.170> Windows

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
rumors and then let's talk about Windows

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.429 
rumors and then let's talk about Windows

this<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> much<00:01:43.560> smarter<00:01:43.829> strategy<00:01:44.310> than

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this is a much smarter strategy than

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
this is a much smarter strategy than
trying<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.570> give<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:45.990> option<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.799> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
can run the legacy applications on or

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.380 
can run the legacy applications on or
that<00:01:53.070> even<00:01:53.310> new<00:01:53.490> developers<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.210> want<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
that even new developers don't want to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.569 
that even new developers don't want to
build<00:01:54.570> applications<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:55.439> again<00:01:56.070> strategies

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.149 
which does not have expandable storage
you're<00:02:57.109> pretty<00:02:57.319> much<00:02:57.379> gonna<00:02:57.620> have<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.920> switch

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
you're pretty much gonna have to switch

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.399 
you're pretty much gonna have to switch
carriers<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:59.120> obviously<00:02:59.810> this<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.109> most

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
carriers and obviously this is most

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.649 
carriers and obviously this is most
likely<00:03:00.680> for<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.159> United<00:03:01.519> States<00:03:01.760> as<00:03:02.060> HTC

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659 
likely for the United States as HTC

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.539 
likely for the United States as HTC

hopefully the unlock variant will not
have<00:03:07.280> this<00:03:07.430> issue<00:03:07.609> but<00:03:08.000> that<00:03:08.389> leads<00:03:08.510> me<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:08.750> the

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
would you ever switch carriers just to

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.550 
would you ever switch carriers just to
get<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.819> specific<00:03:14.299> phone<00:03:14.569> in<00:03:14.900> my<00:03:15.379> particular

get a specific phone in my particular

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.920 
get a specific phone in my particular
case<00:03:15.889> I<00:03:16.190> will<00:03:16.250> admit<00:03:16.819> that<00:03:16.849> I<00:03:17.030> did<00:03:17.060> do<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.569> once

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
case I will admit that I did do it once

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.599 
case I will admit that I did do it once
but<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.290> did<00:03:18.530> it<00:03:18.620> because<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:19.069> other<00:03:19.190> carrier

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
but I did it because the other carrier

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.189 
but I did it because the other carrier
was<00:03:19.760> actually<00:03:20.180> better<00:03:20.389> in<00:03:20.569> signal<00:03:20.930> strength
