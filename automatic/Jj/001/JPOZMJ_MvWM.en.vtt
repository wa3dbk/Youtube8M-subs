00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello and welcome to the topic 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:08.580
 I want replication in this movie 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.700
 you people and what a great is that is 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.750
 actually the dna explains very quickly 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.410
 Polymerase needed needed a city 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.539
 the region where she can camp 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.720
 and only you have a free battery 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.529
 The sinupret can attach to it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:35.610
 the cell uses a trick it stores 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:37.590
 possibly a status in this area 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.510
 sequence on to the prime or more 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 a good idea then from the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:50.870
 polymerase be recognized so the enzyme 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.600
 that she works is the prices she 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.800
 stores as I said complementary again 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.800
 to the pranger 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 so now this region is ready 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.880
 from the DNA polymerase detected here 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.330
 you a free group where you are the next 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.380
 song equipment can see this way and now 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.290
 Let's start with our DNA polymerase and off 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.290
 Here begins the synthesis of the new 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:29.970
 single strands of five stroke in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:34.360
 direction 3 stroke so finished 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:38.800
 so that his water can already today 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.550
 you make artificially and with it 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.880
 certain regions in the dna 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.580
 detect 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.619
 This is used, for example, for genes 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.910
 isolate 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.540
 that would be interesting then 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.780
 again with the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.830
 polymerase-chain-reaction busy 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.080
 that's it 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.180
 I hope you understood everything and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.470
 who would like to read this again 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.399
 can do that on www.bio clips de that 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.170
 grasp my side 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.170
 see you soon bye
