couple<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.280> spectacular<00:01:49.910> season<00:01:50.540> there<00:01:50.720> on

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410

the<00:01:51.590> Apollo<00:01:51.860> play<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:53.570> general<00:01:53.960> you

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
the Apollo play in general you

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.170 
the Apollo play in general you
goaltenders<00:01:54.830> always<00:01:55.070> your<00:01:55.190> best<00:01:55.310> penalty
