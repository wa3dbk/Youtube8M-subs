00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
two blocks behind so you have room I'm

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.950 
two blocks behind so you have room I'm
gonna<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.549> blocks<00:01:35.880> behind<00:01:36.180> there<00:01:36.689> like

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
gonna put two blocks behind there like

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.030 
gonna put two blocks behind there like
so<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.840> then<00:01:39.840> you're<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.799> pull<00:01:40.950> out

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
so and then you're going to pull out

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
so and then you're going to pull out
your<00:01:41.250> redstone<00:01:41.640> repeaters<00:01:42.210> here<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.960> you're

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
your redstone repeaters here and you're

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.330 
your redstone repeaters here and you're
going<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.229> make<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> faced<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:43.829> towards<00:01:44.250> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
going to make it faced in towards the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.200 
going to make it faced in towards the
lava<00:01:44.610> pit<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.470> will<00:01:46.470> go<00:01:46.590> whoops<00:01:47.189> I'm<00:01:48.030> on

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
lava pit like that will go whoops I'm on

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.590 
lava pit like that will go whoops I'm on
creative<00:01:48.630> mode<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.470> just<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.619> that

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
creative mode here and just like that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.609 
creative mode here and just like that
now<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:54.750> going<00:01:54.869> to<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> same<00:01:55.320> thing

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
now you're going to do the same thing

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.139 
now you're going to do the same thing
right<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.490> doesn't<00:01:56.790> really<00:01:56.880> work<00:01:57.000> like

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
right here that doesn't really work like

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.780 
right here that doesn't really work like
that<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.680> make<00:01:58.890> them<00:01:59.040> face<00:01:59.280> towards<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
that so just make them face towards the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.090 
that so just make them face towards the
Pistons<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.570> these<00:02:00.780> do<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.619> power<00:02:01.860> both

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
Pistons what these do is they power both

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.550 
Pistons what these do is they power both
of<00:02:02.280> these<00:02:02.399> pistons<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.210> pull<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> center

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
of these pistons to pull back the center

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.419 
of these pistons to pull back the center
Pistons<00:02:05.070> which<00:02:05.460> you'll<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:05.759> in<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:06.060> sec<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.310> do

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
Pistons which you'll see in a sec so do

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.979 
Pistons which you'll see in a sec so do
like<00:02:08.580> I'm<00:02:08.729> doing<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.450> going<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.629> set<00:02:09.810> this

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
like I'm doing you're going to set this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.950 
like I'm doing you're going to set this
one<00:02:10.229> on<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.770> second<00:02:11.160> tick<00:02:11.340> one<00:02:11.790> two<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.300> this

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
one on the second tick one two and this

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.250 
one on the second tick one two and this
on<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.230> fourth<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:14.720> then<00:02:15.720> both<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.170> these

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
on the fourth and then both of these

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.130 
on the fourth and then both of these
ones<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.740> second<00:02:17.130> tick<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.760> so<00:02:18.140> then

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
ones on the second tick like so then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
ones on the second tick like so then
you're<00:02:19.410> just<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.740> going<00:02:20.100> to<00:02:20.130> whoops

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
you're just going to going to whoops

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.530 
you're just going to going to whoops
connect<00:02:21.510> them<00:02:21.660> real<00:02:21.810> quick<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.640> just

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
connect them real quick like this just

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.020 
connect them real quick like this just
follow<00:02:24.750> what<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.080> doing<00:02:25.610> it's<00:02:26.610> better<00:02:26.760> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
follow what I'm doing it's better to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.300 
follow what I'm doing it's better to
make<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.390> closed<00:02:27.690> in<00:02:27.900> as<00:02:28.080> much<00:02:28.260> as<00:02:28.440> possible<00:02:28.620> so

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
make it closed in as much as possible so

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.720 
make it closed in as much as possible so
that<00:02:29.780> you<00:02:30.780> know<00:02:31.160> you're<00:02:32.160> taking<00:02:32.460> up<00:02:32.520> less<00:02:32.550> room

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
that you know you're taking up less room

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.320 
that you know you're taking up less room
you<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.630> cover<00:02:33.810> less<00:02:35.060> make<00:02:36.060> sure<00:02:36.090> it's

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
you have to cover less make sure it's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.870 
you have to cover less make sure it's
all<00:02:36.390> connected<00:02:36.720> um<00:02:37.460> once<00:02:38.460> it's<00:02:38.610> connected

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
all connected um once it's connected

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.960 
all connected um once it's connected
like<00:02:39.210> that<00:02:39.800> you're<00:02:40.800> going<00:02:41.100> to<00:02:41.310> place<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
like that you're going to place a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.150 
like that you're going to place a
redstone<00:02:42.690> repeater<00:02:43.230> somewhere<00:02:43.740> along<00:02:43.950> the

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
redstone repeater somewhere along the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.650 
redstone repeater somewhere along the
way<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.550> like<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.820> because<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.270> circuit

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
way just like that because the circuit

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.150 
way just like that because the circuit
does<00:02:45.810> not<00:02:45.960> reach<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> way<00:02:46.530> around<00:02:46.740> and

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
does not reach all the way around and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840 
does not reach all the way around and
then<00:02:47.270> once<00:02:48.270> you've<00:02:48.390> done<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:49.280> line<00:02:50.280> up<00:02:50.520> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
then once you've done that line up the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.720 
then once you've done that line up the
wall<00:02:51.060> so<00:02:51.390> wherever<00:02:51.720> this<00:02:52.050> is<00:02:52.320> right<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.490> well

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
wall so wherever this is right here well

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.430 
wall so wherever this is right here well
you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.940> line<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.180> up<00:02:54.300> anyway<00:02:54.690> anywhere<00:02:55.230> but

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
you can line this up anyway anywhere but

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.810 
you can line this up anyway anywhere but
you're<00:02:55.860> just<00:02:56.010> going<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.190> dig<00:02:56.340> up<00:02:56.490> into<00:02:56.700> your

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
you're just going to dig up into your

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.120 
you're just going to dig up into your
house<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.240> if<00:02:57.300> I<00:02:57.420> big<00:02:57.630> right<00:02:57.780> here<00:02:58.140> I'm<00:02:58.290> dug<00:02:58.950> up

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
house so if I big right here I'm dug up

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.400 
house so if I big right here I'm dug up
into<00:02:59.370> my<00:02:59.520> house<00:02:59.730> and<00:03:00.620> all<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.860> have<00:03:02.010> to<00:03:02.160> do<00:03:02.310> is

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
into my house and all you have to do is

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.860 
into my house and all you have to do is
just<00:03:04.410> extend<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:04.980> slips<00:03:05.330> extend<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> circuit

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
just extend the slips extend the circuit

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.010 
just extend the slips extend the circuit
up<00:03:07.130> like<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:08.720> then<00:03:09.720> you're<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:09.930> to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
up like that and then you're going to

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.670 
up like that and then you're going to
pull<00:03:10.170> out<00:03:10.260> your<00:03:10.440> redstone<00:03:10.770> torch<00:03:11.220> right<00:03:12.180> here

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
pull out your redstone torch right here

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.940 
pull out your redstone torch right here
it's<00:03:13.680> going<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.860> turn<00:03:14.070> on<00:03:14.340> all<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:15.560> Pistons<00:03:16.560> so

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
it's going to turn on all the Pistons so

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.770 
it's going to turn on all the Pistons so
what<00:03:17.430> happens<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.030> it<00:03:18.240> turns<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.510> all<00:03:18.660> these

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
what happens is it turns on all these

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.920 
what happens is it turns on all these
Pistons<00:03:19.320> like<00:03:19.950> this<00:03:20.300> which<00:03:21.300> pushes<00:03:21.570> these

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
Pistons like this which pushes these

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.780 
Pistons like this which pushes these
sticky<00:03:22.350> pistons<00:03:22.710> in<00:03:22.740> which<00:03:23.280> turned<00:03:23.640> on

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
sticky pistons in which turned on

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.580 
sticky pistons in which turned on
because<00:03:24.060> they're<00:03:24.360> hitting<00:03:24.660> these<00:03:24.810> repeaters

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
because they're hitting these repeaters

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.830 
because they're hitting these repeaters
and<00:03:25.860> grab<00:03:26.430> on<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:26.940> dirt<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.360> then<00:03:27.600> once<00:03:27.750> I

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and grab on to that dirt and then once I

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
and grab on to that dirt and then once I
turn<00:03:28.380> them<00:03:28.500> off<00:03:28.650> it'll<00:03:29.220> pull<00:03:29.400> down<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.730> dirt

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
turn them off it'll pull down the dirt

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.330 
turn them off it'll pull down the dirt
these<00:03:30.270> four<00:03:30.690> pistons<00:03:31.020> will<00:03:31.140> pull<00:03:31.410> all<00:03:31.710> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
these four pistons will pull all the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.310 
these four pistons will pull all the
dirt<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.790> Pistons<00:03:33.450> back<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.020> it'll<00:03:34.140> open

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
dirt and the Pistons back and it'll open

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.740 
dirt and the Pistons back and it'll open
up<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.710> pit<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:35.100> lava<00:03:35.420> so<00:03:36.420> once<00:03:36.630> you've

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
up the pit to the lava so once you've

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.390 
up the pit to the lava so once you've
done<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.290> place<00:03:37.500> your<00:03:37.620> redstone<00:03:37.920> thing

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
done that you place your redstone thing

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.380 
done that you place your redstone thing
there<00:03:38.610> you<00:03:38.910> can<00:03:39.060> just<00:03:39.210> cover<00:03:39.450> up<00:03:39.570> the<00:03:39.840> hole

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
there you can just cover up the hole

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.640 
there you can just cover up the hole
usually<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.480> want<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.750> hidden<00:03:43.140> obviously

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
usually you want this hidden obviously

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.600 
usually you want this hidden obviously
right<00:03:43.800> you<00:03:43.860> don't<00:03:43.950> want<00:03:44.130> people<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.520> know

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
right you don't want people to know

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.450 
right you don't want people to know
about<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.970> so<00:03:45.150> usually<00:03:46.020> when<00:03:46.980> I'm<00:03:47.130> playing<00:03:47.220> in

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
about it so usually when I'm playing in

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.100 
about it so usually when I'm playing in
single-player<00:03:47.940> do<00:03:48.360> let's<00:03:48.570> just<00:03:48.780> say<00:03:48.900> if<00:03:48.990> I

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
single-player do let's just say if I

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.620 
single-player do let's just say if I
have<00:03:49.320> a<00:03:50.030> let's<00:03:51.030> just<00:03:51.210> say<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.480> have<00:03:51.600> a

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
have a let's just say if I have a

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.930 
have a let's just say if I have a
furnace<00:03:52.110> here<00:03:52.410> I'll<00:03:52.740> place<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.460> furnace<00:03:53.790> like

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
furnace here I'll place the furnace like

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.390 
furnace here I'll place the furnace like
that<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.480> can't<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:56.510> whoops<00:03:58.400> pardon

that's<00:05:22.140> basically<00:05:22.470> how<00:05:22.560> you<00:05:22.740> make<00:05:22.950> your<00:05:22.979> trap

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
that's basically how you make your trap

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.550

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
you can leave the switch anywhere

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.700 
you can leave the switch anywhere

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
obviously and make sure it's hidden and

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.560
