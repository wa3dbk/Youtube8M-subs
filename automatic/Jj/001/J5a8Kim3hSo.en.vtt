 Yes, it's a guard channel- this time bmw's 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.660
 this 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:14.950
 It is a position lamp called characteristic Angel Eye 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.410
 This is my 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:23.500
 I already replaced it with LED 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:28.310
 The replaced LED is double old specification only one side 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:33.470
 I'm not feeling well, this outside 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.040
 Squid ring is in the state not to light now 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.250
 So if you do me 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:44.680
 I bought cheap things and I think that I would like to exchange from now on 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.870
 Still need a jack for work 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.300
 And Electric Impact League 2 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 Use these 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.060
 I would like to remove the tires first 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.710
 Well san's car with a military impact officer of electric impact wrench 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.560
 If you remove the tire first 9 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.610
 In this Restraints 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 Objective 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.320
 I will not mix this because the option led is included 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.670
 The button is 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:23.890
 It is everywhere remove the strange Nde there is also towards the rest and under 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.760
 Icat this vendor is this 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.990
 I'm removing this place 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.009
 This is it 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.340
 I will remove this from now where the position valve is in 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.969
 It was so hard that parts didn't come off 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.390
 Beneath can be tired I was, but take the air at 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:47.100
 Here is 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.070
 I saw a chip led from it 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.750
 It becomes a position lamp 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.260
 When I turned on the light , I still had one ball out, so I would like to exchange this 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.220
 I'm sorry 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:02.210
 It was attached with this and set 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.270
 Newly wear products are in this way become an integral 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:10.490
 led itself 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:12.760
 Since larger than the previous one there I think quite bright even here 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.760
 Relieved
