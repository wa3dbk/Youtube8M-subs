00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.570
 with point 24 Mr. Bachman in 67 a 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.160
 61 6 the difference and 70 seconds in what 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.940
 that is left to finish it squared 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.770
 taylor behind two fingers nothing more than 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.330
 two interesting that Brazil would have 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.130
 got that fast double because it's going 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.260
 to stay a minute okay just spend 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 point the difference of being able to defend 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
 this position will be around 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
 of 50 seconds to put on only 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.170
 for one and that in the end you can give 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.280
 some kind of credit handles the ball 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.500
 Carlos Rice 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.590
 return stream faces benitez or 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.180
 you came the custodians face it not what 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.850
 let's act with freedom always 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.920
 benítez will be over now tide there 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.530
 a curtain that is for it to happen let's see 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.170
 if it does it is suspended 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.730
 there's a bounce that I'll notice loneliness to that 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.039
 Puerto Rican ball now for 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.949
 create a sports player sanchez 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:01.460
 remained benítez against Sanchez and 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:03.350
 the size difference is very much yes 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.670
 but it is by design I do not know well to leave him 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.659
 nobody else has ordered batman if not 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.979
 is in 30 seconds 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.439
 4 the difference and the loss of ball 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:21.039
 the benefit benítez you have left 20 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:23.259
 seconds to the match but the rebound 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:24.640
 defensive and I think that's all in the 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.590
 party I think I had walked 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.920
 even benitez when he tried to 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:33.100
 define topic I do not want and that's why it fails 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.979
 it was not fluid probe exactly though 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.409
 there you see in the two logical steps that 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.659
 allow you to reach the basket for 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.189
 insert a tray before I think a 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.520
 illegal movement that was not always 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.430
 will place also I think I expected 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.720
 the physical contact benitez did not receive it 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.119
 and that's why a sixth theory fails 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.320
 seemingly easy we are, I do not want 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:02.860
 16 seconds and to sentence stream one 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.840
 advantage of 4 that are 5 with the conversion 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.670
 of this free shot for stream that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.410
 it could be enough in the game 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.940
 complicated for brazil go back to 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.470
 find already going to be two positions 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.030
 long in case of becoming the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.110
 streams would have to look for a triple 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.480
 fast and have a lack by then 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.100
 try to stay in play but the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 clock is jon the maximum in the center 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.350
 ching back from number 9 this is already 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.380
 for finishing the courts 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.070
 13 12 seconds will launch from 3 marcelino 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:36.010
 has the cane class up the legs 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:38.439
 almost give him the knee 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.470
 defensively speaking very complete already 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:43.160
 the offensive knows how to reinvent itself can read 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.670
 the game 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.650
 although it has no outside shot 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.450
 because in painting he does his business 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.090
 sanchez in chapel two with four 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.819
 personal returns is eight seconds 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.520
 of party and charges to Brazil 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.750
 marcelinho orchards very, very annoying 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.640
 with rafael first he says that with his 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.840
 size and who was marking it had 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.319
 to grab the ball immediately 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.959
 inhale or not chop when trying to carry 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.370
 the ball to the floor received the foul below 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.200
 and gave him no chance that the 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.690
 additional there goes the second for this 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.200
 time and convinced the first convert 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.760
 the two consequently 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.760
 69 65 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:30.060
 every creature on line every creature is 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.980
 beautiful this ladies and gentlemen have left 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.180
 four seconds four tenths of a 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.580
 second 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.280
 new lack 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:44.110
 965 well very well logical what it says 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.270
 because being a referee in front of the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.610
 play did not sentence a foul that 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.830
 sentenced the one that was and we have it 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.730
 cheer me up and I had marcelinho 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.730
 back gardens 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.880
 inside point 2 for barea with 70 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.500
 for the Puerto Rico national address 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.850
 important to the points of the differential 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.080
 that center can enter into a team and 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.480
 that's why they will be attacking and 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.000
 defending to the last because it is 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.620
 There may be a tie that is 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.220
 necessary when we get to perform it 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.320
 get and worth that yes worth twice as much 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.120
 ricky sanchez and there is a time for part 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.650
 robert morning although already you are known to have 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.690
 good for the encounter is losing 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.550
 percent need to put together a play with 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.460
 that second that remains to see if it can 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.770
 discount the difference and that in some 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.200
 because if given a hypothetical case of a 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.400
 tie the differential of points between 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.400
 puerto rico brazil is less 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.880
 and tell them something that happens to this 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.419
 level in the first meeting between 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.520
 Canada and Jamaica happened the same had 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.300
 a pretty big difference on the part 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.330
 of the Canadian set 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.409
 and I request a time discount 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:58.019
 when 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:05:01.030
 we were about 17 winning the 

00:04:58.019 --> 00:05:03.430
 game for more than 17 points 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.010
 at that time the squirrels asked me 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:08.560
 he asked us why he requested that 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.600
 time 24 points for batman very rebound 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.060
 to holland four assists for the 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.010
 tide and a steal for Mr. 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.260
 alan had an importance that suddenly 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:20.140
 it is not reflected in the numbers but and it had 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.850
 one is to that period in which he obtained 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.350
 up to six consecutive points for the 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.000
 cause of puerto rico because he gave me 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.500
 torrico again in the game when 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.140
 Brazil had made a difference 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.520
 not broad but what but that 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.650
 allowed to consolidate your flight 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.490
 here you have to remove that criterion from the 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.860
 head juniors friends of tvn césar and that 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.490
 you have to leave in the last position 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.560
 because I play is defined 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.930
 modern basketball you do not take her 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.910
 and at this level this kind of much less 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.460
 the game remember what it cost us that 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.470
 against him and with lithuania and that 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.249
 unfortunate against nigeria this ladies 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:02.149
 and gentlemen when I make contact there is 

00:05:58.249 --> 00:06:05.179
 the game 72 to 65 is over 

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:07.819
 giving puerto rico to brazil and gabriel 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:12.429
 cava or gabriel was with us 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:12.429
 to start the match next
