00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Yes 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.410
 hello the facts you have been several 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.930
 to mention it you are going to move 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.060
 and that you were curious to know 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.710
 how I had packed but thing 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.800
 now I can not that nothing five years 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.270
 at content of all the stock that I have 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.850
 would you put a link to my last 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.619
 Thursday makeup engagement video 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.419
 I needed to be organized is this 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.420
 that I did what I took my little 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.760
 kaige wood for example but me when I 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.860
 got glee but all that and it's in 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.380
 that sense that I placed very 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.360
 coordinated for example the foursomes all 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.750
 alone so the goal is that in every 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.280
 little wood on the chain if you move it 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.030
 and youri that collide that it 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.309
 make no noise 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.750
 in short, everything is still the only 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.030
 so there really no risk 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.980
 unless totally escaped me in 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.879
 that things are happening in that 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.899
 I did it is in fact several 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.489
 small boxes 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.910
 and these little love boxes are issued 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.160
 in a big month to transport it 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.020
 the more fragile items packed them in 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.929
 paper so the whole thing really 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.410
 played or tetris to place things from 

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:17.479
 so that it does not move for the 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.030
 varnish I have them squarely packed in 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.649
 clothes because I found on 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.179
 newsprint was like good enough 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.759
 thick between each let's see why who 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.099
 is water collision for not that 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.170
 settles between them then it leaves him 

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:32.149
 to find that it was bad I almost failed 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.890
 you angry against but varnish or against 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.429
 the newsprint because jan balik thursday of 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.970
 Harbor 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.459
 I take I take my age I took 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.869
 old clothes that even if he wants 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:44.209
 dynamic of the blow on it I had not 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.950
 crying my life the goal was still 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.750
 not that the varnish glue we check well 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 that your bottles are closed properly 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.910
 sellers before packing them and so 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.800
 I took for example beach jackets 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.530
 started with the sleeve a varnish so 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:01.429
 a bit of a UFO in short at the end it's 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.890
 a kicker tunick tiny tournicoti 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.319
 of clothes and varnish in the box 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.190
 but everything went in no way broken 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:09.479
 everything went well 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.739
 the only thing I have blackcurrant 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.970
 but in fact she does not even break I 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.890
 do not understand what terrorists a 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.230
 bottle of hair oil 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.480
 recognized of the day it is a little filtered 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.090
 expensive but good port then sank 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.799
 put in a ziploc bag with other 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.799
 stuff for the hair so there will be 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.330
 many teeth the other thing 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.310
 serious re-read maybe containers 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.989
 closed so I had to clean so 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.450
 try things that have a risk 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.709
 potential of hens and not to 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.910
 put in touch with things 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.489
 which you hold or at least 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 same in their ziploc bag or whatever and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.450
 it's in this box the I had 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 not put things still in this 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.099
 box from where the importance of making the 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.599
 things of the mobile so I broke nothing I 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.640
 I thought it could be 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.709
 useful to screw bubble wrap also done 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.790
 take care to pack your things and 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.019
 all my brushes for example I have everything 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.269
 taken by a few of my eyebrushes 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.819
 with and there it's like that but at 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:06.329
 bottom of me so lyon no 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:10.430
 of crushing his close friend in a 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.079
 nut nuts some 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.139
 some eat before I kept 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:18.329
 the little plastic protector of when 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:21.090
 purchase so I handed it to keep you 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.380
 my form is really not trying to 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.389
 keep I know it's flat to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.220
 keep my acid board more wood 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.870
 past ball or that kind of things to 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.989
 ways to defend either the brushes 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.519
 in a kind of display stands or a 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.560
 little pocket that we use almost 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.209
 never except when traveling but first except 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.760
 to put them away like that they'll be 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.250
 cleaner they are going to be even more 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.620
 since - - men's grizzlies ten years of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.690
 magic so that was my little zasso 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.340
 cherry tree wizard I had asked for advice 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.660
 with my friends before so this moment 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.669
 who invented the technique of any 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.590
 way it stems from the logic the 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.870
 names system I hope this 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.970
 video there to stop you useful then to 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.889
 if you move you as good 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.870
 luck I'm forcing 100% what you 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.250
 can it's a lot stressful to get 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.150
 return once we're done and we 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.250
 know that we have not forgotten anything 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.020
 all is well we seek but it is the 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.190
 life not alone 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.110
 it's a good joly party 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.290
