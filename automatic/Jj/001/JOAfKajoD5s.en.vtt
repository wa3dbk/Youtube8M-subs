as though Virgo may have won or
something<00:02:14.110> or<00:02:14.319> maybe<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> fight<00:02:15.220> was

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940

punched into the other room and the
doors<00:02:19.629> locked<00:02:19.690> or<00:02:20.110> something<00:02:20.140> but<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.040> seems

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
doors locked or something but it seems

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.500 
doors locked or something but it seems
as<00:02:21.310> though<00:02:21.430> her<00:02:21.610> girls<00:02:21.790> heading<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.209> STD

room<00:02:22.840> and<00:02:23.049> the<00:02:23.560> fight<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.860> over<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.310> little

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
room and the fight is over a little

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.130 
room and the fight is over a little
short<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.299> my<00:02:25.420> opinion<00:02:25.720> I<00:02:25.780> think<00:02:25.840> that<00:02:25.989> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
short in my opinion I think that the

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.330 
short in my opinion I think that the
fights<00:02:26.349> have<00:02:26.500> definitely<00:02:26.830> been<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:26.980> little<00:02:27.129> bit

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
fights have definitely been a little bit

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.030 
fights have definitely been a little bit
longer<00:02:27.640> but<00:02:28.450> overall<00:02:28.870> still<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:29.799> what<00:02:29.920> it

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
longer but overall still was for what it

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.380 
longer but overall still was for what it
was<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.310> was<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.489> decent<00:02:30.670> little<00:02:30.909> scuffle<00:02:31.269> I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
was it was a decent little scuffle I

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.149 
was it was a decent little scuffle I
feel<00:02:31.540> like<00:02:31.659> both<00:02:31.900> fights<00:02:32.200> were<00:02:32.560> kind<00:02:32.860> of<00:02:32.920> short

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
feel like both fights were kind of short

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.920 
feel like both fights were kind of short
in<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:33.430> like<00:02:33.579> luffy<00:02:34.060> vertices<00:02:34.540> are<00:02:34.720> going
