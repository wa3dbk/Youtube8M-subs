00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.250
 Y 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.300
 It's as good as part of the special 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.300
 spring we will have a review of 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.730
 a product that is this that is the basis 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.650
 hd of make up forever mica forever 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.270
 assumes that you will get to chile is supposed 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.000
 that you bring it to sail but still not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.739
 has arrived we have not had news already 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.730
 so in theory it should come in 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.860
 some time already 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.809
 This is a super name brand to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.120
 international level and the truth is that 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.860
 has enough with the products of 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.829
 more professional makeup in certain 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.840
 way already in especially this base already 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.400
 I have a base that is made as it says 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.210
 his name for high television 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:09.250
 that is, it does not have any type 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.009
 of digital reflection for photos for 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.160
 the camera for high intensity lights 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:17.710
 already has a high average coverage and a 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.330
 termination that is oil-free by 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.520
 It does not make you more bright than you do not 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.100
 agrees in the camera keeps the skin 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.930
 verified and those important is that 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.160
 has a range of bases like that 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.160
 awesome are 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.740
 20-25 tones for the team so it's 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.580
 how impossible it is not to find your 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.340
 color since this is the product well 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
 says make up forever hd where I have 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.960
 the TV on if I also 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.280
 I saw it the tone that I am in the color 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.930
 of 125 the 125 is filled 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.920
 we want to compute in the ball information 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:00.410
 that came out like sand already and says that 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.120
 is for clear skin with its beige tones 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.980
 since it's kind of like me because I 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.320
 we are pink we are in yellow 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.179
 our buyer to 120 who is the same 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.660
 tone but it is more yellow if 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:13.490
 we noticed already so that I see them as 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.470
 want 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.710
 so I 'm going to apply I 'm going to take a 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.710
 bit 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.240
 and if they set the texture it's like well 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.100
 creamy it looks a little liquid 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.100
 how do you apply it first? 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.630
 although it kind of drips a bit like the 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.090
 that runs 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.790
 and this is a sub tones weitz more with its 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.680
 pink tone is like neutral because I 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.540
 I did not ask for yellow because they adapt 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.370
 a lot because it's very yellow and I asked 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.180
 the pink to be able to blur and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.590
 disguise the rosacea in the background so 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.410
 Now that I have many points 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.290
 I'll spread with a brush as 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.830
 large base that is on the f60 's 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.870
 sigma 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.230
 so that to see the coverage that it has and is 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.769
 an average coverage 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.390
 which can be done in the background 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.080
 second layer and carry a hedge 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.080
 high 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.620
 and from this 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.620
 but no 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:33.270
 if they are fixed it is super easy to apply the 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.420
 base like that does not put much 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:39.500
 it does not dry does not put us much resistance 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.590
 to melt in the skin 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.030
 and left the completion that yes in which 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.830
 you see the poles and giving a termination 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.660
 that is not very thick to the base I cited 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.730
 the intersections with a coverage 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.410
 mean as I said and then it's not that 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.910
 this color to me neutralizes me enough 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.810
 the rosacea are fixed had as well 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:02.849
 rojito here and now it 's far less 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.849
 and there it melts very easily on the skin 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.360
 very low 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.520
 the termination that it has despite being 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.230
 a fat-free base is not matte 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:26.150
 natural because what you look for in the 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.520
 background this base is to imitate the skin 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:33.280
 so that when you see it on television 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.280
 hd do not notice so I'm going to do 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.980
 equity as you want 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.950
 is fixed in the termination is precious it 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.620
 It seems a lot natural and there's the 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.540
 front 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.790
 in the natural you want to say 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.680
 something 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.620
 alex had invites looks what things are what 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.130
 that the sensation in the 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.240
 skin 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.350
 the other super livianita does not 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:01.830
 They misunderstand but it's like I do not have 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.050
 absolutely nothing 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.480
 and all of perfections the 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.250
 disappearance is already foundation of makeup 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:14.730
 they do not sell it here, it does not reach chile 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.860
 I became attached to a friend who traveled and 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.630
 so it 's cost me the 42 dollars that 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:21.840
 ok in the store that out of the 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.670
 reason 21,000 chile already but there is a 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:28.350
 person who can bring them to you who is the 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:31.140
 but from the 3 joli store on facebook that 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.720
 her three sephora things you now 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.249
 you can order me down I'll leave you 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.689
 the link of the habit store 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:43.259
 so that the best 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:45.209
 if I left it under the lic 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:47.189
 so they can go where she is 

00:05:45.209 --> 00:05:48.719
 they really like that it's a base 

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:51.360
 quite expensive but it is quite good in 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:54.689
 30 ml is all that and if you look at me I know 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.610
 like a bread and a half more or less in 

00:05:54.689 --> 00:05:58.739
 apply me not on the whole face in that 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.259
 super fast the application does it 

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:03.989
 with the most basic brush that I have and that 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:06.509
 a lovely ending it super 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:08.189
 natural if they have oily skin without any 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:11.039
 problem can be used more with 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:11.879
 less gene was the idea in the background 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.699
 is that it has as a hedge 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:16.289
 invisible they say they take out the 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.539
 container 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:20.189
 and there the other thing is that it does not dry the skin 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.439
 despite being fat free because it has 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.180
 a hydration system but those 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:26.249
 graduation as on water basis not in 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.669
 base to fat that's why it stays 

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:31.889
 also on the skin already so I hope so 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.119
 that you like this review is well 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.430
 short because in the background what more 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:37.409
 I want is to want the termination to me 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.149
 I love that, I think this base is a 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:41.279
 super good investment if you have 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.050
 many events now to year 

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.990
 example to children who are going to record that 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.240
 they are going to have the parties that they are going to have 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:50.879
 these pictures that get things like this this 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.039
 kind of bases they have in the background not 

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.749
 has solar authorization that is to say that it does not 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:58.259
 reflects light and that they are made to 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:07:00.629
 taking pictures are super are a good 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.300
 investment in the fund can even be 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:06.029
 buy it in two and divide the 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.159
 contained there you see but it happened 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.240
 mind that it is very expensive already but if they have 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:10.709
 the opportunity to buy it is 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.599
 I recommend Jose roses that are going to have 

00:07:10.709 --> 00:07:14.279
 a lot of meeting with cameras or with photos 

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:16.759
 and so I hope you liked it and 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:16.759
