00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello youtube people today I bring you 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:14.190
 ribs like the hollywood poster 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 with homemade barbecue sauce on 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.990
 first step that we are going to do is to cook 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.410
 the ribs that gives a touch 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.090
 much tastier 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.090
 so we're going to cook it 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:42.220
 when we see that things start to come out 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:46.200
 white and unknown so the 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.200
 much juicier changes 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.200
 and now let's do what sauce 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.420
 for the sauce we're going to need sauce 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.510
 barbecue well brown sugar and pepsi or 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.900
 coca cola in this case used pepsi that 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 is what I have 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.620
 let's have a barbecue 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.140
 not so we have thrown out of the barbecue for 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.770
 very real 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.770
 all right 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.100
 so it stayed tastier 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.590
 and now sugar 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.960
 and now we are going to take a lot of roll 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:08.480
 and now you have to start moving it 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.480
 until everything is well moved 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:17.620
 and the original barbecue sauce will come out 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 I can leave the ribs super rich 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.439
 also add potatoes 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.439
 look what cozy little color 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.000
 Well, here we have the barbecue sauce 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000
 word after 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.850
 we left them five or ten minutes 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.580
 look how the water starts to put 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.610
 white and you start throwing white that's 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.890
 that are already so we are going to remove it 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.060
 the water and we're going to put it to bake 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.060
 cover at 250 degrees to the top 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.450
 we will raffle at first alone and then 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.849
 then we would add the barbecue sauce 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.370
 let's add enough to the one we 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.990
 matter because as the barbecue sauce is 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.850
 quite a bit of buchona so that 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.190
 and so we put it in the oven 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.820
 We have already removed them 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.580
 Let 15 minutes only with the grill to 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.910
 that the cable stays crisper and 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.180
 now we are going to add the sauce 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.180
 barbecue 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.690
 with a brush of these 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.400
 we are going to take a lot of sauce 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.030
 on all sides of the rib 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.130
 and apart we have peeled a potato and the 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.020
 we have left whole 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.699
 to accompany them 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.699
 just like in hollywood dessert 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.940
 is not entering a man 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.740
 more so 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.250
 if needed now we will add more 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.250
 ah 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.930
 we installed cut because the potato of 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.400
 the too much 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.699
 is going to add a little salt to the 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.699
 potatoes 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.740
 and we are not talking 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.310

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.310
 Pepper 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.470
