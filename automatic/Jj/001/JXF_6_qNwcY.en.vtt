00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:10.869 
good impact like fable one did it's the
people<00:07:07.999> kept<00:07:08.270> saying<00:07:08.349> that<00:07:09.349> fable<00:07:09.709> one<00:07:09.919> was

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:10.879 
people kept saying that fable one was

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:12.879 
people kept saying that fable one was
too<00:07:11.089> short<00:07:11.270> yes<00:07:11.569> it<00:07:11.839> was<00:07:11.990> too<00:07:12.199> short<00:07:12.439> and<00:07:12.740> I

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:12.889 
too short yes it was too short and I

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:14.619 
too short yes it was too short and I
wish<00:07:13.069> it<00:07:13.219> was<00:07:13.339> longer<00:07:13.490> that's<00:07:13.879> why<00:07:14.270> they<00:07:14.449> came

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629 
wish it was longer that's why they came

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:17.409 
wish it was longer that's why they came
out<00:07:14.779> with<00:07:14.839> fable<00:07:15.229> TLC<00:07:15.919> but<00:07:16.249> that<00:07:16.849> was<00:07:16.999> still<00:07:17.389> a

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:17.419 
out with fable TLC but that was still a

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.269 
out with fable TLC but that was still a
little<00:07:17.569> bit<00:07:17.869> too<00:07:18.020> short<00:07:18.319> in<00:07:18.409> my<00:07:18.559> opinion<00:07:18.889> and

00:07:19.269 --> 00:07:19.279 
little bit too short in my opinion and

00:07:19.279 --> 00:07:21.249 
little bit too short in my opinion and
then<00:07:19.399> acropolis<00:07:20.029> was<00:07:20.240> a<00:07:20.270> tedious<00:07:20.809> piece<00:07:21.080> of

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:21.259 
then acropolis was a tedious piece of

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:26.139 
then acropolis was a tedious piece of
shit<00:07:23.740> also<00:07:24.740> that<00:07:24.949> it's<00:07:25.099> overhyped<00:07:25.519> of<00:07:25.819> course

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:26.149 
shit also that it's overhyped of course

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:28.389 
shit also that it's overhyped of course
the<00:07:26.449> whole<00:07:26.629> damn<00:07:26.839> series<00:07:27.349> is<00:07:27.529> overhyped<00:07:27.979> and

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:28.399 
the whole damn series is overhyped and

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:31.629 
the whole damn series is overhyped and
couldn't<00:07:29.029> deliver<00:07:29.300> but<00:07:29.779> I<00:07:29.959> think<00:07:30.229> fabled<00:07:30.680> TLC

00:07:31.629 --> 00:07:31.639 
couldn't deliver but I think fabled TLC

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.389 
couldn't deliver but I think fabled TLC
definitely<00:07:32.330> delivered<00:07:32.870> in<00:07:32.990> that<00:07:33.199> be<00:07:34.009> able<00:07:34.219> two

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:34.399 
definitely delivered in that be able two

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:36.459 
definitely delivered in that be able two
and<00:07:34.759> fable<00:07:34.939> three<00:07:35.300> could<00:07:35.569> not<00:07:35.749> compete<00:07:36.199> I

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:36.469 
and fable three could not compete I

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:38.739 
and fable three could not compete I
would<00:07:37.069> I<00:07:37.099> really<00:07:37.639> don't<00:07:37.819> like<00:07:37.969> about<00:07:38.149> fable
