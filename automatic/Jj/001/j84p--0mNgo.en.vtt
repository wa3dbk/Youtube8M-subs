00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.600
 ah 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.290
 welcome to more guys today 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.619
 we go with the moon review 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:19.119
 hidden or high the moon as you 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:21.760
 want to put I'm very upset I'm going 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.700
 to say why to knees on 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.880
 new actress 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.460
 that is low does not mean that it is one of 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.769
 the most talented actresses that exist 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.800
 that's not the main issue what to me 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.590
 it bothers me enough is why the hell 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.140
 they keep insisting on making movies 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:46.650
 the truth is not even if I do not know if it is 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:50.530
 Mexican or is American is Spanglish and 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:53.680
 chicana I do not know what a hidden 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.790
 would love that a producer of the 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.650
 poorly explained movie because we'll see 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.830
 why do they speak first in English and then 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.510
 in Spanish and then as it is one of 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.910
 those things that have lately 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.090
 I have been making movies 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.160
 mexicanas or those who internationalized 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.520
 they want it to be Hollywood success not 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.160
 I know but hidden moon simply 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.960
 is going to tell us are very bad attempts to 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:24.880
 movie with the story 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.930
 sorry for the word I'm going to say 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.940
 but stupid 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.310
 a stupid love story that already 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.920
 we have seen that the girl is 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:39.680
 confused and has his romance from the 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.740
 childhood with this guy that all life 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.810
 he has lived with him and with what but then 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 comes to a new boy and how do you 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.150
 start to like and if you already know the end 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.280
 it has not even been so, because 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.040
 it's clearer than water and what I 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.840
 annoying is that they then ask for 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.810
 what do not support Mexican cinema there 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.390
 because it's not because the 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.640
 pens or you will not succeed on 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.399
 soundtrack is lousy the address is 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.580
 of the scrubbing to have the used ones 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.580
 of 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.860
 on stage beautiful scenarios of 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.840
 mexico like veracruz and guanajuato not 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.930
 it means that it's going to be a good movie 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.670
 made if you see the photograph and skewed that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.150
 father the new ones of mexico but then 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.640
 also has effects of 3rd of 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.190
 primary and not tell me there is no 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.959
 talent here in mexico if there is and if you 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.540
 can do things well so that 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.730
 do more well with time and demand 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.590
 quality and if it bothers me because I am 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.340
 one of those people who says there's 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.160
 support the national being and then tell me 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.620
 alexander as it is supported saying relational 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.780
 if they bring us movies like a 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.640
 hidden and obviously it angers me and I 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.709
 I say that if they have absolutely all the 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.510
 reason as we will support the cinema 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.019
 national if I'm not in movies like 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.030
 hidden moon and tell us tell us 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.010
 now it comes without national and you see the 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.710
 product and say you hear it seems a chapter 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.810
 of the rose of guadeloupe 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 and you say to see things like this 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.050
 quality therefore better putting the channel of 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.890
 the stars or huasteca 13 or any 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.530
 of those open signal channels if I 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.110
 understand then how do you want 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.730
 they want you to support a movie like 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:32.340
 the moon hidden with bad performances 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.430
 bad and bad lighting a story 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.980
 stupid I say to my angry I get angry 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.110
 because I know that you write us and 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.140
 they tell us how we are going to support if national 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.010
 after seeing one thing has been thus 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.990
 I know 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.710
 I offer a great apology to the public 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:54.060
 Also, if that's why I watch movies 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.030
 what do you say what the hell and the truth a 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.520
 speaking of that I would like to touch the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.740
 topic I did not like who posted in addition and 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.740
 I have become up to demanding because 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:07.050
 it's been said to me now we already know up 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.570
 that premier is choosing we will not choose 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.110
 any prize and know that I only 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.690
 I can tell you 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.870
 and it's good that they do it because now 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:20.870
 means that they already know how to enjoy and 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.630
 choose quality films and that's what 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.780
 try are you paying for a ticket to 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.139
 see something of quality something that you like 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.600
 even if it's a movie comedy trash 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.389
 what are you saying and how bad I hope it gives you 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.449
 laugh and have enjoyed it that 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.280
 try invincible so guys this 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.160
 it was the review 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.360
 I do not know half violent medium rare but it's 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:49.760
 that if a quality left us with a very 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.730
 bad taste in the mouth so guys this 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:57.190
 it was the hidden moon review and here 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.190
