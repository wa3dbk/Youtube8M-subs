what<00:00:21.610> is<00:00:21.880> engineering<00:00:22.300> technology<00:00:23.170> and<00:00:23.440> how

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620 
what is engineering technology and how

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.500 
what is engineering technology and how
does<00:00:23.830> it<00:00:23.980> fit<00:00:24.220> into<00:00:24.430> our<00:00:24.640> business<00:00:25.090> model

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510 
does it fit into our business model

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.230 
does it fit into our business model
quite<00:00:26.320> simply<00:00:26.770> it's<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:27.070> link<00:00:27.369> it's<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:28.000> key

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
quite simply it's a link it's the key

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.620 
quite simply it's a link it's the key
link<00:00:28.570> between<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:29.289> applied<00:00:29.619> side<00:00:30.130> of
