00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.860 
1920 by 1080 native HD resolution which

sense<00:00:59.879> for<00:01:00.239> using<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.629> on<00:01:00.719> my<00:01:00.750> Mac<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.710> that's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
sense for using it on my Mac so that's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.310 
sense for using it on my Mac so that's
basically<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> reason<00:01:02.850> for<00:01:03.539> my<00:01:03.690> returning<00:01:04.199> up

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
reading this one alright let's get a

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:54.009 
reading this one alright let's get a
basic<00:03:51.349> breakdown<00:03:51.590> of<00:03:52.420> the<00:03:53.420> stats<00:03:53.750> on<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
basic breakdown of the stats on the

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.199 
basic breakdown of the stats on the
right<00:03:54.170> first<00:03:54.459> you'll<00:03:55.459> see<00:03:55.519> right<00:03:55.819> away<00:03:55.940> this

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
right first you'll see right away this

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:57.970 
right first you'll see right away this
is<00:03:56.269> led<00:03:56.720> which<00:03:57.049> is<00:03:57.170> very<00:03:57.349> nice<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.709> got<00:03:57.799> high

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
is led which is very nice it's got high

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.490 
is led which is very nice it's got high
contrast<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:59.120> ms<00:03:59.540> response<00:03:59.959> line<00:04:00.200> which<00:04:00.409> is

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
contrast to ms response line which is

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.400 
contrast to ms response line which is
extremely<00:04:00.920> fast<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.489> an<00:04:01.549> LCD<00:04:01.790> full<00:04:02.629> HD<00:04:03.049> 1080

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
extremely fast for an LCD full HD 1080

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.309 
extremely fast for an LCD full HD 1080
so<00:04:03.650> it's<00:04:03.769> obviously<00:04:04.040> not<00:04:04.190> 220<00:04:04.640> by<00:04:04.730> 1080<00:04:05.319> HDCP

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
so it's obviously not 220 by 1080 HDCP

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:08.979 
so it's obviously not 220 by 1080 HDCP

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
have but again I will not be even be

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.039 
have but again I will not be even be

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:15.640 
using them and 40% power saving which is
always<00:04:15.200> good

here we see we have access to the audio
the<00:05:00.260> speaker's<00:05:00.590> input<00:05:01.810> I'm<00:05:02.810> not<00:05:02.960> sure<00:05:03.139> with

the speaker's input I'm not sure with
that<00:05:03.410> as<00:05:03.590> that<00:05:03.710> might<00:05:03.889> be<00:05:03.919> headphones<00:05:04.430> that

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610

there's<00:05:04.789> no<00:05:04.970> label<00:05:05.599> on<00:05:05.840> it<00:05:06.020> we<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.620> HDMI<00:05:07.160> DVI

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
there's no label on it we have HDMI DVI

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.760 
there's no label on it we have HDMI DVI
and<00:05:07.729> VGA<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:08.510> we<00:05:08.840> have<00:05:08.930> all<00:05:09.139> three<00:05:09.380> standard

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
and VGA so we have all three standard

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.500 
and VGA so we have all three standard
video<00:05:09.919> connections<00:05:10.460> which<00:05:11.150> is<00:05:11.300> definitely

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
video connections which is definitely

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.800 
video connections which is definitely
nice<00:05:11.840> since<00:05:12.080> my<00:05:12.169> video<00:05:12.320> card<00:05:12.620> uses<00:05:12.949> DVI<00:05:13.720> but<00:05:14.720> if

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
nice since my video card uses DVI but if

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:16.060 
nice since my video card uses DVI but if
you<00:05:14.870> do<00:05:14.990> want<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.169> use<00:05:15.289> HDMI<00:05:15.620> we<00:05:15.919> obviously

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
you do want to use HDMI we obviously

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.790 
you do want to use HDMI we obviously
have<00:05:16.460> that<00:05:16.669> option<00:05:16.940> and<00:05:17.380> then<00:05:18.380> over<00:05:18.590> here<00:05:18.620> we

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
have that option and then over here we

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.219 
have that option and then over here we
have<00:05:18.979> your<00:05:19.160> power<00:05:19.430> and<00:05:20.210> now<00:05:20.389> for<00:05:20.660> the<00:05:20.720> fun<00:05:20.900> part

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
have your power and now for the fun part

put<00:05:21.410> in<00:05:21.500> the<00:05:21.620> stand<00:05:21.919> on<00:05:22.130> which<00:05:22.280> shouldn't<00:05:22.699> be

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:22.760 
put in the stand on which shouldn't be

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.180 
put in the stand on which shouldn't be
too<00:05:23.030> difficult<00:05:23.199> to<00:05:24.199> do<00:05:24.320> this<00:05:24.470> upside<00:05:24.710> down<00:05:24.889> is

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
too difficult to do this upside down is

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.490 
too difficult to do this upside down is
probably<00:05:25.430> easier<00:05:25.760> there<00:05:26.690> we<00:05:26.780> go<00:05:26.960> so<00:05:27.169> I<00:05:27.199> that<00:05:27.410> is

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
probably easier there we go so I that is

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:35.180 
probably easier there we go so I that is
the<00:05:27.650> slot<00:05:27.919> then<00:05:28.639> twist<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.419> support

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:38.450 

and<00:05:35.850> that<00:05:36.000> was<00:05:36.120> incredibly<00:05:36.270> easy<00:05:37.130> now<00:05:38.130> to<00:05:38.190> put

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 
and that was incredibly easy now to put

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:47.230 
and that was incredibly easy now to put
on<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.670> desk<00:05:44.960> very<00:05:45.960> nice

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
on the desk very nice

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.090 
on the desk very nice
that's<00:05:48.240> actually<00:05:48.630> pretty<00:05:49.050> wide<00:05:49.320> for<00:05:49.560> 24<00:05:49.920> inch

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
that's actually pretty wide for 24 inch

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.820 
that's actually pretty wide for 24 inch
unlike<00:05:51.060> my<00:05:51.180> cinema<00:05:51.510> display<00:05:51.780> that's<00:05:52.050> 1920<00:05:52.710> by

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
unlike my cinema display that's 1920 by

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.010 
unlike my cinema display that's 1920 by
1200<00:05:53.160> which<00:05:53.550> I<00:05:53.730> actually<00:05:53.850> preferred<00:05:54.360> at<00:05:54.540> 16<00:05:54.900> by

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
1200 which I actually preferred at 16 by

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.010 
1200 which I actually preferred at 16 by
10<00:05:55.290> but<00:05:55.830> this<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.100> 1920<00:05:56.820> by<00:05:56.910> 1080<00:05:57.300> this<00:05:57.870> is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
10 but this is 1920 by 1080 this is

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.630 
10 but this is 1920 by 1080 this is
actually<00:05:58.320> better<00:05:58.470> for<00:05:58.530> movie<00:05:58.920> since<00:05:59.130> it's<00:05:59.280> 16

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
actually better for movie since it's 16

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.170 
actually better for movie since it's 16
by<00:05:59.790> 9<00:05:59.820> so<00:06:00.780> I<00:06:01.140> might<00:06:02.010> even<00:06:02.130> buy<00:06:02.400> a<00:06:02.430> second<00:06:03.030> one<00:06:03.060> of

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
by 9 so I might even buy a second one of

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.470 
by 9 so I might even buy a second one of
these<00:06:03.360> who<00:06:03.690> knows<00:06:03.900> because<00:06:04.170> this<00:06:05.010> is<00:06:05.190> only

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
these who knows because this is only

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.970 
these who knows because this is only
$220<00:06:06.480> onderweg<00:06:06.750> which<00:06:07.200> in<00:06:07.440> my<00:06:07.590> opinion<00:06:07.710> is

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
$220 onderweg which in my opinion is

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.520 
$220 onderweg which in my opinion is
pretty<00:06:08.430> cheap<00:06:08.790> for<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.660> monitor<00:06:10.080> of<00:06:10.320> this

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
pretty cheap for a monitor of this

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.350 
pretty cheap for a monitor of this
caliber<00:06:10.980> oh<00:06:11.160> and<00:06:11.700> also<00:06:11.850> I<00:06:12.000> should<00:06:12.090> mention

caliber oh and also I should mention

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.170 
caliber oh and also I should mention
that<00:06:12.810> this<00:06:12.990> is<00:06:13.260> a<00:06:13.320> matte<00:06:13.680> display<00:06:13.890> as<00:06:14.460> you<00:06:15.000> can

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
that this is a matte display as you can

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.120 
that this is a matte display as you can
tell<00:06:15.390> I'm<00:06:15.630> not<00:06:15.690> a<00:06:15.900> fan<00:06:16.140> of<00:06:16.170> glossy<00:06:16.650> at<00:06:16.860> all
