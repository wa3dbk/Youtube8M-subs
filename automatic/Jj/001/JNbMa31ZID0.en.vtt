input stuff but since this card

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.520 
input stuff but since this card
well<00:04:57.660> it<00:04:57.930> has<00:04:58.050> two<00:04:58.320> DVI<00:04:58.620> Zsasz<00:04:59.130> ole<00:05:00.139> well<00:05:01.139> most

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
well it has two DVI Zsasz ole well most

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.659 
well it has two DVI Zsasz ole well most
of<00:05:02.130> this<00:05:02.810> 6900<00:05:03.810> series<00:05:03.840> cards<00:05:04.530> has<00:05:04.800> two<00:05:05.280> DVI<00:05:05.550> is

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
of this 6900 series cards has two DVI is

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.120 
of this 6900 series cards has two DVI is
one<00:05:06.030> HDMI<00:05:06.539> to<00:05:06.840> display<00:05:07.830> mini<00:05:08.130> DisplayPort

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
one HDMI to display mini DisplayPort

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.190 
one HDMI to display mini DisplayPort
so<00:05:11.130> yeah<00:05:11.310> it<00:05:11.520> says<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.849> PCI<00:05:12.479> Express<00:05:12.810> the

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
so yeah it says a PCI Express the

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.010 
so yeah it says a PCI Express the

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
no backplate on this one interesting

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.980 
no backplate on this one interesting
well<00:05:20.190> as<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.460> boot<00:05:20.820> matte<00:05:21.000> black<00:05:21.240> PCB<00:05:21.660> which

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
well as a boot matte black PCB which

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.779 
well as a boot matte black PCB which
looks<00:05:22.229> nice<00:05:23.720> morning<00:05:24.720> that<00:05:25.080> is<00:05:25.229> hot<00:05:25.770> surface<00:05:26.460> I

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
looks nice morning that is hot surface I

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.640 
looks nice morning that is hot surface I
guess<00:05:27.360> it<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.720> because<00:05:27.900> this<00:05:27.960> is<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.289> quite<00:05:28.470> high

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
guess it is because this is a quite high

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.520 
guess it is because this is a quite high

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289 
stuff I guess will run just fine so yeah

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.960 
stuff I guess will run just fine so yeah
we<00:05:53.530> got<00:05:53.680> also<00:05:53.919> protective<00:05:54.460> plastic<00:05:54.639> on<00:05:54.940> it

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
we got also protective plastic on it

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.850 
we got also protective plastic on it
actually<00:05:55.180> I<00:05:55.360> only<00:05:55.509> fan<00:05:55.960> it<00:05:56.380> is<00:05:58.500> yeah

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
and on the top the card itself whose

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.350 
and on the top the card itself whose
reflections<00:06:08.560> down<00:06:08.740> there<00:06:09.000> so<00:06:10.000> it<00:06:10.150> has<00:06:10.330> a

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
reflections down there so it has a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.279 
reflections down there so it has a

on<00:06:23.409> this<00:06:23.620> particular<00:06:23.949> card<00:06:24.460> and<00:06:25.389> you<00:06:25.599> can<00:06:25.659> see

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
on this particular card and you can see

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.180 
on this particular card and you can see
the<00:06:26.229> finger<00:06:26.830> in<00:06:27.099> there<00:06:28.800> you<00:06:29.800> turn<00:06:30.009> the

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.190 
the finger in there you turn the

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:31.890 
the finger in there you turn the
brightness<00:06:30.340> on<00:06:30.789> the<00:06:30.940> camera<00:06:31.330> so<00:06:31.659> you<00:06:31.720> can<00:06:31.810> see

little too powerful core we do corner of
it<00:07:23.680> and<00:07:23.919> it's<00:07:24.460> frying<00:07:24.819> up<00:07:25.000> actually<00:07:25.810> the<00:07:25.870> power

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:26.020 
it and it's frying up actually the power

yeah this will be replacing the card I
had<00:07:31.270> my<00:07:31.479> system<00:07:31.750> now<00:07:31.930> which<00:07:32.259> is<00:07:32.409> this<00:07:32.620> was<00:07:33.219> a

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:33.250 
had my system now which is this was a

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:38.300 
had my system now which is this was a
temporary<00:07:33.610> card<00:07:33.880> that<00:07:34.120> was<00:07:34.270> my<00:07:34.710> the<00:07:35.710> H<00:07:35.979> is<00:07:36.310> HD

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:38.310 
temporary card that was my the H is HD

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.420 
temporary card that was my the H is HD
4830

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.320 
4830
I<00:07:40.469> didn't<00:07:41.469> expect<00:07:41.770> that<00:07:41.889> coming<00:07:42.130> right<00:07:42.460> yeah

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330

I didn't expect that coming right yeah
the<00:07:43.509> 4030<00:07:44.080> was<00:07:44.409> a<00:07:44.650> reason<00:07:45.009> the<00:07:45.449> mid-range<00:07:46.449> good

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:46.840 
the 4030 was a reason the mid-range good

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.200 
the 4030 was a reason the mid-range good
card<00:07:47.169> back<00:07:47.650> and<00:07:47.680> it<00:07:48.039> was<00:07:48.430> a<00:07:48.460> really<00:07:48.759> good<00:07:48.909> card

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.210 
card back and it was a really good card

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.399 
card back and it was a really good card
actually<00:07:49.479> I<00:07:49.509> was<00:07:49.690> very<00:07:49.750> happy<00:07:50.050> with<00:07:50.199> it

betta<00:07:50.949> and<00:07:51.250> got<00:07:51.460> some<00:07:51.610> artifacts<00:07:52.000> on<00:07:52.150> it<00:07:52.270> now<00:07:52.389> I

00:07:52.409 --> 00:07:52.419 
betta and got some artifacts on it now I

00:07:52.419 --> 00:07:54.379 
betta and got some artifacts on it now I
guess<00:07:52.750> that<00:07:52.930> I've<00:07:53.080> treated<00:07:53.409> it<00:07:53.620> like<00:07:53.680> hell<00:07:54.039> so

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:54.389 
guess that I've treated it like hell so

00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:57.810 
guess that I've treated it like hell so
that's<00:07:55.389> why<00:07:55.919> but<00:07:56.919> yeah<00:07:57.310> guys
