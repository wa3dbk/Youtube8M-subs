okay now we're going to draw the rest of
I'm<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> bring<00:02:57.270> this<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.200> little

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
I'm going to bring this in just a little

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.260 
I'm going to bring this in just a little
bit<00:02:58.560> we're<00:02:59.070> going<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.220> bring<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.580> rest<00:02:59.760> of<00:03:00.060> his

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
bit we're going to bring the rest of his

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.300 
bit we're going to bring the rest of his
we're<00:03:01.050> going<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.230> start<00:03:01.500> as<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.920> rest<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.190> his

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
we're going to start as the rest of his

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.740 
we're going to start as the rest of his
head<00:03:02.520> so<00:03:03.000> we<00:03:03.060> put<00:03:03.270> a<00:03:03.300> little<00:03:03.570> line<00:03:03.810> above<00:03:04.490> by

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
head so we put a little line above by

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.000 
head so we put a little line above by
then<00:03:06.750> we're<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.050> to<00:03:07.110> pretend<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.740> that's

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
then we're going to pretend like that's

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.220 
then we're going to pretend like that's
coming<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:09.120> lines<00:03:09.360> coming<00:03:09.780> through<00:03:10.020> and

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
coming that lines coming through and

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.140 
coming that lines coming through and
then<00:03:10.860> draw<00:03:11.220> a<00:03:11.250> little<00:03:11.730> bit<00:03:11.940> down<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:14.150> then

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
then draw a little bit down here then

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.460 
then draw a little bit down here then
we're<00:03:15.300> going<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> just<00:03:15.660> draw<00:03:15.870> his<00:03:15.900> little<00:03:16.140> lip

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
we're going to just draw his little lip

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
we're going to just draw his little lip
so<00:03:17.040> draw<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.340> curved<00:03:17.640> line<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.970> comes<00:03:18.480> out<00:03:20.690> and

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
so draw a curved line that comes out and

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.780 
so draw a curved line that comes out and
then<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.110> straight<00:03:22.830> line<00:03:23.190> in<00:03:24.410> huh<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:29.040> then

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
then a straight line in huh and then

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.250 
then a straight line in huh and then
we're<00:03:29.940> going<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.090> we're<00:03:30.480> going<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:30.630> start

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
we're going to we're going to start

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.810 
we're going to we're going to start
where<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:31.739> line<00:03:32.010> is<00:03:32.250> we're<00:03:32.430> going<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.580> come

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
where this line is we're going to come

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.490 
where this line is we're going to come
through<00:03:32.850> and<00:03:33.300> then<00:03:34.020> finish<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.709> rest<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.130> this

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
through and then finish the rest of this

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:44.570 
through and then finish the rest of this
rest<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.620> his<00:03:37.739> neck<00:03:40.880> good<00:03:41.880> job<00:03:42.660> dude<00:03:43.340> all<00:03:44.340> right

rest of his neck good job dude all right
okay<00:03:44.880> now<00:03:45.150> let's<00:03:45.510> draw<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.750> other<00:03:45.959> side<00:03:46.290> of

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
okay now let's draw the other side of

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.250 
okay now let's draw the other side of
his<00:03:46.530> head<00:03:46.739> and<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.910> so<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.600> line<00:03:48.900> that<00:03:49.080> go

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
his head and this so this line that go

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.960 
his head and this so this line that go
we're<00:03:49.590> going<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.770> come<00:03:50.310> up<00:03:50.430> straight<00:03:50.730> across

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
we're going to come up straight across

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.000 
we're going to come up straight across
and<00:03:51.840> we're<00:03:52.020> going<00:03:52.200> to<00:03:52.260> draw<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.620> line<00:03:52.950> that

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
and we're going to draw a line that

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.250 
and we're going to draw a line that
comes<00:03:53.400> down<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.590> stop<00:03:56.750> right<00:03:57.750> about<00:03:58.050> half

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
comes down and stop right about half

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.449 
comes down and stop right about half
halfway<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.040> his<00:03:59.160> nose

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.949 

keep<00:04:04.459> going<00:04:06.489> good<00:04:07.489> job<00:04:07.849> man<00:04:08.239> okay<00:04:08.599> now<00:04:08.810> we're

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
keep going good job man okay now we're

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.369 
keep going good job man okay now we're
going<00:04:09.050> to<00:04:09.110> draw<00:04:09.379> a<00:04:09.620> backward<00:04:10.069> see

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
going to draw a backward see

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.410 
going to draw a backward see
do<00:04:12.379> you<00:04:12.440> remember<00:04:12.590> what<00:04:13.010> Phineas<00:04:13.670> had<00:04:13.910> in<00:04:14.120> his

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
do you remember what Phineas had in his

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:24.310 
do you remember what Phineas had in his
ear<00:04:14.870> a<00:04:15.019> 3<00:04:15.830> a<00:04:16.040> 3<00:04:16.690> Ferb<00:04:17.690> has<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:17.989> 3<00:04:18.410> -<00:04:22.600> good<00:04:23.600> job<00:04:23.810> ok

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
ear a 3 a 3 Ferb has a 3 - good job ok

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.840 
ear a 3 a 3 Ferb has a 3 - good job ok
now<00:04:24.590> we're<00:04:24.740> going<00:04:24.860> to<00:04:24.919> retell<00:04:25.370> it<00:04:25.430> we're<00:04:25.729> going

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
now we're going to retell it we're going

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.760 
now we're going to retell it we're going
to<00:04:25.940> imagine<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.600> that<00:04:26.810> line<00:04:27.080> goes<00:04:27.350> through

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
to imagine that that line goes through

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.850 
to imagine that that line goes through
his<00:04:27.919> ear<00:04:28.190> and<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.850> comes<00:04:29.120> out<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> bottom

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
his ear and it comes out the bottom

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.740 
his ear and it comes out the bottom
comes<00:04:30.860> down<00:04:31.220> and<00:04:31.780> then<00:04:32.780> stops<00:04:33.350> at<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.370> same

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
comes down and then stops at the same

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.879 
comes down and then stops at the same
spot<00:04:35.750> same<00:04:36.139> distance<00:04:36.620> on<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.830> paper<00:04:37.419> down

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
spot same distance on the paper down

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:42.129 
spot same distance on the paper down
good<00:04:39.889> you<00:04:40.520> nailed<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.970> all<00:04:41.210> right<00:04:41.840> let's

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
good you nailed it all right let's

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.379 
good you nailed it all right let's
finish<00:04:42.290> his<00:04:42.620> collar<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:43.550> we<00:04:43.669> draw<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:43.970> straight

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
finish his collar so we draw a straight

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:50.200 
finish his collar so we draw a straight
line<00:04:44.419> that<00:04:44.810> goes<00:04:44.990> across<00:04:46.360> and<00:04:48.160> then<00:04:49.160> a<00:04:49.190> W<00:04:49.970> a

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
line that goes across and then a W a

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:59.290 
line that goes across and then a W a
wide<00:04:50.840> W<00:04:51.380> aren't<00:04:53.080> point<00:04:57.820> did<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:58.880> get<00:04:59.060> it<00:04:59.150> all

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
wide W aren't point did you get it all

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.230 
wide W aren't point did you get it all
