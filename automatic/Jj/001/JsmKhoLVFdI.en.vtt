00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.109
 thrilled every year 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.339
 game developers with new announcements because of the great heat 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.339
 most of them saw the light of day but some are here 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:17.550
 they will be buried in silence 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.929
 from Manuel 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.069
 to the cemetery of video games 

00:00:22.069 --> 00:00:24.279
 we ran out of money 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.279
 how can you go up again? 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.789
 what comes out when you cross people with intelligent civilians 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:42.250
 and there is still something of a slimy alien race 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.320
 right StarCraft 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.060
 but all too long the fans of the Zerg photos and Terrans waited on one 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.049
 Shooter in this universe StarCraft Ghost should offer just that 

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:57.889
 Shooters should get the chance No was 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.649
 An intentions trillions and eels pulled the zerg and Protoss stopped his butt 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:03.770
 to spank 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.490
 the game, which has been under development since 2001, was first released in 2002 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.450
 announced 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.980
 The big hype was there, but Blizzard did not announce anything until 2006 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.700
 back 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 unfortunately, it was just about the game final cull reasons for that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 were the success of Biovail and working on StarCraft 2's implementation 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.490
 was then planned for the Xbox Live Game Cube and PlayStation 2 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.380
 The story about StarCraft Ghost was supposed to be four years after the event 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.160
 Play proto 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.500
 With the help of her suit, the heroes also had several stealth passages too 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.800
 Master Sam Fisher sends his regards 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.260
 Of course, the option of holding the button 10 Haudrauf Mania remains 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.320
 There should also be a multiplayer 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 in addition to the traditional modes like Deathmatch Capture the Flag and kids 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.359
 to listen 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.169
 should be added specifically for StarCraft Ghost two new species 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.510
 for one, a conflict was two teams should move against each other 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.860
 Military representative Terrans take 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.390
 fight to the command center and the entire factory to the starting point 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.109
 maneuver back 

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:13.609
 the second unique mode should be called in which 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:17.499
 Here it was about mineral points to take and their resources 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.249
 to get 

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:21.459
 if the topic is people enough it can buy vehicles and weapons 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:26.029
 an interesting life in Forest's the blacklist of Blizzard 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.589
 Astonishingly, StarCraft Ghost does not play their own set game 

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:32.309
 shows up 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.399
 What's the name of hope? 

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:38.899
 thus, there may still be a small chance Consoleros 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.660
 to dive into the world of StarCraft
