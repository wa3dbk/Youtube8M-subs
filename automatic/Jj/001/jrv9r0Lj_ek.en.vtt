00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.440
 hey i'm the fw at the bush force was 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:07.339
 I always only with my car 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.440
 on the way 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.809
 but now has me nevertheless times 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.980
 interested and I have these 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.980
 little ax here worried 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.090
 I do with my big automesse 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
 usually just rough work though 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 just for such work for example 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.360
 when chopping I have a big problem 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.430
 because the focus of this knife 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.010
 is very far back then I have 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 So grab hold very far back and 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.800
 then i can do more right 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.160
 hold on and have no right 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.090
 swing and the fine work that makes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 I mostly with mine anyway 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.140
 Swiss Army Knife and therefore have 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.360
 i thought i want the car 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.519
 detach the knife with this ball 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.549
 if that works because we are the same 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:02.909
 see this is the mp 9 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:05.549
 all purpose in having a weight of 240 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:08.159
 gram including the handle cord has 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.990
 a length of 24 inches and a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.350
 cutting width of 7 cm is the thickness 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 about three and a half mm the blade is made 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.680
 from a stainless hsg the 120er start 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.780
 first test firing with the fire 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.430
 plays and that works know for sure 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 and the whole thing now with the ball 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.210
 perfectly ok now we had that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:49.270
 gs was but it is very tedious and 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 the whole thing now with the ball 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:01.130
 well, very tedious but it works 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:18.230
 a little better than the car fair 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:19.190
 how she carves out 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.010
 much heavier 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.010
 but that was to be expected wooden beams 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.160
 even better since I have to say so 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.989
 that was not right but convincing 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.820
 it was even worse today and starts 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.560
 so if I have this at home right now 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.299
 try again 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.840
 with a proper lock that's one 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:03:23.299
 book seems to be looking pretty hard 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:03:26.180
 that it works, what is it now? 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.850
 actually better when you make fire 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.100
 both equally good at chopping 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.620
 you do not have that good in the movie 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.720
 but I have with me because 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.030
 definitely something easier done 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.170
 at the split that one has just 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.480
 because it will be a bit better soon 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.680
 the carving okay clearly there is 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.379
 me 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.659
 better and what is better now i think 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.159
 that clearly depends on the purpose 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.989
 I would definitely be next 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:54.069
 time to test a bit and 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.099
 when I know more 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.659
 are you the first to know 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:01.079
 Thank you for watching it all right and see you 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.079
 next time
