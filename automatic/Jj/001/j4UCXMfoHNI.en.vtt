at times in this game you take a look at
the<00:01:06.360> cluster<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.920> the

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the cluster and really just the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.500 
the cluster and really just the
different<00:01:08.369> positions<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:08.909> are<00:01:08.970> respected

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
different positions that are respected

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.899

linemen<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.590> choose<00:01:13.799> to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
