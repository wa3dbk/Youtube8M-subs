00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
type dig into the roller okay I'll be

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.830 
type dig into the roller okay I'll be
less<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.859> is<00:00:35.980> pressure<00:00:36.219> of<00:00:36.399> blind<00:00:36.640> eye<00:00:36.840> they've

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
less a is pressure of blind eye they've

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.209 
less a is pressure of blind eye they've
got<00:00:38.230> fair<00:00:38.379> amount<00:00:38.500> of<00:00:38.620> pressure<00:00:38.769> but<00:00:39.039> well

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219 
got fair amount of pressure but well

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.729 
got fair amount of pressure but well
it's<00:00:39.460> actually<00:00:39.850> just<00:00:40.059> a<00:00:40.629> spring<00:00:41.440> on<00:00:41.679> the

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
it's actually just a spring on the

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.340 
it's actually just a spring on the
rollers<00:00:42.190> but<00:00:42.670> it's<00:00:43.030> enough<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.449> if<00:00:43.899> you

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:44.350 
rollers but it's enough that if you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.630 
rollers but it's enough that if you
leave<00:00:44.530> it<00:00:44.620> there<00:00:44.739> long<00:00:44.920> enough<00:00:45.070> they'll<00:00:45.489> be<00:00:45.609> a

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
leave it there long enough they'll be a

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.729 
leave it there long enough they'll be a
mark<00:00:45.910> it'll<00:00:46.390> it'll<00:00:46.629> gradually<00:00:46.899> work<00:00:47.289> out<00:00:47.469> most

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
mark it'll it'll gradually work out most

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.739 
mark it'll it'll gradually work out most
of<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:47.890> time<00:00:48.129> and<00:00:48.399> by<00:00:48.789> it<00:00:49.239> could<00:00:49.539> eventually

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
of the time and by it could eventually

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.169 
of the time and by it could eventually
leave<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.109> mark<00:00:50.410> that<00:00:50.469> will<00:00:51.120> affect<00:00:52.120> your

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.179 
leave a mark that will affect your

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.479 
leave a mark that will affect your
roller<00:00:52.480> surface<00:00:55.679> so<00:00:56.679> you<00:00:56.739> put<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.100> ink<00:00:57.249> you

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
roller surface so you put the ink you

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.250 
roller surface so you put the ink you
put<00:00:57.760> you<00:00:58.059> put<00:00:58.089> the<00:00:58.420> ink<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:58.719> platen<00:00:58.960> their

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
put you put the ink on the platen their

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.590 
put you put the ink on the platen their
anchors<00:00:59.800> up<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.190> disk<00:01:00.429> has<00:01:01.269> this<00:01:01.449> been

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
anchors up on the disk has this been

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
anchors up on the disk has this been
used<00:01:01.839> this<00:01:01.929> morning<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:02.379> hide<00:01:02.739> out<00:01:02.920> shake<00:01:03.190> ok

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
used this morning to hide out shake ok

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.420 
used this morning to hide out shake ok
we'll<00:01:04.210> see<00:01:04.390> what's<00:01:05.080> a<00:01:05.170> gift<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.470> me<00:01:05.590> now<00:01:06.280> we

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
we'll see what's a gift to me now we

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.359 
we'll see what's a gift to me now we
positioned<00:01:07.000> this<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.659> that<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:09.040> was<00:01:09.159> in<00:01:09.280> the

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
positioned this so that it was in the

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:11.190 
positioned this so that it was in the
same<00:01:09.579> position<00:01:10.000> as<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.210> previous<00:01:10.420> type<00:01:10.840> so

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
same position as the previous type so

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380 
same position as the previous type so
that<00:01:11.380> we<00:01:11.500> shouldn't<00:01:11.740> have<00:01:11.950> any<00:01:12.390> interaction

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
that we shouldn't have any interaction

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.560 
that we shouldn't have any interaction
with<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.100> guides<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:16.210> are<00:01:16.270> on<00:01:16.479> the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
with the with the guides that are on the

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.510 
with the with the guides that are on the
plate<00:01:16.780> but<00:01:17.110> it's<00:01:17.649> always<00:01:17.829> nice<00:01:18.070> just<00:01:18.310> to<00:01:18.369> do<00:01:18.490> a

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
plate but it's always nice just to do a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.130 
plate but it's always nice just to do a
visible<00:01:18.909> check<00:01:19.149> all<00:01:19.299> that<00:01:19.509> I've<00:01:19.659> got<00:01:19.810> lots<00:01:19.930> of

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
visible check all that I've got lots of

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.539 
visible check all that I've got lots of
clearance<00:01:20.500> there<00:01:20.740> so<00:01:21.130> we're<00:01:21.250> not<00:01:21.280> going<00:01:21.490> to

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
clearance there so we're not going to

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.830 
clearance there so we're not going to
have<00:01:21.640> any<00:01:21.820> problem<00:01:23.969> so<00:01:25.740> I've<00:01:26.740> got<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:26.920> learn

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
have any problem so I've got to learn

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.710 
have any problem so I've got to learn
lessons<00:01:28.840> will<00:01:29.829> just<00:01:30.009> run<00:01:30.159> it<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.460> couple<00:01:30.789> times

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.000 

nice<00:01:34.720> simple<00:01:35.290> depending<00:01:35.830> surface<00:01:36.160> so<00:01:38.010> let's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
nice simple depending surface so let's

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:46.110 
nice simple depending surface so let's
just<00:01:39.930> see<00:01:40.930> how<00:01:41.080> our<00:01:41.230> position<00:01:41.650> is<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:42.310> I<00:01:45.120> don't

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
just see how our position is and I don't

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.880 
just see how our position is and I don't
know<00:01:46.360> anything<00:01:46.660> this<00:01:46.900> working<00:01:47.260> is<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.680> turn

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
know anything this working is to turn

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:57.150 
know anything this working is to turn
the<00:01:48.010> wheel<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.580> other<00:01:48.790> way<00:01:55.470> okay<00:01:56.470> so<00:01:56.800> we

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:57.160 
the wheel the other way okay so we

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.530 
the wheel the other way okay so we
definitely<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.610> centering<00:01:57.880> problems<00:01:58.330> oh

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
definitely have centering problems oh

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:05.340 
definitely have centering problems oh
yeah<00:01:59.500> okay<00:01:59.890> okay<00:02:00.580> let's<00:02:01.530> take<00:02:02.530> that<00:02:02.590> off<00:02:04.350> yeah

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
yeah okay okay let's take that off yeah

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
away a little bit of this space here and

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.570 
away a little bit of this space here and
give<00:02:46.209> it<00:02:46.330> two<00:02:46.450> down<00:02:46.600> here<00:02:47.250> even<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.400> much<00:02:48.550> as
