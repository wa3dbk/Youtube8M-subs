higher level its way up there this one

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.760 
higher level its way up there this one
is<00:01:02.459> in<00:01:03.459> fact<00:01:04.360> I<00:01:04.960> believe<00:01:05.680> aim<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:07.810> know<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.560> looks

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
is in fact I believe aim I know it looks

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.710 
is in fact I believe aim I know it looks
like<00:01:08.950> it's<00:01:09.310> a<00:01:09.370> different<00:01:09.610> color<00:01:09.760> but<00:01:10.000> it's<00:01:10.150> not

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
like it's a different color but it's not

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.330 
like it's a different color but it's not
so<00:01:11.350> you're<00:01:11.470> just<00:01:11.530> going<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.800> come<00:01:11.920> around<00:01:12.010> here

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
so you're just going to come around here

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.410 
so you're just going to come around here
and<00:01:12.430> you're<00:01:12.730> gonna<00:01:12.820> see<00:01:12.970> another<00:01:13.120> little

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
and you're gonna see another little

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.260 
and you're gonna see another little
robot<00:01:13.690> here<00:01:13.960> looks<00:01:14.680> like<00:01:14.830> it's<00:01:14.950> peaceful<00:01:15.270> come

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
robot here looks like it's peaceful come

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.180 
robot here looks like it's peaceful come
up<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.480> this<00:01:16.570> tree<00:01:16.840> once<00:01:17.710> you're<00:01:17.830> at<00:01:17.920> the<00:01:17.950> tree

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
up to this tree once you're at the tree

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.910 
up to this tree once you're at the tree
just<00:01:18.400> hop<00:01:19.270> on<00:01:19.480> over<00:01:19.690> it's<00:01:20.200> basically<00:01:20.470> kind<00:01:20.800> of

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
just hop on over it's basically kind of

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.230 
just hop on over it's basically kind of
slide<00:01:21.100> over<00:01:21.400> until<00:01:21.670> you<00:01:21.790> get<00:01:21.910> to<00:01:22.000> write<00:01:22.150> about

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
slide over until you get to write about

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.420 
slide over until you get to write about
their<00:01:22.510> I<00:01:22.750> should<00:01:23.080> be<00:01:23.170> your<00:01:23.290> path<00:01:23.500> and<00:01:23.800> then

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
their I should be your path and then

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.820 
their I should be your path and then
this<00:01:24.940> one<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.300> can<00:01:25.330> just<00:01:25.570> move<00:01:26.110> on<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.380> up<00:01:26.590> and

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
this one you can just move on and up and

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.770 
this one you can just move on and up and
then<00:01:27.310> I<00:01:27.430> found<00:01:27.700> its<00:01:27.970> best<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.360> just<00:01:28.450> jump<00:01:28.690> right

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
then I found its best to just jump right

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.380 
then I found its best to just jump right
onto<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.320> thing<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.800> then<00:01:30.610> jump<00:01:30.970> up<00:01:31.090> again

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
onto this thing and then jump up again

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.300 
onto this thing and then jump up again
and<00:01:31.570> then<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:32.500> usually<00:01:32.800> just<00:01:32.830> go<00:01:33.070> around<00:01:33.130> the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
and then I usually just go around the

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.100 
and then I usually just go around the
side<00:01:33.430> and<00:01:33.670> we<00:01:34.180> are<00:01:34.450> up<00:01:34.810> here<00:01:35.080> easy<00:01:35.530> as<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:37.110> now

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
side and we are up here easy as that now

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.720 
side and we are up here easy as that now
once<00:01:38.350> you're<00:01:38.500> up<00:01:38.590> here<00:01:38.620> you'll<00:01:39.220> want<00:01:39.490> to<00:01:39.550> click

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
once you're up here you'll want to click

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.020 
once you're up here you'll want to click
it<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.320> you're<00:01:41.320> no<00:01:41.470> longer<00:01:41.620> able<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.980> me<00:01:42.460> but

run down to it from the for Ford Garnock

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.589 
run down to it from the for Ford Garnock
so<00:03:25.560> once<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:25.859> get<00:03:25.949> to<00:03:26.010> it<00:03:26.250> just<00:03:26.519> run<00:03:26.790> across<00:03:26.910> on

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
so once you get to it just run across on

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.449 
so once you get to it just run across on
the<00:03:28.049> lower<00:03:28.199> side<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.919> run<00:03:29.099> across<00:03:29.190> the
