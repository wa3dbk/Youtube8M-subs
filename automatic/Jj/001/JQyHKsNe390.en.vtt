to make some builds much more creative I
really<00:02:05.450> like<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.630> couple<00:02:06.590> of<00:02:06.650> the<00:02:06.710> bugs<00:02:06.920> that

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
really like that couple of the bugs that

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.929 
really like that couple of the bugs that
were<00:02:07.130> fixed<00:02:07.430> redstone<00:02:08.329> lamp<00:02:09.099> lag<00:02:10.099> has<00:02:10.700> been

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:10.939 
were fixed redstone lamp lag has been

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:13.360 
were fixed redstone lamp lag has been
reduced<00:02:11.689> before<00:02:12.379> if<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.799> were<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.980> make<00:02:13.129> a<00:02:13.159> big

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
reduced before if you were to make a big

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.290 
reduced before if you were to make a big
contraption<00:02:13.819> out<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.209> redstone<00:02:14.480> lamps<00:02:15.230> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
contraption out of redstone lamps and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.300 
contraption out of redstone lamps and
use<00:02:17.300> them<00:02:17.540> they<00:02:18.110> would<00:02:18.349> almost<00:02:18.830> freeze<00:02:19.190> your

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
use them they would almost freeze your

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.990 
use them they would almost freeze your
game<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.819> you

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
game if you

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.120 
game if you
did<00:02:20.120> something<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.600> complex<00:02:21.080> wheat<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:21.770> no

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
did something to complex wheat is no

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.010 
did something to complex wheat is no
longer<00:02:22.370> depleted<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.120> creative<00:02:23.570> mode<00:02:23.600> when

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
longer depleted in creative mode when

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.950 
longer depleted in creative mode when
you<00:02:24.140> use<00:02:24.320> it<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.620> animals<00:02:25.370> so<00:02:26.360> before<00:02:26.510> when<00:02:26.870> you

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
you use it on animals so before when you

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.180 
you use it on animals so before when you
had<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.170> put<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:27.380> whole<00:02:27.560> stack<00:02:27.800> and<00:02:27.920> there<00:02:28.040> now

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
had to put a whole stack and there now

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.280 
had to put a whole stack and there now
you<00:02:28.250> can<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.720> continuously<00:02:29.720> use<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.140> on

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you can just continuously use it on

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.260 
you can just continuously use it on
animals<00:02:30.710> Jeb<00:02:31.370> fix<00:02:31.610> the<00:02:31.730> crash<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.150> would

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
animals Jeb fix the crash that would

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.330 
animals Jeb fix the crash that would
happen<00:02:32.390> when<00:02:32.660> you're<00:02:32.780> above<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.410> old<00:02:33.950> height

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
happen when you're above the old height

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.920 
happen when you're above the old height
level<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.850> you<00:02:34.910> were<00:02:35.000> trying<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.300> stack<00:02:35.600> signs

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
level and you were trying to stack signs

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.240 
level and you were trying to stack signs
like<00:02:36.260> this<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:37.190> it<00:02:37.280> does<00:02:37.430> not<00:02:37.550> do<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.910> anymore

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
like this so it does not do that anymore

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.310 
like this so it does not do that anymore
Jeb<00:02:40.250> also<00:02:40.610> fixed<00:02:41.000> the<00:02:41.060> caves<00:02:41.720> not<00:02:41.990> spawning

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
Jeb also fixed the caves not spawning

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.140 
Jeb also fixed the caves not spawning
because<00:02:42.920> in<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.160> last<00:02:43.250> lap<00:02:43.520> set<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:43.850> was<00:02:44.000> no

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
because in the last lap set there was no

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.800 
because in the last lap set there was no
caves<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:45.080> also<00:02:45.260> fixed<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:46.010> reduced<00:02:46.820> redstone

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
caves he also fixed a reduced redstone

leg overall on the new map format and he
also<00:02:51.260> fixed<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.680> binary<00:02:51.890> issue<00:02:52.400> making

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
