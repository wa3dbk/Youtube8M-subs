00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
thing about the Tesla is how efficient

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.659 
thing about the Tesla is how efficient
it<00:05:09.740> is<00:05:09.860> now<00:05:10.580> that<00:05:11.390> you<00:05:11.720> know<00:05:11.750> the<00:05:12.590> average<00:05:13.280> car

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
true benefit for the environment really

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.920 
true benefit for the environment really
is

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:37.930 
is

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:39.689 
is
we're<00:05:38.139> not<00:05:38.229> going<00:05:38.259> to<00:05:38.410> waste<00:05:38.530> a<00:05:38.710> bit<00:05:38.860> okay<00:05:39.550> now

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
we're not going to waste a bit okay now

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:45.400 
Tesla what's under the hood well it's

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.379 
Tesla what's under the hood well it's
all<00:05:45.759> electric<00:05:46.210> there's<00:05:46.750> no<00:05:46.990> gas<00:05:47.699> it's<00:05:48.699> goes

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
all electric there's no gas it's goes

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.570 
all electric there's no gas it's goes
zero<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:49.780> 60<00:05:50.229> quicker<00:05:50.470> than<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.710> Ferrari<00:05:50.889> 430

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
zero to 60 quicker than a Ferrari 430

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.279 
zero to 60 quicker than a Ferrari 430
and<00:05:51.910> it's<00:05:52.030> twice<00:05:52.300> as<00:05:52.330> efficient<00:05:52.840> as<00:05:52.900> a<00:05:52.960> Prius

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
sports car like the Tesla there is

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.370 
sports car like the Tesla there is
always<00:06:00.460> something<00:06:01.030> that<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:01.900> can<00:06:02.110> choose

always something that you can choose
that's<00:06:02.919> more<00:06:03.100> eco-friendly<00:06:03.400> so<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.360> clothes

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
that's more eco-friendly so the clothes

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.080 
that's more eco-friendly so the clothes
you<00:06:04.750> wear<00:06:04.900> the<00:06:05.259> car<00:06:05.530> you<00:06:05.710> drive<00:06:05.979> the<00:06:06.610> food<00:06:06.880> you

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:23.979 
well I'm basically Carlos because I live

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:26.430 
well I'm basically Carlos because I live

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.270 
footprint type of people there up

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.999

because<00:06:31.300> it's<00:06:31.750> great<00:06:32.020> mass<00:06:32.229> transit<00:06:32.680> and

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:33.009 
because it's great mass transit and

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.189 
because it's great mass transit and
that's<00:06:33.190> what<00:06:33.340> la<00:06:33.610> really<00:06:33.940> lacks<00:06:34.240> an<00:06:34.660> effective

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 
that's what la really lacks an effective

that's what la really lacks an effective
mass<00:06:35.470> transit<00:06:35.919> system<00:06:36.099> can<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:36.610> imagine<00:06:36.699> if

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
mass transit system can you imagine if

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.279 
mass transit system can you imagine if
there<00:06:37.120> was<00:06:37.180> a<00:06:37.270> subway<00:06:37.660> here<00:06:37.840> there<00:06:37.990> be<00:06:38.020> no

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:38.289 
there was a subway here there be no

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.020 
there was a subway here there be no
traffic<00:06:38.560> jams<00:06:38.740> gonna<00:06:39.460> be<00:06:39.639> a<00:06:39.669> lot<00:06:39.849> less

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
traffic jams gonna be a lot less

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.850 
traffic jams gonna be a lot less
pollution<00:06:40.419> so<00:06:41.259> you're<00:06:41.560> not<00:06:41.620> going<00:06:41.740> to<00:06:41.830> believe

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
pollution so you're not going to believe

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.170 
pollution so you're not going to believe
this<00:06:42.039> but<00:06:42.159> on<00:06:42.370> the<00:06:42.490> way<00:06:42.580> here<00:06:42.789> tonight<00:06:43.030> the

walk<00:06:49.030> like<00:06:49.300> the<00:06:49.419> last<00:06:49.630> two<00:06:49.810> blocks<00:06:50.080> because<00:06:50.560> it

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
walk like the last two blocks because it

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.230 
walk like the last two blocks because it
was<00:06:50.740> literally<00:06:51.099> quicker<00:06:51.490> to<00:06:51.669> get<00:06:51.820> here<00:06:52.060> to
