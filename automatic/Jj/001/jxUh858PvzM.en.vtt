some<00:00:42.450> short<00:00:42.750> bit<00:00:42.989> stuff<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.530> finally<00:00:44.219> got<00:00:44.399> an

some short bit stuff and finally got an

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.580 
some short bit stuff and finally got an
errant<00:00:44.820> shot<00:00:45.059> from<00:00:45.360> saver<00:00:45.960> that<00:00:46.379> brought

about<00:00:46.620> his<00:00:46.980> downfall<00:00:47.250> so<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.239> bowling<00:00:48.629> was

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
about his downfall so the bowling was

about his downfall so the bowling was
was<00:00:49.530> good<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> long<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.360> problem<00:00:51.989> is

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
was good for a long time the problem is

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260 
was good for a long time the problem is
that<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.860> know<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.190> weren't<00:00:53.610> tested<00:00:54.090> by<00:00:54.239> a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
that you know they weren't tested by a

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.330 
that you know they weren't tested by a
really<00:00:54.629> strong<00:00:54.930> batting<00:00:55.320> line-up<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.160> New

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
really strong batting line-up with New

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.490 
really strong batting line-up with New
Zealand<00:00:56.370> plus<00:00:57.270> conditions<00:00:57.930> were<00:00:58.079> very<00:00:58.140> much

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
Zealand plus conditions were very much

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.830 
Zealand plus conditions were very much
in<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> first<00:00:59.340> two<00:00:59.579> tests<00:00:59.850> were<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:00.480> much<00:01:00.629> in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
in the first two tests were very much in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.660 
in the first two tests were very much in
favor<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> bowlers<00:01:01.469> suddenly<00:01:02.430> here

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
favor of the bowlers suddenly here

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.219 
favor of the bowlers suddenly here
you've<00:01:02.879> got<00:01:02.910> too<00:01:03.359> much<00:01:03.570> better<00:01:03.870> batting

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
you've got too much better batting

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.359 
you've got too much better batting
conditions<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.860> you've<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> much

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
conditions and you've got a much

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.219 
conditions and you've got a much
stronger<00:01:05.670> batting<00:01:06.150> lineup<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.020> was

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
stronger batting lineup so this was

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.830 
stronger batting lineup so this was
always<00:01:07.439> going<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.250> huge<00:01:08.610> test<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.150> the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
always going to be a huge test for the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.130 
always going to be a huge test for the
Australian<00:01:10.439> bowlers<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.450> guess<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
Australian bowlers and and I guess it

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.600 
Australian bowlers and and I guess it
was<00:01:14.270> indicative<00:01:15.830> coming<00:01:16.830> up<00:01:16.920> against<00:01:17.159> drivin

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
was indicative coming up against drivin

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.520 
was indicative coming up against drivin
and<00:01:17.790> drivin<00:01:17.820> had<00:01:18.479> some<00:01:18.720> periods<00:01:19.200> where<00:01:19.409> he

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and drivin had some periods where he

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.800 
and drivin had some periods where he
really<00:01:19.890> struggled<00:01:20.490> once<00:01:21.090> again<00:01:21.240> particularly

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
really struggled once again particularly

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.170 
really struggled once again particularly
pattinson<00:01:22.530> Hilfenhaus<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.670> thought<00:01:23.909> bold

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
pattinson Hilfenhaus I thought bold

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.109 
pattinson Hilfenhaus I thought bold
pretty<00:01:24.900> well<00:01:25.170> but<00:01:26.130> Dravid<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.000> ability

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
pretty well but Dravid has that ability

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
pretty well but Dravid has that ability
to<00:01:28.009> struggle<00:01:29.009> through<00:01:29.040> those<00:01:29.400> tough<00:01:29.759> periods

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
to struggle through those tough periods

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140 
to struggle through those tough periods
and<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.630> period<00:01:31.380> when<00:01:31.680> he's<00:01:31.950> really<00:01:32.520> battling

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and a period when he's really battling

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.149 
and a period when he's really battling
and<00:01:33.390> he<00:01:33.840> comes<00:01:34.079> out<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.409> other<00:01:34.439> side<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.070> then

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
and he comes out the other side and then

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.880 
and he comes out the other side and then
suddenly<00:01:35.369> play<00:01:35.700> some<00:01:35.970> good<00:01:36.119> shots<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:37.590> then

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
suddenly play some good shots and then

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.210 
suddenly play some good shots and then
you<00:01:38.070> had<00:01:38.250> ten<00:01:38.939> dalka<00:01:39.390> who<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.229> know<00:01:40.320> before<00:01:40.890> T

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
you had ten dalka who you know before T

he doesn't look the same sort of player
it<00:01:46.240> doesn't<00:01:46.600> look<00:01:46.720> natural<00:01:46.930> when<00:01:47.320> he's<00:01:47.500> doing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
it doesn't look natural when he's doing

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580 
it doesn't look natural when he's doing

know that he is and he looks a far
different<00:01:55.119> player<00:01:55.509> so<00:01:55.930> this<00:01:56.140> this<00:01:56.560> was<00:01:56.770> always

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
different player so this this was always

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.499 
different player so this this was always
going<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.520> be<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.759> big<00:01:57.939> test<00:01:58.180> for<00:01:58.329> the

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
going to be the big test for the

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.590 
going to be the big test for the
Australian<00:01:59.049> attack<00:01:59.350> I<00:01:59.649> think<00:02:00.220> of<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.390> bowl

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
Australian attack I think of the bowl

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.350 
Australian attack I think of the bowl
was<00:02:01.810> probably<00:02:02.729> certainly<00:02:03.729> patents<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
was probably certainly patents in the

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.480 
was probably certainly patents in the
best<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:04.929> I<00:02:05.080> think<00:02:05.320> sidled<00:02:05.679> has<00:02:05.920> bowled<00:02:06.250> some

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
best and I think sidled has bowled some

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.729 
best and I think sidled has bowled some
very<00:02:06.700> good<00:02:06.880> spells<00:02:07.210> as<00:02:07.360> well<00:02:07.600> and<00:02:07.960> it's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739 
very good spells as well and it's

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.650 
very good spells as well and it's
probably<00:02:09.069> easy<00:02:09.310> with<00:02:09.610> hindsight<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.239> given

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
probably easy with hindsight but given

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.620 
probably easy with hindsight but given
the<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.370> Indian<00:02:12.370> batting<00:02:12.610> lineup<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.360> you

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
the the Indian batting lineup and you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.120 
the the Indian batting lineup and you
know<00:02:13.870> that<00:02:14.200> Australia's<00:02:14.590> bowlers<00:02:14.890> haven't

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
know that Australia's bowlers haven't

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770 
know that Australia's bowlers haven't
been<00:02:15.220> tested<00:02:15.400> was<00:02:15.790> was<00:02:16.090> there<00:02:16.269> more<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.540> a<00:02:16.600> case

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
been tested was was there more of a case

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.280 
been tested was was there more of a case
for<00:02:17.049> including<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.830> around<00:02:18.160> anything<00:02:18.430> cool

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
for including the around anything cool

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.970 
for including the around anything cool
um<00:02:20.290> I<00:02:20.620> mean<00:02:21.489> I<00:02:21.790> really<00:02:22.299> think<00:02:22.690> that<00:02:22.840> four<00:02:23.739> bowls

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
um I mean I really think that four bowls

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.770 
um I mean I really think that four bowls
are<00:02:24.310> going<00:02:24.489> to<00:02:24.549> do<00:02:24.670> most<00:02:24.880> of<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.269> bulk<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
are going to do most of the bulk of the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.220 
are going to do most of the bulk of the
work<00:02:25.959> work<00:02:26.489> a<00:02:27.489> place<00:02:28.450> where<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:29.110> you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
work work a place where I think you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.900 
work work a place where I think you
might<00:02:29.470> need<00:02:29.680> five<00:02:29.950> bowls<00:02:30.220> is<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.459> bloke<00:02:30.790> I've

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
might need five bowls is a bloke I've

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.699 
might need five bowls is a bloke I've
always<00:02:31.090> thought<00:02:31.330> out<00:02:31.480> laterz<00:02:31.840> is<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.319> idea

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
always thought out laterz is the idea

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.000 
always thought out laterz is the idea
was<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.069> classic<00:02:33.580> place<00:02:33.880> for<00:02:34.319> three<00:02:35.319> quickies

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
was a classic place for three quickies

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.190 
was a classic place for three quickies
and<00:02:36.040> two<00:02:36.430> spinners<00:02:36.760> so<00:02:37.269> perhaps<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
and two spinners so perhaps the

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.050 
and two spinners so perhaps the
all-rounder<00:02:38.680> there<00:02:40.620> now<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> I<00:02:42.519> think<00:02:42.849> it<00:02:42.940> was

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
all-rounder there now I I think it was

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.410 
all-rounder there now I I think it was
the<00:02:43.180> right<00:02:43.209> way<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.599> go<00:02:44.549> but<00:02:45.549> they<00:02:45.700> may<00:02:45.970> find

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
the right way to go but they may find

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.569 
the right way to go but they may find
now<00:02:46.750> with<00:02:47.080> this<00:02:47.230> Indian<00:02:47.680> batting<00:02:47.890> lineup<00:02:48.250> if

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:48.579 
now with this Indian batting lineup if

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.849 
now with this Indian batting lineup if
it<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:48.910> if<00:02:49.299> they're<00:02:49.989> in<00:02:50.140> good<00:02:50.380> form<00:02:50.680> in

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
it is if they're in good form in

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.550 
it is if they're in good form in
Australia<00:02:51.519> then<00:02:52.090> maybe<00:02:52.870> they<00:02:53.079> do<00:02:53.140> have<00:02:53.440> to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
Australia then maybe they do have to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.569 
Australia then maybe they do have to
think<00:02:53.769> about<00:02:53.859> the<00:02:54.220> five<00:02:54.459> bowlers<00:02:55.859> but<00:02:56.859> I<00:02:57.070> think

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
think about the five bowlers but I think

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:58.800 
think about the five bowlers but I think
it<00:02:57.640> was<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.760> right<00:02:57.850> move<00:02:58.120> coming<00:02:58.450> into<00:02:58.600> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
it was the right move coming into the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.840 
it was the right move coming into the
Melbourne<00:02:59.140> test<00:02:59.350> and<00:02:59.560> earlier<00:03:00.310> today<00:03:00.489> and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
Melbourne test and earlier today and

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.539 
Melbourne test and earlier today and
yesterday<00:03:01.530> India's<00:03:02.530> bowling<00:03:03.040> line-up<00:03:03.220> had

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
yesterday India's bowling line-up had

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.160 
yesterday India's bowling line-up had
been<00:03:03.730> spoken<00:03:04.359> about<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.780> being<00:03:04.900> their

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
been spoken about as being their

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.599 
been spoken about as being their
weakness<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.799> were<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.100> impressed<00:03:06.340> with

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
weakness and were you impressed with

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.520 
weakness and were you impressed with
with<00:03:07.060> how<00:03:07.359> they<00:03:07.510> performance<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.109> think<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
with how they performance I think the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.110 
with how they performance I think the
good<00:03:08.709> news<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.220> India<00:03:09.549> as<00:03:09.730> far<00:03:09.970> as<00:03:10.030> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
good news for India as far as the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.620 
good news for India as far as the
bowling<00:03:10.480> was<00:03:10.630> concerned<00:03:11.190> I<00:03:12.420> expected<00:03:13.420> yard

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
bowling was concerned I expected yard

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.660 
bowling was concerned I expected yard
out<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:14.079> quite<00:03:14.350> well<00:03:14.380> here<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.980> he's<00:03:15.459> been

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
out to do quite well here and he's been

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.640 
out to do quite well here and he's been
impressive<00:03:15.819> but<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:16.720> think<00:03:17.019> the<00:03:17.139> really<00:03:17.380> big

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
impressive but I think the really big

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.740 
impressive but I think the really big
news<00:03:17.889> for<00:03:18.130> India<00:03:18.459> was<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.940> form<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.269> czar<00:03:19.510> here

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
news for India was the form of czar here

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.110 
news for India was the form of czar here
and<00:03:20.319> particularly<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.370> second<00:03:21.730> morning

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
and particularly the second morning

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.020 
and particularly the second morning
because<00:03:22.930> he<00:03:23.109> he<00:03:23.380> bowled<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.950> lot<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.549> first<00:03:24.790> day

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
because he he bowled a lot the first day

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.280 
because he he bowled a lot the first day
and<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.239> thought<00:03:25.450> he<00:03:25.600> got<00:03:25.720> better<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.230> better

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
and I thought he got better and better

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.259 
and I thought he got better and better
as<00:03:26.620> he<00:03:26.739> went<00:03:26.920> along<00:03:27.010> particularly<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.940> spell

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
as he went along particularly that spell

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.059 
as he went along particularly that spell
worried<00:03:28.450> he<00:03:28.959> picked<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.319> the<00:03:29.380> two<00:03:29.650> wickets<00:03:29.950> in

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
worried he picked up the two wickets in

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.509 
worried he picked up the two wickets in
a<00:03:30.190> row<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:31.239> delivery<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.840> Hussey<00:03:32.519> suddenly

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
a row the delivery to Hussey suddenly

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.250 
a row the delivery to Hussey suddenly
looked<00:03:34.389> like<00:03:34.540> he'd<00:03:34.690> turned<00:03:34.900> back<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.109> clock

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
looked like he'd turned back the clock

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.610 
looked like he'd turned back the clock
10<00:03:35.950> years<00:03:36.280> but<00:03:37.090> he<00:03:37.540> then<00:03:37.780> at<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.230> end<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.500> the

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
10 years but he then at the end of the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.500 
10 years but he then at the end of the
day<00:03:38.799> he<00:03:39.010> was<00:03:39.100> looking<00:03:39.430> pretty<00:03:39.459> stiff<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.239> sore

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
day he was looking pretty stiff and sore

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.270 
day he was looking pretty stiff and sore
in<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:40.900> field<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.500> thought<00:03:41.680> it's<00:03:42.069> going<00:03:42.190> to

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
in the field and I thought it's going to

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.860 
in the field and I thought it's going to

be interesting to see how he comes up on
the<00:03:43.930> second<00:03:44.350> day<00:03:44.380> well<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.130> way<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.549> evolved

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
the second day well the way that evolved

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.550 
the second day well the way that evolved
on<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.150> second<00:03:46.510> morning<00:03:46.810> was<00:03:46.930> just<00:03:47.170> brilliant

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
on the second morning was just brilliant

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.350

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
because if he's informed if he's fit he

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.480 
because if he's informed if he's fit he
he<00:03:53.230> makes<00:03:53.470> a<00:03:53.590> huge<00:03:53.800> difference<00:03:54.160> to<00:03:54.370> that

bowling<00:03:55.030> attack<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:55.900> think<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.230> way<00:03:56.410> bold

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
bowling attack and I think the way bold

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.130 
bowling attack and I think the way bold
on<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.190> second<00:03:57.580> morning<00:03:58.000> is<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.750> best<00:03:58.960> news

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
on the second morning is the best news

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.200 
on the second morning is the best news
that<00:03:59.200> India<00:03:59.680> could<00:03:59.860> have<00:04:00.010> had<00:04:00.190> and<00:04:00.700> what<00:04:01.060> about

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
that India could have had and what about

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.710 
that India could have had and what about
Ashwin<00:04:02.250> he<00:04:03.250> probably<00:04:03.790> didn't<00:04:04.210> have<00:04:04.330> me<00:04:04.510> as

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
Ashwin he probably didn't have me as

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.420 
Ashwin he probably didn't have me as
much<00:04:04.870> of<00:04:05.050> an<00:04:05.140> impact<00:04:05.350> as<00:04:05.530> he<00:04:05.590> as<00:04:06.010> he<00:04:06.130> might<00:04:06.310> him

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
much of an impact as he as he might him

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.430 
much of an impact as he as he might him
on<00:04:06.700> some<00:04:06.880> other<00:04:07.000> wickets<00:04:07.330> I<00:04:07.510> thought<00:04:08.290> he

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
on some other wickets I thought he

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.260 
on some other wickets I thought he
bought<00:04:08.560> extremely<00:04:09.130> well<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.970> fact<00:04:10.180> that

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
bought extremely well and the fact that

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.000 
bought extremely well and the fact that
he<00:04:10.390> got<00:04:10.420> quite<00:04:10.750> a<00:04:10.900> lot<00:04:11.050> of<00:04:11.080> turn<00:04:11.380> in<00:04:11.590> Melbourne

he got quite a lot of turn in Melbourne

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.930 
he got quite a lot of turn in Melbourne
is<00:04:12.190> is<00:04:12.730> impressive<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:14.410> also<00:04:14.710> I<00:04:15.280> like<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.790> way

is is impressive and also I like the way

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.130 
is is impressive and also I like the way
that<00:04:16.120> he<00:04:16.209> finished<00:04:16.540> off<00:04:16.630> the<00:04:16.690> innings

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140

have to drag it from white outside

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.409 
have to drag it from white outside
off-stump<00:04:35.770> that's<00:04:36.490> what<00:04:36.700> caused<00:04:36.880> him<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.180> miss

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
off-stump that's what caused him to miss

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.180 
off-stump that's what caused him to miss
hit<00:04:37.600> it<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.870> he<00:04:37.990> got<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.290> wicker<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.070> he

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
hit it and he got the wicker and then he

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.730 
hit it and he got the wicker and then he
polished<00:04:39.490> off<00:04:39.669> line<00:04:39.880> at<00:04:40.150> the<00:04:40.270> end<00:04:40.450> so<00:04:40.960> I<00:04:41.500> I

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
polished off line at the end so I I

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.180 
polished off line at the end so I I
think<00:04:42.630> India<00:04:43.630> must<00:04:44.140> be<00:04:44.440> feeling<00:04:44.890> a<00:04:45.070> lot

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
think India must be feeling a lot

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.159 
think India must be feeling a lot
happier<00:04:45.250> after<00:04:45.970> that<00:04:46.330> first<00:04:46.600> things<00:04:46.900> with<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
happier after that first things with the

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:48.990 
happier after that first things with the
way<00:04:47.320> they<00:04:47.500> are<00:04:47.620> attacked<00:04:47.919> as<00:04:48.220> performed<00:04:48.700> by<00:04:48.730> I

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
way they are attacked as performed by I

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.480 
way they are attacked as performed by I
think<00:04:49.240> they've<00:04:49.419> done<00:04:49.570> pretty<00:04:49.840> well<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:51.010> just

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
think they've done pretty well and just

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.940 
think they've done pretty well and just
finally<00:04:51.669> on<00:04:52.210> Australia's<00:04:52.960> batting<00:04:53.560> yesterday

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
finally on Australia's batting yesterday

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.090 
finally on Australia's batting yesterday
and<00:04:54.850> into<00:04:55.060> today<00:04:55.330> ed<00:04:56.169> cowan<00:04:56.470> certainly<00:04:56.890> played

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
and into today ed cowan certainly played

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.670 
and into today ed cowan certainly played
a<00:04:57.130> test<00:04:57.640> style<00:04:58.180> inning<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:58.720> what<00:04:59.350> did<00:04:59.470> you<00:04:59.560> make

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
a test style inning so what did you make

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.469 
a test style inning so what did you make
of<00:04:59.710> the<00:04:59.890> way<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.160> rest<00:05:00.340> of<00:05:00.490> the<00:05:00.610> top<00:05:01.090> order<00:05:01.270> and

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 
of the way the rest of the top order and

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:03.360 
of the way the rest of the top order and
middle-order<00:05:01.720> played<00:05:02.080> I<00:05:02.410> think<00:05:02.860> they<00:05:03.220> would

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
middle-order played I think they would

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.100 
middle-order played I think they would
have<00:05:03.460> been<00:05:03.550> disappointed<00:05:03.729> to<00:05:04.360> have<00:05:04.450> got<00:05:04.690> into

have been disappointed to have got into

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.110 
have been disappointed to have got into
a<00:05:05.140> strong<00:05:05.560> position<00:05:05.800> and<00:05:06.340> particularly<00:05:06.880> when

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
a strong position and particularly when

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.030

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
you know that the hard work obviously

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.400 
you know that the hard work obviously
was<00:05:09.520> was<00:05:09.910> first<00:05:10.180> thing<00:05:10.510> with<00:05:10.810> the<00:05:10.930> overcast

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410

looked at the pitch in your thought and

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.190 
looked at the pitch in your thought and
this<00:05:15.640> is<00:05:15.790> a<00:05:15.820> pretty<00:05:16.030> decent<00:05:16.510> pitch<00:05:16.750> and

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
this is a pretty decent pitch and

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.990 
this is a pretty decent pitch and
Australia<00:05:18.040> had<00:05:18.130> got<00:05:18.310> themselves<00:05:18.520> into<00:05:18.910> a

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
Australia had got themselves into a

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.880 
Australia had got themselves into a
strong<00:05:19.360> position<00:05:19.570> so<00:05:20.350> I<00:05:20.380> think<00:05:20.500> they<00:05:20.740> would

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:20.890 
strong position so I think they would

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.330 
strong position so I think they would
have<00:05:20.979> been<00:05:21.130> disappointed<00:05:21.760> too<00:05:23.130> to<00:05:24.130> have<00:05:24.310> that

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
have been disappointed too to have that

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.730 
have been disappointed too to have that
bit<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.669> a<00:05:24.880> middle-order<00:05:25.300> collapse<00:05:25.780> then<00:05:26.530> they

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
bit of a middle-order collapse then they

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.590 
bit of a middle-order collapse then they
got<00:05:26.950> out<00:05:27.100> of<00:05:27.280> they<00:05:27.669> got<00:05:27.850> out<00:05:28.000> of<00:05:28.120> strife<00:05:28.390> and

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
got out of they got out of strife and

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.190 
got out of they got out of strife and
got<00:05:28.780> a<00:05:28.890> reasonable<00:05:29.890> score<00:05:30.160> but<00:05:31.000> you<00:05:31.930> know<00:05:32.050> if

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 
got a reasonable score but you know if

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.950 
got a reasonable score but you know if
the<00:05:32.380> Indian<00:05:32.770> batsmen<00:05:33.280> can<00:05:33.520> build<00:05:34.419> up<00:05:34.600> at<00:05:34.810> a

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
the Indian batsmen can build up at a

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.260 
the Indian batsmen can build up at a
decent<00:05:35.100> first-innings<00:05:36.100> lead<00:05:36.100> then<00:05:36.910> I<00:05:37.000> see<00:05:37.240> a

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
decent first-innings lead then I see a

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.629 
decent first-innings lead then I see a
bit<00:05:37.510> of<00:05:37.540> trouble<00:05:37.720> ahead<00:05:37.960> from<00:05:38.260> strike

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
bit of trouble ahead from strike

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:40.279 
bit of trouble ahead from strike
