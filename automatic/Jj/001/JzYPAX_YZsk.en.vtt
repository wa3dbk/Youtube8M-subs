00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.950
 and well hello to all what kisses 35 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.750
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.700
 little video fishing tips with a 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.960
 small video on the brake adjustment 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.150
 so I'm going to show you how 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.220
 preset your brake so 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.200
 effectively ferrying the fish is also 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.769
 in order to handle most of 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.120
 fighting then of course this method is going 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.370
 allow you to adjust roughly 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.870
 your brake when fighting or when 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.519
 the fishing action according to the lure 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.660
 that you will use depending on the 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:45.820
 fish that you will have at the end of the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.160
 line it will have to fine tune this setting 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.020
 by loosening or tightening a small 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.950
 little your reel 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.140
 these two techniques that can 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.239
 apply both in casting and in 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.280
 spinning as well in boat as in 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.079
 board the only thing you're going to have 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.730
 need it is either a friend who will hold 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.020
 your them be a branch in 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.869
 which you are going to hang your 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.640
 lure then i will introduce you to the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.020
 method is for that I'll have to 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.649
 start by hanging my theirs in a 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.039
 tree went on the small branch 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.060
 there it will be well here nickel so I 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.830
 go away a little bit and like you 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.700
 see 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.649
 that's it the coils the brake is 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.160
 completely loosen so the first 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.569
 step already it will consist of putting to 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.599
 make an angle actually between your 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.830
 fluid and your cane 90 degrees a 

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:32.080
 times these times when it's going to be done 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.929
 you 're going to grip your brake so 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.250
 that the can is well in tension 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.990
 so there for example she is in tension 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.200
 but not enough we go there narrowed a 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.149
 little bit so here I managed well 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.640
 my brake see my cane and in tension 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.429
 my son is at 90 degrees to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.729
 my heel to my forearm and see if 

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:53.349
 I'm drawing here reels so that's it 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.810
 allows me what it actually allows me 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:58.060
 to shoe one to make a shoe 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.890
 powerful and well supported and at the same time 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.200
 to be able to maintain a good tension 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.110
 on the fish without it taking 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.470
 two sons after if the fish makes a 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.149
 rush 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.959
 he can take a son if you see if 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:12.910
 I go back here if I go back and 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.550
 just bah the reel lets 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.700
 wire so I'll put you back a 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.610
 second loose focus gets its share all 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.220
 alone so I'm going to start tightening 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:27.730
 my brake to put a good tension 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.320
 with the cane at 90 degrees so see the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.200
 end I have a good tension but that's 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.620
 reels still a little 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.050
 so I'll tighten up and the it 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.120
 stops from reels and there is a 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.910
 good tension the net at 90 degrees eh 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.800
 yes if I shoot a body hop salsa comes 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.870
 so the fish can put a rush by 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:46.610
 example a pike of 60-70 can 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.410
 put a rush without it pulling him 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.790
 too much on the figure and yet I have a 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.310
 good tension and I can still 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.120
 really press it pressed when 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.130
 jeweler's iron if i make makan folds 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.620
 suddenly but stops in tension and 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.150
 once his intentions these blocks and 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.319
 we're going to hang on to it, you can 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.150
 approach your soul are here by 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:11.329
 example here is nickel the loop she 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:17.560
 pass or have you pic it yeah good 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:19.390
 well go ahead it's good yeah that's nickel 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.670
 so much so your son 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.380
 but soon in heels that's how 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.579
 so here you can do a little bit 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.430
 go away again a little like that you have 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.440
 of the margin that's where you can straighten 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.639
 still a little bit you canes the summer is 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:39.709
 blocked and there is a cost for this is my the 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:41.060
 technical she sees the tension and yeah 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.100
 were still behind you still have some 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.870
 jus to support you can put back the 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.340
 intentions you can tighten a whole 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.370
 little bit to prevent this sort of thing 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:52.700
 only here and so here if you shoot if you 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.510
 draw back is nickel So there will 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.010
 better tuned so I'll take this 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.299
 angle of view so that you can well 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.190
 see what I explained to you at 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.660
 time we thought cinnamon and well 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.510
 in tension we really see that the 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.400
 cinnamon and well bent the reel only 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.410
 not coils and if I pull a little bit more 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:15.109
 that's reels so like that I 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.709
 block my fish well and if he holds 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:20.709
 even more its meaning part too 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.260
 zhu 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.289
 and 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.030
 1
