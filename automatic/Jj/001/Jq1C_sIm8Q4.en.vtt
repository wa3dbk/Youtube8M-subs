00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hi scholars today we are going to be

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.519 
hi scholars today we are going to be
doing<00:00:04.529> two<00:00:04.980> digit<00:00:05.810> addition<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:06.990> we're<00:00:07.350> going

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
doing two digit addition and we're going

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.100 
doing two digit addition and we're going
to<00:00:07.589> be<00:00:07.770> adding<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.760> certain<00:00:09.450> number<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.719> tens

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
to be adding a certain number of tens

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.990 
to be adding a certain number of tens
but<00:00:10.830> we're<00:00:10.950> going<00:00:11.040> to<00:00:11.099> be<00:00:11.250> doing<00:00:11.490> it<00:00:11.730> using

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
but we're going to be doing it using

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.460 
but we're going to be doing it using
number<00:00:12.960> chips<00:00:13.559> today<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.130> number<00:00:15.000> chips<00:00:15.210> are

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.470 
number chips today and number chips are

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.859 
number chips today and number chips are
simple<00:00:16.470> disks<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.789> we<00:00:18.180> use<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:19.410> show<00:00:20.869> how

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
simple disks that we use to show how

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.019 
simple disks that we use to show how
many<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> place<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.890> have<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.760> call

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
many of a place that we have so we call

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.359 
many of a place that we have so we call
this<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.420> ones<00:00:24.630> place<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.830> call<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
this the ones place we call this the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.279 
this the ones place we call this the
tens<00:00:26.609> place<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.599> we're<00:00:27.750> going<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> do<00:00:28.109> is

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
tens place and all we're going to do is

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.790 
tens place and all we're going to do is
use<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.279> ones<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> tens<00:00:29.970> today<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:31.170> model

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
use the ones in the tens today to model

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.639 
use the ones in the tens today to model
what<00:00:31.920> it<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.160> we<00:00:32.430> are<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:33.149> are<00:00:33.180> doing<00:00:33.600> today<00:00:33.750> so

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
what it is we are we are doing today so

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.130 
what it is we are we are doing today so
this<00:00:34.890> chip<00:00:35.280> will<00:00:35.399> represent<00:00:35.670> 1<00:00:36.059> 1<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.630> this

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this chip will represent 1 1 and this

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.869 
this chip will represent 1 1 and this
chip<00:00:37.410> was<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:38.520> represent<00:00:38.960> 110<00:00:39.960> ok<00:00:40.879> let's

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
chip was it will represent 110 ok let's

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.220 
chip was it will represent 110 ok let's
take<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.090> look<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.450> our<00:00:42.600> first<00:00:42.809> problem<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
take a look at our first problem that

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.220 
take a look at our first problem that
we're<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:43.710> do<00:00:44.129> using<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.180> using<00:00:46.140> these

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we're going to do using this using these

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.010 
we're going to do using this using these
manipulatives<00:00:47.160> we<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:48.030> 42<00:00:48.660> plus<00:00:49.289> 40<00:00:50.570> 42<00:00:51.570> plus

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
manipulatives we have 42 plus 40 42 plus

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.590 
manipulatives we have 42 plus 40 42 plus
40<00:00:52.469> tells<00:00:53.399> us<00:00:53.750> that<00:00:54.750> we<00:00:55.079> have<00:00:55.640> right<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.670> we

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
40 tells us that we have right here we

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.510 
40 tells us that we have right here we
have<00:00:58.100> 4<00:00:59.100> tens<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.850> two<00:01:00.809> ones<00:01:01.160> because<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> is

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
have 4 tens and two ones because this is

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.789 
have 4 tens and two ones because this is
the<00:01:02.670> ones<00:01:02.879> place<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> tens

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the ones place and this is the tens

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:20.360 
the ones place and this is the tens
place<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.960> down<00:01:07.170> four<00:01:08.070> tens

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.830 

and<00:01:21.370> I'm<00:01:22.150> going<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.420> put<00:01:22.630> down<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:24.100> ones

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
and I'm going to put down two ones

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.100 
and I'm going to put down two ones
because<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:25.990> two<00:01:26.140> is<00:01:26.290> in<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.410> ones<00:01:26.500> place

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.340 

okay<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.710> now<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:32.920> have<00:01:33.040> four<00:01:33.550> tens<00:01:33.880> and<00:01:34.350> two

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
okay so now I have four tens and two

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590 
okay so now I have four tens and two
ones<00:01:35.380> and<00:01:36.010> that's<00:01:36.340> where<00:01:36.490> I'm<00:01:36.580> getting<00:01:36.700> my<00:01:36.910> 42

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
ones and that's where I'm getting my 42

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.490 
ones and that's where I'm getting my 42
from<00:01:37.840> four<00:01:38.200> tens<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.770> two<00:01:39.130> ones<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:40.270> I<00:01:40.600> come

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
from four tens and two ones now I come

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.140 
from four tens and two ones now I come
to<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> operation<00:01:42.220> sign<00:01:42.400> which<00:01:42.580> says<00:01:42.760> to<00:01:42.970> add

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
to the operation sign which says to add

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.950 
to the operation sign which says to add
add<00:01:43.600> means<00:01:44.470> to<00:01:44.740> put<00:01:45.040> together<00:01:45.340> okay<00:01:46.150> so<00:01:46.570> I'm

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
add means to put together okay so I'm

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.930 
add means to put together okay so I'm
going<00:01:47.170> to<00:01:47.260> put<00:01:47.440> together<00:01:47.590> four<00:01:48.280> tens<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.760> two

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
going to put together four tens and two

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.510 
going to put together four tens and two
ones<00:01:49.170> 42<00:01:50.250> together<00:01:51.250> with<00:01:51.870> four<00:01:52.870> tens<00:01:53.260> and<00:01:53.590> zero

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
ones 42 together with four tens and zero

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.300 
ones 42 together with four tens and zero
ones<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.750> I'm<00:01:55.810> going<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.140> put<00:01:56.530> four<00:01:57.040> tens

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
ones so I'm going to put four tens

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.470 
ones so I'm going to put four tens
together<00:01:57.790> with<00:02:01.440> 42<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:02.740> I'm<00:02:03.700> adding<00:02:04.180> four

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
together with 42 and I'm adding four

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.590 
together with 42 and I'm adding four
tens<00:02:07.080> to<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.230> tens<00:02:08.440> place<00:02:08.850> because<00:02:09.850> they<00:02:10.360> are

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
tens to the tens place because they are

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.850 
tens to the tens place because they are
tens<00:02:11.350> okay<00:02:12.340> now<00:02:13.330> what<00:02:14.230> is<00:02:14.260> the<00:02:14.470> answer<00:02:14.590> that<00:02:14.800> I

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
tens okay now what is the answer that I

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.910 
tens okay now what is the answer that I
have<00:02:14.950> how<00:02:15.910> many<00:02:15.970> tens<00:02:16.270> do<00:02:16.420> I<00:02:16.480> have<00:02:16.660> one<00:02:17.470> two

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
have how many tens do I have one two

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.020 
have how many tens do I have one two
three<00:02:18.460> four<00:02:18.970> five<00:02:19.390> six<00:02:19.870> seven<00:02:20.500> eight<00:02:20.860> I<00:02:21.430> have

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
three four five six seven eight I have

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.290 
three four five six seven eight I have
eight<00:02:22.300> tens<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.930> how<00:02:23.470> many<00:02:23.650> ones<00:02:23.920> one<00:02:24.820> two

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
eight tens and how many ones one two

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.690 
eight tens and how many ones one two
ones<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.350> I<00:02:26.470> have<00:02:26.590> eight<00:02:26.830> tens<00:02:27.160> and<00:02:27.400> two

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
ones so if I have eight tens and two

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.130 
ones so if I have eight tens and two
ones<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.660> means<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.230> answer<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:31.140> equal

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
ones that means that the answer is equal

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:40.260 
ones that means that the answer is equal
to<00:02:34.709> 82<00:02:36.750> because<00:02:37.980> 8<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.040> in<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.520> tens<00:02:39.640> place

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
to 82 because 8 is in the tens place

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:44.970 
to 82 because 8 is in the tens place
and<00:02:41.520> two<00:02:42.520> is<00:02:42.700> in<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.850> ones<00:02:42.940> place<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:44.230> two

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and two is in the ones place I have two

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.350 
and two is in the ones place I have two
ones<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:46.180> 2<00:02:46.239> is<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.750> ones<00:02:46.780> place<00:02:47.050> and<00:02:47.410> eight

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
ones so 2 is in the ones place and eight

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.710 
ones so 2 is in the ones place and eight
tens<00:02:49.360> so<00:02:50.260> 8<00:02:50.470> is<00:02:50.620> in<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.770> tens<00:02:50.860> place<00:02:51.510> let's<00:02:52.510> try

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
tens so 8 is in the tens place let's try

00:02:52.720 --> 00:03:08.120 
tens so 8 is in the tens place let's try
that<00:02:52.900> with<00:02:53.170> another<00:02:53.860> addition<00:02:54.670> problem

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.690 

we<00:03:08.670> have<00:03:08.850> 50<00:03:09.360> plus<00:03:09.930> 36<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.950> tells<00:03:14.250> me<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
we have 50 plus 36 this tells me that I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.510 
we have 50 plus 36 this tells me that I
have<00:03:14.790> five<00:03:15.300> tens<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.870> zero<00:03:16.470> ones<00:03:16.740> that's<00:03:17.280> what

place<00:04:42.420> value<00:04:43.670> lines<00:04:44.670> eight<00:04:45.450> tens<00:04:46.080> because

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
place value lines eight tens because

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.560 
place value lines eight tens because
this<00:04:47.100> is<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.400> tens<00:04:47.610> place<00:04:47.730> this<00:04:48.090> is<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.330> ones

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
this is the tens place this is the ones

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.630 
this is the tens place this is the ones
and<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.930> tens<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.680> 8<00:04:49.860> is<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:50.040> the<00:04:50.130> tens<00:04:50.220> place

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
and the tens so 8 is in the tens place

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.540 
and the tens so 8 is in the tens place
and<00:04:50.820> six<00:04:51.660> is<00:04:51.810> in<00:04:51.840> the<00:04:52.050> ones<00:04:52.230> place<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:53.370> now<00:04:53.520> I

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
and six is in the ones place and now I

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.140 
and six is in the ones place and now I
can<00:04:53.730> get<00:04:53.910> rid<00:04:54.090> of<00:04:54.120> my<00:04:54.300> lines<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:55.280> 50<00:04:56.280> plus<00:04:56.580> 36

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
can get rid of my lines and 50 plus 36

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.970 
can get rid of my lines and 50 plus 36
equals<00:04:57.360> 86<00:04:58.460> so<00:04:59.460> you<00:04:59.970> can<00:05:00.150> do<00:05:00.380> addition<00:05:01.380> with

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
equals 86 so you can do addition with

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.600 
equals 86 so you can do addition with
two<00:05:02.970> digits<00:05:03.330> I'm<00:05:03.600> using<00:05:04.230> place<00:05:04.950> value<00:05:05.070> chips

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
two digits I'm using place value chips

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.360 
two digits I'm using place value chips
and<00:05:06.170> knowing<00:05:07.170> that<00:05:07.410> when<00:05:07.890> you<00:05:08.040> are<00:05:08.190> talking

and knowing that when you are talking
about<00:05:08.670> adding<00:05:09.600> just<00:05:10.050> a<00:05:10.380> certain<00:05:11.130> number<00:05:11.280> of

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
about adding just a certain number of

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.070 
about adding just a certain number of
tens<00:05:11.760> you're<00:05:12.540> going<00:05:12.900> to<00:05:13.190> take<00:05:14.190> out<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.550> 10<00:05:15.080> the

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
tens you're going to take out the 10 the

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.290 
tens you're going to take out the 10 the
10<00:05:16.260> chips<00:05:16.560> and<00:05:16.800> put<00:05:17.070> down<00:05:17.250> five<00:05:17.729> of<00:05:17.910> them<00:05:18.090> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
10 chips and put down five of them and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.290 
10 chips and put down five of them and
then<00:05:19.080> zero<00:05:19.979> ones<00:05:20.280> and<00:05:20.700> you're<00:05:20.970> going<00:05:21.120> to<00:05:21.150> put

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
then zero ones and you're going to put

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.860 
then zero ones and you're going to put
that<00:05:21.450> together

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
that together

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.550 
that together
with<00:05:22.100> three<00:05:23.100> tens<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.940> six<00:05:24.660> ones<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.350> when

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
with three tens and six ones and when

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.990 
with three tens and six ones and when
you<00:05:25.680> do<00:05:25.860> that<00:05:25.940> you<00:05:26.940> have<00:05:27.840> eight<00:05:28.230> tens<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:29.000> six

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
you do that you have eight tens and six

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.590 
you do that you have eight tens and six
ones<00:05:30.090> therefore<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.200> answer<00:05:31.470> is<00:05:31.620> eight<00:05:32.600> tens

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
ones therefore the answer is eight tens

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.130 
ones therefore the answer is eight tens
