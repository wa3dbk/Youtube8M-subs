00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.160
 save save cartoleiro portfolios 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.960
 Let's go to the eighth round 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.050
 so the staff 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.150
 First I wanted to say to you, in between. 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.189
 Our facebook group, I'll leave the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.550
 link in the video description because it 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.550
 what youtube 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:44.719
 and there you have the final escalation of our 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.820
 team for this round for all 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.100
 other rounds that will turn and until the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.190
 end of this championship 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.299
 staff is the following us with our 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 scoring is done to score 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:03.260
 if you want to value if you need 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.659
 scale in players who do not 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.819
 were well in the last round that 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:11.270
 devalued in the last round or 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:12.920
 very little and that they cost 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.200
 reasonably cheap 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.729
 these are the players who have the greatest 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:23.899
 tendency to value another's beauty 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:27.170
 figueirense and international warning not 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.880
 this goes for the hat round 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.250
 so do not climb players nor 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:39.460
 figueirense and neither international 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:42.549
 ok then come on let's go escalation 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:48.789
 for this eighth round 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:51.049
 on goal daniel fernandes sport 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:54.259
 let's believe again with daniel 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:57.140
 fernandes plays against the Basque at home and 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.850
 Let's hope this time he did not call. 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.320
 because when joinville was scoring 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:06.049
 very well and ended up taking that goal 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:10.340
 as the first side of the carlinhos are 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:12.530
 paulo plays against avaí at home is a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.579
 good side as bruno but has 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.150
 average better 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:20.690
 so we chose the carlinhos as 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.150
 the second side samuel xavier sport 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.959
 the same way daniel fernandes takes the 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.180
 Basque at home is the Basque who is 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.400
 let's hope for the sport do not take goals 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.660
 this time as first defender kadu 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.700
 Athletic Paranaense plays the classic 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.290
 against the most athletic coritiba 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.500
 Paraná comes at a much better time 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.560
 so expensive than it is a good defender should 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.460
 well should score as well as second 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.270
 defender 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.610
 Macedo Goiás Goiás has not been doing 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:56.090
 very good, people do not take much 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.310
 Little also gets the joinville out of 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.200
 house but joinville also almost does not 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.280
 gol then we believe that felipe 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.310
 macedo goes well as the first 6 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.910
 rithieli sport takes the Basque in 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.940
 House 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.840
 I already said that it was a good sock. 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.720
 good against the Basque then 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.790
 Let's suddenly it's like a second sock. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.430
 michel bastos again michel bastos 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.080
 which did not go well in the last round but 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.780
 Let's believe and we'll bet on it. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.960
 once again plays against Avaí at home 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:33.860
 são paulo is the leader of the championship comes 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:36.320
 well owes well and michel rows as a 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.640
 third half patrik goiás see that 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.110
 patric is like doubt but we will 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.570
 keep silent because we believe 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.540
 that he will play for the information that 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.120
 We got on the internet. 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.340
 In case something changes we will 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120
 bet on the video description and also 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:57.070
 Let's post on our channel on Facebook 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.570
 to participate 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.810
 Patrick takes the joinville out of the house 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:04.280
 goias well patrick is a good sock 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.590
 It should be fine when playing video 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.990
 Let's go patrícia with the first 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.700
 maikon milk attack is the big 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.780
 highlight the previous round us 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.370
 I was with him 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.530
 still good because if it were not for him to 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.950
 people had been much worse 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.270
 very much appreciated that it is cheap has 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.160
 great risk of devaluation in this 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.980
 round but picks up the Basque at home as 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.860
 people had point we believe that 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.630
 maikon milk goes well again like 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.900
 second striker leandro damião too 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:35.480
 very well in the last round plays against 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.190
 chapecoense at home the cruise came back 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.530
 to play well returned to pack 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.760
 so I daniel a big chance of 

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.220
 score as well as third striker 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.220
 henrique goiás goiás gets joinville 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.840
 out like I already told you and goiás with 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.510
 great chances to score in 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.130
 joinville because joinville comes badly then 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.180
 bruno henrique one of the good attackers of the 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.350
 may well and with the technician or the 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.890
 carlos osório 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.290
 São Paulo São Paulo in general should 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.840
 well and is a team that comes from the good for being the 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.260
 league leader takes the avaí home 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.790
 so we are going joão carlos osório 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.680
 technician's score is nothing more than 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:22.310
 the average player that's it 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:24.350
 guys for this round is this if there is 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.800
 some modification we will bet 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.570

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.950

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:35.510
