 reflected with cap bazze had with dark brown cole lens wick 

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:09.699
 brown the lighting project 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:11.989
 our model has a dark brown 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.989
 which was applied percent the tincture 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.739
 And that is why you want to look for this to clarify this color 

00:00:19.739 --> 00:00:22.010
 give it elimination 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.079
 whereby 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:28.379

 thin chacÃ³n 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 and the color that we will choose once within the brown tones 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.090
 What we did was 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.420
 first of anger art from 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410
 volumes and I left an exposure time of 25 minutes after 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.180
 After that time we prepared a pendant with West of twenty 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.160
 volumes and there we work to the root 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.989
 what is important and what to keep in mind 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.859
 is that that attends a single application of dark brown 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.570

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.860
 at the tip 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.160
 so that we have the same discoloration 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.020
 can you see what after the decoration the orange blond a 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.380
 base to apply the color 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.290
 shaikh the color that we are going to apply is a 6 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.149
