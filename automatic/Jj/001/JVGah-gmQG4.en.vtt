00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello youtube hello i'm doing now 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.629
 update again from the video for the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.889
 key 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:14.519
 that is now times with the sane sees 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.490
 You often do it when you are like that 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:20.400
 if there does not work out there 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.460
 it's actually two more 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.660
 possibilities either contact he is in 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.710
 order or you do not have me 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.660
 Light up time until 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.500
 troubleshooting beutin east evil 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:41.250
 but can that be that here 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.370
 and is below the battery 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:51.809
 [Music] 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:54.329
 this metal this article up here 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.320
 to the basin, the number of cases is 110 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:03.260
 an oxidation on it is also 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 less fall that we get together 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:11.640
 it is as I said now everything took 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:15.869
 that works then he has the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 second volume of opera drieb - for 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:24.360
 really is just that - despite there here 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 just better off to that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.180
 oxidation is when that's all that wonderful 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.409
 I feel that is alright I can 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:43.280
 there the area and 14 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:47.959
 that's just make something out with the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.840
 is the better way of the lamps 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:55.539
 finger up photo 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:02:01.299
 because the right ones from here are in 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.299
 moment in which there are different 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.500
 searched and found 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:15.590
 the bio that I may now and tyrol 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:18.829
 this one has these too 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:21.400
 two books from here but the bolt 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:25.640
 was locked in place for the circuit board 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:34.890
 So the screws here with me as the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:50.690
 slice up here you can see the text 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:03:01.710
 [Music] 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:06.960
 because Amazon with parents on the left 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:09.030
 coalition I show now again to 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:21.210
 expedition of the generation with the 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:21.990
 a screwdriver and pried the 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:40.170
 server out 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:44.069
 [Music] 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:48.550
 that's how it looks from the beginning 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:04:02.020
 decision this bradl has switched 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:04:02.020
 [Music] 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:12.959
 then he is scratching here on the 2923 pins 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.269
 around the three pins are the whole then 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:19.440
 nice clean then again 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:24.600
 Assemble the skimmer before 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.610
 So man , that's down here and 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.250
 area but the iron and brain 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:33.090
 still on both sides 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:40.490
 that with swift ones and then clearly 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:46.190
 keep and do these checkpoints why 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:49.350
 So only briefly that was conclusive again 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.110
 that the children's holiday will be that 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.820
 somewhere in the cabin you were so surprised 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.960
 about wholegrain and then it works 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.800
 [Music] 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.800
 always different 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:19.740
 Some of them are flashing for example 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:23.830
 [Music] 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:44.160
 first dark light and the motto that 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:44.160
 is yes then should flash once now 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.600
 physically must 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:08.420
 [Music] 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:18.130
 with double therefore always therefore 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:23.150
 brings attention next to switching behavior 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:24.130
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.300
 see you later 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.300
