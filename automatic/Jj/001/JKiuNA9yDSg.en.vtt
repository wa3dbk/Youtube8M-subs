00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
is why is all designed I did actually

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.550 
is why is all designed I did actually
get<00:02:37.590> in<00:02:37.709> one<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.860> these<00:02:37.980> before<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:39.380> I'm<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
get in one of these before and I'm the

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.300 
get in one of these before and I'm the
last<00:02:40.769> gen<00:02:41.480> I'm<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:43.019> glitch<00:02:43.380> ages<00:02:43.860> ago<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:44.070> think

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
last gen I'm a glitch ages ago I think

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.479 
last gen I'm a glitch ages ago I think
it's<00:02:44.430> nearly<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.880> year<00:02:45.300> ago<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
it's nearly a year ago now and and it

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.180 
it's nearly a year ago now and and it
was<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.880> detailed<00:02:48.360> inside<00:02:48.720> at<00:02:48.870> all<00:02:49.140> so<00:02:49.830> this

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
was not detailed inside at all so this

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.820 
was not detailed inside at all so this
means<00:02:50.640> that<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.120> is<00:02:51.269> being<00:02:51.600> used<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.140> heists

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
means that this is being used in heists

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.580 
means that this is being used in heists
