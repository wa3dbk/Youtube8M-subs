00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
this as an additional battery charger

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.510 
this as an additional battery charger
whatever<00:05:17.560> you'd<00:05:17.740> like<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.979> interoperate<00:05:18.460> with

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
whatever you'd like to interoperate with

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.790 
whatever you'd like to interoperate with
it<00:05:18.850> so<00:05:19.300> that's<00:05:19.660> makes<00:05:19.930> it<00:05:20.050> not<00:05:20.229> really<00:05:20.620> nice

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
it so that's makes it not really nice

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.860 
it so that's makes it not really nice
usable<00:05:21.130> feature<00:05:21.550> on<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:21.880> device<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.389> the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
usable feature on the device and the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.629 
usable feature on the device and the
last<00:05:23.199> nice<00:05:23.500> little<00:05:23.889> freaks<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.340> will<00:05:24.550> be

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
last nice little freaks that will be

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.740 
last nice little freaks that will be
included<00:05:24.789> in<00:05:25.150> the<00:05:25.210> box<00:05:25.590> so<00:05:27.090> there's<00:05:28.090> tickle

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
included in the box so there's tickle

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.450 
included in the box so there's tickle
distance<00:05:29.199> game<00:05:29.500> just<00:05:29.949> kind<00:05:30.160> of<00:05:30.190> give<00:05:30.310> you<00:05:30.370> an

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
distance game just kind of give you an

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.460 
distance game just kind of give you an
idea<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:31.389> sims<00:05:31.690> a<00:05:31.870> sense<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.139> where<00:05:32.259> you<00:05:32.350> used

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
idea the sims a sense of where you used

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.560 
idea the sims a sense of where you used
to<00:05:32.590> see<00:05:32.800> in<00:05:32.919> you<00:05:33.520> know<00:05:33.669> in<00:05:33.850> a<00:05:34.000> single<00:05:34.360> straight

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
to see in you know in a single straight

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.090 
to see in you know in a single straight
leg

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.910 

the<00:05:38.550> stems<00:05:38.850> are<00:05:39.000> loading<00:05:39.360> up<00:05:39.420> here<00:05:39.770> and<00:05:40.770> this

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
the stems are loading up here and this

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.890 
the stems are loading up here and this
really<00:05:41.220> i<00:05:41.280> think<00:05:41.370> optimizes<00:05:42.210> the<00:05:42.330> two<00:05:42.510> streams

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
really i think optimizes the two streams

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:48.650 
really i think optimizes the two streams
here<00:05:43.200> again

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.080 

they<00:05:49.230> got<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:49.680> know<00:05:49.830> that

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.700 

the<00:05:52.540> top<00:05:52.780> you<00:05:53.050> know<00:05:53.139> you<00:05:53.230> will<00:05:53.740> go<00:05:53.860> ahead

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
the top you know you will go ahead

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.650 
the top you know you will go ahead
the<00:05:56.010> copy<00:05:56.220> do<00:05:56.700> what<00:05:56.820> you<00:05:56.940> normally<00:05:57.090> do<00:05:57.450> on<00:05:57.480> the

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
the copy do what you normally do on the

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.440 
the copy do what you normally do on the
device<00:05:57.900> when<00:05:58.110> you're<00:05:58.200> on<00:05:58.290> the<00:05:58.320> bottom<00:05:58.530> you<00:05:59.310> can

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
device when you're on the bottom you can

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.010 
device when you're on the bottom you can
interoperate<00:06:00.450> with<00:06:00.870> it<00:06:01.110> so<00:06:01.500> bigger<00:06:01.980> love

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
interoperate with it so bigger love

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.270 
interoperate with it so bigger love
so<00:06:04.020> now<00:06:04.170> at<00:06:04.230> the<00:06:04.350> bottom<00:06:04.680> you're<00:06:04.800> able<00:06:05.070> to<00:06:05.130> do

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
so now at the bottom you're able to do

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.200 
so now at the bottom you're able to do
things<00:06:05.600> change<00:06:06.600> things<00:06:06.930> on<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.850> you<00:06:08.850> know<00:06:09.000> so

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
things change things on that you know so

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.830 
things change things on that you know so
we're<00:06:09.390> changing<00:06:09.810> thing<00:06:11.420> this<00:06:12.420> really<00:06:12.690> what

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 
we're changing thing this really what

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.120 
we're changing thing this really what
makes<00:06:13.110> it<00:06:13.290> I<00:06:13.380> think<00:06:13.440> it's<00:06:13.800> kind<00:06:13.890> of<00:06:13.980> unique

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
makes it I think it's kind of unique

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.560 
makes it I think it's kind of unique
because<00:06:14.490> you're<00:06:14.760> doing<00:06:14.970> things<00:06:15.090> on<00:06:15.270> the<00:06:15.360> top

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:15.570 
because you're doing things on the top

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.390 
because you're doing things on the top
and<00:06:15.810> using<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.140> Box<00:06:16.350> screen<00:06:16.710> to<00:06:16.830> you<00:06:17.310> know

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
and using the Box screen to you know

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:24.560 
and using the Box screen to you know
maneuvers<00:06:17.790> nearby<00:06:22.790> and<00:06:23.790> then<00:06:23.970> one<00:06:24.420> other

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
maneuvers nearby and then one other

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:25.940 
maneuvers nearby and then one other
thing<00:06:24.840> I<00:06:24.900> don't<00:06:25.050> think<00:06:25.170> we've<00:06:25.260> shown<00:06:25.500> you<00:06:25.530> here

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
thing I don't think we've shown you here

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.140 
thing I don't think we've shown you here
because<00:06:26.130> that<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.490> think<00:06:26.700> is<00:06:26.760> really<00:06:26.790> really

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
because that I think is really really

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.220 
because that I think is really really
nice<00:06:27.710> is

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.170 

so<00:06:31.770> let's<00:06:32.040> go<00:06:32.190> ahead<00:06:32.220> and<00:06:32.430> launch<00:06:32.880> a<00:06:33.000> browser

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
so let's go ahead and launch a browser

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.380 
so let's go ahead and launch a browser
okay<00:06:34.280> we<00:06:35.280> got<00:06:35.310> facebook<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:36.000> boat<00:06:36.210> up<00:06:36.360> there
