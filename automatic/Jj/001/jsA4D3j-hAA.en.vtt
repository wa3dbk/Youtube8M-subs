 Hello play today will tell 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.840
 you and the board game more 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.299
 and confusion in it you have to as you can 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.990
 rather collect cute little animals from 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.119
 which messed up body parts game 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.189
 comes in a standard box 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.340
 sizes inside which are many 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 cardboard components and a set of wooden 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.230
 asterisks the game offers two options 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.350
 complexity depending on which 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.900
 all fields are used entirely or only 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.330
 his half apart from that in the game 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.870
 all animals are used or only 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.239
 five pieces accordingly anyway 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.210
 segments should be separated with 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.760
 special separators having collected a field 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.580
 it is necessary to place body parts on it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.190
 animals so that they are completely not 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.769
 coincided but here's further in the levels 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.010
 difficulties start more significant 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.780
 differences in the lighter version 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.260
 shuffled 15 cards with an image 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.020
 five selected animals and 1 dummy these 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.590
 cards are placed next to the field face 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.130
 down the players take turns starting from 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.890
 your his 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 in his turn the player turns the top 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.920
 card his goal to collect the animal 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.740
 the player depicted on it can do 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.109
 up to three movements and shoot 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.929
 you can only the most extreme card 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.710
 any number dropped during the shift 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:35.380
 card 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.749
 goes to the opposite side 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.060
 if a player for three moves could 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:43.630
 collect the animal indicated on the card 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.319
 then he takes it to himself if it is him 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.020
 failed 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:50.229
 the same assignment goes to the next one. 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.079
 the player sitting on the left if opened 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.509
 animal card that has already been collected 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:58.990
 the card is sent back and the player 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.780
 pulls out the next card dummy 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.549
 allows the player to collect absolutely any 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.729
 animal of his choice 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.090
 the game in this mode will end as soon as 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.100
 the last card will be received 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.280
 score maximum and wins the game and 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.930
 in a more sophisticated mode intended 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.810
 for players from 6 years 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.410
 the game is played on a full game board 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.610
 all animals all 30 cards without 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.490
 soothers 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.620
 lying on the landing site 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.110
 laid out 10 pieces each player 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.900
 gets three wooden stars 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.210
 the essence of the game remains the same to collect 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.540
 animals indicated on the cards 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:42.370
 for three moves the input is each star 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.060
 you can spend on one 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.150
 extra move 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.239
 at the end of each player's cards 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.290
 animals replenish to 10 and as soon 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.550
 they all end the game will end 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.080
 the one who wins will surely win 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.239
 most of all the big confusion is simple 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.440
 children's game that does not force much 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.739
 strain your brains 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.030
 but it will bring a lot of fun and 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:11.550
 hilarious combination of body parts 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.269
 different animals are wonderful this 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.269
 promotes
