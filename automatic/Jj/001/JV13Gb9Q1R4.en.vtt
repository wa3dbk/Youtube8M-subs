whole<00:01:11.270> 65<00:01:12.170> based<00:01:12.500> power<00:01:12.770> and<00:01:13.220> once<00:01:13.700> your

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
whole 65 based power and once your

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.110 
whole 65 based power and once your
opponent<00:01:14.300> as<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.870> at<00:01:15.229> about<00:01:15.920> half<00:01:16.160> HP<00:01:16.430> or

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
opponent as is at about half HP or

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.140 
opponent as is at about half HP or
whatever<00:01:17.840> its<00:01:18.320> power<00:01:18.950> doubles<00:01:19.550> ever<00:01:19.790> since<00:01:20.030> I

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
whatever its power doubles ever since I

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.150 
whatever its power doubles ever since I
saw<00:01:20.330> that<00:01:20.570> I<00:01:20.630> knew<00:01:20.750> it<00:01:21.080> had<00:01:21.229> potential<00:01:21.619> just

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
saw that I knew it had potential just

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.240 
saw that I knew it had potential just
like<00:01:22.310> psycho<00:01:22.580> shift<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.690> what<00:01:24.170> I'm<00:01:24.440> finally<00:01:25.040> I

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
like psycho shift so what I'm finally I

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.300 
like psycho shift so what I'm finally I
was<00:01:25.490> finally<00:01:25.729> able<00:01:25.910> to<00:01:26.210> build<00:01:26.420> a<00:01:26.509> team<00:01:26.780> around

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
was finally able to build a team around

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.210 
was finally able to build a team around
that<00:01:28.310> attack<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:30.140> start<00:01:30.560> off<00:01:30.619> with<00:01:30.830> a<00:01:30.890> super

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
that attack so I start off with a super

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.460 
that attack so I start off with a super
fang<00:01:31.490> on<00:01:31.759> that<00:01:31.910> armaldo<00:01:32.330> even<00:01:32.960> though<00:01:33.080> it's<00:01:33.290> uh

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
fang on that armaldo even though it's uh

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.219 
fang on that armaldo even though it's uh
I<00:01:34.400> probably<00:01:35.300> could<00:01:35.630> have<00:01:35.660> gone<00:01:35.840> for<00:01:36.110> either

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
I probably could have gone for either

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.690 
I probably could have gone for either
one<00:01:36.500> but<00:01:36.680> I<00:01:36.740> knew<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:36.950> need<00:01:37.190> to<00:01:37.310> bring<00:01:37.520> down

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
one but I knew I need to bring down

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.190 
one but I knew I need to bring down
armaldo<00:01:38.090> since<00:01:38.479> they're<00:01:38.660> known<00:01:38.930> to<00:01:38.960> have

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
armaldo since they're known to have

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.520 
armaldo since they're known to have
earthquake<00:01:39.770> so<00:01:40.759> I<00:01:40.790> go<00:01:41.180> for<00:01:41.420> super<00:01:41.750> fang<00:01:41.960> and<00:01:41.990> i

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
earthquake so I go for super fang and i

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.920 
earthquake so I go for super fang and i
get<00:01:42.740> i<00:01:43.009> get<00:01:43.460> pretty<00:01:43.790> lucky<00:01:44.030> for<00:01:44.360> this<00:01:44.450> match<00:01:44.720> I

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
get i get pretty lucky for this match I

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.170 
get i get pretty lucky for this match I
don't<00:01:45.110> miss<00:01:45.350> a<00:01:45.380> single<00:01:45.740> time<00:01:46.399> the<00:01:46.700> super<00:01:47.000> fang

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
don't miss a single time the super fang

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.510 
don't miss a single time the super fang
and<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:47.960> I<00:01:47.990> bring<00:01:48.259> his<00:01:48.380> HP<00:01:48.530> down<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.009> half<00:01:49.190> and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
and so I bring his HP down to half and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.770 
and so I bring his HP down to half and
then<00:01:50.210> I<00:01:50.420> set<00:01:50.660> up<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.869> rain<00:01:51.050> dance<00:01:51.350> now<00:01:52.780> brine

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
then I set up the rain dance now brine

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.230 
then I set up the rain dance now brine
if<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.410> don't<00:01:54.619> if<00:01:54.860> you<00:01:55.460> don't<00:01:55.700> use<00:01:55.940> brine

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
if you don't if you don't use brine

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.749 
if you don't if you don't use brine
correctly<00:01:56.960> it's<00:01:57.350> not<00:01:57.619> a<00:01:57.950> very<00:01:58.460> powerful

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
correctly it's not a very powerful

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.609 
correctly it's not a very powerful
attack<00:01:59.390> but<00:01:59.660> the<00:01:59.750> way<00:01:59.899> i'm<00:02:00.050> using<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:00.590> right

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
attack but the way i'm using it right

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.070 
attack but the way i'm using it right
here<00:02:00.979> i'll<00:02:01.160> explain<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.759> right<00:02:01.940> now<00:02:02.000> once<00:02:02.929> your

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
here i'll explain it right now once your

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.520 
here i'll explain it right now once your
opponent<00:02:03.470> is<00:02:03.560> at<00:02:03.740> half<00:02:04.310> HP<00:02:04.640> it's<00:02:05.530> brian's

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
opponent is at half HP it's brian's

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.160 
opponent is at half HP it's brian's
power<00:02:06.830> will<00:02:07.220> double<00:02:07.670> to<00:02:09.100> 130<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:11.090> yeah<00:02:11.900> that's

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
power will double to 130 so yeah that's

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.090 
power will double to 130 so yeah that's
pretty<00:02:12.290> powerful<00:02:12.620> so<00:02:13.810> doubled<00:02:14.810> power<00:02:15.100> then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
pretty powerful so doubled power then

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.480 
pretty powerful so doubled power then
natural<00:02:16.760> stab<00:02:17.090> rain<00:02:17.810> dance<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.440> then<00:02:18.740> with<00:02:19.340> an

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
natural stab rain dance and then with an

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
item I've actually done the math on a

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.030 
item I've actually done the math on a
previous<00:02:22.910> previous<00:02:23.600> occasion<00:02:24.380> I'm<00:02:24.709> actually

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
210 power that's more powerful than

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.160 
210 power that's more powerful than
water<00:02:41.990> spout<00:02:42.319> just<00:02:42.680> then<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.599> course<00:02:44.900> I
