00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.160
 good evening london make them 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.050
 put on weight 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.759
 normally when talking about hypo 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.919
 synthesis focuses mainly 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.860
 on sugars and fats 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.160
 proteins appear to be macron one 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.149
 customer that less leads to the creation of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.100
 new to explain, yet lately 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.559
 still Dr. Berlin is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.829
 focused on this macro nutrient 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.110
 saying that one of the main factors 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.929
 which leads us to create new fabric 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.890
 fat especially in children what is there 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:51.589
 true 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.920
 let's start by saying this thing who studies 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.989
 human physiology knows the factors that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.809
 affect the human body does not harm 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.300
 always only one answer but second 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.460
 of their quantity and situation 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.220
 they can have opposite effects 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.909
 for this reason we feel everything and the opposite 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.460
 of all we must understand the principles for 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.740
 know when a thing from a given 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.810
 effects when from the opposite the doctor 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.970
 berlin when it says that proteins 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.050
 they make you fat is based on studies 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.210
 epidemiological observational what 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.420
 it means that a link is not sold 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.210
 causality but a correlation is seen 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.720
 statistically the classic example is that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:39.320
 of the breakfast who made the breakfast is 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.360
 on average more fat we can say that 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.510
 skipping breakfast makes you fat 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.740
 no because it is on average fatter a 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.350
 statistical level 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.440
 normally those who skip breakfast e 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:54.530
 not very attentive to his diet a 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.190
 mid-morning to make and compensate immediately 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.330
 with a hood it is a brioche instead 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.610
 who does sport 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 who is attentive to food knows 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.100
 how important it is then to eat fruit 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:10.160
 yogurt makes a healthy breakfast is 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:13.489
 on average slimmer though now 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.980
 we know that in the meantime skipping is not 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.560
 breakfast that makes the difference but the 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.190
 quality and quantity of what 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.260
 let's eat 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.939
 when 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.120
 to stop something we must not base ourselves 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.790
 only on statistical studies but we must 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.890
 understand the principle and now we see the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.069
 principle that proteins do 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.069
 put on weight 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.850
 if it is true that some amino acids like 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.800
 those that do not intervene in 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.260
 hepatic metabolism and go directly 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.170
 at the exit to the muscle like i 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.870
 branched amino acids me the day 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:52.410
 insulin sensitivity because they carry i 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.140
 surface receptors 14 even without 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.450
 the presence of sugars is likewise 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.550
 true that an excess blood 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.350
 amino acids in a context t for caloric 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.870
 hinders the entry of glucose into it 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 the cell and leads to the insulin 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.100
 resistance the insulin resistance does not have 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.930
 effect only at the level of 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.700
 cell membrane but also level 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.130
 mitochondrial mitochondria manage to 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.250
 transform little energy into cadence and 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.750
 go to life processes more easily 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.100
 the positive ones plus some amino acids 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 allow marjoram tourism of the 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.290
 cell bullying wool does not concern 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.960
 only protein synthesis but also the 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.440
 formation of glycogen and acids 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.310
 fat 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.480
 in this context a chronic excess of 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:50.210
 amino acids with a surplus caloric leads 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.210
 people to gain more weight 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.910
 however the proteins of people 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.610
 and don't let yourself get fat always depends 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.800
 in fact, from the context this macro 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.200
 nourishing the one with the dynamic expense 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.290
 specify higher what it means 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.390
 that the body to assimilate digest it 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.630
 consumes a lot of energy 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.200
 10 to 35 percent of calories 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:17.040
 introduced with an average of 22.5 per 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.859
 one hundred 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.810
 the thermogenesis thus induced by this 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.389
 macro nourishing allows what 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.820
 a metabolic advantage is defined 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.380
 for proteins they have a great power 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.840
 filling 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:32.280
 so we can eat less e 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.430
 feel more satiated 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.830
 among other things the protein excess therefore the 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.530
 proteins that we don't need 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.510
 It is true that theoretically they can be 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.210
 convert to glucose which in turn 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:47.669
 it can become fatty acids but this 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.490
 completely theoretical process actually not 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:53.190
 proteins almost never recede 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:57.260
 the heat is very easily oxidized 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.260
 pretty nice and converted 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.969
 in conclusion what 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.789
 how to say that it is true that at the level 

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.889
 statistician who takes more proteins more 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.810
 fat but not because he eats two 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.999
 extra steaks and two pasta dishes 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.129
 dry and less simply because 

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:17.330
 eat two more steaks and two dishes 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.249
 of dry pasta so eat too much 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:23.189
 who is doing a diet for the 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:26.729
 mass to put on a muscle and assume 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.060
 already enough fat carbohydrates does not have 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.819
 need to exceed with proteins 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.979
 because even a protein excess more 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:35.729
 it will easily lead him to accumulate 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.219
 fat 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:41.909
 on the contrary those who are following a diet 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.949
 low calorie will have all the advantages seen 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.300
 so far from increasing its share 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.479
 protein 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.509
 ultimately there is no physiology 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:54.889
 a law that is valid forever but yes 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.889
 suitable if, however, its context
