the first patented surface mixed burner

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.590 
the first patented surface mixed burner
was<00:00:31.109> for<00:00:31.710> General<00:00:32.099> Electric<00:00:32.129> and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.570> a

more complete mixing of the fuels

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.970 
more complete mixing of the fuels
because<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.230> heavy<00:00:55.680> wall

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
because you don't have the heavy wall

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.549 
because you don't have the heavy wall
separating<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.789> gas<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> oxygen<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.050> other

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
unique feature of the thin wall is that

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.109 
unique feature of the thin wall is that
it<00:01:02.760> allows<00:01:03.090> laminar<00:01:03.840> flow<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.649> fuels<00:01:05.119> it

it allows laminar flow of the fuels it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.169 
it allows laminar flow of the fuels it
allows<00:01:06.479> those<00:01:06.840> fuels<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.679> stay<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.640> separate

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
allows those fuels to stay in a separate

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:12.050 
allows those fuels to stay in a separate
configuration<00:01:10.220> well<00:01:11.220> after<00:01:11.670> they<00:01:11.789> leave<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
configuration well after they leave the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.240 
configuration well after they leave the
front<00:01:12.479> face<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.929> burner<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.830> when<00:01:14.009> they<00:01:14.190> do

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
front face of the burner so when they do

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.760 
front face of the burner so when they do

burner they are still mixed properly in
the<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:21.270> proportion<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:23.670> didn't<00:01:24.000> have

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
the right proportion if you didn't have

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.359 
the right proportion if you didn't have
laminar<00:01:24.720> flow<00:01:24.929> you'd<00:01:25.200> have<00:01:25.410> turbulent<00:01:26.039> flow

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
laminar flow you'd have turbulent flow

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.540 
laminar flow you'd have turbulent flow
and<00:01:27.319> then<00:01:28.319> the<00:01:28.530> flame<00:01:28.770> wouldn't<00:01:29.190> have<00:01:29.340> that

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
head

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.460 
head
so<00:02:19.750> it<00:02:19.959> allows<00:02:20.260> more<00:02:20.769> fuel<00:02:21.310> to<00:02:21.610> be<00:02:21.760> combusted

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so it allows more fuel to be combusted

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.619 
so it allows more fuel to be combusted
than<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:24.250> premix<00:02:24.640> burner<00:02:24.879> the<00:02:25.390> Bethlehem

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
than the premix burner the Bethlehem

than the premix burner the Bethlehem
flame<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.739> very<00:02:27.099> soft<00:02:27.459> flame<00:02:27.879> and<00:02:28.379> the

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
flame is a very soft flame and the

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.440 
flame is a very soft flame and the
reason<00:02:29.769> for<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> softness<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:30.939> laminar

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
reason for the softness is the laminar

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.720 
reason for the softness is the laminar
flow<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:32.079> allowing<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.709> large<00:02:33.010> volume<00:02:33.370> of

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
flow it's allowing a large volume of

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.479 
flow it's allowing a large volume of
fuel<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.480> exit<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.019> burner<00:02:35.290> at<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.620> very<00:02:36.069> slow

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
fuel to exit the burner at a very slow

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.420 
fuel to exit the burner at a very slow
velocity<00:02:37.209> that<00:02:37.900> allows<00:02:38.200> all<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.769> fuel<00:02:38.980> to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
velocity that allows all that fuel to

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.990 
velocity that allows all that fuel to
mix<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:39.939> combust<00:02:40.359> at<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.689> same<00:02:40.900> time<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:42.280> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
mix and combust at the same time and the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.069 
mix and combust at the same time and the
great<00:02:43.239> amount<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.569> heat<00:02:43.780> that's<00:02:43.989> generated

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
great amount of heat that's generated

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.860 
great amount of heat that's generated
from<00:02:44.799> that<00:02:44.920> stays<00:02:45.640> close<00:02:46.269> to<00:02:46.299> the<00:02:46.540> burner

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
from that stays close to the burner

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.740 
from that stays close to the burner
which<00:02:47.260> also<00:02:47.530> means<00:02:47.859> it<00:02:48.099> stays<00:02:48.370> right<00:02:49.359> on<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
which also means it stays right on the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.940 
instead of if you have a high-velocity

localized as possible on your workpiece
and<00:03:05.769> that's<00:03:06.639> why<00:03:06.790> we<00:03:06.939> call<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.209> bathing<00:03:07.480> in<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
and that's why we call it bathing in the

and that's why we call it bathing in the
flame<00:03:08.470> because<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:09.129> stays<00:03:09.459> close<00:03:09.939> by

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.920 

the<00:03:21.400> unique<00:03:21.730> part<00:03:21.970> about<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.360> beta<00:03:22.570> is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
the unique part about the beta is

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.870 
the unique part about the beta is
strictly<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.800> channeling<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.550> fuel

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
strictly the the channeling of the fuel

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.710 
strictly the the channeling of the fuel
to<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.050> burner<00:03:26.290> face<00:03:26.650> rather<00:03:27.580> than<00:03:27.850> using<00:03:28.420> a

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
to the burner face rather than using a

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680 
to the burner face rather than using a
high<00:03:28.960> pressure<00:03:29.440> to<00:03:29.860> push<00:03:30.270> fuels<00:03:31.270> through<00:03:31.660> a

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
high pressure to push fuels through a

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.710 
high pressure to push fuels through a
small<00:03:32.170> gap<00:03:32.200> inside<00:03:33.130> the<00:03:33.370> burner<00:03:33.580> body<00:03:34.180> we've

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
small gap inside the burner body we've

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.200 
small gap inside the burner body we've
expanded<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.490> volume<00:03:36.880> of<00:03:37.030> all<00:03:37.150> the

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:37.210 
expanded the the volume of all the

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.240 
expanded the the volume of all the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
channels inside the burner body so that

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.360 
channels inside the burner body so that
a<00:03:39.610> low<00:03:40.210> pressure<00:03:40.600> will<00:03:40.930> allow<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.590> large<00:03:42.040> volume

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
a low pressure will allow a large volume

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.460 
a low pressure will allow a large volume
to<00:03:42.640> go<00:03:42.790> through<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.570> get<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:43.930> same<00:03:44.200> volume

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
to go through to get that same volume

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.620 
to go through to get that same volume
through<00:03:45.070> and<00:03:45.340> another<00:03:45.700> burner<00:03:46.030> you'd<00:03:46.240> have<00:03:46.450> to

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
through and another burner you'd have to

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.780 
through and another burner you'd have to
increase<00:03:47.020> the<00:03:47.200> pressure<00:03:47.470> and<00:03:48.370> once<00:03:48.640> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
increase the pressure and once you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.900 
increase the pressure and once you
increase<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.420> pressure<00:03:49.830> then<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.580> fuels

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
increase the pressure then the fuels

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.970 
increase the pressure then the fuels
almost<00:03:52.330> compete<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:52.990> each<00:03:53.140> other<00:03:53.410> we've

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
almost compete with each other we've

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.490 
almost compete with each other we've
noticed<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.580> when<00:03:54.820> we<00:03:54.970> increase<00:03:55.420> the

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
noticed that when we increase the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.410 
noticed that when we increase the

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.360 
pressure of the fuels coming in it's
almost<00:03:58.660> creates<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.440> back<00:03:59.650> pressure<00:04:00.010> that

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
almost creates a back pressure that

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.270 
almost creates a back pressure that
prevents<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.150> flow<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.959> fuel<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.070> get

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
prevents a flow of fuel that you get

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.190 
prevents a flow of fuel that you get

otherwise at a lower pressure it's

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.670 
otherwise at a lower pressure it's
almost<00:04:05.500> like<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:07.480> think<00:04:07.690> of<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.900> as<00:04:08.020> a<00:04:08.050> common

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
almost like you think of it as a common

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.710 
almost like you think of it as a common
thing<00:04:08.800> as<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> garden<00:04:09.430> hose<00:04:09.610> if<00:04:09.880> if<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.450> put

but you're not getting a volume of water

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.700 
but you're not getting a volume of water
doing<00:04:27.340> that<00:04:27.669> if<00:04:27.910> you<00:04:28.390> look<00:04:28.600> at<00:04:28.780> in<00:04:29.200> greenhouses

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
doing that if you look at in greenhouses

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.850 
doing that if you look at in greenhouses
they<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.310> a<00:04:30.520> large<00:04:31.090> head<00:04:31.510> with<00:04:31.780> big<00:04:32.050> holes<00:04:32.410> so

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
they have a large head with big holes so

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.440 
they have a large head with big holes so
they<00:04:32.950> get<00:04:33.070> a<00:04:33.130> large<00:04:33.400> volume<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.910> water<00:04:34.150> going

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
they get a large volume of water going

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.720 
they get a large volume of water going
through<00:04:34.570> now<00:04:35.560> we're<00:04:35.770> trying<00:04:36.160> to<00:04:36.280> do<00:04:36.400> the<00:04:36.520> same

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
through now we're trying to do the same

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.050 
through now we're trying to do the same
kind<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.120> thing<00:04:37.390> with<00:04:37.870> gas<00:04:38.669> where<00:04:39.669> you<00:04:39.820> have

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
kind of thing with gas where you have

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.480 
kind of thing with gas where you have
all<00:04:40.480> this<00:04:40.780> volume<00:04:41.500> going<00:04:41.830> through<00:04:42.190> all<00:04:42.310> these

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
all this volume going through all these

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.080 
all this volume going through all these
small<00:04:43.000> little<00:04:43.180> holes<00:04:43.540> and<00:04:44.200> in<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.640> same<00:04:45.880> way

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
small little holes and in the same way

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.350 
small little holes and in the same way
as<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.600> showerhead<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.830> the<00:04:48.580> big<00:04:48.850> volume<00:04:49.240> of

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
as the showerhead if the big volume of

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.730 
as the showerhead if the big volume of
water<00:04:49.570> is<00:04:49.840> staying<00:04:50.110> close<00:04:50.410> to<00:04:50.590> that

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
water is staying close to that

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.530 
water is staying close to that
showerhead<00:04:51.130> it's<00:04:51.400> not<00:04:51.550> being<00:04:51.820> pushed<00:04:52.300> away

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
showerhead it's not being pushed away

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.510 
showerhead it's not being pushed away
because<00:04:53.290> you're<00:04:53.470> allowing<00:04:53.860> more<00:04:54.040> volume<00:04:54.490> to

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
because you're allowing more volume to

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.340 
because you're allowing more volume to
go<00:04:54.760> through<00:04:55.000> at<00:04:55.120> one<00:04:55.300> time<00:04:55.600> at<00:04:55.900> a<00:04:56.050> lower

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
go through at one time at a lower

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.570 
go through at one time at a lower
pressure

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.719 

last<00:04:59.789> few<00:05:00.090> years<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:01.650> availability<00:05:02.490> of

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
last few years the availability of

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.580 
last few years the availability of
computer-controlled<00:05:03.449> machinery<00:05:04.409> has

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
computer-controlled machinery has

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.879 
computer-controlled machinery has
increased<00:05:05.310> greatly<00:05:05.729> and<00:05:06.599> that<00:05:07.080> has<00:05:07.560> allowed

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:07.889 
increased greatly and that has allowed

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:09.499 
increased greatly and that has allowed
us<00:05:07.949> to<00:05:08.219> make<00:05:08.580> things<00:05:08.879> that<00:05:09.090> we<00:05:09.180> could<00:05:09.360> never

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
us to make things that we could never

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.230 
us to make things that we could never
make<00:05:09.810> before<00:05:10.259> so<00:05:11.189> the<00:05:11.400> burners<00:05:11.759> that<00:05:11.969> Henry

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
make before so the burners that Henry

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.580 
make before so the burners that Henry
Neiman<00:05:12.569> designed<00:05:12.960> back<00:05:13.259> in<00:05:13.289> the<00:05:13.879> 40s<00:05:14.879> and<00:05:15.030> 50s

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
Neiman designed back in the 40s and 50s

Neiman designed back in the 40s and 50s
were<00:05:16.590> designed<00:05:17.550> and<00:05:17.909> manufactured<00:05:18.449> using

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
were designed and manufactured using

were designed and manufactured using
equipment<00:05:19.379> that<00:05:19.800> was<00:05:19.949> 50<00:05:20.550> years<00:05:20.580> old<00:05:21.259> today

equipment that was 50 years old today

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:24.260 
equipment that was 50 years old today
you<00:05:22.319> can<00:05:22.740> make<00:05:22.979> a<00:05:23.460> whole<00:05:23.699> variety<00:05:23.879> of<00:05:24.150> things

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you can make a whole variety of things

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.570 
you can make a whole variety of things
that<00:05:24.689> could<00:05:24.900> not<00:05:25.080> be<00:05:25.229> made<00:05:25.439> at<00:05:25.560> all<00:05:25.770> back<00:05:26.370> in

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
that could not be made at all back in

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.330 
that could not be made at all back in
those<00:05:26.759> days<00:05:27.289> it<00:05:28.289> just<00:05:28.620> physically<00:05:29.069> wasn't

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
those days it just physically wasn't

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.869 
those days it just physically wasn't
possible<00:05:30.169> so<00:05:31.169> taking<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:32.099> old<00:05:32.280> ideas

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:32.879 
possible so taking the the old ideas

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.240 
possible so taking the the old ideas
which<00:05:33.569> are<00:05:33.719> good<00:05:33.930> ideas<00:05:34.349> they<00:05:34.560> were<00:05:34.620> why<00:05:35.219> they

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
which are good ideas they were why they

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.350 
which are good ideas they were why they
were<00:05:35.460> patentable<00:05:36.120> but<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.530> apply<00:05:38.400> today's

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
were patentable but to apply today's

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.200 
were patentable but to apply today's
technology<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.169> those<00:05:40.590> ideas<00:05:41.069> is<00:05:41.340> mostly<00:05:41.969> what

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
technology to those ideas is mostly what

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.930 
technology to those ideas is mostly what
we're<00:05:42.360> trying<00:05:42.599> to<00:05:42.719> do
