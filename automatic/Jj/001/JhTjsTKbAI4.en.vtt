00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
probably something like that and I'm

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.109

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
he'll say like you're only allowed to be

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.920 
he'll say like you're only allowed to be
VAP<00:02:12.260> over<00:02:12.530> 5000<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.730> don't<00:02:14.239> know<00:02:14.330> how<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.720> works

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
VAP over 5000 I don't know how it works

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.850 
VAP over 5000 I don't know how it works
but<00:02:15.550> hopefully<00:02:16.550> I<00:02:16.910> know<00:02:17.540> there's<00:02:17.900> a<00:02:17.989> VAP<00:02:18.349> step

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
but hopefully I know there's a VAP step

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.369 
but hopefully I know there's a VAP step
there<00:02:19.069> somewhere<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.580> can<00:02:19.970> spend<00:02:20.300> which<00:02:21.200> is

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
there somewhere you can spend which is

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:24.100 
there somewhere you can spend which is
probably<00:02:21.769> hundreds<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.700> dollars<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.510> would

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
probably hundreds of dollars I would

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.259 
probably hundreds of dollars I would
have<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.410> think<00:02:24.560> but<00:02:24.950> it'd<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.310> worth<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:25.970> for

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
have to think but it'd be worth it for

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.089 
have to think but it'd be worth it for
