00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
what a disappointing game we had some

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.250 
what a disappointing game we had some
really<00:06:50.850> good<00:06:51.030> chances<00:06:51.630> but<00:06:51.810> the<00:06:51.870> Norwich

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
really good chances but the Norwich

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.470 
really good chances but the Norwich
keeper<00:06:52.710> was<00:06:52.920> really<00:06:53.520> on<00:06:53.640> top<00:06:53.910> form<00:06:54.270> and

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.480 
keeper was really on top form and

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.290 
keeper was really on top form and
Norwich<00:06:55.470> had<00:06:55.680> some<00:06:55.950> chances<00:06:56.520> as<00:06:56.700> well<00:06:56.940> so<00:06:57.210> we

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
Norwich had some chances as well so we

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.450 
Norwich had some chances as well so we
could<00:06:57.480> have<00:06:57.630> lost<00:06:57.780> this<00:06:57.990> game<00:06:58.110> the<00:06:58.830> point<00:06:59.160> is

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
could have lost this game the point is

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.790 
could have lost this game the point is
not<00:06:59.730> worse<00:07:00.090> because<00:07:00.600> we<00:07:00.780> were<00:07:00.930> on<00:07:01.140> a<00:07:01.170> mat

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 
not worse because we were on a mat

not worse because we were on a mat
winning<00:07:02.250> run<00:07:02.460> I<00:07:02.490> think<00:07:02.610> we<00:07:02.970> want<00:07:03.210> seven<00:07:04.200> or

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
winning run I think we want seven or

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.500 
winning run I think we want seven or
eight<00:07:04.440> games<00:07:04.740> in<00:07:04.920> a<00:07:05.040> row<00:07:05.070> up<00:07:05.520> before<00:07:06.060> this<00:07:06.240> and

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
eight games in a row up before this and

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.870 
eight games in a row up before this and
man<00:07:06.720> city<00:07:06.930> couldn't<00:07:07.410> win<00:07:07.620> as<00:07:07.830> well<00:07:07.890> against

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880

Cardiff<00:07:09.390> which<00:07:09.600> is<00:07:09.750> very<00:07:10.080> lucky<00:07:10.320> for<00:07:10.470> us<00:07:10.710> so

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
Cardiff which is very lucky for us so

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.210 
Cardiff which is very lucky for us so
the<00:07:11.820> three-point<00:07:12.420> gap<00:07:12.660> remains<00:07:13.010> so<00:07:14.010> this<00:07:14.190> is

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:14.220 
the three-point gap remains so this is

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.010 
the three-point gap remains so this is
