00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
underrated ah i think um i think jinkx

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.730 
underrated ah i think um i think jinkx
is<00:02:00.000> underrated<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.189> think<00:02:04.130> Jays<00:02:05.130> underrated

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.559 

and<00:02:07.860> um<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:10.849> think<00:02:11.849> Zimmer's<00:02:12.300> pretty

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
and um I think Zimmer's pretty

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.729 
and um I think Zimmer's pretty
underrated<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:15.450> those<00:02:15.780> are<00:02:15.930> off<00:02:16.080> to<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.500> top

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
underrated but those are off to just top

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.960 
underrated but those are off to just top
of<00:02:16.860> my<00:02:16.950> head<00:02:17.069> like<00:02:17.340> there's<00:02:17.550> a<00:02:17.610> bunch<00:02:17.849> of

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
of my head like there's a bunch of

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.130 
of my head like there's a bunch of
people<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.360> think<00:02:18.390> are<00:02:18.660> underrated<00:02:18.989> in

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
people that I think are underrated in

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.729 
people that I think are underrated in
phase<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.709> goes<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.670> like<00:02:20.940> Ben<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> all<00:02:21.450> them

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
phase like goes on like Ben and all them

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.710 
phase like goes on like Ben and all them
but<00:02:22.880> those<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.000> just<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.209> three<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.540> popped

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
but those are just the three that popped

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.350 
but those are just the three that popped
into<00:02:24.870> my<00:02:24.930> mind<00:02:25.019> first<00:02:25.940> question<00:02:26.940> number<00:02:27.120> four

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
into my mind first question number four

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.670 
into my mind first question number four
do<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> think<00:02:27.959> trickshotting<00:02:28.380> would<00:02:28.560> have

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
do I think trickshotting would have

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.790 
do I think trickshotting would have
advanced<00:02:29.280> if<00:02:29.400> people<00:02:29.640> didn't<00:02:29.910> set<00:02:30.060> up

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
advanced if people didn't set up

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.509 
advanced if people didn't set up
obviously<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.830> think<00:02:32.010> trickshotting<00:02:32.340> would

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
obviously I think trickshotting would

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.270 
obviously I think trickshotting would
have<00:02:32.610> advanced<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:34.590> probably<00:02:35.069> would<00:02:35.220> have

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
have advanced it probably would have

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.809 
have advanced it probably would have
advanced<00:02:35.790> uh<00:02:36.830> I<00:02:37.830> don't<00:02:38.130> think<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.400> would<00:02:38.730> have

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
advanced uh I don't think it would have

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.509 
advanced uh I don't think it would have
advanced<00:02:39.180> as<00:02:39.269> much<00:02:39.420> as<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.660> did<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.620> it<00:02:40.680> would

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
advanced as much as it did but it would

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.020 
advanced as much as it did but it would
have<00:02:41.610> definitely<00:02:41.819> advanced<00:02:42.450> a<00:02:42.690> lot<00:02:44.030> obviously

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
have definitely advanced a lot obviously

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.490 
have definitely advanced a lot obviously
because<00:02:45.420> people<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:45.870> obviously<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.260> for

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
because people would obviously go for

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.280 
because people would obviously go for
more<00:02:46.620> spins<00:02:47.060> and<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.569> shit<00:02:48.870> as<00:02:49.049> time

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
more spins and all that shit as time

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.259 
more spins and all that shit as time
went<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.610> but<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.640> don't<00:02:50.760> think<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.030> would<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.180> as

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
went on but I don't think it would be as

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.530 
went on but I don't think it would be as
crazy<00:02:51.450> as<00:02:51.690> it<00:02:51.720> is<00:02:51.870> now<00:02:52.170> know<00:02:53.000> what<00:02:54.000> is<00:02:54.120> my<00:02:54.239> best

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
crazy as it is now know what is my best

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.410 
crazy as it is now know what is my best
memory<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.080> phase<00:02:55.410> /<00:02:55.799> gaming<00:02:56.340> my<00:02:57.180> best<00:02:57.330> memory

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
memory in phase / gaming my best memory

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.350 
memory in phase / gaming my best memory
in<00:02:57.750> phase<00:02:58.140> would<00:02:58.410> have<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.190> think<00:02:59.910> the

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
in phase would have to be I think the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.690 
in phase would have to be I think the
time<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.170> was<00:03:01.860> playing<00:03:02.040> with<00:03:02.130> like<00:03:02.250> sea<00:03:02.519> bass

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
time I was playing with like sea bass

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.720 
time I was playing with like sea bass
apex<00:03:03.239> like<00:03:03.569> Nate<00:03:04.049> just<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.040> bunch<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.250> people<00:03:05.489> I

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
apex like Nate just a bunch of people I

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.860 
apex like Nate just a bunch of people I
don't<00:03:06.030> really<00:03:06.120> remember<00:03:06.209> everyone<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
don't really remember everyone in the

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.620 
don't really remember everyone in the
party<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.290> I<00:03:07.500> hit<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.489> three<00:03:08.790> killcams<00:03:09.360> in<00:03:09.540> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
party but I hit like three killcams in a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.729 
party but I hit like three killcams in a
row<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.049> like<00:03:10.620> I<00:03:11.900> don't<00:03:12.900> know<00:03:13.109> like<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.620> back

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
row and like I don't know like it back

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:15.710 
row and like I don't know like it back
to<00:03:13.859> background<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.579> like<00:03:15.239> one<00:03:15.390> of<00:03:15.420> them<00:03:15.570> was

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
to background and like one of them was

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.090 
to background and like one of them was
really<00:03:15.959> good<00:03:16.109> it<00:03:16.200> was<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.380> prisms<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:16.980> other

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
really good it was in prisms the other

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.380 
really good it was in prisms the other
one<00:03:17.220> was<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.430> an<00:03:17.519> episode<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.299> other

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
one was in an episode I think the other

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.449 
one was in an episode I think the other
one<00:03:18.480> was<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.750> a<00:03:18.780> leftover<00:03:19.140> but<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:20.370> know

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
one was like a leftover but I don't know

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.420 
one was like a leftover but I don't know
that<00:03:20.730> was<00:03:20.820> just<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.090> a<00:03:21.120> really<00:03:21.359> fun<00:03:21.780> time<00:03:22.019> and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
that was just like a really fun time and

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.550 
that was just like a really fun time and
my<00:03:23.430> best<00:03:23.640> memory<00:03:24.600> in<00:03:24.840> gaming<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.530> general

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
my best memory in gaming in general

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.180 
my best memory in gaming in general
would<00:03:26.130> probably<00:03:26.519> be<00:03:26.690> when<00:03:27.690> uh<00:03:27.720> when<00:03:28.380> debacle

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
would probably be when uh when debacle

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.340 
would probably be when uh when debacle
went<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.430> hazard<00:03:29.880> cinema<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:31.140> was<00:03:31.230> probably

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
went on hazard cinema that was probably

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.210 
went on hazard cinema that was probably
like<00:03:31.650> the<00:03:32.519> peak<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:33.000> my<00:03:33.269> success<00:03:34.109> when<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.100> was

would<00:03:58.410> probably<00:03:58.799> be<00:03:59.010> like<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.150> wasn't<00:04:00.480> even

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
would probably be like this wasn't even

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.990 
would probably be like this wasn't even
like<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:02.250> wouldn't<00:04:02.519> be<00:04:02.579> considered<00:04:03.530> like<00:04:04.530> I

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
like it wouldn't be considered like I
