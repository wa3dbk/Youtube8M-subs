we're<00:00:48.059> doing<00:00:48.090> now<00:00:48.450> honestly<00:00:49.350> obito<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:49.980> think

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
we're doing now honestly obito I think

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.700 
we're doing now honestly obito I think
the<00:00:50.610> case<00:00:50.930> that's<00:00:51.930> happening<00:00:52.320> right<00:00:52.350> now<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
the case that's happening right now is a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.950 
the case that's happening right now is a
little<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:53.190> exclusive<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.360> don't

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
little bit exclusive to you I don't

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.170 
little bit exclusive to you I don't
think<00:00:55.079> anyone<00:00:55.620> else<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:56.399> come<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.090> the

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
think anyone else would come to the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.330 
think anyone else would come to the
exact<00:00:57.480> same<00:00:57.660> conclusion<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.320> did<00:00:58.559> over<00:00:59.250> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
exact same conclusion you did over the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.310 
exact same conclusion you did over the
exact<00:00:59.640> same<00:00:59.789> things<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.329> doesn't<00:01:00.989> seem<00:01:01.289> very

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
exact same things it doesn't seem very

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.709 
exact same things it doesn't seem very
likely<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.920> me<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.550> anyway<00:01:02.879> they're<00:01:03.390> using<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
likely to me but anyway they're using a

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.030 
likely to me but anyway they're using a
strategy<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> are<00:01:04.290> actually<00:01:04.409> trying<00:01:04.890> to

because<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.899> knew<00:01:42.899> I<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.290> remember<00:01:43.649> them

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
because I knew I don't remember them

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.630 
because I knew I don't remember them
ever<00:01:44.479> saying<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.960> his<00:01:46.530> ability<00:01:47.130> lasted<00:01:47.520> for

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
ever saying that his ability lasted for

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.690 
ever saying that his ability lasted for
five<00:01:47.729> minutes<00:01:48.380> when<00:01:49.380> where<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:50.490> was

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
five minutes when where was I when was

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.200 
five minutes when where was I when was
this<00:01:51.170> he<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.380> only<00:01:52.590> stay<00:01:53.130> invisible<00:01:53.729> 45

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
this he can only stay invisible 45

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.280 
this he can only stay invisible 45
minute<00:01:54.450> or<00:01:54.570> not<00:01:54.689> invisible<00:01:54.899> but<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
minute or not invisible but you know

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.170 
minute or not invisible but you know
what<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.439> mean<00:01:55.470> 45<00:01:56.460> minutes<00:01:57.829> mmm<00:01:59.090> all<00:02:00.090> right

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
what I mean 45 minutes mmm all right

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
what I mean 45 minutes mmm all right
where<00:02:00.689> did<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.020> I'm<00:02:01.799> confused<00:02:02.159> honestly

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
where did this I'm confused honestly

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.690 
where did this I'm confused honestly
because<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.240> feel<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.259> something

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
because I feel like this is something

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.340 
because I feel like this is something
that<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.850> would<00:02:06.030> only<00:02:06.090> have<00:02:06.509> possibly<00:02:07.110> found

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
that we would only have possibly found

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.309 
that we would only have possibly found
out<00:02:07.560> recently<00:02:08.420> but<00:02:09.420> I<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.720> remember<00:02:10.140> it

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
out recently but I don't remember it

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.030 
out recently but I don't remember it
being<00:02:10.890> brought<00:02:11.220> up<00:02:11.370> ever<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:12.060> I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
being brought up ever so I

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.740 
being brought up ever so I
know<00:02:13.129> about<00:02:13.219> that<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:13.790> anyway<00:02:14.299> apparently

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
know about that but anyway apparently

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.479 
know about that but anyway apparently
that's<00:02:15.170> how<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.560> gonna<00:02:15.709> do<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.069> it's<00:02:16.189> not<00:02:16.310> like

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
that's how we gonna do it it's not like

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.009 
that's how we gonna do it it's not like
you're<00:02:16.790> kind<00:02:16.909> of<00:02:17.000> really<00:02:17.120> play<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.569> part<00:02:17.900> in

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
you're kind of really play a part in

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.449 
you're kind of really play a part in
defeating<00:02:18.379> either<00:02:18.620> of<00:02:18.799> them<00:02:18.950> anyway<00:02:19.280> these

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
defeating either of them anyway these

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.339 
defeating either of them anyway these
random<00:02:19.909> guys<00:02:20.060> we<00:02:20.480> don't<00:02:20.569> really<00:02:20.689> see<00:02:20.930> any<00:02:21.049> like

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
random guys we don't really see any like

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.110 
random guys we don't really see any like
the<00:02:21.500> konoha<00:02:21.769> 11<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.310> hope<00:02:22.459> we<00:02:22.579> get<00:02:22.700> more<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:23.000> them

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
the konoha 11 I hope we get more of them

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.059 
the konoha 11 I hope we get more of them
later<00:02:23.329> specifically<00:02:24.079> doing<00:02:24.680> stuff<00:02:24.920> because

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
later specifically doing stuff because

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.190 
later specifically doing stuff because
right<00:02:25.219> now<00:02:25.250> it's<00:02:25.519> just<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:26.420> villages<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.019> big

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
right now it's just the villages the big

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.780 
right now it's just the villages the big
clans<00:02:27.530> of<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.769> village<00:02:28.069> doing<00:02:28.370> these<00:02:28.489> big

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
clans of the village doing these big

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.140 
clans of the village doing these big
elemental<00:02:29.750> attacks<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.370> do<00:02:31.609> hope<00:02:31.849> we<00:02:32.000> get

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
elemental attacks but I do hope we get

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.589 
elemental attacks but I do hope we get
like<00:02:32.659> Kiba<00:02:33.049> Shino<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:34.400> doing<00:02:34.939> specific<00:02:35.420> stuff

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 
like Kiba Shino not doing specific stuff

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.750 
like Kiba Shino not doing specific stuff
later<00:02:35.840> but<00:02:36.290> yeah<00:02:36.799> these<00:02:36.950> these<00:02:37.250> r<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.430> numbers

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
later but yeah these these r a numbers

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.160 
later but yeah these these r a numbers
of<00:02:37.909> people<00:02:38.030> they're<00:02:38.599> gonna<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.900> annihilated

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
of people they're gonna be annihilated

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
of people they're gonna be annihilated
especially<00:02:40.010> at<00:02:40.129> the<00:02:40.220> end<00:02:40.250> because<00:02:40.549> apparently

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
especially at the end because apparently

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.940 
especially at the end because apparently
the<00:02:41.420> juubi<00:02:41.810> is<00:02:41.930> beginning<00:02:42.379> to<00:02:42.500> reach<00:02:42.650> maturity

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
the juubi is beginning to reach maturity

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.190 
the juubi is beginning to reach maturity
and<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.670> shows<00:02:43.909> something<00:02:44.510> happening

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and it shows something happening

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.660 
and it shows something happening
couldn't<00:02:45.799> really<00:02:45.920> tell<00:02:46.099> what<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.340> was<00:02:46.370> but

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
couldn't really tell what it was but

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.000 
couldn't really tell what it was but
apparently<00:02:47.329> it's<00:02:47.480> gonna<00:02:47.599> be<00:02:47.810> bigger<00:02:48.379> faster

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
apparently it's gonna be bigger faster

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.039 
apparently it's gonna be bigger faster
stronger<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.730> all<00:02:50.359> that<00:02:50.569> good<00:02:50.689> stuff<00:02:50.750> maybe

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
stronger and all that good stuff maybe

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.929 
stronger and all that good stuff maybe
not<00:02:51.230> bigger<00:02:51.409> husband<00:02:51.859> yeah<00:02:52.430> it's<00:02:52.669> reaching

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
not bigger husband yeah it's reaching

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.460 
not bigger husband yeah it's reaching
maturity<00:02:53.060> which<00:02:53.419> is<00:02:53.510> great<00:02:53.689> so<00:02:53.959> hopefully<00:02:54.349> it

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
maturity which is great so hopefully it

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.860 
maturity which is great so hopefully it
can<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:54.709> sort<00:02:54.980> of<00:02:55.150> flick<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> few<00:02:56.540> people

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
can just sort of flick a few people

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.240 
can just sort of flick a few people
because<00:02:57.049> I<00:02:57.109> think<00:02:57.349> if<00:02:57.439> it<00:02:57.530> just<00:02:57.650> doesn't<00:02:58.040> that

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
because I think if it just doesn't that

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.270 
because I think if it just doesn't that
like<00:02:58.639> the<00:02:58.879> air<00:02:59.269> shock<00:03:00.019> wave<00:03:00.290> would<00:03:00.590> kill<00:03:01.129> at

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
like the air shock wave would kill at

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.610 
like the air shock wave would kill at
least<00:03:01.310> 75<00:03:01.970> people<00:03:02.180> so<00:03:02.989> just<00:03:03.109> do<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.470> just

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
least 75 people so just do that just

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.129 
least 75 people so just do that just
blow<00:03:03.980> on<00:03:04.250> them<00:03:04.430> just<00:03:04.489> slap<00:03:05.359> your<00:03:05.389> tentacles

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:06.139 
blow on them just slap your tentacles

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.330 
blow on them just slap your tentacles
around<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.439> little<00:03:06.530> bit<00:03:06.709> just<00:03:06.980> kill<00:03:07.159> some

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
around a little bit just kill some

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:08.890 
around a little bit just kill some
people<00:03:07.430> hopefully<00:03:07.760> some<00:03:08.120> people<00:03:08.389> who<00:03:08.510> we

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
people hopefully some people who we

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.289 
people hopefully some people who we
actually<00:03:09.290> know<00:03:09.500> but<00:03:10.250> also<00:03:10.519> a<00:03:10.730> good<00:03:11.060> majority

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:11.299 
actually know but also a good majority

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:13.360 
actually know but also a good majority
of<00:03:11.569> random<00:03:11.930> people<00:03:12.019> too<00:03:12.290> because<00:03:12.530> people<00:03:12.829> need

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
of random people too because people need

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.420 
of random people too because people need
to<00:03:13.430> die<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:13.909> this<00:03:14.090> if<00:03:14.299> they<00:03:14.389> really<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:15.049> so<00:03:15.950> it

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
to die in this if they really do so it

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.619 
to die in this if they really do so it
was<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.579> pretty<00:03:16.700> interesting<00:03:17.030> chapter<00:03:17.540> I'm

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
was a pretty interesting chapter I'm

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:19.270 
was a pretty interesting chapter I'm
glad<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.900> wasn't<00:03:18.169> it<00:03:18.379> felt<00:03:18.530> really<00:03:18.650> short<00:03:19.040> like

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
glad it wasn't it felt really short like

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.610 
glad it wasn't it felt really short like
after<00:03:20.000> I<00:03:20.030> was<00:03:20.239> over<00:03:20.449> I<00:03:20.479> was<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:20.659> what<00:03:21.260> that

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
after I was over I was like what that

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.949 
after I was over I was like what that
was<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.799> was<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:21.949> whole<00:03:22.099> thing<00:03:22.159> but<00:03:23.090> I'm

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959

it was pretty pointless because nothing

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.469
