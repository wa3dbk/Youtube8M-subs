00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
at the actual seeds that are contained

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.840 
at the actual seeds that are contained
within<00:01:09.259> these<00:01:10.100> orchid<00:01:11.030> seed<00:01:11.990> pods<00:01:12.580> okay<00:01:13.580> folks

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
within these orchid seed pods okay folks

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.230 
within these orchid seed pods okay folks
so<00:01:14.090> as<00:01:14.300> you<00:01:14.840> can<00:01:15.020> see<00:01:15.080> here<00:01:15.729> these<00:01:16.729> are<00:01:17.180> the

blow away those are all of its thousands
and<00:01:28.130> thousands<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.150> seeds<00:01:29.509> so<00:01:29.869> we're<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:30.710> to

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
and thousands of seeds so we're going to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.550 
and thousands of seeds so we're going to
show<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.070> how<00:01:31.430> it<00:01:31.790> disperses<00:01:32.330> from<00:01:33.259> these

show you how it disperses from these
seed<00:01:33.860> pods<00:01:34.390> tada

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
seed pods tada

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.429 
seed pods tada
and<00:01:36.909> they<00:01:37.909> just<00:01:38.119> blow<00:01:38.360> here<00:01:38.869> there<00:01:39.170> and

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
and they just blow here there and

you see that look at all those seeds Wow

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.039 
you see that look at all those seeds Wow
what<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.250> wonder<00:02:10.850> it<00:02:11.000> would<00:02:11.150> be<00:02:11.390> if<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:11.930> could

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
what a wonder it would be if we could

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:16.509 
what a wonder it would be if we could
actually<00:02:12.489> grow<00:02:13.489> all<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.970> these<00:02:14.870> seeds<00:02:15.519> isn't

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
actually grow all of these seeds isn't

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.420 
actually grow all of these seeds isn't
it<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.640> shame<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:17.120> your<00:02:17.299> average<00:02:17.480> grower<00:02:18.430> even

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it a shame that your average grower even

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.470 
it a shame that your average grower even
though<00:02:19.579> it's<00:02:19.850> falling<00:02:20.450> all<00:02:21.110> over<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.650> place

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
though it's falling all over the place

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.580 
though it's falling all over the place
cannot<00:02:23.480> grow<00:02:23.989> these<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:27.190> regular<00:02:28.269> basis

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
cannot grow these on a regular basis

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.339 
cannot grow these on a regular basis
because<00:02:30.590> folks<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.549> create<00:02:32.090> these<00:02:32.690> seedlings

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
because folks to create these seedlings

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.910 
because folks to create these seedlings
from<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.189> actual<00:02:35.519> seeds<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.969> an<00:02:36.060> orchid<00:02:36.390> it

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
from the actual seeds of an orchid it

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.809 
from the actual seeds of an orchid it
actually<00:02:37.920> takes<00:02:38.189> a<00:02:38.340> certain<00:02:38.639> type<00:02:38.790> of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
actually takes a certain type of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.170 
actually takes a certain type of
bacteria<00:02:39.290> within<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.439> rainforests<00:02:41.280> or<00:02:41.370> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
bacteria within the rainforests or the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.500 
bacteria within the rainforests or the
place<00:02:42.540> that<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:43.079> originates<00:02:43.709> from<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:45.209> create

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
place that it originates from to create

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
place that it originates from to create
the<00:02:45.689> seeds<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.260> if<00:02:46.889> it<00:02:47.010> doesn't<00:02:47.219> get<00:02:47.489> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
the seeds and if it doesn't get that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.920 
the seeds and if it doesn't get that
type<00:02:48.090> of<00:02:48.170> bacteria<00:02:49.170> it<00:02:50.129> will<00:02:50.400> not<00:02:50.549> grow<00:02:50.930> but

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
type of bacteria it will not grow but

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.569 
type of bacteria it will not grow but
looks<00:02:52.739> like<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.189> artificial<00:02:53.819> snow<00:02:55.129> so<00:02:56.129> an

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579 
looks like that artificial snow so an

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.479 
looks like that artificial snow so an
actual<00:02:57.030> reality<00:02:57.299> it<00:02:57.689> really<00:02:57.719> takes<00:02:58.709> an<00:02:58.980> expert

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
actual reality it really takes an expert

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.209 
actual reality it really takes an expert
to<00:03:00.329> create<00:03:00.859> these<00:03:01.859> plants<00:03:02.849> from<00:03:03.239> seeds

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219 
to create these plants from seeds

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.449 
to create these plants from seeds
usually<00:03:05.219> in<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.430> lab<00:03:05.669> dealing<00:03:06.510> with<00:03:06.659> flasks

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
usually in a lab dealing with flasks

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.209 
usually in a lab dealing with flasks
dealing<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.700> all<00:03:09.299> sorts<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.930> chemicals<00:03:10.560> and

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:11.219 
dealing with all sorts of chemicals and

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:17.179 
dealing with all sorts of chemicals and
of<00:03:11.549> course<00:03:11.879> your<00:03:13.730> antibacterials<00:03:15.199> yeah<00:03:16.199> it

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:17.189 
of course your antibacterials yeah it

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.819 
of course your antibacterials yeah it
really<00:03:17.489> is<00:03:17.849> some<00:03:18.510> kind<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:18.989> work<00:03:19.199> to<00:03:19.230> get<00:03:19.620> these

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
really is some kind of work to get these
