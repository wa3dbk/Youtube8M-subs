00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
do is try and kill the ghost first not

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.920 
do is try and kill the ghost first not
not<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.500> your<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.979> arc<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.150> EMP<00:01:09.689> or

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
not get your little arc on EMP or
whatever<00:01:10.290> because<00:01:10.740> uh<00:01:10.920> because<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.939> could

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
whatever because uh because if we could

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.380 
whatever because uh because if we could
impede<00:01:12.360> your<00:01:12.630> GG<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:14.100> anyways<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.939> idea<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
impede your GG but anyways the idea is

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.010 
impede your GG but anyways the idea is
to<00:01:15.420> be<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> last<00:01:15.840> person<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.530> fight

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
to be the last person in a fight

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.350 
to be the last person in a fight
otherwise<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.409> will<00:01:19.530> lose<00:01:19.729> yep<00:01:20.729> just<00:01:21.299> like

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
otherwise you will lose yep just like

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.880 
otherwise you will lose yep just like
that<00:01:21.450> but<00:01:21.840> anyways<00:01:22.290> I<00:01:22.409> don't<00:01:22.530> have<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> chance

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that but anyways I don't have a chance

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.170 
that but anyways I don't have a chance
there<00:01:23.070> because<00:01:23.310> they<00:01:23.520> threw<00:01:23.820> me<00:01:23.909> right<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
there because they threw me right in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.160 
there because they threw me right in the
middle<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.689> don't<00:01:24.810> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> spawn

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
middle of it you don't want to spawn

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.990 
middle of it you don't want to spawn
their<00:01:25.350> own<00:01:25.500> apparently<00:01:25.920> best<00:01:26.520> place<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:26.970> is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
their own apparently best place to be is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
their own apparently best place to be is
right<00:01:27.299> here<00:01:27.479> in<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.170> of<00:01:28.200> these<00:01:28.320> corners<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
right here in one of these corners so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.069 
right here in one of these corners so
that<00:01:29.509> everyone<00:01:30.509> else<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.780> fighting<00:01:30.990> each

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
that everyone else is fighting each

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
that everyone else is fighting each
other<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.920> really<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.400> be

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
to it like said to the ghost impede them

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.100 
to it like said to the ghost impede them
first<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:38.759> can't<00:01:38.970> impede<00:01:39.240> your<00:01:39.360> arc<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.010 
first so we can't impede your arc on and
then<00:01:40.710> impede<00:01:41.070> our<00:01:41.189> con<00:01:41.400> down<00:01:41.780> while<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:42.869> kill

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
then impede our con down while you kill

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.499 
then impede our con down while you kill
the<00:01:43.110> ghost<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.710> can't<00:01:43.920> snipe<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.509> Gigi

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:27.340 
where the tanks will be coming really
really<00:03:26.450> fast<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.840> got<00:03:26.959> to<00:03:26.989> go<00:03:27.140> through<00:03:27.170> this

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
really fast you got to go through this

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.280 
really fast you got to go through this
little<00:03:27.530> bitty<00:03:27.709> mays<00:03:27.920> here<00:03:28.250> and<00:03:28.459> the<00:03:29.330> idea<00:03:29.630> is

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
little bitty mays here and the idea is

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.590 
little bitty mays here and the idea is
to<00:03:30.590> wait<00:03:30.890> for<00:03:30.920> it<00:03:31.280> to<00:03:31.310> slow<00:03:31.640> down<00:03:31.880> because<00:03:32.120> once

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
to wait for it to slow down because once

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.910 
to wait for it to slow down because once
the<00:03:32.690> start<00:03:32.870> slowing<00:03:33.019> down<00:03:33.200> as<00:03:33.410> lot<00:03:33.560> easy<00:03:33.709> go

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
the start slowing down as lot easy go

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.750 
the start slowing down as lot easy go
through<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.870> once<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.230> holy<00:03:37.070> crap<00:03:37.430> almost

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
through but once it holy crap almost

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.229 
through but once it holy crap almost
died<00:03:37.910> there<00:03:39.280> once<00:03:40.280> it<00:03:40.400> gets<00:03:40.580> really<00:03:40.790> slow

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
died there once it gets really slow

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.460 
died there once it gets really slow
it'll<00:03:41.450> actually<00:03:41.630> turn<00:03:41.959> around<00:03:42.200> go<00:03:42.320> the<00:03:42.440> other

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
it'll actually turn around go the other

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.509 
it'll actually turn around go the other
way<00:03:43.450> sounds<00:03:44.450> oh<00:03:44.739> snap<00:03:45.739> where<00:03:46.100> did<00:03:46.220> that<00:03:46.310> come

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
there's going to be tanks coming on all

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.090 
there's going to be tanks coming on all
these<00:03:55.670> sides<00:03:55.910> here<00:03:56.209> and<00:03:56.530> what<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.620> want<00:03:57.769> to<00:03:57.860> do

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
in the middle to blow up and that's

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:05.560 
in the middle to blow up and that's
going<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.700> make<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:04.940> lot<00:04:05.060> easier<00:04:05.090> there's<00:04:05.480> no

you<00:04:07.459> go<00:04:07.640> through<00:04:07.670> the<00:04:07.940> sides<00:04:08.180> they<00:04:08.600> die<00:04:08.810> so

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
you go through the sides they die so

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.630 
you go through the sides they die so
maybe<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.830> can<00:04:09.920> make<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:10.160> to<00:04:10.220> this<00:04:10.280> side<00:04:10.459> if

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
maybe you can make it to this side if

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.730 
maybe you can make it to this side if
you<00:04:10.730> practice<00:04:11.090> a<00:04:11.120> little<00:04:11.209> bit

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740
