 i 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:23.960
 in a pitÃ©r ix file 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.360
 they lived together with the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.559
 dinosaurs during the Jurassic period 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:33.410
 about 150 million years ago on the site 

00:00:30.559 --> 00:00:34.660
 in which today it locates if the continent 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.260
 European 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:43.210
 its name means the old ones in Latin 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:48.859
 its fossil was discovered in Germany in 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:52.190
 1861 on a limestone rock was an animal 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:55.640
 carnivorous and fed primarily on 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 insects their size could reach up to 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.460
 one meter in length and its weight up to 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.010
 four kilos 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.020
 Recent studies have shown that their 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.350
 skull was larger than that of most 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:13.840
 dinosaurs indicating that the brain was 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.259
 big enough to allow it to fly 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:21.829
 the architect and ex has wide wings and 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.590
 asymmetrical teeth and tail feathers 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:26.000
 were very similar to those of the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.060
 reptiles 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.659
 scientists believe that the 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:36.950
 his flight was different from that of the current birds 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:40.909
 being more like populus or jumps 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.640
 in addition the wings had three fingers 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:48.439
 that would serve to grasp the branches of the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.320
 trees and assist in the ascent to the 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.380
 vision- related brain corresponds to 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.829
 approximately one third of it and others 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.590
 well developed regions were the 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.179
 responsible for the hearing and 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.310
 motor coordination archeopteryx is 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.489
 very important in the study of evolution 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.450
 of animals because through it it is 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:17.019
 understand the link that explains how birds 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.019
 emerged
