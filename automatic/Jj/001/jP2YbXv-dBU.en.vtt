recently<00:00:12.809> did<00:00:13.170> from<00:00:13.620> bracket<00:00:14.070> airport<00:00:14.430> into

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
recently did from bracket airport into

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.320 
recently did from bracket airport into
Catalina

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
Catalina

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.600 
Catalina
it<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.719> IFR<00:00:16.170> there<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.620> some<00:00:16.830> IMC<00:00:17.280> inside

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
it was IFR there was some IMC inside

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.040 
it was IFR there was some IMC inside
clouds<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.510> interesting<00:00:18.840> thing<00:00:18.990> about

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
clouds but the interesting thing about

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.320 
clouds but the interesting thing about
this<00:00:19.320> flight<00:00:19.560> was<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.430> ATC<00:00:20.970> gave<00:00:21.180> me

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
this flight was that the ATC gave me

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.210 
this flight was that the ATC gave me
some<00:00:21.510> directions<00:00:21.960> during<00:00:22.230> my<00:00:22.320> approach<00:00:22.740> that

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
some directions during my approach that

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.280 
some directions during my approach that
did<00:00:23.400> not<00:00:23.550> make<00:00:23.700> sense<00:00:23.940> to<00:00:24.060> me<00:00:24.270> basically<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.960> was

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
did not make sense to me basically I was

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.580 
did not make sense to me basically I was
flying<00:00:25.950> to<00:00:26.100> 6-0<00:00:26.790> to<00:00:27.090> intercept<00:00:27.600> the<00:00:27.720> vor/dme

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
flying to 6-0 to intercept the vor/dme

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.010 
flying to 6-0 to intercept the vor/dme
final<00:00:28.920> approach<00:00:29.190> of<00:00:29.400> 172<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.480> Catalina

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
final approach of 172 into Catalina

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.200 
final approach of 172 into Catalina
at<00:00:31.170> one<00:00:31.530> point<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.920> ATC<00:00:32.460> said<00:00:32.700> turn<00:00:32.940> heading

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
at one point the ATC said turn heading

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.180 
at one point the ATC said turn heading
one<00:00:33.600> five<00:00:33.870> zero<00:00:33.899> clear<00:00:34.440> for<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.649> approach<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
one five zero clear for the approach a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.799 
one five zero clear for the approach a
heading<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.030> five<00:00:36.239> zero<00:00:36.270> would<00:00:36.719> have

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
heading of one five zero would have

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.029 
heading of one five zero would have
taken<00:00:37.079> me<00:00:37.199> from<00:00:37.379> the<00:00:37.499> final<00:00:37.800> approach<00:00:38.010> course

00:00:38.029 --> 00:00:38.039 
taken me from the final approach course

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:41.060 
taken me from the final approach course
of<00:00:38.519> 172<00:00:39.179> but<00:00:39.839> because<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.289> ATC's<00:00:40.829> don't

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of 172 but because the ATC's don't

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.189 
of 172 but because the ATC's don't
usually<00:00:41.249> make<00:00:41.609> mistakes<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.050> thing

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
usually make mistakes the first thing

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.720 
usually make mistakes the first thing
that<00:00:43.230> happened<00:00:43.620> was<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.829> questioned<00:00:44.219> myself<00:00:44.370> am

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
that happened was I questioned myself am

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.700 
that happened was I questioned myself am
I<00:00:44.940> where<00:00:45.210> I'm<00:00:45.300> supposed<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.719> be<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:46.499> was<00:00:46.620> an

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
I where I'm supposed to be it was an

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.079 
I where I'm supposed to be it was an
interesting<00:00:46.890> fight<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.519> was<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> great

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
interesting fight it was a great

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.509 
interesting fight it was a great
learning<00:00:48.359> experience<00:00:48.649> it<00:00:49.649> reinforced<00:00:50.280> into

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
learning experience it reinforced into

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:52.160 
learning experience it reinforced into
my<00:00:50.640> head<00:00:50.850> make<00:00:51.269> sure<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.659> know<00:00:51.839> where<00:00:52.019> you<00:00:52.140> are

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
at all times because even the ATC s can

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.419 
at all times because even the ATC s can
make<00:00:54.960> mistake<00:00:55.319> anyway<00:00:55.739> guys<00:00:55.890> I'm<00:00:56.219> going<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
gave me the clearance to do the approach

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:02.450 
gave me the clearance to do the approach
so<00:01:00.600> enjoy<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.319> rest<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.499> this<00:01:01.589> video<00:01:01.890> I'll<00:01:02.249> see
