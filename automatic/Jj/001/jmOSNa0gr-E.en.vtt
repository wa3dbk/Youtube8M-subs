00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 Ok? 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.550
 Thank you! 

00:00:26.088 --> 00:00:28.088
 &gt;&gt; Did you choose the number or did they give it to you? &lt;&lt; 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.555
 No no, I chose it! &gt; He chose it. 

00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:32.020
 &gt;&gt; Why? &lt;&lt; Well, because I saw small numbers there were few ... 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.020
 I liked a big number with 9 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.898
 then the 7 and 9 are two numbers that I like and I put them together 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 Stefano Giacomelli. The final blow of the Pescara transfer market. Welcome to Pescara! 

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:51.024
 Well .. thank you so much for how you accepted me today 

00:00:51.025 --> 00:00:58.425
 and from today I am available to this company 

00:00:58.426 --> 00:00:59.726
 and I hope to do well until the end. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.200
 The directors and the president explained that they had taken you away from a very nourished competition 

00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:11.401
 Sassuolo in extremis, but above all Benevento and Cagliari of your old master Bisoli. 

00:01:11.902 --> 00:01:16.702
 Yes I want to thank above all the president for the beautiful words expressed towards me anyway 

00:01:16.703 --> 00:01:23.103
 there were so many teams that still wanted me to go to them 

00:01:23.104 --> 00:01:27.404
 I immediately chose Pescara because it was one of the squares that shared 

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:29.505
 more important than this Serie B and I'm happy to be a part of it 

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:31.206
 of this company. 

00:01:31.507 --> 00:01:37.807
 Not yet 21 years from April 30th, but already a vast experience 

00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:44.908
 you were the first Foligno player to be called up to a national team 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.659
 70 appearances in Serie C, in short, a player already ready. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.260
 Yes, I still have championships behind me and I don't say much experience 

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.361
 because absolutely of road there is however to make of it however these years in which 

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:01.862
 I played in Foligno where I definitely left a piece of my heart 

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:07.563
 and in fact I want to greet and thank everyone, they have served me so much. 

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:14.664
 and I still hope to face this challenge with certainly very high motivations 

00:02:14.665 --> 00:02:19.665
 and I hope to give my best with this shirt I am already fond of. 

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:26.666
 For the fans who know you less: what kind of technical features do you have and the role in which you would prefer to play? 

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:30.967
 Well ... anyway I like one against one and dribbling. 

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:36.268
 and those are certainly the most important qualities I have of me. 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.069
 The roles where I like to play are many. Now the coach will decide 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.070
 I am available he will choose the best position for me to play. 

00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.571
 CEO Sebastiani at your press conference already has you 

00:02:51.572 --> 00:02:55.572
 defined the protégé of President De Cecco. Do you know this is a big responsibility? 

00:02:55.573 --> 00:02:59.173
 Yes, absolutely yes! And indeed as I said 

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:03.974
 thank you all for the nice words said now it will be up to me to prove 

00:03:04.075 --> 00:03:05.875
 all I am worth. 

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:07.440
 In conclusion a curiosity: 

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.431
 did you choose number 79, why? 

00:03:09.432 --> 00:03:13.853
 Well ... there were few small numbers, I liked a high number 

00:03:13.854 --> 00:03:19.308
 and I want to keep it for myself. Although 7 and 9 are two numbers that I like. 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:20.709
 Thank you. Thank you. 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
 Thank you all for watching. Until next time!
