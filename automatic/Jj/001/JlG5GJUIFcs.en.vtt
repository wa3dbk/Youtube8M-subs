doing it one of the problems with this
is<00:02:40.760> when<00:02:41.060> you<00:02:41.180> stop<00:02:41.510> somebody<00:02:41.959> doing

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
is when you stop somebody doing

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.740 
is when you stop somebody doing
something<00:02:42.530> one<00:02:42.980> way<00:02:43.300> they<00:02:44.300> know<00:02:44.510> they've<00:02:44.720> been

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
something one way they know they've been

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.540 
something one way they know they've been
stopped<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.530> so<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:45.920> gives<00:02:46.130> them<00:02:46.280> an<00:02:46.400> option

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
stopped and so it gives them an option

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.870 
stopped and so it gives them an option
to<00:02:46.790> do<00:02:46.910> something<00:02:47.360> else<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.810> know<00:02:47.900> and<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.880> kind

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
to do something else you know and I kind

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.220 
to do something else you know and I kind
of<00:02:49.970> lose<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.390> advantage

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
of lose this advantage

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.280 
of lose this advantage
another<00:02:51.680> thing<00:02:51.920> might<00:02:52.130> be<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.550> to<00:02:52.670> run
