00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.700
 the staffs are all good, I speak and today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:13.469
 I came to talk about the book willon I received from 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.719
 structure the anticipated proof of the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.310
 book in the test and then 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.960
 I finished reading already I would like to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.320
 recorded for you before but I waited 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.510
 get a free physical that's it here 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.330
 super beautiful, thanks, law 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
 Anyway, let's go in Milan, the fault is not 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.769
 of the third year book stars 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.750
 person and tell them the willow routine that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.030
 is a young orphan who moved in with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.030
 her brother after the death of her parents she 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.160
 blame for the tragedy and to punish and 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 to mask emotional pain with pain 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.649
 physics it cuts itself almost every day 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.989
 hawilla finds in self- mutilation a 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.420
 way to live your mourning and to punish yourself 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.280
 for having killed their parents and as 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 let's follow the narrative 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.840
 we realize why she blame herself and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.000
 this sentiment is understandable. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.440
 our character suffers but this does not 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
 justifies what it does to one 's own 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 The narrative begins by throwing us into the 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.260
 universe of the character and soon in the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.689
 The first chapter already has a scene where 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.670
 the voter cutting himself I took a baita 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 I suspect her scene because I thought she 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.259
 was killing himself and I thought the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.369
 from the narrative would be before the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.439
 her death 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.140
 telling her why she killed herself and everything 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.140
 but that's not what we found it is 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.540
 she is still alive and other scenes of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.759
 self-mutilation are described here what 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.070
 gave me a lot of agony and we are very scenes 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 strong and well described and I do not 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.700
 I know why the light came to mind 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.680
 Video scene cutting his own hand in 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.720
 19 suburb clip when this 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850
 first write the villain chapter 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.340
 I'm really scared I do not like this 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.299
 kind of scene but read on to me ok 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.579
 only that leaves me half knows how to bother 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.850
 When I go to sleep, I keep thinking about it. 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:57.270
 but I imagine in a lighter way the 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.670
 that it would be a movie and even though this 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.860
 agony that the scenes that the oea or 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.790
 cut causes the reader not to be 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.890
 nice 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.990
 this is good because it shows that the author 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.489
 knew very well to play us in the universe of 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.800
 Author character knew very well 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.800
 described the universe of this character and the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.290
 what we see here 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.780
 It's like going to work on her problem, she 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.840
 you do not allow yourself to feel anything other than 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.820
 of the physical pain that causes itself 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.510
 the guilt he feels for the death of his 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.700
 parents 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.410
 and we understand this reaction over there not 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.300
 to have conceded the goal in a natural way 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.560
 which is what happens to the older brother 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.510
 old for example 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.370
 we understand that to get rid of this 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.620
 of the weight she carries on her back 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.230
 to cry and live their grief of a 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.550
 appropriate way to naturally cry the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.650
 loss of parents 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.580
 the problem here is that al hillu does not want 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.950
 to change 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.990
 only that she knows a boy and 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.000
 slowly with his help she goes 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.780
 beginning to feel other things inside 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.120
 said 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.100
 beyond pain this plot may even seem 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.170
 a bit clichÃ© but do not start reading 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.240
 willow looking for romance because 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.760
 fortunately the author addresses the problems 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.280
 the character of your main theme and 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.500
 leaves the novel in the third plane is a 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.580
 very small base it exists 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.350
 I just do not feel like running away 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.040
 screaming does not feel like dying does not give 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.110
 want to die with them in some 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.940
 moments when he irritates with this 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.920
 Do not let me do it, I can not 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.410
 feel I can not feel all the time 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.660
 she irritates and she ends up hurting 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.050
 people around you this also causes 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.510
 uncomfortable in addition to that she thinks that only 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.950
 pain it is important that the suffering 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.810
 other people does not matter because 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.310
 other people have not lost their parents and 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.090
 two people did not kill their own 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.650
 parents 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.660
 At that moment I read the book very 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.980
 anger rush out of the form of romance 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.510
 but I ran away 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.390
 but later when I picked it up again 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
 seek to understand the character's side 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.770
 understand her suffering and came back to 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.930
 strong steady reading and leaving a little of 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.370
 Willon 's character universe here 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.670
 we also accompany your older brother 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.200
 old the david and the guy that boy 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.690
 who discovered the secret of willow and 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.730
 ends up helping her in some way and with 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.170
 these characters are we have another one 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.000
 subject addressed 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.489
 both carry forming too heavy 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.800
 that appear out of nowhere in their lives and that 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:10.720
 should not exist, both complain that 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.150
 life has thrown you a big problem 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.400
 too much and that things are not taking 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.380
 the direction they should have taken and thus 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.970
 as with willow people 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.240
 can understand the feeling that 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:24.820
 they are not overdone but can 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.420
 seems a bit selfish since everything 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.090
 world goes by 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:30.460
 that's why everyone has problems that 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.860
 I do not think I should have it and life like that 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.330
 a box of surprises but it seems that 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.200
 this character still do not understand 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.840
 that 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.550
 how are most people going to eat 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.980
 then ilan is a book that provokes 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.620
 various feelings the reader to a book 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.420
 'the mixed but without exaggeration and 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.550
 really plays universe that the 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.110
 characters meet and as a message 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.630
 the book shows us that it does not always exist 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.240
 the culprit for the events of life 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.910
 some things just happen and 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.130
 we have to let ourselves feel in 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.840
 allows you to feel everything that life 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.240
 shows us why in the end 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.400
 she is an explosion of feelings and 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.290
 another message that stays sharp 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.150
 during reading is that we should not be 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:12.820
 selfish about the feelings of others 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.740
 your problem always appears an arc of the 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.360
 neighbor but that's not why I do not have 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.670
 The right to suffer your way I 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.190
 I liked to hear him and lead this 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:23.620
 foundation that I made the few defects 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:26.550
 the things that is the easy pilot sometimes 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.050
 irritates and rotates 41 pages of this book 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.700
 so I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.770
