00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.419
 [Applause] 

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.130
 a few years ago I happened to see 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.690
 a cheater in action was playing with 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.940
 four players and what was more 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 fantastic that these players knew 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.679
 who now freed as he says lubrano 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.660
 a question arises if these 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.400
 men knew he was good because there 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.490
 they played together with an obvious question 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
 a very simple answer for the players 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.250
 they had seen that the baron had 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.029
 the four deposited on the fund in March 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 axes and after making a cut like 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.309
 this turned the cards fascinated and 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.300
 boards were still there at the bottom of the deck 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.190
 one of the four took courage to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 save that if they had been a 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.460
 insert those axes at different points 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.829
 of March the barman would have been in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.610
 able to trace the launch I accept the 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.079
 challenge 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.180
 and the players dispersed the cards in 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 this is the first April player 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.640
 paper fan a little less well than how 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.370
 I made four cards and then took them 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.440
 also card from the table of the second ace 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:05.519
 and executes notary then taken some paper 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.229
 from here it is complete to the cut to that point 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.670
 the ball picked up the cards, tried 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.409
 today to identify the position of the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.970
 aces is not good weather 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.490
 the third player tore off the cards 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.290
 from the hands he took the third ace to perform 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.500
 a cut to take some paper from here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.509
 and then complete when cut 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.670
 finally to the fourth last player taken 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.650
 the fourth and final ace made a cut 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.360
 he took the remaining cards and put them on 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 table and for example the cut as heads 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.979
 cards to the bar before launching 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.009
 track down the boards he said he will have 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.689
 to be who could have played a 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.450
 particular game to the game of who 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.820
 he cut the highest card and won 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.290
 this to warm up 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.820
 the game practically explains it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.009
 briefly consists that if a player 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 cut a 7 the dance has to cut one 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.229
 card of higher value but one of the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.060
 four told him if you are really good 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.689
 you have to cut a value card 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 the card is superior but of the same suit 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.530
 start the first player if you want one 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.630
 series of cuts like these cuts to a king 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.920
 the king of hearts at that time did not 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.840
 a cape of hearts would have sufficed 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.849
 whatever it took 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.619
 the ace of hearts that the cheater took of 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.620
 cards with one hand make a cut e 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.330
 I cut the second heartily 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.190
 player I think it was just about 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.280
 luck make a series of cuts e 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.870
 even he cut looks at is also in 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.599
 this case was not enough 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.459
 whatever paintings we wanted, I leave 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.440
 of paintings the ball still picked up the cards 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.959
 Human tissue performs a cut and cut 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.000
 to the ace of diamonds the third player 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.470
 Captain, it was just luck 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.480
 and after making a series of cuts 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.790
 as these turn the cards face up 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.650
 and randomly between ion that he is a king a 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.930
 king of flowers and as you may have guessed not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.620
 was enough of a paper flowers there any 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.849
 He wanted 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.130
 born the solution is he thiolas the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.200
 fourth player was resigned and challenged 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.299
 still at the post after cutting 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.599
 he also casually offers a king of 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.780
 spades 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.090
 the is to cut a spade card 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.610
 that would have indicated him in the deck la 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.220
 position of the fourth and last ash e 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.620
 obviously he had to make her cut one 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.069
 card of the same suit the cheater 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:15.870
 presented with one hand and cut at a 5 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:17.850
 against a two three four cards and spin 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:23.190
 the last card that was the fourth e 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:25.530
 last to the four players did not stay 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.680
 than go home to their four 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.680
 women
