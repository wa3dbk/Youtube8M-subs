00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.579

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:02.390
 throw it but clear to see where you put it 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:05.290
 I'm going to remove this so you can see 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.320
 the detail of the black box 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.570
 and how it takes a lot to get what 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.110
 that inside there will be an ellipse and 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.750
 we continue 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.460
 Well, here you have it, we have taken 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.620
 quite in taking it out of the box but 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.620
 well here you have the titan 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.920
 how big the box has a lot to do 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.470
 with all the protections that the 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.630
 figure the figure of the titan because as 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.729
 you see is a pass of figure is very 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.040
 big to pull it normal in the 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.479
 collectors editions and it comes very 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.070
 protected comes very very protected 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.440
 then that makes the box 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.450
 they remain in volume as you have seen and 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.970
 well here you have the figure is the queen 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.460
 of the crown 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.440
 the titan has several soldiers has a 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.930
 soldier over and a couple of soldiers that 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.540
 you have to place we have to place 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.700
 us in the quality of the details 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.200
 of the soldiers is not too high 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.690
 for what we are used to but 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.260
 well they are secondary here 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.270
 absolute protagonist is is the atlas that 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.680
 As you can see, it looks fantastic 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.860
 that yes you have to have a space 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.770
 quite large on the house shelf 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 in the middle of the living room table to be able 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.500
 place to hang this figure 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.740
 what else leads to the collector's edition 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.920
 well little more really the titan is 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.890
 practically the one that encompasses all the 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.220
 as you can see the edition of the 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.950
 wang box is simple we are going to 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.810
 standard scale does not bring those boxes 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.940
 metal we like so much but 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:40.160
 good if you have the typical art book 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.290
 of the game pretty cool with more than 190 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.709
 pages since you already know with the 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.110
 illustrations the sketches all the 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.590
 details of each weapon each 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.630
 each titan each character design 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.370
 well here they like these things to me 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.480
 I like art books so much 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.250
 it's pretty cool it's an edition 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.470
 also very very pretty and also includes 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.310
 a poster a pretty cool poster 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.560
 which is as if it were a scheme of 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.180
 Atlas Titan 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:18.420
 and nothing else the edition number 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.030
 we have the 33 thousand 598 number 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.250
 of the collector's edition and good here 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.110
 you have the titan I think that in Spain they are 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.110
 sold out the collectors editions 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.200
 of the field already sold out before leaving 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.260
 of the game the sale but good I think 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.560
 than in the second-hand portals 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.130
 ads are growing like 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.600
 mushrooms so if you want a give 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.850
 a round the internet and alomejor 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.560
 paying a little more of the almost 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.560
 three hundred euros that cost in store 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.560
 the special edition is already
