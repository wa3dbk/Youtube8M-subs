00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:05.020
 videos and finally regarding computers assembled challenges 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.230
 University of San Carlos of Guatemala 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.669
 Faculty of Engineering 

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.259
 description of the athletic desire we will develop a cream ice cream 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.059
 week using basic techniques like this 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.329
 enterate scenic 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:18.570
 indispensable for me 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.489
 world in 3d 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.489
 initially we added a plane that at the origin 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.130
 then we divide 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.519
 parties 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.319
 so much that they face 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:33.770
 In the left side 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.230
 lateral on the left 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.590
 right sorry 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.980
 we add the images 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.230
 we tune the images so that others are in agreement 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.510
 we climb 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 our plane 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.659
 and we leave one of the four 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:51.310
 what we have 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.960
 after this 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.610
 we add 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.930
 much color 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.900
 mirror 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.990
 and we start destroying as we see in the sequence of images 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.970
 little by little as you are seeing 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.270
 according to our 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.370
 nature of our human head 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.590
 We were coupling to it as we see 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.820
 let's add 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.310
 little by little everything 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.210
 for the eyes that we say 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.230
 a circle 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.140
 in which 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.210
 we are going inward 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.210
 shaping akon lathes of our 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.550
 little by little we are adding it 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.930
 I'm watching then we move to the mouth part we add a circle 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 the optimum of the show make up the mouth 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.700
 we were 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.000
 slowly 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.740
 and then we do a similar technique 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.430
 to the initial 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.850
 where company mounts the barbie 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.830
 up to the forehead 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.060
 a little bit below the barbie or how we look 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.870
 back of the head 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.030
 and up 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.359
 this will be modified at the end because the sky in a simpler way 

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.779
 perform it in another way 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.509
 we started modeling 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.509
 giving a clear image our eyes 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.779
 to make it more natural 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:20.829
 and they were devised 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.689
 impacted so to speak more 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.209
 more aesthetic 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.359
 let's add the same geometry 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.649
 ours 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:31.719
 giving him 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:33.679
 the shape 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.739
 necessary for that proper tiger 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.139
 as we have the final result 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.299
 of our eye 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.249
 then we add a sphere 

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.499
 and the mirror we add the parts lose common 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.889
 It is the beginning of this multicolored 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:51.990
 as we see the 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.209
 the sphere remains 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.909
 like on top of ours 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.220
 - You were like that 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.319
 mold surface couple it 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.849
 modifying 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.479
 the surface then we follow 

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:06.969
 with his nose giving him more 

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.499
 geometry 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.889
 little by little we add this technique that we are seeing 

00:03:11.889 --> 00:03:13.829
 This studio 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.679
 a bergese 

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:17.919
 we unite 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.280
 we do that with 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.529
 the double key b 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.009
 the less option 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.189
 i ap center that as both join two vertices 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:28.709
 I'm very useful 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.909
 and then we continue 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.760
 I'm looking in 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.179
 delort of the nostril 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:37.579
 and adding 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.039
 little depth to make it look real 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.999
 we follow 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 and how we have to be ramÃ³n the inner part of the nose 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.730
 and we continue upwards I'm seeing in the middle of both eyes 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.999
 adding him 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:53.219
 the skills this is done 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:55.799
 selecting the vertices where we want 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.079
 the letters possessions 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.129
 and the key 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.039
 and with this we are going to give 

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:04.859
 little by little the faces 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.469
 where more textures 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:08.159
 and we passed 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.759
 to the part of the mouth 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.239
 in the courts we played I'm seeing that we do it with the key 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.689
 ok the key that stop exclude 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:20.799
 inward of her 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.159
 of the area where we are studying 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.819
 I did not feel like we have little popular has riding a 

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.569
 a finish 

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.419
 to our 3d model 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:31.889
 plus 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.559
 similar 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:34.870
 almada 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:36.969
 to the rial 

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:39.370
 as we have natural 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.210
 in each one of us 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.900
 we see that 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.440
 the various subjects 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.710
 fleshy as it should be 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.710
 not as flat as if they looked at the beginning 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.639
 little by little we are adding more metier as we need it 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:57.219
 when adding more than I put 

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:59.550
 our computer 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.180
 it will become a bit slower 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 so we must take into account that 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:07.409
 perform 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.379
 so much geometry 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.629
 we should only use the necessary 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.529
 as we see 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:19.009
 we have added margin of foot on the inside of the mouth we are going to 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.909
 start modeling 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:22.449
 customers the 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:23.939
 fairies gums 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:25.650
 as we see 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.650
 we must be inside the left part 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.770
 excluding the part around the mouth 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.889
 as we have in the sequence of images 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.850
 little by little studying in the part 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.449
 Inside the mouth 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.680
 for later 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.169
 can realize 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:45.939
 the part 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.139
 of the 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.969
 gums 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.219
 and later the teeth as in good part superior 

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.249
 you see the simplicity that we are 

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:57.750
 closing the part 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:59.860
 upper mouth 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.029
 from inside 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:04.289
 later part 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.680
 interior we model it 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.680
 and which to the top like that of an icy world 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.729
 we see that we have already created a tooth where we were 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.089
 the part 

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:18.469
 flat of the gums that I'm seeing the region 

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:21.469
 where we want the teeth little by little 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:23.969
 doing 

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:26.969
 the stupidity one of the teeth 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.279
 that we were the teeth on top 

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:33.559
 pos we continue with the brics illusion of the teeth below 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.740
 as we see is the amp and we should 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.800
 Serrat 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.180
 the region 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.770
 to tie to have rendering problems later that is bad 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:47.479
 image 

00:06:47.479 --> 00:06:48.969
 so it's bouquets 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:51.349
 completely 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:54.119
 of the part in which the fund 

00:06:54.119 --> 00:06:56.080
 we continue to create it 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.240
 max 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.070
 form inside the mouth where we are 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:02.819
 selecting the bottom 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.569
 from the mouth to be able to perform 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:07.710
 the 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.500
 language 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:12.500
 We previously removed the mirror to see action within the area 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.289
 from the mouth 

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:18.419
 and is to be final result by adding again the modified 2001 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.360
 we will have teeth
