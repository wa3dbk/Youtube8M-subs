that he's got he's crafted very well

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
that he's got he's crafted very well
over<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.630> years<00:00:33.660> he<00:00:33.960> hasn't<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.410> put<00:00:34.559> up

with a lot of criticism I got to say

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.479 
with a lot of criticism I got to say
very<00:00:37.350> quickly<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.770> think<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> first

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
very quickly I think in the first

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
very quickly I think in the first
instance<00:00:38.969> when<00:00:39.120> McKinnon<00:00:39.570> was<00:00:39.600> tackled<00:00:40.110> cam

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
instance when McKinnon was tackled cam

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.410 
instance when McKinnon was tackled cam
Smith<00:00:40.770> did<00:00:40.980> exactly<00:00:41.370> what<00:00:41.460> any<00:00:41.790> other<00:00:41.879> captain

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
Smith did exactly what any other captain

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
Smith did exactly what any other captain
would<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> think<00:00:42.960> about<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
would have done I think about the the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.709 
would have done I think about the the
way<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.489> McKinnon<00:00:44.879> went<00:00:45.059> down<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.660> he

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
way that McKinnon went down and what he

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
way that McKinnon went down and what he
did<00:00:45.899> with<00:00:46.050> he's<00:00:46.170> with<00:00:46.500> his<00:00:46.620> head<00:00:46.829> but<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.070> think

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
did with he's with his head but I think

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.790 
did with he's with his head but I think
look<00:00:48.059> as<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.719> went<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.469> piers<00:00:49.710> that

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
look as it went on and on the piers that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
look as it went on and on the piers that
he<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.129> might<00:00:50.340> have<00:00:50.489> dragged<00:00:51.030> on<00:00:51.180> his

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
he just might have dragged on his

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.939 
he just might have dragged on his
conversation<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.170> referee<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.739> far

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
conversation with the referee for far

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.319 
conversation with the referee for far
too<00:00:52.980> long<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.460> didn't<00:00:53.730> paint<00:00:53.879> him<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> good

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
too long it didn't paint him in a good

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.400 
too long it didn't paint him in a good
light<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.570> 60<00:00:55.050> minutes

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
light on 60 minutes

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.340 
light on 60 minutes
I<00:00:55.860> think<00:00:56.850> mud<00:00:57.030> sticks<00:00:57.390> unfortunately<00:00:58.020> for<00:00:58.140> cam

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
I think mud sticks unfortunately for cam

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.869 
I think mud sticks unfortunately for cam

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
of stuff they seem to be a little bit

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
of stuff they seem to be a little bit
more<00:01:17.549> subtle<00:01:17.820> heading<00:01:18.210> into<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.509> game<00:01:18.780> yeah

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

more subtle heading into this game yeah
and<00:01:19.590> that's<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> something<00:01:20.189> very

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
and that's that's something very

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.130

that<00:01:27.689> beau<00:01:28.110> Scott<00:01:28.530> these<00:01:28.860> other<00:01:29.070> guys<00:01:29.280> that

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that beau Scott these other guys that

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.370 
that beau Scott these other guys that

have spoken about clemmer they're loving
it<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.680> really<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.189> Queensland<00:01:32.729> have

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it and I really think Queensland have

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.700 
it and I really think Queensland have
been<00:01:32.939> put<00:01:33.150> off<00:01:33.180> their<00:01:33.479> game<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.320> Cameron

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
been put off their game the Cameron

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.289 
been put off their game the Cameron
Smith<00:01:34.920> business<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.520> come<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.150> days

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
Smith business to come out three days

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.899 
Smith business to come out three days
before<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.290> hugest<00:01:37.770> game<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.310> at<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
end of the Origin series I think really

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.800

a siege mentality I think they all will
rally<00:02:01.590> around

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
rally around

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.280
