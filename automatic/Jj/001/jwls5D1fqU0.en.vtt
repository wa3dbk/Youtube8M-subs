is<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.259> box<00:01:46.259> here<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.770> knows<00:01:47.040> this<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.579> low

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
is the box here this knows this is a low

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.370 
is the box here this knows this is a low
car<00:01:48.180> cable<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:48.840> come<00:01:48.990> off<00:01:49.170> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
car cable that would come off the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.620 
car cable that would come off the
throttle<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:50.009> then<00:01:50.579> we<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> one<00:01:51.390> for

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
throttle and then we have the one for

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.980 
throttle and then we have the one for
the<00:01:51.720> seven<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.290> seven<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.369> we're<00:01:54.329> zooming<00:01:54.810> here

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
the seven to seven so we're zooming here

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
the seven to seven so we're zooming here
get<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.350> real<00:01:55.530> good<00:01:55.560> close<00:01:56.100> look<00:01:56.570> so<00:01:57.570> when<00:01:57.719> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
get you real good close look so when the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.120 
get you real good close look so when the
pedal<00:01:58.110> works<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.369> pulls<00:02:00.619> the<00:02:01.619> detent

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
pedal works it actually pulls the detent

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
pedal works it actually pulls the detent
for<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.549> transmission<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:03.630> worked

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
for the transmission it really worked

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.639 
for the transmission it really worked
out<00:02:04.049> slick<00:02:05.360> so<00:02:06.360> this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.840> used<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.409> lot<00:02:07.590> of

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
out slick so this is used so a lot of

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.199 
out slick so this is used so a lot of
times<00:02:07.860> you're<00:02:08.069> trying<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> stable<00:02:08.729> stock<00:02:08.940> gas

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209

how the tube comes out of the water pump
the<00:02:29.880> driver's<00:02:30.360> side<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:31.020> pressure<00:02:31.350> and

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
the driver's side is the pressure and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.530 
the driver's side is the pressure and
there's<00:02:32.340> another<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.850> underneath<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.480> they

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
there's another one underneath and they

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.200 
there's another one underneath and they
come<00:02:33.780> straight<00:02:34.080> out<00:02:34.110> at<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.650> back<00:02:35.030> on<00:02:36.030> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
back of the motor I think we've showed

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.240 
back of the motor I think we've showed
you<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:38.040> earlier<00:02:38.370> applications<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:41.100> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you in earlier applications and you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.450 
you in earlier applications and you
notice<00:02:41.640> here<00:02:41.910> how<00:02:42.020> marks<00:02:43.020> got<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.470> a/c<00:02:43.650> hoses

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
notice here how marks got the a/c hoses

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.150 
notice here how marks got the a/c hoses
and<00:02:44.640> then<00:02:45.420> here's<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> shutoff<00:02:46.470> valve<00:02:46.800> coming

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and then here's the shutoff valve coming

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.830 
and then here's the shutoff valve coming
off<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.580> heater<00:02:47.760> side<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.240> driver's<00:02:48.390> side

off the heater side the driver's side

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.350 
off the heater side the driver's side
going<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:50.010> heater<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.580> back<00:02:50.730> over<00:02:50.970> to

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
going to the heater and back over to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.200 
going to the heater and back over to
this<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:52.200> same<00:02:52.590> way<00:02:52.800> an<00:02:52.950> AC<00:02:53.190> those<00:02:53.820> he<00:02:54.000> goes

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
this the same way an AC those he goes

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.960 
this the same way an AC those he goes
charging<00:02:54.600> point<00:02:55.080> ports<00:02:55.560> here<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.550> that's<00:02:56.730> one

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
charging point ports here and that's one

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.930 
charging point ports here and that's one
of<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.150> things<00:02:57.330> we<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:57.720> do<00:02:58.250> Jerry<00:02:59.250> wanted<00:02:59.700> one
