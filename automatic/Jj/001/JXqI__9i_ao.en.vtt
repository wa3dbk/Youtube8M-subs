00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
this thing so I'm going to use the thick

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.350 
this thing so I'm going to use the thick
Peterson<00:01:11.159> wrench<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.700> top<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.210> it's

I<00:03:49.680> probably<00:03:50.680> homemade<00:03:51.430> pins<00:03:51.760> or<00:03:52.150> if<00:03:52.900> somebody

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
I probably homemade pins or if somebody

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.490 
I probably homemade pins or if somebody
has<00:03:53.500> repin<00:03:53.950> this<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.490> would<00:03:54.760> expect<00:03:55.500> we're

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
has repin this I would expect we're

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.750 
has repin this I would expect we're
going<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.710> find<00:03:56.980> some<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.280> those<00:03:57.460> weird

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
going to find some of those weird

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.350 
going to find some of those weird
mushrooms<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:59.530> paper<00:03:59.860> on<00:04:00.100> the<00:04:00.190> top<00:04:00.400> or<00:04:00.700> these

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
mushrooms that paper on the top or these

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.410 
mushrooms that paper on the top or these
might<00:04:01.630> even<00:04:01.810> be<00:04:01.990> T<00:04:02.200> pins<00:04:02.550> so<00:04:03.550> let's<00:04:04.030> let's<00:04:04.270> take

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
might even be T pins so let's let's take

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.120 
might even be T pins so let's let's take
a<00:04:04.450> look<00:04:04.630> let's<00:04:04.660> quit<00:04:05.020> thinking<00:04:05.440> about<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.800> just

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130 
a look let's quit thinking about it just

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.100 
a look let's quit thinking about it just
confirm<00:04:06.640> it<00:04:06.820> since<00:04:07.060> we're<00:04:07.240> not<00:04:07.420> only<00:04:07.900> about

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
confirm it since we're not only about

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:15.270 
confirm it since we're not only about
three<00:04:08.380> minutes<00:04:12.180> okay<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.750> don't<00:04:14.740> have<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.070> key<00:04:15.250> so

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
three minutes okay I don't have a key so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.240 
three minutes okay I don't have a key so
I<00:04:15.460> can't<00:04:15.700> screw<00:04:16.000> this<00:04:16.030> up<00:04:16.270> so<00:04:19.890> let's<00:04:20.890> see<00:04:21.130> if<00:04:21.190> we

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
I can't screw this up so let's see if we

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.640 
I can't screw this up so let's see if we
can't<00:04:21.520> take<00:04:21.670> this<00:04:21.880> clip<00:04:22.540> off<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:23.080> just<00:04:23.260> shove

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
can't take this clip off and just shove

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.110 
can't take this clip off and just shove
that<00:04:23.680> thing<00:04:23.950> right<00:04:24.460> out<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.640> there<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:24.970> who

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
that thing right out of there and who

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:33.180 
that thing right out of there and who
happens<00:04:27.360> without<00:04:28.360> turning<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.040> keyhole<00:04:32.190> see

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
happens without turning the keyhole see

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:53.159 
happens without turning the keyhole see
we<00:04:33.340> got<00:04:33.520> here

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.469 

okay<00:04:54.039> we're<00:04:54.249> still<00:04:54.460> turn<00:04:54.699> pins<00:04:55.180> going<00:04:55.330> to<00:04:55.419> be

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
okay we're still turn pins going to be

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.899 
okay we're still turn pins going to be
on<00:04:55.569> top<00:04:56.819> let's<00:04:57.819> start<00:04:58.120> sliding<00:04:58.479> this<00:04:58.780> hangout

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
on top let's start sliding this hangout

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:05.999 
on top let's start sliding this hangout
there's<00:05:00.909> our<00:05:01.060> pins<00:05:01.330> on<00:05:01.509> top<00:05:02.129> and<00:05:04.620> let<00:05:05.620> me<00:05:05.830> get<00:05:05.979> a

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
there's our pins on top and let me get a

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:12.050 
there's our pins on top and let me get a
pair<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.340> tweezer

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.339 

it's<00:05:13.060> fine<00:05:13.330> let's<00:05:13.539> get<00:05:13.689> the<00:05:13.840> other<00:05:13.990> ones<00:05:14.169> out

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
it's fine let's get the other ones out

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.510 
it's fine let's get the other ones out
and<00:05:14.379> then<00:05:14.529> I'll<00:05:14.620> pick<00:05:14.830> that<00:05:14.860> one<00:05:15.189> up<00:05:15.219> off<00:05:15.490> of

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
and then I'll pick that one up off of

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.239 
and then I'll pick that one up off of
the<00:05:15.849> floor<00:05:15.879> I<00:05:16.180> can<00:05:16.479> see<00:05:16.779> it<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.110> just<00:05:18.039> can't

00:05:18.239 --> 00:05:18.249 
the floor I can see it I just can't

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.519 
the floor I can see it I just can't
reach<00:05:18.460> it

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
reach it

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:29.129 
reach it
so<00:05:20.529> that<00:05:20.710> was<00:05:20.860> pin<00:05:22.830> five<00:05:27.689> there<00:05:28.689> we<00:05:28.810> go<00:05:28.960> they

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
so that was pin five there we go they

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:42.370 
so that was pin five there we go they
are<00:05:29.669> that's<00:05:30.669> a<00:05:30.789> T<00:05:31.000> pin

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:57.730 

that's<00:05:43.250> a<00:05:43.400> cheap<00:05:43.640> in<00:05:46.930> it's<00:05:47.930> another<00:05:48.200> t-pin

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.379 

it's<00:05:58.190> kind<00:05:58.430> of<00:05:58.460> a<00:05:58.550> odd-shaped<00:05:59.080> core<00:06:00.080> here<00:06:01.389> and

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
it's kind of a odd-shaped core here and

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:03.730 
it's kind of a odd-shaped core here and
be<00:06:02.540> fun<00:06:02.840> putting<00:06:03.139> these<00:06:03.290> back<00:06:03.350> together

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
be fun putting these back together

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.650 
be fun putting these back together
there's<00:06:04.130> another<00:06:04.400> tape<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:04.820> so<00:06:04.880> we've<00:06:04.970> got<00:06:05.090> 40

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:05.660 
there's another tape and so we've got 40

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.719 
there's another tape and so we've got 40
pins<00:06:05.990> for<00:06:06.289> sure<00:06:06.500> I'm<00:06:06.889> still<00:06:07.130> I<00:06:07.190> can<00:06:07.340> pick<00:06:07.550> up

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
pins for sure I'm still I can pick up

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.969 
pins for sure I'm still I can pick up
pick<00:06:08.449> that<00:06:08.630> one<00:06:08.810> up<00:06:08.870> off<00:06:09.080> of<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.410> ground<00:06:09.440> on

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979 
pick that one up off of the ground on

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:16.150 
pick that one up off of the ground on
the<00:06:10.759> bottom<00:06:13.330> key<00:06:14.330> pins<00:06:14.660> we<00:06:14.930> had<00:06:15.110> a<00:06:15.139> just<00:06:16.039> a

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 
the bottom key pins we had a just a

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.420 
the bottom key pins we had a just a
straight<00:06:16.430> up<00:06:16.720> oops

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
straight up oops

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:30.640 
straight up oops
normal<00:06:19.720> normal<00:06:20.720> normal<00:06:22.060> normal<00:06:28.360> and<00:06:29.360> a<00:06:30.169> normal

normal normal normal normal and a normal
looks<00:06:30.919> like<00:06:31.070> we<00:06:31.220> had<00:06:31.460> a<00:06:31.539> short<00:06:32.539> pin<00:06:33.050> hiding

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
looks like we had a short pin hiding

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.620 
looks like we had a short pin hiding
behind<00:06:33.740> two<00:06:34.070> long<00:06:34.340> ones<00:06:34.520> and<00:06:34.880> then<00:06:35.360> we<00:06:35.479> had

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:35.630 
behind two long ones and then we had

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.469 
behind two long ones and then we had
another<00:06:35.979> well<00:06:36.979> medium<00:06:37.250> pin<00:06:37.669> hiding<00:06:38.090> behind<00:06:38.240> a

00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 
another well medium pin hiding behind a

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:40.029 
another well medium pin hiding behind a
long<00:06:38.660> one<00:06:38.870> in<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.080> back<00:06:39.260> so<00:06:39.590> that<00:06:39.710> might<00:06:39.919> have

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 
long one in the back so that might have

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.469 
long one in the back so that might have
given<00:06:40.160> you<00:06:40.340> a<00:06:40.400> little<00:06:40.550> bit<00:06:40.729> of<00:06:40.760> trouble<00:06:41.000> Eric

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
given you a little bit of trouble Eric

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:43.330 
given you a little bit of trouble Eric
hold<00:06:42.229> on<00:06:42.350> just<00:06:42.470> a<00:06:42.560> second<00:06:42.860> let<00:06:42.949> me<00:06:43.039> find<00:06:43.250> that

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
hold on just a second let me find that

00:06:43.340 --> 00:07:04.650 
hold on just a second let me find that
other<00:06:43.490> thing

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:04.660 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.940 

yeah<00:07:05.560> I<00:07:06.570> said<00:07:07.570> I<00:07:07.600> saw<00:07:07.960> him<00:07:08.110> but<00:07:08.290> I'm<00:07:08.380> I<00:07:08.590> don't

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950 
yeah I said I saw him but I'm I don't

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.590 
yeah I said I saw him but I'm I don't
think<00:07:09.340> this<00:07:09.640> is<00:07:09.700> the<00:07:09.850> one<00:07:10.000> I<00:07:10.060> was<00:07:10.240> looking<00:07:10.510> at

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:10.600 
think this is the one I was looking at

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.940 
think this is the one I was looking at
but<00:07:10.690> this<00:07:10.810> is<00:07:10.960> definitely<00:07:11.200> not<00:07:11.410> him<00:07:11.650> this<00:07:11.830> is

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
but this is definitely not him this is

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.670 
but this is definitely not him this is
out<00:07:12.070> of<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:12.250> ruko<00:07:12.580> lock<00:07:12.820> so<00:07:13.150> I<00:07:13.390> think<00:07:14.170> I<00:07:14.440> didn't

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:14.680 
out of a ruko lock so I think I didn't

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.230 
out of a ruko lock so I think I didn't
sweep<00:07:14.890> the<00:07:15.100> lock<00:07:15.280> lap<00:07:15.550> good<00:07:15.760> enough<00:07:15.970> I<00:07:16.060> can't

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
sweep the lock lap good enough I can't

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.510 
sweep the lock lap good enough I can't
imagine<00:07:16.330> this<00:07:16.720> was<00:07:16.900> inside<00:07:17.200> of<00:07:17.260> there<00:07:17.590> so<00:07:18.310> I

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 
imagine this was inside of there so I

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.330 
imagine this was inside of there so I
would<00:07:18.640> bet<00:07:19.000> that<00:07:19.030> it<00:07:19.300> was<00:07:19.390> probably<00:07:19.800> five<00:07:20.800> of

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:21.340 
would bet that it was probably five of

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:24.090 
would bet that it was probably five of
these<00:07:21.490> t<00:07:21.910> pins<00:07:22.410> Eric<00:07:23.410> that<00:07:23.680> was<00:07:23.800> giving<00:07:24.040> you

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
these t pins Eric that was giving you

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.980 
these t pins Eric that was giving you
trouble<00:07:24.310> so<00:07:24.640> when<00:07:24.850> they<00:07:25.000> when<00:07:25.480> you<00:07:25.600> get<00:07:25.780> to<00:07:25.870> the

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
trouble so when they when you get to the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.840 
trouble so when they when you get to the
shear<00:07:26.200> line<00:07:26.410> these<00:07:26.620> flop<00:07:27.100> over<00:07:27.280> on<00:07:27.550> the<00:07:27.640> side

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
shear line these flop over on the side

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.010 
shear line these flop over on the side
they<00:07:28.090> might<00:07:28.270> lead<00:07:28.570> you<00:07:28.690> to<00:07:28.720> believe<00:07:28.840> that

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:29.020 
they might lead you to believe that

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.450 
they might lead you to believe that
you've<00:07:29.350> got<00:07:29.530> reached<00:07:29.710> the<00:07:29.830> shear<00:07:30.040> line<00:07:30.220> but

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:30.460 
you've got reached the shear line but

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.190 
you've got reached the shear line but
you've<00:07:31.090> really<00:07:31.270> got<00:07:31.510> a<00:07:31.540> little<00:07:31.810> bit<00:07:31.900> more<00:07:32.080> to

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:32.200 
you've really got a little bit more to

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.570 
you've really got a little bit more to
go<00:07:32.350> so<00:07:32.530> you<00:07:32.620> kind<00:07:32.770> of<00:07:32.800> got<00:07:32.890> to<00:07:33.010> massage<00:07:33.130> them

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:33.580 
go so you kind of got to massage them

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.330 
go so you kind of got to massage them
into<00:07:33.880> place<00:07:34.320> so<00:07:35.320> you'll<00:07:35.500> feel<00:07:35.710> it<00:07:35.830> break<00:07:36.070> and

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:36.340 
into place so you'll feel it break and

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.130 
into place so you'll feel it break and
then<00:07:36.580> you<00:07:36.610> just<00:07:36.850> kind<00:07:37.030> of<00:07:37.120> slide<00:07:37.480> in<00:07:37.720> until<00:07:38.020> you

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:38.140 
then you just kind of slide in until you

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.500 
then you just kind of slide in until you
do<00:07:38.380> feel<00:07:38.680> the<00:07:39.130> the<00:07:39.580> shear<00:07:39.820> line<00:07:39.970> give<00:07:40.210> just<00:07:40.450> a

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:40.510 
do feel the the shear line give just a

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:41.760 
do feel the the shear line give just a
little<00:07:40.720> bit<00:07:40.810> more<00:07:40.990> and<00:07:41.110> that'll<00:07:41.350> tell<00:07:41.500> you<00:07:41.620> you

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:41.770 
little bit more and that'll tell you you

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.320 
little bit more and that'll tell you you
reach<00:07:41.980> the<00:07:42.100> shear<00:07:42.340> line<00:07:42.460> with<00:07:42.670> these<00:07:42.790> t<00:07:43.030> pins

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:43.330 
reach the shear line with these t pins

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.170 
reach the shear line with these t pins
and<00:07:44.070> yeah<00:07:45.070> one<00:07:45.250> more<00:07:45.340> thing<00:07:45.460> find<00:07:45.850> some<00:07:46.000> more
