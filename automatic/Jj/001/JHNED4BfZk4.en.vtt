empowerment<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.799> always<00:01:35.100> know<00:01:35.310> we<00:01:35.880> are

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
empowerment we always know we are

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
empowerment we always know we are
physically<00:01:36.869> not<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.439> strong<00:01:37.710> as<00:01:37.740> men<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
physically not as strong as men and

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
physically not as strong as men and
therefore<00:01:39.329> at<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.689> end<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.960> day<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.380> will

therefore at the end of the day we will

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
therefore at the end of the day we will
always<00:01:40.860> have<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.430> fear<00:01:41.700> for<00:01:41.909> our<00:01:41.939> safety<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.720> so
