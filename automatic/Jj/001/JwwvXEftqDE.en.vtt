00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
things you get in special packs so I

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.520

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
have all of those and then my binders

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.109 
have all of those and then my binders
here<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.100> estimate<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.700> there's<00:01:26.970> at

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
here I would estimate that there's at

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.840 
here I would estimate that there's at
least<00:01:27.360> 500<00:01:28.049> cars<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.530> each<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> binders<00:01:29.340> so

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
least 500 cars in each of the binders so

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
least 500 cars in each of the binders so
just<00:01:30.090> on<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.299> bed<00:01:30.509> alone<00:01:30.840> right<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.320> there's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
just on my bed alone right here there's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.370 
just on my bed alone right here there's
at<00:01:32.040> least<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.640> least<00:01:32.990> 19,000<00:01:33.990> cards<00:01:34.229> and
