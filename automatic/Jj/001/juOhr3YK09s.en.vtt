00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.050 
time they're like what car you need to
keep<00:01:48.659> those<00:01:48.840> eyes<00:01:48.990> moving<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.220> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
keep those eyes moving all the time and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.120 
keep those eyes moving all the time and
I<00:01:51.390> would<00:01:51.810> say<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.950> most

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
I would say that that's the most

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340 
I would say that that's the most
important<00:01:53.729> part<00:01:53.970> of<00:01:54.149> driving<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
important part of driving is the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
important part of driving is the
scanning<00:01:55.920> because<00:01:56.460> basically<00:01:57.030> that's<00:01:57.509> what's

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
scanning because basically that's what's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.530 
scanning because basically that's what's
going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> save<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.350> life
