00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.289
 we can see that I have a glass of sugar 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.369
 the juice of a lemon water I'm going 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.449
 use all this water is not even 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 a spoon of her honeymoon honeymoon 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:31.189
 so as not to miss a place and 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.189
 eastern the most essential thing 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.460
 these two covers it only to do the 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.530
 cover the sugar with water 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:47.120
 and mix well 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.129
 so I added the half spoon of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.580
 rooms is actually what is important 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.610
 now is to set fire to a 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.210
 temperature not too high so we 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.340
 try to do that thoroughly and let's 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.790
 this mixture on fire during a small 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.199
 moment 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.940
 we can see that it's starting to boil 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.800
 you can increase a little bit the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.979
 fire temperature but it takes 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.530
 monitor in this case there is actually it 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:16.399
 must not forget to 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.820
 add the lemon at this time and not 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:18.820
 not before 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.290
 I will also m this plate to the private 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 we can see that it was starting to become 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.859
 Brown 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.840
 so the test to see if she is ready 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.840
 it's on the edge 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:06.259
 if she is like that if she has a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:10.690
 texture a little touch is that the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:20.840
 pralines so now it's going to have to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:23.080
 let it cool on this plate 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.269
 we got out of the fridge 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.680
 some people wet their 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.209
 plates could put their 6th before 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.739
 three say in this tape wet 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.910
 the problem when you were wet 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.860
 is that the more risk 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.799
 liquefy matter so it's better 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.150
 rather put it to cool 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.310
 so we let pass cool a 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.720
 little bit she is not yet all to 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.120
 is cold but to prevent it from 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 harden it is necessary at this stage started 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.370
 to play with with a wooden spoon 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.830
 with a spoon in the door but he 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.850
 must do that otherwise we will 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:04.299
 find with hard caramel so that's it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.299
 we play at lens 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:36.930
 for more wait on dheune she 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:38.430
 even thicker and more invested than 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.550
 after I'm going to work with the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.550
 hands 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.530
 Oh 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.510
 so in the end if we do not use everything 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.790
 the wax can be made a small 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:23.170
 ball and then put it in the paper 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.170
 two km for all 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.479
 and then the next time we want 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.270
 to use it we will only have to put it in 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:32.400
 microwave for a few seconds 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.550
 then we will be ready to be 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.550
 used
