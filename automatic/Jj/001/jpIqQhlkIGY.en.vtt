00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
bought from the store but you can

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.200

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
certainly make fresh lemonade and then

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.970 
certainly make fresh lemonade and then
I'm<00:01:53.300> going<00:01:53.390> to<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:53.570> adding<00:01:53.750> two<00:01:54.290> jell-o

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 
I'm going to be adding two jell-o

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.310 
I'm going to be adding two jell-o
packets<00:01:55.700> now<00:01:55.880> if<00:01:56.270> you're<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.540> vegan<00:01:57.170> or

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
packets now if you're a vegan or

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.500 
packets now if you're a vegan or
vegetarian<00:01:57.700> obviously<00:01:58.700> this<00:01:58.850> recipe<00:01:59.240> isn't

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
vegetarian obviously this recipe isn't

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.970 
vegetarian obviously this recipe isn't
for<00:01:59.660> you<00:01:59.750> but<00:01:59.780> I'm<00:02:00.050> definitely<00:02:00.320> a<00:02:00.590> big<00:02:00.770> fan<00:02:00.950> of

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
for you but I'm definitely a big fan of

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.050 
for you but I'm definitely a big fan of
jell-o<00:02:01.550> and<00:02:02.410> so<00:02:03.410> you're<00:02:03.710> adding<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.370> gelatin

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
jell-o and so you're adding the gelatin

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.640 
jell-o and so you're adding the gelatin
which<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.480> going<00:02:05.660> to<00:02:05.750> make<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.140> liquid

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
which is going to make this liquid

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.920 
which is going to make this liquid
harden<00:02:07.490> inside<00:02:08.149> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.360> lemon<00:02:08.660> which<00:02:08.810> is

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
harden inside of the lemon which is

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:10.060 
harden inside of the lemon which is
going<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.110> give<00:02:09.260> it<00:02:09.290> the<00:02:09.470> appearance<00:02:09.740> that

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to give it the appearance that

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.370 
going to give it the appearance that
we're<00:02:10.220> looking<00:02:10.490> for<00:02:10.730> so<00:02:11.240> I'm<00:02:11.600> gonna<00:02:11.870> actually

we're looking for so I'm gonna actually
on<00:02:12.560> low<00:02:12.950> heat<00:02:13.370> I'll<00:02:13.760> begin<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.720> stir<00:02:15.050> this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
on low heat I'll begin to stir this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
on low heat I'll begin to stir this
liquid<00:02:15.710> for<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.190> two<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.910> three<00:02:16.970> minutes

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
liquid for about two to three minutes

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.660 
liquid for about two to three minutes
and<00:02:17.900> you're<00:02:18.620> not<00:02:18.770> gonna<00:02:18.920> want<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.400> get<00:02:19.490> too

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
and you're not gonna want it to get too

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.300 
and you're not gonna want it to get too
boiling<00:02:20.210> or<00:02:20.390> too<00:02:20.540> hot<00:02:20.720> just<00:02:21.140> very<00:02:21.470> very<00:02:21.590> warm

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
so that the entire gelatin packet

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.250 
so that the entire gelatin packet
dissolves<00:02:25.520> completely<00:02:25.700> I'm<00:02:26.540> gonna<00:02:26.780> set<00:02:27.080> out

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.070 

now<00:03:07.820> the<00:03:07.880> jello<00:03:08.270> has<00:03:08.420> had<00:03:08.570> a<00:03:08.600> chance<00:03:08.810> to

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
now the jello has had a chance to

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.750 
now the jello has had a chance to
completely<00:03:09.560> firm<00:03:09.800> up<00:03:09.980> so<00:03:10.220> I'm<00:03:10.310> gonna<00:03:10.430> start

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760

with one plate and just set them all out
by<00:03:13.700> this<00:03:13.760> point<00:03:14.150> they<00:03:14.390> should<00:03:14.420> be<00:03:14.720> completely

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
by this point they should be completely

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.480 
by this point they should be completely
firm<00:03:16.010> inside<00:03:16.730> of<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:18.290> lemon<00:03:18.740> and<00:03:18.920> this<00:03:19.280> is

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
firm inside of the lemon and this is

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.700 
firm inside of the lemon and this is
where<00:03:19.670> the<00:03:19.790> fun<00:03:19.970> part<00:03:20.000> begins<00:03:20.660> so<00:03:21.350> I'm<00:03:21.560> gonna

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
start by just cutting a little bit of

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.560 
start by just cutting a little bit of
the<00:03:23.780> top<00:03:23.960> so<00:03:24.200> that<00:03:24.350> it's<00:03:24.560> completely<00:03:25.240> flush<00:03:26.240> up

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:26.570 
the top so that it's completely flush up

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.410 
the top so that it's completely flush up
against<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.800> lemon<00:03:28.220> you<00:03:28.910> want<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.180> give<00:03:29.300> it

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
against the lemon you want to give it

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.850 
against the lemon you want to give it
the<00:03:29.540> appearance<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:30.170> it<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.470> an<00:03:30.650> actual

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860
