00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
first time that mercedes AMG developed

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.650 
first time that mercedes AMG developed
and<00:01:21.980> produce<00:01:22.370> an<00:01:22.640> engine<00:01:23.000> outside<00:01:23.480> the

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
and produce an engine outside the

and produce an engine outside the
Daimler<00:01:24.020> family<00:01:26.860> so<00:01:27.860> it's<00:01:28.100> quite<00:01:28.250> an<00:01:28.460> honor

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550

a<00:02:07.850> brand<00:02:08.850> new<00:02:09.000> system<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.630> active

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
a brand new system of active

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.770 
a brand new system of active
aerodynamics<00:02:10.400> it<00:02:11.400> has<00:02:11.610> two<00:02:11.850> flaps<00:02:12.180> an<00:02:12.390> affront

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
aerodynamics it has two flaps an affront

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.830 
aerodynamics it has two flaps an affront
to<00:02:13.080> win<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> rear<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.400> moves<00:02:14.670> separately<00:02:15.239> to

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
to win the rear that moves separately to

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.199 
to win the rear that moves separately to
increase<00:02:16.200> balance<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.190> downforce<00:02:17.760> during

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
increase balance and downforce during

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.780 
increase balance and downforce during

one<00:02:21.269> under<00:02:21.810> one<00:02:22.080> above<00:02:22.349> as<00:02:22.590> close<00:02:23.160> as<00:02:23.340> possible

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
one under one above as close as possible

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.509 
one under one above as close as possible
I<00:02:23.970> mean<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.360> terms<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.690> right<00:02:25.500> there<00:02:25.739> that's

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
I mean in terms of right there that's

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.449 
I mean in terms of right there that's
increase<00:02:26.940> you<00:02:27.330> know<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:28.250> stability<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
increase you know the stability of the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.030 
increase you know the stability of the
car<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.000> speak<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.900> an<00:02:31.019> airplane<00:02:31.319> yeah

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
car at the I speak like an airplane yeah

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.009 
car at the I speak like an airplane yeah
like<00:02:32.190> an<00:02:32.340> airplane<00:02:32.580> that's<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.569> can<00:02:33.900> ever

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
like an airplane that's it I can ever
