there's<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.359> lot<00:00:27.630> of<00:00:27.660> people<00:00:28.109> moving<00:00:28.619> away<00:00:28.980> from

there's a lot of people moving away from

there's a lot of people moving away from
refined<00:00:30.420> sugars<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.349> there's<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.560> variety<00:00:31.920> of

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
refined sugars and there's a variety of

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.190 
refined sugars and there's a variety of
reasons<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.780> really<00:00:33.960> need<00:00:34.079> to

reasons for that I don't really need to
get<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> diabetes<00:00:35.550> epidemic<00:00:35.760> that's

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
get into the diabetes epidemic that's

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
get into the diabetes epidemic that's
happening<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> US<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.440> obviously<00:00:37.950> that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
happening in the US but obviously that's

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.790 
happening in the US but obviously that's
a<00:00:38.489> result<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.149> some<00:00:39.719> poor<00:00:39.899> eating<00:00:40.079> habits<00:00:40.230> and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
a result of some poor eating habits and

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.889 
a result of some poor eating habits and
using<00:00:41.070> refined<00:00:41.399> sweeteners<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.300> excessive

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
using refined sweeteners so excessive

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.139 
using refined sweeteners so excessive
refined<00:00:43.260> sugar<00:00:43.620> consumption<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.489> also<00:00:44.789> be

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
refined sugar consumption can also be

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.270 
refined sugar consumption can also be
linked<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> inflammation<00:00:46.170> inflammation<00:00:46.860> of

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
linked to inflammation inflammation of

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.150 
linked to inflammation inflammation of
the<00:00:47.309> joints<00:00:47.850> of<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.390> tissues<00:00:49.110> even<00:00:49.649> possibly

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the joints of the tissues even possibly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.310 
the joints of the tissues even possibly
arthritis<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.059> that's<00:00:51.210> another<00:00:51.539> downside

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
arthritis so that's another downside

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.170 
arthritis so that's another downside
eating<00:00:52.920> too<00:00:53.039> much<00:00:53.160> refined<00:00:53.520> sugar<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> then

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
eating too much refined sugar and then

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.600 
eating too much refined sugar and then
we're<00:00:54.420> getting<00:00:54.660> into<00:00:54.960> Candida<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.340> lot

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
we're getting into Candida right a lot

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.889 
we're getting into Candida right a lot
of<00:00:56.730> people<00:00:56.910> are<00:00:57.000> talking<00:00:57.030> about<00:00:57.420> yeast

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
of people are talking about yeast

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.779 
of people are talking about yeast
overgrowth<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> gut<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.219> that's<00:00:59.579> been<00:00:59.760> a

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
overgrowth in the gut and that's been a

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.369 
overgrowth in the gut and that's been a
big<00:00:59.850> thing<00:01:00.300> here<00:01:00.329> especially<00:01:00.690> those<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:01.140> you

she talks a lot about these issues and
particularly<00:01:08.610> candida<00:01:09.180> overgrowth<00:01:09.290> so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
particularly candida overgrowth so

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
particularly candida overgrowth so
that's<00:01:10.409> another<00:01:10.770> reason<00:01:11.070> just<00:01:11.549> your<00:01:11.790> yeast

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that's another reason just your yeast

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.060 
that's another reason just your yeast

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
some healthier sweeteners but more so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.469

agaves you may have seen on the market

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.589 
agaves you may have seen on the market

are actually dark in color well I can

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:44.509 
are actually dark in color well I can
tell<00:03:42.750> you<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:43.109> one<00:03:43.410> first<00:03:43.709> of<00:03:43.919> all<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.190> less

tell you this one first of all is less
refined<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.569> here's<00:03:46.380> why<00:03:46.560> when<00:03:46.829> you<00:03:46.950> cut<00:03:47.220> open

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
refined and here's why when you cut open

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.039 
refined and here's why when you cut open
an<00:03:47.639> agave<00:03:47.880> plant<00:03:48.239> right<00:03:48.450> if<00:03:48.569> you<00:03:48.660> were<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.840> run

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
an agave plant right if you were to run

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.479 
an agave plant right if you were to run
out<00:03:49.200> if<00:03:49.349> you're<00:03:49.470> in<00:03:49.560> the<00:03:49.650> southwestern<00:03:50.310> here

out if you're in the southwestern here

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.250 
out if you're in the southwestern here
on<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.669> west<00:03:50.819> coast<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.690> take<00:03:51.930> an<00:03:52.019> agave

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
on the west coast and you take an agave

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
on the west coast and you take an agave
plant<00:03:52.620> you<00:03:52.739> cut<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> bad<00:03:53.430> boy<00:03:53.639> open<00:03:53.880> what

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
plant you cut that bad boy open what

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.199 
plant you cut that bad boy open what
comes<00:03:55.049> out<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.500> not<00:03:55.620> a<00:03:55.680> brown<00:03:56.010> liquid<00:03:56.340> it's

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
comes out it's not a brown liquid it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.780 
comes out it's not a brown liquid it's
actually<00:03:57.419> a<00:03:57.750> clear<00:03:58.290> sap<00:03:58.829> that<00:03:59.190> comes<00:03:59.609> out<00:03:59.760> of

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
actually a clear sap that comes out of

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.640 
actually a clear sap that comes out of
the<00:04:00.000> agave<00:04:00.389> plant<00:04:00.690> so<00:04:01.260> when<00:04:01.410> we're<00:04:01.500> talking

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
the agave plant so when we're talking

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.250 
the agave plant so when we're talking
about<00:04:02.010> unrefined<00:04:02.879> or<00:04:03.239> minimally<00:04:03.930> processed

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
about unrefined or minimally processed

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.740 
about unrefined or minimally processed
sweeteners<00:04:05.069> this<00:04:05.669> clear<00:04:06.000> agave<00:04:06.389> is<00:04:06.480> one

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
sweeteners this clear agave is one

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.690 
sweeteners this clear agave is one
that's<00:04:06.930> as<00:04:07.200> close<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.069> original<00:04:08.099> source

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
that's as close to the original source

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.520 
that's as close to the original source
as<00:04:08.940> possible<00:04:09.419> that's<00:04:09.510> why<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.109> clear

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
as possible that's why I like the clear

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.129 
as possible that's why I like the clear
agave<00:04:11.010> nectar<00:04:11.150> versus<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.299> brown<00:04:12.569> agaves

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
agave nectar versus the brown agaves

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:14.869 
agave nectar versus the brown agaves
because<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:13.829> just<00:04:14.010> less<00:04:14.190> processed<00:04:14.730> and

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
because it's just less processed and

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.509 
because it's just less processed and
then<00:04:15.239> we've<00:04:15.389> got<00:04:15.419> organic<00:04:16.079> yacon<00:04:16.859> powder<00:04:17.220> now

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
then we've got organic yacon powder now

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.250 
then we've got organic yacon powder now
organic<00:04:17.789> yacon<00:04:18.269> powder<00:04:18.539> is<00:04:18.720> awesome<00:04:19.139> because

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
organic yacon powder is awesome because

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.099 
organic yacon powder is awesome because
you're<00:04:19.590> Khan<00:04:19.979> has<00:04:20.760> fructose<00:04:21.599> oblio
