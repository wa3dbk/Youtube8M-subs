00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.160 
com let's get started so last week we

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.130 
com let's get started so last week we
looked<00:00:25.340> at<00:00:25.430> embellishing<00:00:26.000> triads<00:00:26.480> through

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
looked at embellishing triads through

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.859 
looked at embellishing triads through
ascending<00:00:27.800> chromatic<00:00:28.610> half<00:00:28.820> steps<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:29.660> for

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
ascending chromatic half steps so for

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.470 
ascending chromatic half steps so for
example<00:00:30.260> on<00:00:30.410> a<00:00:30.440> C<00:00:30.680> major<00:00:30.860> chord<00:00:31.360> we<00:00:32.360> would

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
example on a C major chord we would

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.939 
example on a C major chord we would
approach<00:00:32.780> each<00:00:33.050> note<00:00:33.260> of<00:00:33.350> the<00:00:33.440> C<00:00:33.620> major<00:00:33.649> chord

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
approach each note of the C major chord

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:40.479 
approach each note of the C major chord
by<00:00:34.370> half<00:00:34.610> step<00:00:34.850> below

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.340 

today<00:00:41.090> we're<00:00:41.239> going<00:00:41.329> to<00:00:41.390> do<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:41.899> opposite

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
today we're going to do the opposite

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.260 
today we're going to do the opposite
we're<00:00:42.620> gonna<00:00:42.710> approach<00:00:43.010> each<00:00:43.340> note<00:00:43.700> of<00:00:43.910> the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:44.270 
we're gonna approach each note of the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.299 
we're gonna approach each note of the
major<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:44.870> minor<00:00:45.020> triads<00:00:45.559> by<00:00:45.800> half<00:00:46.070> step

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
major and minor triads by half step

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.580 
major and minor triads by half step
above<00:00:46.520> so<00:00:47.510> if<00:00:47.629> we've<00:00:47.780> got<00:00:47.930> our<00:00:48.050> C<00:00:48.230> major<00:00:48.410> chord

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
above so if we've got our C major chord

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.880 
above so if we've got our C major chord
here<00:00:49.420> octave<00:00:50.420> on<00:00:50.510> top<00:00:50.780> will<00:00:51.440> approach<00:00:51.710> the

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
here octave on top will approach the

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.310 
here octave on top will approach the
first<00:00:52.070> note<00:00:52.309> by<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.489> half<00:00:52.699> step<00:00:52.730> above<00:00:53.260> my<00:00:54.260> D

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
first note by a half step above my D

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.760 
first note by a half step above my D
flat<00:00:55.420> are<00:00:56.420> going<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.659> see

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
flat are going to see

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.360 
flat are going to see
oh<00:00:58.800> gee

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.710 

is<00:01:04.370> what<00:01:04.550> it<00:01:04.640> would<00:01:04.730> look<00:01:04.850> like<00:01:04.910> over<00:01:05.420> say

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
is what it would look like over say

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:15.430 
is what it would look like over say
g-major<00:01:13.390> this<00:01:14.390> type<00:01:14.570> of<00:01:14.600> exercise<00:01:14.810> might

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
g-major this type of exercise might

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.530 
g-major this type of exercise might
remind<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:15.950> of<00:01:16.010> something<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:17.180> we<00:01:17.360> use<00:01:17.510> a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
remind you of something that we use a

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.030 
remind you of something that we use a
lot<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:17.780> jazz<00:01:18.020> improvisation<00:01:18.320> called<00:01:18.920> the

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
lot in jazz improvisation called the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.310 
lot in jazz improvisation called the
bebop<00:01:19.370> scale<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.150> what<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.510> bebop<00:01:20.780> scale<00:01:21.110> is

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
bebop scale and what the bebop scale is

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.630 
bebop scale and what the bebop scale is
is<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> mixolydian<00:01:21.980> scale<00:01:24.100> with<00:01:25.100> an<00:01:25.340> added

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
is a mixolydian scale with an added

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.730 
is a mixolydian scale with an added
half-step<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.480> between<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.200> seventh<00:01:27.590> and

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
half-step in between the seventh and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.980 
half-step in between the seventh and
root<00:01:28.190> of<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> scale<00:01:34.510> what<00:01:35.510> this<00:01:35.660> added

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
root of the scale what this added

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.020 
root of the scale what this added
half-step<00:01:36.470> does<00:01:36.710> is<00:01:36.979> make<00:01:37.310> sure<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.490> all<00:01:37.850> the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
half-step does is make sure that all the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:52.180 
half-step does is make sure that all the
court<00:01:38.300> owns<00:01:38.510> line<00:01:38.720> up<00:01:38.869> with<00:01:39.020> downbeats

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.040 

bc7<00:01:53.190> dominant<00:01:53.820> chord<00:01:54.060> will<00:01:54.720> happen<00:01:54.990> on

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
bc7 dominant chord will happen on

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.500 
bc7 dominant chord will happen on
downbeats<00:01:55.500> because<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:56.040> added<00:01:56.370> stuff<00:01:56.910> so

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
downbeats because that added stuff so

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.610 
downbeats because that added stuff so
we're<00:01:57.630> doing<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.840> same<00:01:58.020> thing<00:01:58.080> with<00:01:58.410> our

00:01:58.610 --> 00:01:58.620 
we're doing the same thing with our

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.750 
we're doing the same thing with our
triads<00:01:59.400> here<00:01:59.760> so<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.120> have<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.300> arpeggio<00:02:01.580> if<00:02:02.580> we

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
triads here so we have an arpeggio if we

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.469 
triads here so we have an arpeggio if we
had<00:02:02.880> these<00:02:03.000> chromatic<00:02:03.420> half<00:02:03.600> steps

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.940 

so<00:02:08.479> now<00:02:08.570> let's<00:02:08.750> apply<00:02:09.050> it<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.320> same<00:02:09.350> method<00:02:09.860> we

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
so now let's apply it the same method we

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.070 
so now let's apply it the same method we
used<00:02:10.190> for<00:02:10.340> our<00:02:10.429> last<00:02:10.640> lesson<00:02:10.970> we're<00:02:11.780> going<00:02:11.990> to

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
used for our last lesson we're going to

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.480 
used for our last lesson we're going to
play<00:02:12.290> through<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> exercise<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> slow

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
play through the exercise at a slow

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.490 
play through the exercise at a slow
tempo<00:02:13.520> then<00:02:14.510> we're<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.870> to<00:02:14.960> sing<00:02:15.200> and<00:02:15.380> play

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
tempo then we're going to sing and play

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.440 
tempo then we're going to sing and play
then<00:02:16.220> we're<00:02:16.340> going<00:02:16.460> to<00:02:16.520> sing<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.030> ghost<00:02:17.270> the

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
then we're going to sing and ghost the

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.240 
then we're going to sing and ghost the
notes<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.870> then<00:02:17.990> finally<00:02:18.500> we're<00:02:18.950> going<00:02:18.980> to

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
notes and then finally we're going to

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.560 
notes and then finally we're going to
sing<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.580> notes<00:02:19.760> away<00:02:20.060> from<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.330> instrument

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
sing the notes away from the instrument

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.840 
sing the notes away from the instrument
we'll<00:02:21.500> be<00:02:21.620> taking<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:21.980> exercise<00:02:22.430> around<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
we'll be taking this exercise around the

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.910 
we'll be taking this exercise around the
circle<00:02:23.180> of<00:02:23.270> fourths<00:02:23.540> since<00:02:23.959> that<00:02:24.110> is<00:02:24.320> the<00:02:24.350> most

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
circle of fourths since that is the most

35<00:02:29.150> beats<00:02:29.390> per<00:02:29.570> minute<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.020> a<00:02:30.350> nice<00:02:30.530> slow

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
35 beats per minute which is a nice slow

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.360

that'll<00:02:31.640> make<00:02:31.730> sure<00:02:31.940> we're<00:02:32.120> playing<00:02:32.360> all<00:02:32.510> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
that'll make sure we're playing all the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.790 
that'll make sure we're playing all the
notes<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.900> syncing<00:02:33.290> all<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.500> pitches

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800

correctly<00:02:34.220> first<00:02:34.790> thing<00:02:34.970> we're<00:02:35.090> gonna<00:02:35.180> do<00:02:35.390> is

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
correctly first thing we're gonna do is

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.740 
correctly first thing we're gonna do is
play<00:02:36.170> around<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.310> circle<00:02:37.850> of<00:02:38.060> fourths<00:02:38.510> and

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
play around the circle of fourths and

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.420 
play around the circle of fourths and
I'll<00:02:38.810> only<00:02:38.990> be<00:02:39.200> playing<00:02:39.470> through<00:02:39.800> probably

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
I'll only be playing through probably

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.830 
I'll only be playing through probably
four<00:02:40.670> or<00:02:40.790> five<00:02:41.000> of<00:02:41.180> each<00:02:41.270> of<00:02:41.450> these<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:41.750> the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
four or five of each of these so the

00:02:41.840 --> 00:03:10.970 
four or five of each of these so the
video<00:02:42.050> doesn't<00:02:42.380> get<00:02:42.470> too<00:02:42.590> long

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.930 

you<00:03:11.980> would<00:03:12.099> keep<00:03:12.280> that<00:03:12.430> going<00:03:12.670> around<00:03:12.849> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
you would keep that going around the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.360 
you would keep that going around the
circle<00:03:13.120> of<00:03:13.390> fourths<00:03:13.599> so<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.290> reach<00:03:14.800> see<00:03:15.099> again

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
circle of fourths so you reach see again

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.220 
circle of fourths so you reach see again
here's<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.180> same<00:03:16.420> thing<00:03:16.450> over<00:03:16.780> our<00:03:17.019> minor

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
here's the same thing over our minor

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:47.110 
here's the same thing over our minor
chords

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.310 

you<00:03:48.120> may<00:03:48.270> notice<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.900> might<00:03:49.080> not<00:03:49.200> be

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
you may notice that I might not be

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.440 
you may notice that I might not be
playing<00:03:49.590> them<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.070> the<00:03:50.460> exact<00:03:50.790> octave<00:03:51.240> that's

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
playing them and the exact octave that's

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.210 
playing them and the exact octave that's
written<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.020> sheet<00:03:52.230> music<00:03:52.350> what<00:03:53.190> really

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
written on the sheet music what really

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.650 
written on the sheet music what really
matters<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.880> just<00:03:54.030> that<00:03:54.180> you're<00:03:54.300> playing<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
matters is just that you're playing the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.370 
matters is just that you're playing the
correct<00:03:54.900> notes

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
correct notes

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.590 
correct notes
I<00:03:55.640> mostly<00:03:56.640> wrote<00:03:56.850> them<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.180> octaves<00:03:57.540> I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
I mostly wrote them in the octaves I

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.510 
I mostly wrote them in the octaves I
wrote<00:03:57.750> them<00:03:57.930> in<00:03:58.080> for<00:03:58.350> readability<00:03:58.710> wise<00:03:59.160> so

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
wrote them in for readability wise so

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.890 
wrote them in for readability wise so
you<00:03:59.580> can<00:03:59.850> really<00:04:00.030> play<00:04:00.150> them<00:04:00.330> in<00:04:00.420> any<00:04:00.540> octave

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
you can really play them in any octave

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.590 
you can really play them in any octave

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
on the piano the next step was to sing

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.210 
on the piano the next step was to sing
in<00:04:03.720> play<00:04:03.900> over<00:04:04.320> both<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> major<00:04:04.800> and<00:04:05.070> minor

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.779 

you'll<00:04:35.440> notice<00:04:35.620> I'm<00:04:35.830> switching<00:04:36.250> the<00:04:36.280> octaves

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
you'll notice I'm switching the octaves

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.180 
you'll notice I'm switching the octaves
I<00:04:36.970> was<00:04:37.090> using<00:04:37.300> based<00:04:37.600> on<00:04:37.840> where<00:04:38.410> my<00:04:38.590> voice<00:04:38.860> was

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
I was using based on where my voice was

and<00:04:40.060> you<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.300> do<00:04:40.419> that<00:04:40.570> if<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.750> like<00:04:41.020> to<00:04:41.530> have

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
and you can do that if you like to have

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.050 
and you can do that if you like to have
the<00:04:41.889> pitch<00:04:42.039> in<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.280> same<00:04:42.460> octave<00:04:42.669> as<00:04:42.940> your

the pitch in the same octave as your
voice<00:04:43.210> or<00:04:43.870> you<00:04:44.020> could<00:04:44.199> do<00:04:44.350> an<00:04:45.220> octave<00:04:45.580> apart

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669

with<00:04:46.030> your<00:04:46.150> voice<00:04:46.300> in<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.539> notes<00:04:46.720> it<00:04:46.930> really

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
with your voice in the notes it really

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.360 
with your voice in the notes it really
doesn't<00:04:47.410> matter<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:47.800> long<00:04:47.860> as<00:04:48.039> you're<00:04:48.160> singing

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370

the<00:04:48.490> track<00:04:48.699> pitch<00:04:48.940> here's<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:49.990> sounds

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
the track pitch here's what it sounds

00:04:50.199 --> 00:05:18.070 
the track pitch here's what it sounds
like<00:04:50.229> a<00:04:50.440> reminder

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.260 

the<00:05:18.500> next<00:05:18.770> step<00:05:18.949> is<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.340> sing<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:19.850> ghost<00:05:20.090> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
the next step is to sing and ghost the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.180 
the next step is to sing and ghost the
notes<00:05:20.479> and<00:05:21.020> what<00:05:21.259> this<00:05:21.380> does<00:05:21.590> is<00:05:21.860> create<00:05:21.889> a

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
notes and what this does is create a

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.279 
notes and what this does is create a
very<00:05:22.520> strong<00:05:22.789> connection<00:05:23.060> between<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.870> RL

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
very strong connection between the RL

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.469 
very strong connection between the RL
cents<00:05:24.680> which<00:05:25.160> is<00:05:25.340> hearing<00:05:25.729> the<00:05:25.819> notes<00:05:26.000> in<00:05:26.210> the

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
cents which is hearing the notes in the

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.360 
cents which is hearing the notes in the
physical<00:05:26.840> sense<00:05:27.050> of<00:05:27.319> actually<00:05:27.889> playing<00:05:28.220> the

physical sense of actually playing the

00:05:28.370 --> 00:06:21.999 
physical sense of actually playing the
notes<00:05:28.550> on<00:05:28.699> the<00:05:28.789> piano<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.990> final<00:06:21.620> step<00:06:21.800> is<00:06:21.979> to

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
notes on the piano the final step is to

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.589 
notes on the piano the final step is to
sing<00:06:22.340> to<00:06:22.430> exercise<00:06:22.880> away<00:06:23.270> from<00:06:23.479> your

sing to exercise away from your

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.300 
sing to exercise away from your
instrument<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:24.139> this<00:06:24.620> means<00:06:24.860> that<00:06:25.039> you<00:06:25.130> can

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:25.310 
instrument and this means that you can

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.399 
instrument and this means that you can
practice<00:06:25.669> anywhere<00:06:26.000> and<00:06:26.750> I<00:06:27.050> do<00:06:27.110> these

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
practice anywhere and I do these

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.290 
practice anywhere and I do these
exercises<00:06:27.830> a<00:06:27.949> lot<00:06:28.190> while<00:06:28.430> driving<00:06:28.909> to<00:06:29.000> a<00:06:29.030> gig

exercises a lot while driving to a gig

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.540 
exercises a lot while driving to a gig
to<00:06:29.659> get<00:06:30.020> my<00:06:30.169> head<00:06:30.530> in<00:06:30.650> the<00:06:30.740> right<00:06:30.919> space<00:06:31.190> and<00:06:31.490> to

to get my head in the right space and to

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.060 
to get my head in the right space and to
make<00:06:31.699> sure<00:06:31.729> that<00:06:31.940> I'm<00:06:32.419> prepared<00:06:32.810> mentally<00:06:33.070> for

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:34.070 
make sure that I'm prepared mentally for

00:06:34.070 --> 00:07:02.029 
make sure that I'm prepared mentally for
improvising

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039
