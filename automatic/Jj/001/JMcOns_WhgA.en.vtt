00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.810
 now after this evil 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.190
 the character following previous season

 xalapa 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.360
 if it is added what is the client has the advantage of having many points 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.560
 where to lean to produce a figure 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.960
 interesting from the point of view of the comic reader who demonstrate his 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.259
 intelligence and its self-sufficiency demand for green spaces to several 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.350
 Almerian companies would be made with the fear integrity 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.610
 of course, of course 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 yes you needed to be smart endeavor to have one in front of chad 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.179
 of him but that is imprisoned 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.429
 Chávez has spoken to media insults but 

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.240
 buried my acts very 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.740
 If that gives me an idea, I would say Felipe Saez Asier there is a reality of 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.220

 as they were already mature people not elderly but kiko physiognomy worker 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.890
 the resource of the person who appears first effects after the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.349
 dam mother for that scene character 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.119
 in the case of the appearance of wolf something of this 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:12.399
 they come 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.659
 It's also like that because first they appear 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.189
 the silver-the trembling earth shaking the earth trembles after it collapses 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.579
 the buildings after the duero footprint and just after 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:23.859
 they appear what has been said 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.189
 after the dust 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.189
 collapsing order that it produces once 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.119
 between the catastrophic rumble of collapsing buildings 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:37.369
 rumbled in Europe as before leaving 10 

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:44.210
 the liverpool defeated every step forward 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:47.210
 slowly towards us 

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:59.869
 like a monster his father 

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:05.039
 we could no longer make use of it frankly did it 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.919
 diaz roses 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.899
 but facial care 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:17.319
 the de facto president 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.469
 the second round will be imported products 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.709
 the eternal memory of a navigator of the future 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.169
 began to appear in the magazine zero hour editorial weekly border 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:35.429
 on September 4, 1957 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:38.959
 and it lasted for one hundred and five weeks 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.109
 Until 7 September 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:44.329
 of 1959 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:47.650
 the success was so great that in an unusual gesture 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.599
 the publisher published in 1982 the complete adventure between game 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:59.089
 in the mid-70s the determining factor of popularity 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:00.869
 ulterior of the eternal 

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.779
 is reissued the original version that the boys of the 50 had read in 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.779
 a single volume of 365 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.079
 other readers are 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.769
 lain otherwise ideologized at a time that are the eve of the 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.129
 military dictatorship 

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:20.799
 and at a time when intelligence is not like that 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.799
 he is a militant montonero who lives in these 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.900
 the originality the importance of the work from west to east is difficult to 

00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:36.370
 qualify since any adjective is left with this 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.740
 carlos trillo cheered by gender 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.089
 excellent dynamic and also pronounced an attentive reader of the work 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.270
 because 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.629
 is one of the best people for a woman insults 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.470
 the eternal one was for us children readers as a revelation 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.620
 I surpassed it had never happened 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.370
 Monday the 13th fiction in Argentina 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.229
 We've never seen people who lived near home become a 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.250
 hero will not be like 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.580
 that everything was within reach inaugurated at that time did not 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.100
 surprised the eternal has that 1 elíseo with moving in the year 57 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.729
 and reelection as seen in year 78 but 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.529
 we chose it differently that snowfall Fathallah was in Buenos Aires 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.870
 they are killing people are going through terrible things 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.969
 not then that science fiction adventure that made this gel 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.110
 somehow it became 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.979
 tintin another thing in another reading and probably but lagar 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:47.759
 and it is that they are two more civil times this is still a great history of 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.580
 adventure 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.440
 ibarra 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.710
 back put the limits of transmitted surely 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.110
 I would like to turn what they call a classic that he is saying to the young 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.180
 reader that claw oil 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.060
 something that has to be heard min 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.160
 and that out there was not heard in the past in the past said other things 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.740
 it can disappear 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.029
 the great secret of the eternal is our only cartoon we met 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:17.050
 first lasting in time 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.669
 telling things different methodologies
