00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
now you can see boom it's a little bit

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.920 
now you can see boom it's a little bit
too<00:02:46.389> far<00:02:46.629> backwards<00:02:47.260> his<00:02:48.069> hips<00:02:48.430> when<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.480> pull

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
too far backwards his hips when you pull

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.599 
too far backwards his hips when you pull
the<00:02:49.959> bar<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.590> fisker<00:02:51.129> if<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.340> got<00:02:51.489> to

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
the bar in fisker if you got to

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.369 
the bar in fisker if you got to
counterbalance<00:02:52.030> if<00:02:52.359> your<00:02:52.510> hips<00:02:52.719> so<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.169> goes

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
counterbalance if your hips so it goes

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:56.039 
counterbalance if your hips so it goes
like<00:02:53.590> like<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> seesaw<00:02:55.209> like<00:02:55.510> a<00:02:55.540> rocking<00:02:56.019> motion

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
like like a seesaw like a rocking motion

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.349 
like like a seesaw like a rocking motion
so<00:02:56.769> that<00:02:56.799> way<00:02:57.219> the<00:02:57.280> bar<00:02:57.579> gets<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:57.969> flick

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
so that way the bar gets to flick

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.849 
so that way the bar gets to flick
upwards<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.489> come<00:03:00.489> back<00:03:00.760> into<00:03:01.269> you<00:03:01.829> into<00:03:02.829> a

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
upwards and come back into you into a

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:06.330 
upwards and come back into you into a
hook<00:03:03.219> shape<00:03:04.199> um<00:03:05.199> so<00:03:05.650> at<00:03:05.769> least<00:03:05.889> now<00:03:06.129> we<00:03:06.189> know

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
hook shape um so at least now we know

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.159 
hook shape um so at least now we know
what<00:03:06.669> the<00:03:06.760> problem<00:03:06.939> is<00:03:07.180> and<00:03:07.389> we'll<00:03:07.840> know<00:03:07.989> how

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:08.169 
what the problem is and we'll know how

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:11.670 
what the problem is and we'll know how
to<00:03:08.230> fix<00:03:08.439> it<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.709> next<00:03:08.829> time<00:03:10.500> all<00:03:11.500> right<00:03:11.560> you

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
fails consistency would be a problem we

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.640 
fails consistency would be a problem we
just<00:03:33.519> wanted<00:03:33.759> to<00:03:33.819> find<00:03:34.090> out<00:03:34.239> why<00:03:35.169> he<00:03:35.199> possibly

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
just wanted to find out why he possibly

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.530 
just wanted to find out why he possibly
do<00:03:36.009> so<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.639> would<00:03:36.849> have<00:03:36.879> a<00:03:37.000> gauge<00:03:37.299> of<00:03:38.909> at<00:03:39.909> what

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
do so I would have a gauge of at what

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.059 
do so I would have a gauge of at what
percentage<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.199> work<00:03:41.379> at<00:03:41.590> so<00:03:41.829> I'm<00:03:41.919> probably

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 
percentage to work at so I'm probably

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.360 
percentage to work at so I'm probably
going<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.459> hang<00:03:42.609> around<00:03:42.729> at<00:03:43.000> about<00:03:43.180> 125<00:03:43.840> m<00:03:44.370> 120
