00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
know even life and then we just want to

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
know even life and then we just want to
know<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.680> are<00:01:46.829> these<00:01:47.040> figures<00:01:47.460> doing

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939

what<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.360> they<00:01:57.509> talking<00:01:57.750> about<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.890> all

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
what are they talking about it's all

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.609 
what are they talking about it's all
very<00:01:59.520> open<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> clear<00:02:01.290> narrative

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619

very open there's not a clear narrative
here<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.369> all<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.969> only<00:02:03.090> clarity<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
here at all the only clarity is the

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.389 
here at all the only clarity is the
sense<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.110> isolation<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.860> sense<00:02:05.159> of

sense of isolation the sense of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
sense of isolation the sense of
alienation<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.750> find<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.110> especially

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
alienation and I find this especially

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.710 
alienation and I find this especially
interesting<00:02:08.340> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.910> about<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.360> year

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
interesting if you think about the year

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.530 
interesting if you think about the year
in<00:02:09.840> which<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.289> painted<00:02:10.970> 1942<00:02:11.970> the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.539 
in which this was painted 1942 the

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:16.079 
ways the cities were empty now there

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:17.179 
ways the cities were empty now there
were<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.200> lot<00:02:16.409> of<00:02:16.439> people<00:02:16.799> that<00:02:16.920> had<00:02:17.010> gone

00:02:17.179 --> 00:02:17.189 
were a lot of people that had gone

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.339 
were a lot of people that had gone
overseas<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.969> was<00:02:18.060> a<00:02:18.090> time<00:02:18.329> of<00:02:18.359> great<00:02:18.540> fear<00:02:19.200> and

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
overseas it was a time of great fear and

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.530 
overseas it was a time of great fear and
anxiety<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:20.069> America<00:02:20.700> that's<00:02:21.000> right<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.390> was

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
anxiety in America that's right this was

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.179 
anxiety in America that's right this was
really<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.019> height<00:02:22.230> of<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.620> violence<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.159> the

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
really the height of the violence of the

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.069 
really the height of the violence of the

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.660 
war and nobody knew which way the war
was<00:02:25.109> gonna<00:02:25.379> turn<00:02:25.650> at<00:02:25.829> this<00:02:25.920> point<00:02:26.189> and<00:02:26.459> these

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
was gonna turn at this point and these

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.390 
was gonna turn at this point and these
are<00:02:26.879> subjects<00:02:27.299> that<00:02:27.439> preoccupied<00:02:28.439> hopper<00:02:29.159> for

are subjects that preoccupied hopper for

here that's really compelling absolutely
you<00:04:20.099> know<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.280> have<00:04:20.519> those<00:04:20.729> cherry<00:04:21.329> topped

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:21.719 
you know you have those cherry topped

cherry<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> counter<00:04:25.289> so<00:04:25.830> there's<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.099> kind

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
cherry of the counter so there's a kind

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.870 
cherry of the counter so there's a kind

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
of specificity but at the same time like

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.010 
of specificity but at the same time like
generalising<00:04:29.880> that's<00:04:30.090> happening<00:04:30.659> that's

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
generalising that's happening that's

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.110 
generalising that's happening that's
right<00:04:31.200> he's<00:04:31.469> given<00:04:31.860> us<00:04:31.979> enough<00:04:32.340> specific<00:04:32.940> so

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
right he's given us enough specific so

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.719 
right he's given us enough specific so
that<00:04:33.240> we<00:04:33.450> know<00:04:34.080> we've<00:04:34.409> been<00:04:34.740> there<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.279> yet

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
that we know we've been there and yet

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.840
