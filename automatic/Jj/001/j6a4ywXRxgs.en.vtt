I<00:01:22.439> we<00:01:23.159> built<00:01:23.399> the<00:01:23.579> entire<00:01:23.999> game<00:01:24.240> around<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
I we built the entire game around the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.209 
I we built the entire game around the
idea<00:01:24.719> of<00:01:24.899> doing<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.289> downward<00:01:25.829> sword

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
idea of doing like a downward sword

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.429 
idea of doing like a downward sword
thrust<00:01:26.579> like<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.789> downward<00:01:27.179> sword<00:01:27.450> stab<00:01:27.779> like

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
thrust like a downward sword stab like

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.039 
thrust like a downward sword stab like
from<00:01:28.649> Celta<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> yes<00:01:29.549> like<00:01:29.789> from<00:01:29.939> zelda<00:01:30.209> 2<00:01:30.389> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
from Celta to yes like from zelda 2 and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.839 
from Celta to yes like from zelda 2 and
so<00:01:31.349> we<00:01:31.590> thought<00:01:31.709> well<00:01:31.920> from<00:01:32.279> this<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.700> what

00:01:32.839 --> 00:01:32.849 
so we thought well from this like what

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:34.309 
so we thought well from this like what
else<00:01:32.969> can<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> do<00:01:33.359> maybe<00:01:33.599> if<00:01:33.779> we're<00:01:33.899> stabbing

00:01:34.309 --> 00:01:34.319 
else can we do maybe if we're stabbing

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:35.480 
else can we do maybe if we're stabbing
like<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.560> could<00:01:34.679> be<00:01:34.740> stabbing<00:01:34.979> through<00:01:35.249> dirt

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
like we could be stabbing through dirt

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.159 
like we could be stabbing through dirt
maybe<00:01:35.999> we<00:01:36.179> could<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.450> maybe<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.959> could<00:01:37.079> be

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.169 
maybe we could be maybe we could be

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:38.779 
maybe we could be maybe we could be
digging<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:37.919> it<00:01:38.219> came<00:01:38.399> to<00:01:38.579> us<00:01:38.669> like

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
digging and then it came to us like

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:40.039 
digging and then it came to us like
let's<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.060> a<00:01:39.090> shovel<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.539> let's<00:01:39.749> make<00:01:39.929> the

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
let's do a shovel like let's make the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.839 
let's do a shovel like let's make the
character<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.649> shovel<00:01:41.069> so<00:01:41.429> we<00:01:41.639> could<00:01:41.759> be

00:01:41.839 --> 00:01:41.849 
character have a shovel so we could be

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:43.459 
character have a shovel so we could be
digging<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.179> treasure<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:43.079> flipping

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
digging up treasure we can be flipping

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.870 
digging up treasure we can be flipping
things<00:01:43.619> over<00:01:43.919> with<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.069> blade<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.520> shovel

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
things over with the blade of the shovel

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.649 
things over with the blade of the shovel
and

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
and

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.419 
and
that<00:01:45.749> is<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> basic<00:01:46.469> seed<00:01:46.710> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.920> idea<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
that is the basic seed of the idea that

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:49.459 
that is the basic seed of the idea that
the<00:01:47.759> entire<00:01:48.030> game<00:01:48.299> of<00:01:48.630> shovel<00:01:49.020> knight<00:01:49.170> came

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:23.639 
games and our favorite games that we've

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:24.860 
games and our favorite games that we've
been<00:03:23.730> playing<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.269> know<00:03:24.389> since<00:03:24.569> we<00:03:24.690> were<00:03:24.840> kids

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
been playing you know since we were kids

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.900 
been playing you know since we were kids
they<00:03:25.500> tend<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.130> not<00:03:26.250> take<00:03:26.430> themselves<00:03:26.639> too

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
they tend to not take themselves too

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.059 
they tend to not take themselves too
seriously<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.660> so<00:03:28.230> i<00:03:28.260> think<00:03:28.410> everything<00:03:28.799> that

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
seriously and so i think everything that

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.009 
seriously and so i think everything that
we<00:03:29.160> do<00:03:29.489> we're<00:03:30.090> probably<00:03:30.269> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> aim<00:03:30.989> for

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
we do we're probably going to aim for

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.559 
we do we're probably going to aim for
that<00:03:31.530> that<00:03:32.310> quark<00:03:32.700> eNOS<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.329> kind<00:03:33.510> of

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
that that quark eNOS and that kind of

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.509 
that that quark eNOS and that kind of
strangeness<00:03:34.139> but<00:03:34.590> we<00:03:34.889> think<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.220> just<00:03:35.370> makes

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519 
strangeness but we think that just makes

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.250 
strangeness but we think that just makes
it<00:03:35.609> all<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> little<00:03:35.910> bit<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.180> fun<00:03:36.389> oh<00:03:36.630> yeah

after that we're going to be unlocking

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.190 
after that we're going to be unlocking
levels<00:04:36.979> in<00:04:37.190> waves<00:04:37.550> so<00:04:38.210> when<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:38.900> beat<00:04:39.050> one

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
levels in waves so when you beat one

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.930 
levels in waves so when you beat one
stage<00:04:39.470> maybe<00:04:39.740> two<00:04:39.919> will<00:04:40.070> unlock<00:04:40.370> you'll<00:04:40.760> beat

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
stage maybe two will unlock you'll beat

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.370 
stage maybe two will unlock you'll beat
another<00:04:41.150> stage<00:04:41.479> and<00:04:41.780> then<00:04:41.870> like<00:04:41.990> three<00:04:42.110> more

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
another stage and then like three more

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.350 
another stage and then like three more
will<00:04:42.560> unlock<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.100> then<00:04:43.520> it'll<00:04:43.850> taper<00:04:44.090> back

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
will unlock and then it'll taper back

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.300 
will unlock and then it'll taper back
down<00:04:44.600> when<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:44.900> gets<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.110> the<00:04:45.200> end<00:04:45.320> so<00:04:45.770> you're

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:46.310 
down when it gets to the end so you're

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.060 
down when it gets to the end so you're
there's<00:04:46.880> only<00:04:47.000> one<00:04:47.270> final<00:04:47.720> stage<00:04:48.050> so<00:04:48.440> it's<00:04:48.680> a

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
there's only one final stage so it's a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.909 
there's only one final stage so it's a
mixture<00:04:49.370> of<00:04:49.460> linear<00:04:49.789> and<00:04:49.940> nonlinear<00:04:50.650> based<00:04:51.650> on

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
mixture of linear and nonlinear based on

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.560 
mixture of linear and nonlinear based on
the<00:04:52.190> shovel<00:04:52.490> mechanic<00:04:53.060> are<00:04:53.270> there<00:04:53.419> going<00:04:53.510> to

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
the shovel mechanic are there going to

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.330 
the shovel mechanic are there going to
be<00:04:53.630> other<00:04:53.930> paths<00:04:54.229> to<00:04:54.560> go<00:04:54.680> through<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.039> levels

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
be other paths to go through the levels

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.060 
be other paths to go through the levels
or<00:04:55.760> is<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.120> just<00:04:56.240> for<00:04:56.479> finding<00:04:56.840> stuff<00:04:57.080> well

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
or is it just for finding stuff well

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:00.250 
or is it just for finding stuff well
we're<00:04:58.370> still<00:04:58.850> really<00:04:59.150> toying<00:04:59.479> with<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.900> lot<00:05:00.229> of

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
we're still really toying with a lot of

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.409 
we're still really toying with a lot of
the<00:05:00.440> level<00:05:00.680> design<00:05:00.770> but<00:05:01.340> when<00:05:02.090> you<00:05:02.180> play<00:05:02.330> the

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
the level design but when you play the

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:03.969 
the level design but when you play the
demo<00:05:02.570> you'll<00:05:02.840> see<00:05:03.020> that<00:05:03.350> there<00:05:03.620> are<00:05:03.650> a<00:05:03.740> lot<00:05:03.950> of

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
demo you'll see that there are a lot of

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.850 
demo you'll see that there are a lot of
side<00:05:04.370> areas<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.479> secrets<00:05:06.050> and<00:05:06.289> alternate

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
side areas and secrets and alternate

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.040 
side areas and secrets and alternate
paths<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.729> we're<00:05:08.389> not<00:05:08.479> sure<00:05:08.690> if<00:05:08.780> it's<00:05:08.840> going<00:05:08.990> to

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
paths so we're not sure if it's going to

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.440 
paths so we're not sure if it's going to
be<00:05:09.260> like<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.650> full<00:05:09.979> map<00:05:10.550> that<00:05:10.849> you're<00:05:11.000> exploring

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
be like a full map that you're exploring

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.150 
be like a full map that you're exploring
or<00:05:11.750> if<00:05:11.840> it's<00:05:11.960> going<00:05:12.050> to<00:05:12.110> be<00:05:12.229> more<00:05:12.440> linear<00:05:12.680> but

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
or if it's going to be more linear but

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.100 
or if it's going to be more linear but
you<00:05:13.700> can<00:05:13.910> rest<00:05:14.389> assured<00:05:14.690> that<00:05:14.780> there's<00:05:14.960> going

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
you can rest assured that there's going

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.420 
you can rest assured that there's going
to<00:05:15.169> be<00:05:15.200> a<00:05:15.260> lot<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.470> secret<00:05:15.860> paths<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.310> things

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
to be a lot of secret paths and things

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.350 
to be a lot of secret paths and things
that<00:05:16.490> you<00:05:16.580> going<00:05:16.700> to<00:05:16.760> be<00:05:16.849> taking<00:05:17.210> in<00:05:17.330> the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
that you going to be taking in the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.480 
that you going to be taking in the
levels<00:05:17.720> well<00:05:18.470> the<00:05:18.590> game<00:05:18.740> looks<00:05:18.979> really<00:05:19.280> great

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
levels well the game looks really great

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:20.980 
levels well the game looks really great
