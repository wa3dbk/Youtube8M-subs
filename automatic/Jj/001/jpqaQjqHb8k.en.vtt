00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
this through the barrel of the pen so

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
this through the barrel of the pen so
make<00:01:06.780> sure<00:01:06.810> it's<00:01:07.110> small<00:01:07.409> enough<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.770> get<00:01:07.890> in

screen next step drill a hole into the
pen<00:01:18.900> barrel<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.560> hole<00:01:19.710> needs<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.040> big

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
pen barrel the hole needs to be big

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.649 
pen barrel the hole needs to be big
enough<00:01:20.340> for<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> paperclip<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.240> get<00:01:21.390> through

enough for the paperclip to get through

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.289 
enough for the paperclip to get through
now<00:01:22.100> shove<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> sponge<00:01:23.490> through<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> barrel

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
now shove the sponge through the barrel

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.840 
now shove the sponge through the barrel
so<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.479> pokes<00:01:24.900> out<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.290> tip<00:01:25.470> then<00:01:26.340> put

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
so that pokes out of the tip then put

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.700 
so that pokes out of the tip then put
the<00:01:26.970> pen<00:01:27.150> back<00:01:27.360> together<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> finally

the pen back together and finally
flatten<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.820> paperclip<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.659> poke<00:01:31.170> one

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
flatten out that paperclip and poke one

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
flatten out that paperclip and poke one
end<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.890> into<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> hole<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.670> made

just<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.990> jabbing<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.560> sponge<00:01:34.860> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
just so that is jabbing the sponge and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.910 
just so that is jabbing the sponge and
