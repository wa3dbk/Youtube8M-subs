00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
Ninja Gaiden wasn't one of them so I

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649 
guess you had to get the collectors
edition<00:01:11.009> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> extra<00:01:11.880> content<00:01:12.510> which

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
edition to get the extra content which

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.960 
edition to get the extra content which
wasn't<00:01:12.900> much<00:01:13.080> like<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.500> don't<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.740> extra

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 
wasn't much like you don't get extra

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.399 
wasn't much like you don't get extra
actual<00:01:14.970> content<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.570> affects<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> gameplay

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
