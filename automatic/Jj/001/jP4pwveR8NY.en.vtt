body position there's two parts the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.100 
body position there's two parts the
first<00:02:15.920> part<00:02:16.370> is<00:02:16.970> where<00:02:17.180> he's<00:02:17.300> preparing<00:02:17.810> and

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
first part is where he's preparing and

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.610 
first part is where he's preparing and
that<00:02:18.650> comes<00:02:18.950> right<00:02:19.510> here<00:02:20.510> see<00:02:21.230> how<00:02:21.440> he's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
that comes right here see how he's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.410 
that comes right here see how he's
loading<00:02:22.010> up<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.280> front<00:02:22.550> of<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.700> bike<00:02:22.880> he's

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
loading up the front of the bike he's

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.180 
loading up the front of the bike he's
got<00:02:23.630> his<00:02:23.750> body<00:02:24.050> weight<00:02:24.260> forward<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
got his body weight forward and the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.339 
got his body weight forward and the
suspension<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.849> compressed<00:02:28.239> now<00:02:29.239> he<00:02:29.900> pushes

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
suspension is compressed now he pushes

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.979 
suspension is compressed now he pushes
down<00:02:30.620> hard<00:02:31.099> with<00:02:31.310> that<00:02:31.489> right<00:02:31.790> foot<00:02:32.150> and<00:02:32.390> pulls

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
down hard with that right foot and pulls

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.020 
down hard with that right foot and pulls
his<00:02:33.170> body<00:02:33.410> wave<00:02:33.680> back<00:02:33.980> and<00:02:34.280> that<00:02:34.489> causes<00:02:34.790> a

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
his body wave back and that causes a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.699 
his body wave back and that causes a
torque<00:02:35.450> that<00:02:35.660> lifts<00:02:36.080> the<00:02:36.200> front<00:02:36.380> wheel

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
torque that lifts the front wheel

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.979 
torque that lifts the front wheel
causing<00:02:37.580> a<00:02:37.640> pedal<00:02:38.000> wheelie<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.510> keeps<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
causing a pedal wheelie that keeps the

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:40.600 
causing a pedal wheelie that keeps the
front<00:02:39.260> wheel<00:02:39.440> higher<00:02:39.739> than<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> back<00:02:40.310> as<00:02:40.549> he

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
front wheel higher than the back as he

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.900 
front wheel higher than the back as he
goes<00:02:40.970> off<00:02:41.180> of<00:02:41.480> the<00:02:41.569> edge<00:02:45.040> alright<00:02:46.040> so<00:02:46.280> why

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
goes off of the edge alright so why

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.970 
goes off of the edge alright so why
would<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.319> why<00:02:48.319> would<00:02:48.350> you<00:02:48.590> do<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:48.739> wheelie

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
would you why would you do a wheelie

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.460 
would you why would you do a wheelie
drop<00:02:49.340> vs<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> role<00:02:50.000> seems<00:02:50.959> like<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.200> roll<00:02:51.349> is

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
drop vs a role seems like the roll is

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.470 
drop vs a role seems like the roll is
easy<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:51.950> it<00:02:52.400> is<00:02:52.580> it's<00:02:52.849> the<00:02:52.940> easiest<00:02:53.150> thing<00:02:53.360> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
easy and it is it's the easiest thing to
