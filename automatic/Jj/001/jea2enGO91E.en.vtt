00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that they look at it but you know the

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.950 
that they look at it but you know the
owner<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.070> car<00:01:29.250> ordered<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> pretty<00:01:30.659> close

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
owner of the car ordered it pretty close

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.069 
owner of the car ordered it pretty close
but<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.350> out<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.470> an<00:01:31.650> earlier<00:01:32.040> ban<00:01:32.869> like<00:01:33.869> it's

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
but it's out of an earlier ban like it's

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.649 
but it's out of an earlier ban like it's
1600<00:01:34.890> or<00:01:35.009> something

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
1600 or something

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.179 
1600 or something
so<00:01:36.659> I've<00:01:36.810> modified<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.409> housing<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> little

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
so I've modified the housing a little

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.569 
so I've modified the housing a little
bit<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> put<00:01:39.030> two<00:01:39.210> screws<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.400> works

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
bit and put two screws in and it works

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.760 
bit and put two screws in and it works
quite<00:01:41.700> nicely<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.320> can<00:01:43.530> see<00:01:43.649> it's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
quite nicely but you can see it's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.139 
quite nicely but you can see it's
different<00:01:43.920> style<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.549> motor<00:01:44.790> all<00:01:45.060> together

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
different style and motor all together

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:55.200

would say had it all repaired so it
should<00:02:43.620> be<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.919> now

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
should be good now

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:48.379 
should be good now
well<00:02:46.919> after<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> bit<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.549> messing<00:02:47.939> around<00:02:48.060> and

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
well after a bit of messing around and

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.899 
well after a bit of messing around and
everything<00:02:48.810> it's<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.340> pretty<00:02:50.340> much<00:02:50.519> ready<00:02:50.819> to

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
everything it's all pretty much ready to

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.780 
everything it's all pretty much ready to
go<00:02:51.030> in<00:02:51.439> they'll<00:02:52.439> use<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.829> universal<00:02:53.459> he<00:02:53.579> did

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
go in they'll use the universal he did

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.580 
go in they'll use the universal he did
tap<00:02:53.969> here<00:02:54.209> because<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> original<00:02:55.409> one<00:02:55.560> was

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
tap here because the original one was

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.289 
tap here because the original one was
stuffed<00:02:56.189> and<00:02:56.459> I<00:02:56.489> don't<00:02:56.669> even<00:02:56.760> know<00:02:56.969> if<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.150> was

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
stuffed and I don't even know if it was

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:58.819 
stuffed and I don't even know if it was
the<00:02:57.480> original<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.230> it<00:02:58.319> was<00:02:58.439> it<00:02:58.590> tight

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
the original one and it was it tight

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.300 
the original one and it was it tight
there<00:02:59.299> because<00:03:00.299> it<00:03:00.419> was<00:03:00.510> all<00:03:00.629> broken<00:03:01.169> and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
there because it was all broken and

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.539 
there because it was all broken and
so<00:03:03.150> I've<00:03:03.689> made<00:03:03.840> this<00:03:04.049> one<00:03:04.319> fit<00:03:04.650> hopefully<00:03:05.519> I

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549
