00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.839
 so we are leaving the dealership now 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.450
 on nissan x-trail for what 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.860
 so that we have a task to check it 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.070
 extra features beyond that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.260
 That this machine can be used as 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.260
 family like good so masculine 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.109
 car for 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.550
 held a man he has more 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 extra off-road capability 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.590
 That's just the opinion on the forum very much 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.340
 divided some say it yes it is 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.950
 cool car reliable good but type 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.460
 by force and off-road driving straight 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.050
 right up to shove his type not very 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.860
 ok but on the other hand there is 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 four-wheel drive why are we here 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.590
 lock imitation 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.840
 she's locked on electro 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.530
 the coupling therefore cannot be for it not rigid 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.270
 lock is just there is lock 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.610
 mana 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.950
 clutch disc she herself you load she 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.320
 different or different movement 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.150
 speeds above 40 meters so call 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.660
 her 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.280
 the whole principle of full peony phone 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.820
 understandable but in any case here is good 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.360
 clearance 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.700
 here it is generally outwardly so now even 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:22.920
 no crossover reminds attacks already with 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 hint that this is an SUV yes yes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 and generally looks and you are very, very 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.100
 looks like a range rover defender 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.270
 land rover defender 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 Well, which is out of production new 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.500
 the past 40 years has been such a face of all 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.479
 SUVs that's why we and 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.210
 now we want to check this car 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.070
 see what she can because 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.610
 finally put all the points 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.610
 over i 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.990
 name is difficult love machine will come learn 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.190
 blueberries 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.740
 and jagged joints from these plates here yes but 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.740
 the fact that 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 knocks 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.750
 smart right now 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.620
 I really liked it when we 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.170
 came completely watched 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.680
 the transformation of the salon is the day before yesterday we 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.770
 I would love backs have 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.250
 adjustment first tilt 3 in the morning 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:32.520
 up to 5 positions is very convenient and so much 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:35.590
 Opportunities remove the back shelf 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.830
 drop down the seat will form a flat floor + 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.830
 the organizer is still similar to the floor 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.330
 it will be necessary to look more by the way 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:53.850
 how difficult is it to access the reserve 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:57.830
 strongly or so spare they say 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.830
 I offer both enough car 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.510
 I just started talking too 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.849
 in the flow go maneuvers did not do any 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:18.420
 so I must say that so hemorrhoids 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:22.530
 crazy remove the design but it happens 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:27.000
 not so often is it possible to go up 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.379
 due to the daily advantages here you can 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.409
 still tax the second lesson 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:35.069
 let's say there is no spare many should and then 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:37.010
 that certainly winter or there is no slush 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.840
 shorter important 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.470
 spare tire dirty where to put it 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:47.450
 century light for example wheel is attached 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.090
 down here is how many other roads 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.159
 on the chain and lowering the aroma from the Korean 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.629
 there is also a law. also almost 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.200
 it's dirty of course 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.100
 so it does not go back there 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.090
 wheel rule will go many 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.090
 so 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:13.230
 punch the wheel and very bad for different 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.569
 grabs 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:18.060
 it is differently convenient if here 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.100
 very comfortable to hold and here either 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.840
 after the petals so fingers 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.669
 keep a little sticking to this one 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.700
 here's the thing she's a little bit really 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.980
 there is but the tide is this here and big 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.990
 fingers keep good 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.460
 cool goes gone from the people who are here 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.790
 so they rule in general groups on 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.320
 armrest thrown on the right 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.790
 correct grip in principle, their 2 well 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.970
 here it goes sports 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.669
 that's more or less relaxed 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.530
 and road well here here here absolutely 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:54.710
 wrong i mean we shut up something not 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:54.710
 I know yes yes yes yes 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:02.000
 but you already know it at night already 

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.780
 paranoia if there was considered 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.310
 bossy 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.130
 everything is reduced by equipment reliability 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.830
 first of all in Moscow but these 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:16.330
 all parameters engine box well here 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:22.070
 is to say that everything is cool is cool 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:29.210
 design fire materials assembly all-all 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:34.610
 class but is a minus wheel well, young 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:36.920
 is it forever does it have it 25 30 or 350 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.350
 this is me right now, we just like to share 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.910
 what is really cool 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.010
 about him on the forums there are people who 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:44.780
 all 170 thousand of him wound and 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.390
 there is nothing special about it 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.980
 rack changed the oil of the filter and there by 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.700
 my helmsman 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.380
 and all 170,000 people hitting says well 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:59.270
 so basically nothing especially this 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:00.730
 changed but you need to have such a field here 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.060
 There are a few 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.500
 well she herself must on the wires 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.020
 we visit and there will be sand there is here 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.520
 decided but what we say 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.270
 bezobrava neatly me become more often 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:19.860
 Element certain shit 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.990
 drove right here as outwardly therefore us 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.720
 external camera on with it ibrahim 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.909
 something higher speed and just pay for 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.610
 so he is exactly at the settling rate of this 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:38.340
 this will not be possible to include full 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:41.120
 drinking and you can, that is, the steering wheel is not 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.120
 straightens yet 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:52.800
 the wheels and it is necessary to understand 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.750
 that if I go there even then he 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.270
 record and quietly be so 

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.449
 roll over but have it it doesn't get bogged down 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:02.430
 they are not that it is necessary it is crossed 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:04.050
 the terrain can now lina go to 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:06.599
 speeds show that we can 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.580
 move like this 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:14.130
 here feel the agenda on oilcloth 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:16.020
 swallows do these things a little bit 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.169
 happy i'll try first look 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:25.060
 what do we get here 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:25.060
 it can come here 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:31.540
 keeps well and generally here's the hood 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.400
 cool you can see at all from here 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.040
 you can get hurt and well, like this 

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.860
 watch your credentials start sand 

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.820
 really here's a sauna 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:44.200
 here it is 

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.200
 so slip a little bit 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.310
 here overgrown before was dedicated and 

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.310
 sand 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.720
 but 

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:10.530
 Andryukha with them what
