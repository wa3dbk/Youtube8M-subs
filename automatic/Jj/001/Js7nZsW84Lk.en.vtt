Transformer TF 101 one of the things we

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.940 
Transformer TF 101 one of the things we
should<00:02:28.269> mention<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.930> the<00:02:29.080> back<00:02:29.290> is<00:02:29.560> actually

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
should mention is the back is actually

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.280 
should mention is the back is actually
brushed<00:02:30.849> aluminum<00:02:31.360> as<00:02:31.540> opposed<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.049> most

brushed aluminum as opposed to most

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.070 
brushed aluminum as opposed to most
tablets<00:02:32.799> that<00:02:32.920> have<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.099> plastic<00:02:33.370> back<00:02:33.879> I<00:02:34.540> like

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
tablets that have a plastic back I like

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.690 
tablets that have a plastic back I like
this<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.379> lot<00:02:35.500> better<00:02:35.830> it<00:02:36.010> feels<00:02:36.250> better<00:02:36.459> in

this a lot better it feels better in

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.660 
this a lot better it feels better in
your<00:02:36.819> hands<00:02:37.269> will<00:02:38.170> resist<00:02:38.620> scratches<00:02:39.340> and

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
your hands will resist scratches and

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.449 
your hands will resist scratches and
wear<00:02:39.970> much<00:02:40.599> better<00:02:40.930> than<00:02:41.200> plastic<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.280> also

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
wear much better than plastic you also

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.699 
wear much better than plastic you also
don't<00:02:42.849> have<00:02:42.970> as<00:02:43.330> much<00:02:43.480> worries<00:02:43.959> about<00:02:44.140> denting

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
don't have as much worries about denting

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.500

pin cable this charger has flip-out
power<00:04:00.299> connector<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.660> folds<00:04:02.019> up<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.349> is

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
power connector so it folds up and is

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.319 
power connector so it folds up and is
very<00:04:02.739> nice<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.190> transport<00:04:03.730> it's<00:04:03.910> very<00:04:04.120> light

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
very nice to transport it's very light

very<00:04:04.359> small<00:04:05.019> one<00:04:06.010> of<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.190> things<00:04:06.400> that's

very small one of the things that's

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.849 
very small one of the things that's
surprising<00:04:07.090> about<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.510> is<00:04:07.750> being<00:04:08.380> actually

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
surprising about this is being actually

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.819 
surprising about this is being actually
so<00:04:09.040> small<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.549> does<00:04:10.060> not<00:04:10.180> get<00:04:10.419> warm<00:04:10.680> that<00:04:11.680> has

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
so small it does not get warm that has

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.940
