putting<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.579> mark<00:01:02.850> exactly<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.660> center<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
putting a mark exactly in the center and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520 
putting a mark exactly in the center and
then<00:01:04.710> well<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.060> mark<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.689> where<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.229> lower

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
then well at the mark to where the lower

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.890 
then well at the mark to where the lower
flap<00:01:07.979> comes<00:01:08.340> up<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.820> lower<00:01:09.000> flip<00:01:09.330> reaches

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
flap comes up so the lower flip reaches

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.100 
flap comes up so the lower flip reaches
further<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.400> behind<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.240> upper<00:01:12.810> flap

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
further up like behind the upper flap

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.050 
further up like behind the upper flap
and<00:01:13.320> i'm<00:01:13.799> just<00:01:13.950> making<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> mark<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:14.670> and

and i'm just making a mark there and
i've<00:01:15.299> used<00:01:16.080> mighty<00:01:16.500> ruler<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.509> exactly

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
i've used mighty ruler to exactly

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.010 
i've used mighty ruler to exactly
measure<00:01:19.140> where<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.590> centre<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.189> where<00:01:20.490> these

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
measure where this centre is where these

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.280 
measure where this centre is where these
marks<00:01:22.020> meet<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.979> where<00:01:23.220> i<00:01:23.250> stand<00:01:23.670> my

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.630 
marks meet and that's where i stand my
superhero<00:01:25.290> mask<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.250> i'm<00:01:26.340> using<00:01:26.460> my

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
superhero mask and then i'm using my

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.380 
superhero mask and then i'm using my
craft<00:01:27.090> knife<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:28.080> cut<00:01:28.350> off<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.150> upper

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
craft knife to cut off the the upper

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.520 
craft knife to cut off the the upper
flap<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:31.040> then<00:01:32.040> i<00:01:32.369> used<00:01:32.970> just<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.780> pencil<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
flap and then i used just my pencil to

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.789 
flap and then i used just my pencil to
make<00:01:35.100> sure<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.610> know<00:01:35.729> where<00:01:36.360> these<00:01:37.350> flaps

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
make sure that i know where these flaps

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880 
make sure that i know where these flaps
meet<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.579> you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.780> see<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.439> how<00:01:40.560> i<00:01:40.650> did<00:01:40.829> it

little bit more on my blog about like
what<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.450> was<00:02:23.600> thinking<00:02:23.959> about<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:24.800> this

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
what I was thinking about that so this

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.580 
what I was thinking about that so this
is<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.100> stencil<00:02:25.700> from<00:02:25.910> Simon<00:02:26.060> Says<00:02:26.750> Stamp<00:02:27.200> it's

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
is a stencil from Simon Says Stamp it's

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.350 
is a stencil from Simon Says Stamp it's
a<00:02:27.680> diagonal<00:02:28.130> stencil<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:28.640> i<00:02:28.760> think<00:02:28.970> i'm<00:02:29.090> using

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
a diagonal stencil and i think i'm using

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.330 
a diagonal stencil and i think i'm using
mustard<00:02:29.600> seed<00:02:29.990> or<00:02:30.140> some<00:02:30.320> intense<00:02:30.709> am<00:02:31.010> yellow

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
mustard seed or some intense am yellow

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.130 
mustard seed or some intense am yellow
color<00:02:31.640> here<00:02:31.940> and<00:02:31.970> you<00:02:32.540> have<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.780> be<00:02:32.870> careful

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
color here and you have to be careful

color here and you have to be careful
with<00:02:33.680> these<00:02:34.070> intricate<00:02:34.820> stencils<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.780> can't

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
with these intricate stencils you can't

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.530 
with these intricate stencils you can't
use<00:02:36.709> circular<00:02:37.100> motions<00:02:37.700> when<00:02:37.880> blending<00:02:38.390> you

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
use circular motions when blending you

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.350 
use circular motions when blending you
have<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.020> go<00:02:39.260> with<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.820> design<00:02:41.120> of<00:02:41.150> the

have to go with the design of the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.729 
have to go with the design of the
stencil<00:02:41.780> because<00:02:42.020> otherwise<00:02:42.290> you'll

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
stencil because otherwise you'll

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
smoothly ink underneath the plastic then

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.979 
smoothly ink underneath the plastic then
there<00:02:46.280> are<00:02:46.310> rearranged<00:02:46.940> my<00:02:47.090> car<00:02:47.450> today<00:02:47.600> that

that<00:02:50.209> I<00:02:50.239> just<00:02:50.540> aimed<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.019> now<00:02:51.620> i'm<00:02:51.739> going<00:02:51.950> over

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
that I just aimed and now i'm going over

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.070 
that I just aimed and now i'm going over
it<00:02:52.400> with<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.730> black<00:02:52.970> i'm<00:02:53.180> doing<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.600> black<00:02:53.840> on

it with the black i'm doing the black on
the<00:02:54.110> second<00:02:54.620> time<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.580> otherwise<00:02:55.910> i

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the second time because otherwise i

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.970 
the second time because otherwise i
would<00:02:56.540> have<00:02:56.570> probably<00:02:56.930> transferred<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.680> onto

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
would have probably transferred it onto

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.890 
would have probably transferred it onto

and here is the finished card I added

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:52.620 
and here is the finished card I added
some<00:04:50.770> googly<00:04:51.340> eye<00:04:51.370> simply<00:04:51.910> for<00:04:52.090> the<00:04:52.180> fun<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:52.420> it

slightly so the mask covers the face of

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.400 
slightly so the mask covers the face of
the<00:04:57.520> penguin<00:04:57.850> then<00:04:58.060> when<00:04:58.240> you<00:04:58.360> reveal<00:04:58.720> it<00:04:58.900> you
