I<00:00:48.780> think<00:00:49.520> I'm<00:00:50.520> still<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.180> do<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.780> bitumen

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

see down this end it's got a fairly high

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.810 
see down this end it's got a fairly high
might<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.909> pull<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.150> so<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.820> decent

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
might just pull back so you get a decent

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.109 
might just pull back so you get a decent
shot<00:01:15.210> there<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.869> 24<00:01:16.799> foot<00:01:17.130> from<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:17.909> end

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
shot there so it's 24 foot from one end

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
you can see I've got plenty of foam up

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.800 
you can see I've got plenty of foam up
there<00:01:46.049> left<00:01:46.890> over<00:01:47.159> from<00:01:47.399> last<00:01:47.670> time<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
there left over from last time but I

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.789 
there left over from last time but I
also<00:01:49.110> had<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> heap<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:50.130> wood<00:01:51.409> no<00:01:52.409> no<00:01:52.680> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
also had a heap of this wood no no I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.340 
also had a heap of this wood no no I
like<00:01:53.070> very<00:01:53.280> cycling<00:01:53.759> stuff<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> figured<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
like very cycling stuff and I figured it

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.399 
like very cycling stuff and I figured it
would<00:01:56.210> fit<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.329> there<00:01:57.479> pretty<00:01:57.719> well<00:01:57.810> which<00:01:58.140> it

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
would fit in there pretty well which it

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.520 
would fit in there pretty well which it
has<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.890> 15<00:01:59.280> pieces<00:01:59.490> of<00:01:59.790> scrap<00:02:00.380> I've<00:02:01.380> only

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
has just 15 pieces of scrap I've only

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.359 
has just 15 pieces of scrap I've only
got<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:02.040> little<00:02:02.790> bit<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.799> plastic<00:02:04.799> cloth<00:02:04.979> left

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
got a little bit of plastic cloth left

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.280 
got a little bit of plastic cloth left
for<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.670> Motorola<00:02:06.000> layouts<00:02:06.780> I've<00:02:07.020> had<00:02:07.170> to

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
for my Motorola layouts I've had to

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.650 
for my Motorola layouts I've had to
water<00:02:07.469> some<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:07.920> of<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> figure<00:02:09.479> I'll

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
water some more of that so I figure I'll

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.280 
water some more of that so I figure I'll
get<00:02:10.440> some<00:02:10.619> fly<00:02:10.920> wire<00:02:11.250> later<00:02:11.940> in<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.270> week

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
get some fly wire later in the week

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.679 
get some fly wire later in the week
and<00:02:13.709> some<00:02:14.129> newspaper<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.909> start<00:02:15.180> building<00:02:15.569> up

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
and some newspaper and start building up

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.170 
and some newspaper and start building up
but<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.019> should<00:02:16.230> give<00:02:16.439> me<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:17.000> fairly<00:02:18.000> good

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
but this should give me a fairly good

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.890 
but this should give me a fairly good
base<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.950> work<00:02:20.159> with<00:02:20.459> I<00:02:20.730> don't<00:02:21.360> want<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.720> go<00:02:21.840> too

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
base to work with I don't want to go too

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.259 
base to work with I don't want to go too
high<00:02:22.319> on<00:02:22.500> these<00:02:22.680> hills<00:02:22.980> because<00:02:23.790> I've<00:02:24.030> learned

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
high on these hills because I've learned

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.080 
high on these hills because I've learned
my<00:02:24.420> lesson<00:02:24.530> before<00:02:25.530> doing<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.159> you<00:02:26.849> can't

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
my lesson before doing that you can't

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.580 
my lesson before doing that you can't
actually<00:02:27.269> see<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.780> cars<00:02:28.019> when<00:02:28.349> they<00:02:28.439> get

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
actually see the cars when they get

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.839 
actually see the cars when they get
around<00:02:28.739> the<00:02:28.890> other<00:02:28.980> side<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> hill<00:02:29.670> which

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
around the other side of the hill which

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.170 
around the other side of the hill which
is<00:02:30.090> kind<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.019> defeating<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.590> purpose<00:02:32.180> so

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
is kind of defeating the purpose so

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.050 
is kind of defeating the purpose so
there<00:02:33.329> you<00:02:33.450> go<00:02:34.040> as<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.099> can<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.549> things<00:02:35.790> are<00:02:35.970> a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
there you go as you can see things are a

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.670 
there you go as you can see things are a
little<00:02:36.209> bit<00:02:36.390> cleaner<00:02:36.690> got<00:02:37.140> all<00:02:37.260> my<00:02:37.440> other

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
little bit cleaner got all my other

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.319 
little bit cleaner got all my other
stuff

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
stuff

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.270 
stuff
I<00:02:39.359> guess<00:02:39.930> I'll<00:02:40.140> sort<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.560> out<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.950> that's<00:02:41.099> the

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
I guess I'll sort that out so that's the

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.179 
I guess I'll sort that out so that's the
latest<00:02:41.609> update<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.870> hopefully<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.470> next<00:02:43.950> time

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
latest update so hopefully the next time

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.710 
latest update so hopefully the next time
we<00:02:44.430> come<00:02:44.609> back<00:02:44.819> we'll<00:02:45.060> have<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.239> bit<00:02:45.450> more<00:02:45.480> of

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we come back we'll have a bit more of

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.530 
we come back we'll have a bit more of
the<00:02:45.840> scenery<00:02:46.109> done<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.060> get<00:02:48.060> some<00:02:48.269> braids

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
