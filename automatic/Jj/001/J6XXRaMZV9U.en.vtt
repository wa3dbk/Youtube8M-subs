 The conflict in Syria is moving more and more to the complexity of the battle map between the various factions fighting under the wing of the opposition and the Syrian army and the popular committees and their supporters on the other hand, but the changes accelerated on different fronts and distributed on several axes 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:41.460
 In the north of the country, Adlab and its countryside are witnessing fierce battles, especially after the so-called conquest army led by the Front of the victory over the main camps in the city and its countryside and the withdrawal of the Syrian army under the intensity of the strikes it received, not to mention that the armed opposition intends to repeat the same scenario in Aleppo 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 In parallel, a battle took place in the western Hama countryside in the plain of Al-Ghab with the participation of a number of militant factions, which began targeting army checkpoints in an effort to cut government supply lines between Lattakia and Idlib 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:06.700
 There is also fighting south after the Nasra Front managed to concentrate in the city of Daraa and its countryside and force the Syrian army to retreat 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:16.160
 We will not forget the one who had the lion's share of control over the cities and villages in the eastern and northeastern part of Syria

 All this, according to observers, reflects the size of the new Turkish-Saudi-Gulf coordination in the quest to wrest control of the land more than ever. But why now 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:58.280
 First, the lack of a formula for political action or principles that can be based on between the government and the internal opposition or the so-called peaceful and reliable Second talk about Geneva three between the Syrian regime and the opposition with no identification of the opposition and who is on the ground and is there anyone who can control the insurgents in Syria coming from All the hump and the importance of controlling the field as a card play on the table 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:31.080
 Thirdly, it is reported that some regional countries are trying to change the balance on the ground before any agreement between Iran and the major powers in an attempt to extract a separate agreement with Iran on the survival of Assad Fourth regional situation where the Arab alliance led by Riyadh took out its planes and missiles to hit the sites of the Houthis and supporters of Ali Abdullah Saleh And talk about his transition to other regional states. 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:03:00.840
 All this leads to a result almost certain that the conflict in Syria is often where no vanquished every party has the power and sufficient capacity to sustain war and prolong the balance of Machiavelli referred the terrorism suffered by the entire people and the means justified by the objectives of the parties and their intentions to change and won the battle of long-standing
