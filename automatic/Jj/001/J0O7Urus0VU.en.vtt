 businessmen who control things 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 make all the important decisions forget 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.910
 water and only politicians are set to 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.329
 give you an idea of â€‹â€‹what you have 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.130
 freedom of choice and you do not have it you do not have 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.010
 do you have masters 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.070
 they own you they own everything you 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.899
 he owns all the important land and owns and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.000

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.570
 dismiss senate congress lawmakers 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.550
 councils 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.559
 they have studios in their pockets they all own 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.059
 all yours for the company so they 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.070
 control that almost all the news 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.030
 information when you hear and they hold 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.550
 you for the eggs 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.829
 they spend billions of dollars every year 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.660
 tacking the fruit 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.629
 taking away just to get that 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.309
 they want we know what they want they 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 want more for themselves and less for all 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.510
 the rest but I will say what he does not have 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.369
 although they love from the population of citizens 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.200
 capable with critical thinking or 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.580

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.990
 educated people able 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.670
 clinical thinking but it's not 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.320
 interested and it will not help them 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.729
 it is against their interests that way 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.470
 people look smart enough to 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.240
 sit at the kitchen table and find out how 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 crappy jobs with low wages 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.890

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.330
 these hours are modest opportunities 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.120
