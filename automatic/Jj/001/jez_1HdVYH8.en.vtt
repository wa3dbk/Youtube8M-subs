00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
there are in the world eventually people

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.920 
there are in the world eventually people
will<00:05:52.220> see<00:05:52.400> that<00:05:52.550> you<00:05:52.909> get<00:05:53.060> so<00:05:53.270> much<00:05:53.449> more<00:05:53.659> out

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
will see that you get so much more out

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.890
