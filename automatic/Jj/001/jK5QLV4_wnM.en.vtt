defeat months and we tried a lot of

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.930 
defeat months and we tried a lot of
different<00:01:03.219> things<00:01:03.340> it<00:01:03.610> would<00:01:03.730> have<00:01:03.820> been

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
different things it would have been

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.460 
different things it would have been
great<00:01:04.119> if<00:01:04.239> we<00:01:04.540> could<00:01:04.690> have<00:01:04.780> come<00:01:04.960> up<00:01:05.080> with<00:01:05.260> some

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
great if we could have come up with some

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.170 
great if we could have come up with some
way<00:01:05.620> to<00:01:05.680> redeem<00:01:06.130> him<00:01:06.400> and<00:01:06.610> we<00:01:06.880> actually

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
way to redeem him and we actually

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.560 
way to redeem him and we actually
boarded<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.600> number<00:01:07.840> of<00:01:07.960> versions<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.560> that

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
boarded a number of versions like that

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
time we tried that it just got to this

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.240 
time we tried that it just got to this
weird<00:01:22.930> place<00:01:23.260> of<00:01:23.470> like<00:01:23.619> why<00:01:24.010> are<00:01:24.070> they

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
weird place of like why are they

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.100 
weird place of like why are they
standing<00:01:24.430> around<00:01:24.700> talking<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.420> know<00:01:25.570> in<00:01:25.780> the

standing around talking you know in the
end<00:01:26.260> we<00:01:26.500> figured<00:01:26.860> all<00:01:26.979> right<00:01:27.190> as<00:01:27.340> almost<00:01:27.970> a

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
end we figured all right as almost a

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.890 
end we figured all right as almost a
representation<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:29.140> Karl's<00:01:30.010> old<00:01:30.280> self<00:01:30.909> months

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:50.730 

I<00:02:35.510> did<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:39.020> after<00:02:40.020> all<00:02:40.110> these<00:02:40.140> years

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:03:00.150 

what<00:02:51.740> wrestlin

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.220 

darkness<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.460> then<00:03:02.300> months<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.720> left<00:03:02.930> to<00:03:03.080> then

wander forever in this labyrinth and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.230 
wander forever in this labyrinth and
that's<00:03:06.620> cool<00:03:06.920> too<00:03:07.130> but<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.490> felt<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.880> little<00:03:08.090> bit

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
that's cool too but it felt a little bit

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.900 
that's cool too but it felt a little bit
like<00:03:08.360> it<00:03:08.780> was<00:03:08.900> months<00:03:09.770> is<00:03:09.890> ending<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.820> it

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
like it was months is ending and it

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.330 
like it was months is ending and it
wasn't<00:03:11.090> Carl's<00:03:11.570> ending<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.200> what<00:03:12.950> we<00:03:13.070> did<00:03:13.190> was

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
wasn't Carl's ending so what we did was

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.310 
wasn't Carl's ending so what we did was
truncated<00:03:13.610> it<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.150> so<00:03:14.330> that<00:03:14.450> it<00:03:14.630> all<00:03:14.840> happened

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
truncated it it so that it all happened

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:24.640 
truncated it it so that it all happened
right<00:03:15.500> there<00:03:15.530> in<00:03:15.830> the<00:03:15.920> dirigible<00:03:23.440> we<00:03:24.440> tried

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
right there in the dirigible we tried

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.110 
right there in the dirigible we tried
one<00:03:24.830> version<00:03:25.160> where<00:03:25.310> months<00:03:25.640> got<00:03:25.790> stuck

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
one version where months got stuck

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.980 
one version where months got stuck
inside<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.840> house<00:03:28.300> montz<00:03:29.300> is<00:03:29.510> still<00:03:29.750> after

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
inside the house montz is still after

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.020 
inside the house montz is still after
his<00:03:30.260> quarry<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.860> that's<00:03:30.980> what<00:03:31.250> his<00:03:31.550> undoing

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
his quarry and that's what his undoing

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:48.209 
his quarry and that's what his undoing
is<00:03:32.210> huh<00:03:35.740> Master<00:03:36.740> has<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.010> bird

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.219 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.229 

but<00:03:49.219> then<00:03:49.340> that<00:03:49.489> was<00:03:49.579> creepy<00:03:49.879> because<00:03:50.030> we

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
but then that was creepy because we

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.550 
but then that was creepy because we
thought<00:03:50.420> well<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.870> house<00:03:50.989> is<00:03:51.139> kind<00:03:51.230> of<00:03:51.319> alley

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
thought well the house is kind of alley

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.039 
thought well the house is kind of alley
so<00:03:52.219> we<00:03:52.340> don't<00:03:52.489> want<00:03:52.639> like<00:03:52.760> a<00:03:52.939> month<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.659> with<00:03:53.780> le

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
so we don't want like a month is with le

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.720 
so we don't want like a month is with le
that<00:03:54.799> felt<00:03:55.099> wrong

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
that felt wrong

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.759 
that felt wrong
so<00:03:56.090> we<00:03:56.299> tried<00:03:56.569> this<00:03:56.719> version<00:03:57.019> where<00:03:57.349> months

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
so we tried this version where months

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.099 
so we tried this version where months
leaps<00:03:58.430> out<00:03:58.700> and<00:03:58.939> his<00:03:59.090> legs<00:03:59.540> get<00:03:59.810> caught<00:04:00.079> on

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109 
leaps out and his legs get caught on

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:05.050 
leaps out and his legs get caught on
balloons<00:04:00.739> and<00:04:01.069> it<00:04:01.249> pulls<00:04:01.489> him<00:04:01.670> up<00:04:03.700> but<00:04:04.700> then<00:04:04.879> it

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
balloons and it pulls him up but then it

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.149 
balloons and it pulls him up but then it
felt<00:04:05.239> very<00:04:05.540> indeterminate<00:04:06.530> like<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:06.920> weren't

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
felt very indeterminate like you weren't

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.890 
felt very indeterminate like you weren't
sure<00:04:07.370> if<00:04:07.400> he<00:04:07.700> was<00:04:07.849> dead<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.389> didn't<00:04:08.719> know<00:04:08.780> if

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
sure if he was dead you didn't know if

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.750 
sure if he was dead you didn't know if
that<00:04:09.049> was<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:10.010> know<00:04:10.129> they're<00:04:10.639> gonna

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
that was so that you know they're gonna

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.220 
that was so that you know they're gonna
be<00:04:10.909> a<00:04:10.939> sequel<00:04:11.359> with<00:04:11.540> monster<00:04:11.930> or<00:04:12.049> anything

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
be a sequel with monster or anything

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.069 
be a sequel with monster or anything
like<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.560> in<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.099> way<00:04:13.780> months's<00:04:14.780> comeuppance

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
like that in a way months's comeuppance

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.670 
like that in a way months's comeuppance
was<00:04:15.919> less<00:04:16.220> important<00:04:16.729> to<00:04:16.880> me<00:04:17.150> personally<00:04:17.680> than

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
was less important to me personally than

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.379 
was less important to me personally than
any<00:04:18.919> of<00:04:19.099> that<00:04:19.220> other<00:04:19.370> stuff<00:04:19.489> I<00:04:19.910> just<00:04:19.970> kind<00:04:20.329> of

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
any of that other stuff I just kind of

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.909

wanted<00:04:20.660> to<00:04:20.810> get<00:04:20.989> him<00:04:21.169> out<00:04:21.320> of<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.530> way<00:04:21.650> so<00:04:21.709> that

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
wanted to get him out of the way so that

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.040 
wanted to get him out of the way so that
we<00:04:22.039> could<00:04:22.280> get<00:04:22.370> back<00:04:22.490> to<00:04:22.789> that<00:04:23.389> connection<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
we could get back to that connection to

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.650 
we could get back to that connection to
Carl<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.590> his<00:04:25.160> wife<00:04:25.400> what<00:04:26.030> we<00:04:26.150> finally<00:04:26.479> ended
