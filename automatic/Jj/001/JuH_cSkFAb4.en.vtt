 AnaÃƒÂ¯s 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:04.939
 dancing meal yet quick to take 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:16.249
 pyongyang 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.779
 won 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.519
 an agenda or even his propaganda in the focus on the arrangement by the minimum 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.539
 one year 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.179
 this is the point that allows us to still wait several years before 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:30.609
 it covers 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.530
 and the same thing in Paris at the head of the world my ambition is not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.080
 more 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.069
 for small giants as multiple 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.490
 twenty people thirty people lose our dear 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.079
 ahmed sobh my father a hundred people ranking even 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.289
 as another work the recent massacre went back I believe what 200 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.030
 people 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 at the same time by almost 7% 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.250
 to find his friends club had to settle a few years 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.270
 site customization could do something important to say 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.920
 bye-bye thing for 49% 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.340
 we became so interesting that it was not me because it is a player 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.200
 that I knew it would be too dangerous to personalize his 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.450
 tax declaration 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.229
 so we find a little more their passion 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.829
 highest drop in the cac 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.980
 however the canvas 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.930
 This does not preclude contacts with bank customers so that he can 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 to marry 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.450
 I do not know to make a game Quebec is remarkable 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 at the very first this is really the case of the same vision 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.120
 what did you do what you want to do the eurogroup a 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.280
 discussion where the weight of his age by the bank 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 no more than another with the team 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.400
 then in November after suffering a crisis the pre-production 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.290
 co-production is really prepared 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.220
 precisely the goal is to play so the artistic side c 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 the sketch the character 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.240
 the amenity drawn a copy design side started writing that at this 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.340
 what could be the game 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.720
 finally we start to make controversy 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.540
 remember we are making progress this is the third time that if the production of the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 well 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 for the production of the game consists of reindeer in terms that the assembly that 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.860
 secures the tastes we had already started to prepare 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.039
 we will start to colorize and well modeled characters with the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.429
 club and harvest 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.739
 and once all lego pieces are assembled we have a game on 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.119
 Morocco has planned four races and is preparing to finalize the contract but 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:21.339
 it must be the flaws to the volunteers and remember online 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.339
 geurts not top 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.079
 France 24 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:29.419
 46 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:30.870
 my sense the case 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.479
 shouting 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:38.209
 the video game sites square it only remains around him 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.939
 a team of video games that are really very 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:44.769
 more than ten minutes marc programs to answer with skiable clarity 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.069
 independent game designers bio 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.499
 and you should know 

00:02:48.499 --> 00:02:51.819
 to do that talk that the world in very different areas 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.749
 it's got a lot of compassion that could not be missed under any 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.749
 pretext 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:02.339
 arkema what can we see this spokesperson 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:05.839
 on such skids on paper that exploits the characters 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.229
 after deschamps lifestyle Sunday morning from 9 am what is 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:13.229
 our objective 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:18.100
 it's part of the mobilization appointment that actually 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.189
 from 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
 a reference that creates the character can resume 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.209
 worst times your plate that will feature your model page which 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.709
 is to create a set with the courses 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.299
 fassi fihri we made the textile for this sport in villiers-le-bel 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:38.529
 we hear a lot of video images of characters filmed a game in vancouver 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.609
 its most important scope part this math keen 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.249
 the natixis week of 0 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:46.650
 but the real creator of the game 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.119
 it's not normal 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:51.119
 through the existing computer language 

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:05.199
 it is more important to look pretty it is above all two lightning 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.979
 it's to please players bar we can not really do much more 

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:11.549

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.689
 between us 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.560
 the player and his people 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.709
 they gave advice on everything that's what the occupation of the interior 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.149
 go see is known for its quality of service games and festival tempo 

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:30.340
 Norman success with this team

 I think the schedules are however a lot of passion he finds his body 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.889
 the games what not only friends do 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.529
 because it also requires money 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.689
 printed there is a unique atmosphere the smtp server 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.409
 Last year 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.449
 the future of video games it depends on people a lot of people forget that it 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.300
 must make street 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.509
 for me 22h37 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.300
 have the same rise character in the state of the computer 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.069
 anyway 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.409
