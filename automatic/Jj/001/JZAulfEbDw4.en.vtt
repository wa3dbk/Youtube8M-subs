original karbolyn which is made by this
company<00:00:12.870> which<00:00:13.679> is<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:13.950> made<00:00:14.160> by<00:00:14.309> the

company which is now made by the
all-american<00:00:15.299> EFX<00:00:16.340> what<00:00:17.340> karbolyn<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.970> it's<00:00:18.359> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
all-american EFX what karbolyn is it's a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.929 
all-american EFX what karbolyn is it's a
very<00:00:18.630> complex<00:00:18.990> carbohydrate<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:20.070> exits<00:00:20.699> or

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
very complex carbohydrate that exits or

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.750 
very complex carbohydrate that exits or
as<00:00:21.210> quickly<00:00:21.810> as<00:00:22.109> sugar<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.859> best<00:00:23.189> part<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.519> is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
as quickly as sugar the best part is is

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.029 
as quickly as sugar the best part is is
there<00:00:24.180> sugar<00:00:24.420> free<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:25.350> with<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> carbolic

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
there sugar free so with the carbolic

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
there sugar free so with the carbolic
you<00:00:26.640> want<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> worry<00:00:27.090> about<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.390> being<00:00:27.510> stored

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you want to worry about it being stored

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.839 
you want to worry about it being stored
as<00:00:27.960> body<00:00:27.990> fat<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.859> all<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> excess<00:00:29.400> bloating

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
as body fat or all the excess bloating

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
as body fat or all the excess bloating
it's<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.390> complex<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.619> doesn't<00:00:31.830> be

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it's so complex that it doesn't be

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.260 
it's so complex that it doesn't be
broken<00:00:32.189> down<00:00:32.219> all<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.669> in<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.910> stomach

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
broken down all the way in the stomach

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
broken down all the way in the stomach
so<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.230> happens<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.010> actually<00:00:35.340> aids

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
so and what happens is it actually aids

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910 
so and what happens is it actually aids
if<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.540> take<00:00:36.750> any<00:00:37.020> other<00:00:37.200> product<00:00:37.680> with

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
if you can take any other product with

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.100 
if you can take any other product with
this<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.309> creates<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.790> termino<00:00:39.090> acids<00:00:39.629> it'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
this like creates in termino acids it'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.660 
this like creates in termino acids it'll
bomb<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.950> get<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.370> muscle

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
bomb with that and get to the muscle

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
bomb with that and get to the muscle
cell<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.000> saturate<00:00:42.510> its<00:00:42.690> muscle<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.170> our

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
cell and saturate its muscle so our

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.700 
cell and saturate its muscle so our
muscles<00:00:44.430> run<00:00:44.730> off<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.289> glycogen<00:00:46.289> which<00:00:46.440> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
muscles run off of glycogen which is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.610 
muscles run off of glycogen which is
stored<00:00:46.860> sugar<00:00:47.100> in<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.219> possible<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> it's

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
stored sugar in the possible so it's

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.500 
stored sugar in the possible so it's
really<00:00:49.800> important<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.700> should<00:00:51.149> work<00:00:51.329> out

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
really important I should work out

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.029 
really important I should work out
you're<00:00:51.840> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.020> deplete<00:00:52.410> those<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.949> you

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
you're going to deplete those so you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.510 
you're going to deplete those so you
really<00:00:53.250> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.760> replenish<00:00:54.719> those<00:00:55.140> cells<00:00:55.530> so

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
really want to replenish those cells so

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.180 
really want to replenish those cells so
you<00:00:56.579> drink<00:00:56.850> karbolyn<00:00:57.420> during<00:00:58.320> before<00:00:59.010> before

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
you drink karbolyn during before before

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.520 
you drink karbolyn during before before
during<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.000> after<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.510> workout<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
during or after your workout and it's

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
during or after your workout and it's
going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> do<00:01:02.309> that<00:01:02.489> really<00:01:02.820> efficiently<00:01:03.359> very

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
going to do that really efficiently very

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.850 
going to do that really efficiently very
quickly<00:01:04.189> without<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.549> excess<00:01:05.880> sugars

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
quickly without all the excess sugars

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.469 
quickly without all the excess sugars
the<00:01:07.860> carbolic<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.060> little<00:01:09.390> bit

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the carbolic is just a little bit

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.850 
the carbolic is just a little bit
different<00:01:09.780> from<00:01:09.869> karbolyn<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:10.770> going

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
different from karbolyn that it's going

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.649 
different from karbolyn that it's going
to<00:01:10.950> absorb<00:01:11.040> about<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> same<00:01:11.850> this<00:01:12.180> has<00:01:12.390> some

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
to absorb about the same this has some

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
to absorb about the same this has some
extra<00:01:12.960> stuff<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.439> hasn't<00:01:13.710> re<00:01:13.950> has<00:01:14.220> some
