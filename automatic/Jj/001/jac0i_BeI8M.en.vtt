the case tone which again I will make a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.629 
the case tone which again I will make a
just<00:00:08.210> educational<00:00:09.210> video<00:00:09.360> but<00:00:09.780> not<00:00:09.929> winners

if<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:11.910> using<00:00:12.120> his<00:00:12.599> design<00:00:13.309> you<00:00:14.309> can<00:00:14.519> hide

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
if you are using his design you can hide

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.279 
if you are using his design you can hide
the<00:00:15.150> water<00:00:15.890> that<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.180> staining<00:00:18.180> L<00:00:18.390> here<00:00:18.720> under

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the water that is staining L here under

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.330 
the water that is staining L here under
the<00:00:20.060> spawning<00:00:21.060> pad<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:22.230> there's<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:23.039> blocks

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
the spawning pad so there's three blocks

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.279 
the spawning pad so there's three blocks
on<00:00:23.850> pop<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.330> on<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.960> site<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:26.960> here<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:27.990> have

on pop out on the site and here I have

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.290 
on pop out on the site and here I have
the<00:00:28.470> full<00:00:28.680> version<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.160> his<00:00:29.369> mob<00:00:29.519> grinder<00:00:29.730> with

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
the full version of his mob grinder with

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.630 
the full version of his mob grinder with
the<00:00:30.359> five<00:00:30.570> layers<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:31.080> spawning<00:00:31.410> grounds<00:00:31.920> just

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the five layers of spawning grounds just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.229 
the five layers of spawning grounds just
like<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> tutorial<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:36.469> I<00:00:37.469> was<00:00:37.860> using<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
like in tutorial and I was using this

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.350 
like in tutorial and I was using this
mob<00:00:39.450> grinder<00:00:40.129> until<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.570> developed<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:44.360> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
mob grinder until I developed this it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
mob grinder until I developed this it's
my<00:00:45.570> version<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:46.050> mob<00:00:46.230> grinder<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:47.129> using

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
my version of mob grinder that I'm using

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.549 
my version of mob grinder that I'm using
right<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.480> my<00:00:48.660> Universal<00:00:49.410> mob

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
right now and in the my Universal mob

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.580 
right now and in the my Universal mob
grinder<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.820> removed<00:00:51.510> one<00:00:51.660> floor<00:00:52.170> because

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
grinder but I removed one floor because

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.900 
grinder but I removed one floor because
I<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.129> sorter<00:00:53.460> right<00:00:53.640> below<00:00:53.940> it<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
I have the sorter right below it and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.459 
I have the sorter right below it and
right<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.719> full<00:00:58.050> efficiency

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
right here I have the full efficiency

00:00:58.469 --> 00:02:32.450 
right here I have the full efficiency
version<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.570> let's<00:01:00.570> make<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> comparison

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.490 

when<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.490> was<00:02:33.730> designing<00:02:33.850> my<00:02:34.270> mops<00:02:34.480> order<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.020> was

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
when I was designing my mops order I was

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.920 
when I was designing my mops order I was
following<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.100> golden<00:02:36.250> rule<00:02:36.670> of<00:02:36.940> mob<00:02:37.720> grinder

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
following the golden rule of mob grinder

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.180 
following the golden rule of mob grinder
building<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.460> is<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:40.570> must<00:02:40.960> keep<00:02:41.470> the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
building that is you must keep the

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.610 
building that is you must keep the
spawning<00:02:42.610> pets<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.570> green<00:02:43.900> area<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.440> can

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
spawning pets in this green area you can

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.850 
spawning pets in this green area you can
see<00:02:45.240> it's<00:02:46.240> the<00:02:46.510> most<00:02:46.690> efficient<00:02:47.110> area<00:02:47.470> the

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
see it's the most efficient area the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.860 
see it's the most efficient area the
mumps<00:02:48.130> won't<00:02:48.370> fall<00:02:48.580> asleep<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.090> here<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.540> they

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
mumps won't fall asleep in here and they

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:50.640 
mumps won't fall asleep in here and they
will<00:02:50.080> spawn

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
will spawn

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.700 
will spawn
it's<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.340> place<00:02:51.610> between<00:02:52.060> the<00:02:52.510> 24<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.350> 32

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
it's a place between the 24 and 32

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.580 
it's a place between the 24 and 32
blocks<00:02:54.100> apart<00:02:54.580> from<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.970> player<00:02:55.440> where<00:02:56.440> the

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
blocks apart from the player where the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.630 
blocks apart from the player where the
mobs<00:02:56.800> have<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.870> most<00:02:58.870> activity<00:02:59.200> and<00:02:59.710> you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
mobs have the most activity and you

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.210 
mobs have the most activity and you
won't<00:03:00.880> need<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.510> wait<00:03:01.720> for<00:03:01.750> the<00:03:02.500> other<00:03:02.650> mobs<00:03:02.980> to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
won't need to wait for the other mobs to

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.930 
won't need to wait for the other mobs to
this<00:03:03.340> bound<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:04.260> they<00:03:05.260> will<00:03:05.470> definitely<00:03:06.070> walk

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
this bound and they will definitely walk

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.500 
this bound and they will definitely walk
off<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.960> spawning<00:03:08.290> pads<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.860> fall<00:03:09.700> right<00:03:10.210> to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
off the spawning pads and fall right to

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.830 
off the spawning pads and fall right to
the<00:03:10.840> hole<00:03:11.080> also<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:12.400> have<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.060> water<00:03:13.240> just<00:03:13.660> in

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
the hole also I have the water just in

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.370 
the hole also I have the water just in
the<00:03:14.050> first<00:03:14.260> floor<00:03:15.300> most<00:03:16.300> that<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.930> spawning

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
the first floor most that are spawning

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.680 
the first floor most that are spawning
on<00:03:17.560> this<00:03:17.830> floor<00:03:18.130> see<00:03:18.520> these<00:03:18.940> trap<00:03:19.240> doors<00:03:19.480> has

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
on this floor see these trap doors has

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.750 
on this floor see these trap doors has
blocks<00:03:19.990> they<00:03:20.290> can<00:03:20.500> stand<00:03:20.770> on<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.160> that's<00:03:21.580> why

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
blocks they can stand on and that's why

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.450 
blocks they can stand on and that's why
they<00:03:21.970> won't<00:03:22.270> walk<00:03:22.510> off<00:03:22.750> on<00:03:23.020> here<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:24.280> same

they won't walk off on here and the same

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.210 
they won't walk off on here and the same
thing<00:03:24.520> is<00:03:24.970> for<00:03:25.390> this<00:03:25.690> mobs<00:03:25.930> out<00:03:26.200> here<00:03:26.470> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
first floor mobs walk here because there

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.760 
first floor mobs walk here because there
is<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.190> floor<00:03:30.750> if<00:03:31.750> you<00:03:31.930> want<00:03:32.170> to<00:03:32.320> keep<00:03:32.500> your

their<00:03:37.720> HP<00:03:38.430> down<00:03:39.430> below<00:03:39.850> the<00:03:40.210> one<00:03:40.360> hit<00:03:40.600> point

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
their HP down below the one hit point

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.620 
their HP down below the one hit point
but<00:03:41.530> won't<00:03:41.890> kill<00:03:42.160> them<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.880> can<00:03:43.060> put<00:03:43.330> another

but won't kill them you can put another

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.920 
but won't kill them you can put another
block<00:03:44.110> right<00:03:44.800> here<00:03:44.860> or<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.670> half<00:03:46.000> slabs<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.600> it

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
block right here or a half slabs so it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.270 
block right here or a half slabs so it
will<00:03:47.170> serve<00:03:47.500> as<00:03:47.820> the<00:03:48.820> water<00:03:49.690> break<00:03:50.050> and<00:03:50.350> you

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
will serve as the water break and you
