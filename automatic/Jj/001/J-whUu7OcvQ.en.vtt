past I've been against rooting you could

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.730 
past I've been against rooting you could
see<00:00:11.219> all<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.400> fingerprints<00:00:11.849> right<00:00:12.120> here<00:00:12.740> but

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
see all the fingerprints right here but

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.440 
see all the fingerprints right here but
on<00:00:13.889> right<00:00:14.130> here

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
on right here

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.140 
on right here
I'm<00:00:15.929> running<00:00:16.289> CyanogenMod<00:00:17.039> 7<00:00:17.550> and<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:17.970> have

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I'm running CyanogenMod 7 and I have

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.660 
I'm running CyanogenMod 7 and I have
launcher<00:00:18.660> pro<00:00:18.960> as<00:00:19.170> my<00:00:19.380> launcher<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:22.490> it's<00:00:23.490> not

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
launcher pro as my launcher and it's not

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.490 
launcher pro as my launcher and it's not
overclocked<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.720> it's<00:00:24.810> running<00:00:25.019> at<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> higher

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
overclocked but it's running at a higher

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.550 
overclocked but it's running at a higher
maximum<00:00:26.340> rate<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.840> running<00:00:28.050> out<00:00:28.080> eat

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
maximum rate so it's running out eat

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.999 
maximum rate so it's running out eat
let's<00:00:28.980> check<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.400> stature<00:00:30.000> quick<00:00:30.890> so<00:00:31.890> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
let's check the stature quick so the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.549 
let's check the stature quick so the
highest<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.489> can<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.960> 864<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> lowest

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
highest it can go 864 and the lowest

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.160 
highest it can go 864 and the lowest
right<00:00:34.710> now<00:00:34.860> which<00:00:35.100> is<00:00:35.130> wooden<00:00:35.640> scaling<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.210> 748

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
right now which is wooden scaling is 748

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130 
right now which is wooden scaling is 748
for<00:00:37.410> an<00:00:37.500> 8<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.640> past<00:00:38.910> before<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.600> installed

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
for an 8 in the past before I installed

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
for an 8 in the past before I installed
this<00:00:40.500> ROM<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.910> can<00:00:42.120> do<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.239> on

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
this ROM well I know you can do this on

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.430 
this ROM well I know you can do this on
a<00:00:42.390> bunch<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.719> other<00:00:42.899> roms

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
a bunch of other roms

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.940 
a bunch of other roms
but<00:00:44.100> um<00:00:44.309> especially<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.170> stock<00:00:46.440> rom<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
but um especially on the stock rom you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.450 
but um especially on the stock rom you
can't<00:00:47.309> get<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:48.570> some<00:00:48.930> really<00:00:49.559> high<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.219> know

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
can't get the some really high you know

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.689 
can't get the some really high you know
maximum<00:00:51.180> percentage<00:00:51.739> amount<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.370> highest

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
maximum percentage amount the highest

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.040 
maximum percentage amount the highest
you<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:53.820> go<00:00:54.059> with<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.300> stock<00:00:54.510> rounds<00:00:54.840> around

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you can go with the stock rounds around

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.369 
you can go with the stock rounds around
600<00:00:56.180> 864<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.510> big<00:00:57.660> improvement<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
600 864 is a really big improvement and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.520 
600 864 is a really big improvement and
if<00:00:58.760> you<00:00:59.760> know<00:00:59.879> that's<00:01:00.059> much<00:01:00.570> better<00:01:00.809> than<00:01:00.930> 600

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
if you know that's much better than 600

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.700 
if you know that's much better than 600
so<00:01:01.590> it's<00:01:01.739> running<00:01:01.859> very<00:01:02.160> fast<00:01:03.530> let's<00:01:04.530> do<00:01:04.680> a

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
so it's running very fast let's do a

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.969 
so it's running very fast let's do a
benchmark<00:01:05.100> real<00:01:05.430> quick<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.500> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
benchmark real quick and I know the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.649 
benchmark real quick and I know the
quadrant<00:01:08.520> standard<00:01:08.610> benchmark<00:01:09.650> isn't

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
quadrant standard benchmark isn't

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.300 
quadrant standard benchmark isn't
optimized<00:01:12.659> for<00:01:12.810> gingerbread<00:01:13.380> but<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.159> anyway

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
optimized for gingerbread but so anyway

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.149 
optimized for gingerbread but so anyway
as<00:01:14.960> you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.110> see<00:01:16.229> how<00:01:16.320> he<00:01:16.380> did<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.590> before<00:01:16.740> I'm

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
as you can see how he did it before I'm

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.719 
as you can see how he did it before I'm
sitting<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> again<00:01:19.009> that<00:01:20.009> last<00:01:20.369> one<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> got

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
sitting it again that last one I got

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.510 
sitting it again that last one I got
around<00:01:21.259> 1029<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.590> let's<00:01:22.710> compare<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.369> this

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
around 1029 so let's compare it to this

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.250 
around 1029 so let's compare it to this
one

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.320 

again<00:01:33.010> this<00:01:33.190> isn't<00:01:33.400> gonna<00:01:33.880> be<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.120> most

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
again this isn't gonna be the most

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.540 
again this isn't gonna be the most
amazing<00:01:34.660> quadrant<00:01:35.440> standard<00:01:35.890> benchmark<00:01:36.280> in

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
amazing quadrant standard benchmark in

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.520 
amazing quadrant standard benchmark in
the<00:01:36.610> world<00:01:37.050> again<00:01:38.050> this<00:01:38.200> is<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.500> only

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
the world again this is the only

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:48.700 
the world again this is the only
mid-range<00:01:39.400> phone

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.770 

in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.340> past<00:01:49.610> I've<00:01:49.880> gotten<00:01:50.150> right<00:01:50.330> below<00:01:50.600> than

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
in the past I've gotten right below than

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.850 
in the past I've gotten right below than
the<00:01:50.990> original<00:01:51.470> Nexus<00:01:51.650> One<00:01:52.010> with<00:01:52.220> 2.1<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> that

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
the original Nexus One with 2.1 so that

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.040 
the original Nexus One with 2.1 so that
was<00:01:54.980> actually<00:01:55.130> really<00:01:55.430> good<00:01:55.700> for<00:01:55.910> a<00:01:55.970> stock<00:01:56.450> you

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.050 
was actually really good for a stock you

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.510 
was actually really good for a stock you
know<00:01:57.170> moderate<00:01:57.650> fell<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.040> getting<00:01:58.250> hit<00:01:58.400> below

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
know moderate fell and getting hit below

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.600 
know moderate fell and getting hit below
that<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:59.000> Nexus<00:01:59.390> I<00:01:59.680> usually<00:02:00.680> get<00:02:00.830> above<00:02:01.340> the

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that the Nexus I usually get above the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.880 
that the Nexus I usually get above the
desire<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.180> by<00:02:02.750> a<00:02:02.780> little<00:02:02.840> bit<00:02:03.020> but<00:02:05.590> now<00:02:06.590> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
desire just by a little bit but now that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.550 
desire just by a little bit but now that
it<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.100> running<00:02:07.880> a<00:02:08.000> little<00:02:08.149> bit<00:02:08.360> higher<00:02:08.600> I'm

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
it is running a little bit higher I'm

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.030 
it is running a little bit higher I'm
expect<00:02:10.100> more<00:02:10.369> out<00:02:10.399> of<00:02:10.520> it<00:02:10.870> yeah<00:02:11.870> it<00:02:12.560> did<00:02:12.770> drop<00:02:13.010> a

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
expect more out of it yeah it did drop a

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.720 
expect more out of it yeah it did drop a
little<00:02:13.250> bit<00:02:13.430> in<00:02:13.490> 1997<00:02:14.270> but<00:02:14.510> before<00:02:14.960> losing

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
little bit in 1997 but before losing

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.480 
little bit in 1997 but before losing
1029<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.030> around<00:02:17.420> 1000<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.590> standard<00:02:19.280> for

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
1029 so around 1000 is the standard for

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:25.330 
1029 so around 1000 is the standard for
this<00:02:19.870> right<00:02:20.870> now<00:02:23.709> let's<00:02:24.709> go<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.890> my<00:02:25.040> system

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
this right now let's go to my system

other good stuff I've noticed I'm not
sure<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:09.140> it's<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.440> type<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.150> overclocking

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
sure if it's the type of overclocking

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.290 
sure if it's the type of overclocking
I've<00:03:11.270> been<00:03:11.420> doing<00:03:11.750> because<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.820> program

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
I've been doing because the the program

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.460 
I've been doing because the the program
I<00:03:14.390> do<00:03:14.450> use<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.900> have<00:03:15.110> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
I do use to have it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.680 
I do use to have it
well<00:03:15.860> not<00:03:16.040> overclock<00:03:16.670> but<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.150> know<00:03:17.270> to<00:03:17.450> raise

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
well not overclock but you know to raise

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.900 
well not overclock but you know to raise
it<00:03:17.900> up<00:03:18.020> it<00:03:18.590> does<00:03:18.890> have<00:03:19.040> an<00:03:19.100> option<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:19.580> power

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
it up it does have an option for power

pretty good

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.870 
pretty good
in<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:45.170> past<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.920> know<00:03:46.040> it's<00:03:46.190> when<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.370> 80

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
in the past of you know it's when I 80

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.570 
in the past of you know it's when I 80
percent<00:03:47.450> right<00:03:47.690> now<00:03:47.860> with<00:03:48.860> like<00:03:49.100> moderate

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580 
percent right now with like moderate

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.960

just<00:03:56.570> looks<00:03:56.690> much<00:03:57.170> better<00:03:57.440> in<00:03:57.650> this<00:03:57.890> ROM<00:03:58.130> it's

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
just looks much better in this ROM it's

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.660 
just looks much better in this ROM it's
just<00:03:58.519> cleaner<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:59.330> do<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:00.560> I<00:04:00.860> did<00:04:01.310> like<00:04:01.519> the

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
just cleaner I do like I did like the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.100 
just cleaner I do like I did like the
Froyo<00:04:02.000> bar<00:04:02.330> but<00:04:03.050> this<00:04:03.380> bar<00:04:03.769> really<00:04:04.070> I<00:04:05.110> guess

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
Froyo bar but this bar really I guess

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.140 
Froyo bar but this bar really I guess
black<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.769> makes<00:04:07.190> it<00:04:07.489> just<00:04:07.580> makes<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:07.940> phone

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
black it makes it just makes the phone

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.090 
black it makes it just makes the phone
look<00:04:08.360> a<00:04:08.450> little<00:04:08.930> cooler<00:04:09.260> right<00:04:09.530> now<00:04:09.560> cuz<00:04:09.980> of

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
look a little cooler right now cuz of

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.820 
look a little cooler right now cuz of
black<00:04:10.600> this<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.660> a<00:04:11.840> black<00:04:12.290> phone<00:04:12.560> so

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:14.830 
black this is a black phone so

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:19.690 
black this is a black phone so
everything<00:04:15.830> looks<00:04:15.980> cooler<00:04:16.250> I<00:04:17.950> do<00:04:18.950> have<00:04:19.190> a<00:04:19.220> font

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
different font I'm not sure if you can

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.650

notice<00:04:26.870> it<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.260> lock<00:04:27.440> screen<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:29.450> it<00:04:29.570> a

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
notice it in the lock screen but it a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.100 
notice it in the lock screen but it a
little<00:04:29.810> bit<00:04:29.960> different<00:04:30.229> in<00:04:30.290> the<00:04:30.350> clock<00:04:32.110> and

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
little bit different in the clock and

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.270 
little bit different in the clock and
that's<00:04:33.410> what<00:04:33.530> I<00:04:33.620> thing<00:04:33.740> I<00:04:33.770> want<00:04:33.890> to<00:04:33.950> point<00:04:34.100> out

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
that's what I thing I want to point out

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
that's what I thing I want to point out
it's<00:04:34.610> the<00:04:34.900> lock<00:04:35.900> an<00:04:36.830> animation<00:04:37.280> that<00:04:38.060> comes

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
it's the lock an animation that comes

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.420 
it's the lock an animation that comes
standard<00:04:38.600> in<00:04:38.960> Gingerbread<00:04:39.530> so<00:04:40.010> this<00:04:40.250> is

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
standard in Gingerbread so this is

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:50.520 
standard in Gingerbread so this is
official<00:04:40.940> gingerbread

let's<00:04:51.130> do<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.700> test<00:04:52.000> real<00:04:52.210> quick<00:04:53.040> this<00:04:54.040> isn't

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
let's do this test real quick this isn't

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.950 
let's do this test real quick this isn't
much<00:04:54.460> of<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.640> test<00:04:54.880> B<00:04:55.090> as<00:04:55.180> this<00:04:55.270> application

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
much of a test B as this application

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.140 
much of a test B as this application
really<00:04:56.200> doesn't<00:04:56.680> need<00:04:57.190> much<00:04:57.250> to<00:04:57.730> run<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.030> you

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
really doesn't need much to run it you

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.370 
really doesn't need much to run it you
can<00:04:58.270> run<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.630> on<00:04:58.720> the<00:05:00.630> HTC<00:05:01.630> magic<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:02.260> it'll

can run it on the HTC magic and it'll

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:04.920 
can run it on the HTC magic and it'll
come<00:05:02.530> out<00:05:02.590> pretty<00:05:02.800> good<00:05:03.600> if<00:05:04.600> you<00:05:04.660> don't<00:05:04.870> know

when<00:06:17.320> you<00:06:17.410> were<00:06:17.500> playing<00:06:17.680> ended<00:06:18.130> game<00:06:18.370> if<00:06:18.790> it

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
when you were playing ended game if it

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.440 
when you were playing ended game if it
involved<00:06:20.050> touching<00:06:20.410> the<00:06:20.500> screen<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:22.240> would

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
involved touching the screen it would

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.360 
involved touching the screen it would
respond<00:06:23.020> and<00:06:23.229> it<00:06:23.380> would<00:06:23.470> start<00:06:23.680> lagging<00:06:24.040> and

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
respond and it would start lagging and

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.530 
respond and it would start lagging and
that<00:06:24.490> was<00:06:24.640> the<00:06:24.760> problem<00:06:24.910> with<00:06:25.030> Angry<00:06:25.330> Birds

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540 
that was the problem with Angry Birds

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.940 
that was the problem with Angry Birds
cuz<00:06:25.720> you<00:06:25.810> always<00:06:25.990> have<00:06:26.229> you<00:06:26.380> know<00:06:26.440> drag<00:06:26.800> the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:26.950 
cuz you always have you know drag the

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.920 
cuz you always have you know drag the
bird<00:06:27.190> back<00:06:27.460> and<00:06:27.850> it<00:06:28.360> would<00:06:28.450> start<00:06:28.660> lagging

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
bird back and it would start lagging

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.300 
bird back and it would start lagging
every<00:06:29.290> time<00:06:29.500> you<00:06:29.650> go<00:06:29.979> from<00:06:31.560> from<00:06:32.560> bird<00:06:32.830> to<00:06:33.160> the

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
every time you go from from bird to the

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.570 
every time you go from from bird to the
actual<00:06:33.640> no<00:06:34.360> structure<00:06:34.900> so<00:06:35.800> Brandon<00:06:36.250> they<00:06:36.310> fix

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:36.580 
actual no structure so Brandon they fix

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.190 
actual no structure so Brandon they fix
that<00:06:36.760> in<00:06:36.850> Gingerbread<00:06:37.180> so<00:06:37.510> I'm<00:06:37.630> guessing<00:06:38.080> the

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
that in Gingerbread so I'm guessing the

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.950 
that in Gingerbread so I'm guessing the
update<00:06:38.590> made<00:06:38.800> it<00:06:38.919> run<00:06:39.220> a<00:06:39.250> lot<00:06:39.430> faster<00:06:39.960> another

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 
update made it run a lot faster another

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.450 
update made it run a lot faster another
thing<00:06:41.200> I<00:06:41.320> want<00:06:41.500> to<00:06:41.590> point<00:06:41.740> out<00:06:41.890> about<00:06:42.010> this<00:06:42.400> is

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460 
thing I want to point out about this is

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.990 
thing I want to point out about this is
that<00:06:42.729> they<00:06:42.880> brought<00:06:43.120> back<00:06:43.180> the<00:06:44.760> tiles<00:06:45.760> on<00:06:45.970> the

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
that they brought back the tiles on the

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.730 
that they brought back the tiles on the
top<00:06:46.270> from<00:06:46.690> 2.1<00:06:47.680> so<00:06:48.640> I<00:06:48.669> do<00:06:48.790> do<00:06:49.450> like<00:06:49.660> that<00:06:49.900> a<00:06:50.169> lot

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
top from 2.1 so I do do like that a lot

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:58.230 
top from 2.1 so I do do like that a lot
and<00:06:54.360> um<00:06:55.800> when<00:06:56.800> you<00:06:56.919> get<00:06:57.130> cm7<00:06:57.760> you<00:06:58.090> get

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 
and um when you get cm7 you get

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.020 
and um when you get cm7 you get
everything<00:06:58.570> standard<00:07:00.060> you<00:07:01.060> get<00:07:01.390> super<00:07:01.810> user

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
everything standard you get super user

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.180 
everything standard you get super user
you<00:07:04.030> need<00:07:04.150> a<00:07:04.240> file<00:07:04.479> manager<00:07:04.900> DSPs<00:07:05.620> manager

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190 
you need a file manager DSPs manager

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.400 
you need a file manager DSPs manager
which<00:07:06.370> is<00:07:06.400> basically<00:07:06.760> a<00:07:06.849> Sound<00:07:07.150> Manager<00:07:07.410> dev

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:08.410 
which is basically a Sound Manager dev

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:16.560 
which is basically a Sound Manager dev
tools<00:07:08.800> all<00:07:09.520> that<00:07:09.700> stuff<00:07:09.940> so<00:07:14.070> I<00:07:15.330> guess<00:07:16.330> that's

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
tools all that stuff so I guess that's

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.550 
tools all that stuff so I guess that's
