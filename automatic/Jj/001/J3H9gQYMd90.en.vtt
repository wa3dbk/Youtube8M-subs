00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
guess they're supposed to expand in your

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
guess they're supposed to expand in your
stomach<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> sprite<00:00:41.309> combines<00:00:41.760> with

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
stomach and the sprite combines with

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
stomach and the sprite combines with
that<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.300> makes<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.320> really<00:00:43.410> hard<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.710> keep

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
