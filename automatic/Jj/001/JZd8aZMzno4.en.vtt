well<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.080> got<00:03:47.200> away

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.869 

so<00:03:53.319> if<00:03:53.409> your<00:03:53.560> country<00:03:53.920> doesn't<00:03:54.099> have<00:03:54.250> apple

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
so if your country doesn't have apple

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.630 
so if your country doesn't have apple
cider<00:03:55.030> they<00:03:55.659> probably<00:03:56.019> do<00:03:56.470> because<00:03:56.829> apples

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
cider they probably do because apples

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.869 
cider they probably do because apples
squished<00:03:58.390> up<00:03:58.599> into<00:03:58.870> juice<00:03:59.110> is<00:03:59.379> not

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
squished up into juice is not

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.309 
squished up into juice is not
revolutionary<00:04:00.879> so<00:04:01.450> whatever<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.810> would<00:04:02.290> be

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:02.319 
revolutionary so whatever that would be

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.690 
revolutionary so whatever that would be
in<00:04:02.590> your<00:04:02.620> country<00:04:03.069> use<00:04:03.879> that<00:04:05.250> or<00:04:06.250> maybe<00:04:06.489> it<00:04:06.609> is

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
in your country use that or maybe it is

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:08.490 
in your country use that or maybe it is
I<00:04:06.939> think<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.269> know<00:04:07.390> we<00:04:07.930> mentioned<00:04:08.079> apple
