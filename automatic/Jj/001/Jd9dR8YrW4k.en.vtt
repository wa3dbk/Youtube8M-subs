just to kind of get an idea of what
we're<00:00:45.000> looking<00:00:45.030> at<00:00:45.300> here<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.730> steel

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
we're looking at here so this is steel

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.029 
we're looking at here so this is steel
as<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.870> material<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.410> made<00:00:49.530> out<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.920> can

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
as the material it's made out of you can

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
as the material it's made out of you can
see<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.309> welds<00:00:50.760> all<00:00:50.969> along<00:00:51.300> here<00:00:51.600> they're

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
see the welds all along here they're

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.029 
see the welds all along here they're
right<00:00:52.890> they're<00:00:53.070> really<00:00:53.370> high<00:00:53.520> quality<00:00:53.579> piece

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
right they're really high quality piece

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
right they're really high quality piece
so<00:00:56.039> what<00:00:56.190> we<00:00:56.309> have<00:00:56.489> on<00:00:56.640> top<00:00:56.820> here<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so what we have on top here is the this

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.720 
so what we have on top here is the this
is<00:00:58.410> going<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.710> go<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.890> our<00:00:58.949> scoop<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.550> is

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
is going to go in our scoop and this is

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.099 
is going to go in our scoop and this is
what's<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.210> actually<00:01:00.539> grab<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.960> air

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
what's going to actually grab the air

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.860 
what's going to actually grab the air
and<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.800> flip<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> over<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.460> bottom<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.000> now

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and then flip it over on bottom here now

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.410 
and then flip it over on bottom here now
this<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> site<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.769> actually

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
this will be the site that actually

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.490 
this will be the site that actually
touches<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.450> intercooler<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.290> see

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
touches the intercooler and you can see

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.740 
touches the intercooler and you can see
the<00:01:07.619> weather<00:01:07.920> stripping<00:01:08.340> along<00:01:09.210> all<00:01:09.420> four

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
the weather stripping along all four

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.149 
the weather stripping along all four
sides<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:11.510> now<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.659> will<00:01:12.840> ensure<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.500> proper

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
sides here now this will ensure a proper

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.550 
sides here now this will ensure a proper
fitment<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.240> also<00:01:15.390> provides<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:16.229> high

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
fitment and it also provides a high

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.109 
fitment and it also provides a high
pressure<00:01:16.950> zone<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.400> keeps<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.729> high<00:01:17.850> pressure

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
pressure zone or keeps a high pressure

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.120 
pressure zone or keeps a high pressure
zone<00:01:18.439> above<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> intercooler<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.040> is

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
zone above the intercooler which is

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.320 
zone above the intercooler which is
going<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.340> force<00:01:20.549> more<00:01:20.729> air<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:21.000> go<00:01:21.119> through

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
going to force more air to go through

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.820 
going to force more air to go through
there<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> keep<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.530> intercooler

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
there it's going to keep the intercooler

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.800 
there it's going to keep the intercooler
cooler<00:01:23.220> which<00:01:23.369> will<00:01:23.549> allow<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.820> run<00:01:23.970> more

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
cooler which will allow you to run more

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.719 
cooler which will allow you to run more
boost<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.470> more<00:01:25.619> power<00:01:25.830> all<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> good<00:01:26.490> stuff

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
boost get more power all the good stuff

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.450 
boost get more power all the good stuff
like<00:01:26.820> fast<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.740> I'm<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:28.890> wanted<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> show<00:01:29.369> you

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
guys a couple of different angles of

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.289 
guys a couple of different angles of
this<00:01:31.460> just<00:01:32.460> give<00:01:32.579> me<00:01:32.670> an<00:01:32.759> idea<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.030> what<00:01:33.180> we're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
this just give me an idea of what we're

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.550 
this just give me an idea of what we're
looking<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.570> here<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> kind<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.049> big<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.439> it's

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
looking at here it's kind of big so it's

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.929 
looking at here it's kind of big so it's
a<00:01:34.590> little<00:01:34.740> bit<00:01:34.829> harder<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.100> show<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.460> camera

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.410 

very<00:01:38.939> lightweight<00:01:40.700> should<00:01:41.700> be<00:01:41.790> pretty<00:01:42.090> strong

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
very lightweight should be pretty strong

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
very lightweight should be pretty strong
which<00:01:42.659> shouldn't<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.079> matter<00:01:43.350> for<00:01:43.560> where

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
which shouldn't really matter for where

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.649 
which shouldn't really matter for where
it's<00:01:44.340> mount<00:01:44.549> it's<00:01:44.700> not<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.909> high<00:01:45.180> stress<00:01:45.479> zone

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
it's mount it's not a high stress zone

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
it's mount it's not a high stress zone
or<00:01:45.840> anything<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.259> so<00:01:46.549> all<00:01:47.549> right<00:01:47.729> well
