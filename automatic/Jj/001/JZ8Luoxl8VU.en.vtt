00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.510
 chapter 4 again began jesus to teach the voice of the master 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.340
 the crowd that gathered to see him was so big that he went up and 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.519
 sat in a boat that was in the garlic 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
 while all the people stayed on the beach 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.830
 then many things were put into signs by means of parables i 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.819
 as for the one of his explosion he told them 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:26.269
 bring attention 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.720
 a sower went out to sow 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.169
 your cd or what av scatter 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:32.540
 in health 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.970
 a part fell along the road 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.679
 the birds arrived 

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.570
 and they ate it 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.050
 another part fell on terrain peter joy 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.850
 without much earth 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.170
 those had broken round because the ground was not deep 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.770
 but when the sun came out the plants withered 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.900
 and because they did not have a country they dried up 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.590
 another part of the seed fell into three pines that 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.490
 when growing the all are 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.910
 so it did not bear fruit 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.360
 but serious things fell on good ground 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.060
 they cost they grew they introduced a harvest that yielded rent the 60 and until 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 one hundred and one 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.010
 He who has ears to hear 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.250
 I will return 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.650
 Jesus added 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.140
 when he was alone 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.060
 both of them and those around the act were asked questions about the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.340
 parables 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.130
 you will escape balado the secret of remÃ³n god 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.380
 I answer them 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.909
 but the outsiders all come to them through parables 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.810
 for what 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.390
 as much as they see, they do not perceive 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.210
 as much as they will see it they do not understand 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.600
 I do not know is that they convert and be forgiven they do not understand this parable 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.580
 finally jesus 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.600
 as you can then among the others 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080
 Employers feel the word 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.150
 some are like the ones planted by the road 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.440
 the extension of the word 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.610
 as soon as the young women who to tables 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.850
 and he takes away the word he will sow in them others are like those sown in 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.350
 stony ground 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.059
 when they hear the word 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.729
 they immediately receive it with joy 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:21.740
 but since they do not have the iss 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.429
 they last a short time 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.249
 When problems arise due to persecution 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.919
 perhaps the word 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.339
 they move away from her 

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:34.140
 others are like those sown in three pines today in the word 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.560
 but the worries of this life in the canyon of riches and many 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.399
 others 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.679
 bad wishes and another one to drown the word 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.549
 so that the state does not reach the absurd 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.960
 but others are 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.249
 as planted in good soil 

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.760
 Thou in the word accept it 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.450
 introduces a harvest that yields 30 in a car 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.569
 60 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.269
 and so I feel for one 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.109
 he also told them 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.480
 jasso brings a lamp to put it under a car omc 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.559
 under the bed 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.469
 It is not 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:08.749
 Conversely 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:11.649
 to put it on a shelf 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:15.549
 there is nothing hidden even if it is not destined to be discovered 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.339
 neither is there anything hidden 

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:21.089
 that is not meant to be revealed 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.359
 because I have ears to hear 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:24.729
 what was 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:27.569
 pay close attention added 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.819
 with the measurement that they measure to others they will be measured abusers 

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.689
 there is even more they miss the island 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:36.900
 who has 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.489
 you will be given more 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.029
 although it does not have 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:41.839
 roasted what little it has 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:43.329
 it will be removed 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.129
 Jesus continued 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.829
 the kingdom of god resembles who scatters seed on earth 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.509
 without him knowing how 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.509
 and make him come back or be awake 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.630
 day and night in protest and the seed grows 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.219
 the earth bears fruit by itself 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:07.779
 first then detailed the spike and then the grain and full on the spike 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.429
 as soon as the summer is ripe 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:17.329
 his voice gets in because the time of the harvest also said 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.449
 with which we are going to compare the kingdom of God that parable we can use to 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:24.870
 describe it 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.110
 it's like a mustard clone 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.539
 when it is sown in the earth it is the seed smaller than anyone 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:33.650
 but once on a roll 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.130
 grows to become the largest 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.780
 from the coasts alicia paz 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.050
 fan big branches 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.070
 that the birds 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.340
 they can nest in their shadow 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.870
 and with many similar words they teach Jesus the word 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.120
 how far could they understand 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.719
 I did not say anything without using balls but when I was alone 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:59.300
 with his disciples 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.520
 3 explained 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.999
 that day at night he told his disciples 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:06.759
 cross over to the other side 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.370
 they left the crowd 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.259
 and he went with him in the boat where he was 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:14.569
 also the company advanced other boats 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.520
 then a strong storm was unleashed, the waves lashed the boat so much that 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.339
 began to flood 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:25.259
 jesus meanwhile 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.860
 I was in the cup 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.699
 dhul and endo on gun head high 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.900
 so the ass pupils woke up 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.029
 teacher whistled 

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:38.219
 you do not care if we forget 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:39.520
 he stand up 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.320
 reprimanded the wind 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.199
 he ordered him to love 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.460
 silence 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.050
 take it easy 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.930
 the wind died down 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.930
 and everything was completely calm 

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:53.520
 because they are so afraid 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.539
 he said to his disciples 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.099
 they still do not have faith 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:05:59.260
 they were 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.400
 scared and said to each other 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:04.550
 who is this 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.820
 that even the wind I want to sea obey
