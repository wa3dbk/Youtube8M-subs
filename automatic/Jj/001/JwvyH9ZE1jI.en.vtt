00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.529 

now<00:01:34.220> if<00:01:34.280> you<00:01:34.399> ever<00:01:34.459> play<00:01:34.670> RTS<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.390> need

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
now if you ever play RTS you need

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.929 
now if you ever play RTS you need
resource<00:01:35.929> collectors<00:01:36.579> whatever<00:01:37.579> the<00:01:37.729> top

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
resource collectors whatever the top

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.179 
resource collectors whatever the top
thing<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:38.960> resource<00:01:39.259> collector<00:01:39.890> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
thing is is your resource collector and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.149 
thing is is your resource collector and
the<00:01:41.060> higher<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.479> number<00:01:41.649> basically<00:01:42.649> the

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
the higher the number basically the

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.330 
the higher the number basically the
higher<00:01:43.369> more<00:01:44.060> research<00:01:44.450> as<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.780> gives<00:01:44.960> you<00:01:45.340> so

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
higher more research as it gives you so

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.410 
higher more research as it gives you so
you<00:01:46.399> want<00:01:46.759> to<00:01:46.850> get<00:01:46.939> a<00:01:46.969> really<00:01:47.210> high<00:01:47.390> and

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
are upgrades like burning porches this

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.480 
are upgrades like burning porches this
looks<00:03:03.290> nice<00:03:04.480> and<00:03:05.950> captured<00:03:06.950> another<00:03:07.130> one<00:03:07.370> of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
looks nice and captured another one of

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.310 
looks nice and captured another one of
these<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.150> they<00:03:08.390> should<00:03:08.570> recharge<00:03:08.720> pretty

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320

if I'm Mike's even up oh yeah it should

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:30.660 
if I'm Mike's even up oh yeah it should
be<00:05:22.210> on<00:05:22.530> anyways<00:05:24.240> I<00:05:28.710> really<00:05:29.710> don't<00:05:30.100> like<00:05:30.370> this

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
be on anyways I really don't like this

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.250 
be on anyways I really don't like this
greedy<00:05:31.150> so<00:05:32.250> I'm<00:05:33.250> gonna<00:05:33.400> try<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.790> take<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.000> out

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260
