00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.669
 the characters jean-pierre beaulieu is a character 

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:21.669
 it's very interesting because not easy 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.269
 because he has a way of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.919
 to react 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.539
 he's always in reaction to his person what he is and what I 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.099
 would qualify as a disability and feeling 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.440
 he's always in reaction he has a lot of trouble expressing things 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.640
 in a natural and simple way 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.260
 and he accomplished a little 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.180
 authoritarian 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 jacky laurans or 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.330
 nevertheless friendly and pleasant to defend and and for the show 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
 I think it's going to break a little bit 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 nike 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.340
 m 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 but 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.009
 when I 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.080
 already made the first season 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.850
 it was for me the most beautiful role 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.280
 of all my career 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.420
 p 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.540
 he displays with the character was already at the camp nicely the first 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.320
 season at the total park 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.750
 I took a huge pleasure in working on this character and 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.020
 interested that the sedanais even more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.540
 continue to 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.890
 to further develop his characters so 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 that's the story was beautiful it was the opportunity to find with all 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.020
 team 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.650
 marie bunel in the lead and then of course christophe barraud and then find the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.400
 children 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.109
 Volcker 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.500
 author 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.490
 for the final 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.650
 in 35 seconds 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.170
 if you put down your pens 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.330
 anyway these four points 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.119
 he could fall back on tax evasion 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.409
 hop 0 includes photos 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:13.369
 Why 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.209
 between season and season 2 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.209
 the character in full flight jet blue 

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:23.579
 when we scratch a little acapela carapassion we understand 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.829
 we discover 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:28.889
 a very lonely character he also meets a pretty character what was his 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:29.899
 neighbor vannetais 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:31.479
 a deaf child 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.639
 and alone these two solitudes will receive unite 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.839
 this child from 7 to 18 in life who plays the role of samuel 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.039
 it was a sublime meeting sublime meeting because 

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:44.059
 because in fact 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.749
 first I met a beautiful person a very beautiful person 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:50.749
 it was interesting to work with him because 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.449
 he had no code since he never turned 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:57.699
 in addition it was necessary to explain things of course because on the tournament on the 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.059
 undercooked film set 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.729
 there are a lot of girls in altenmarkt quarantine of people who move in 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.589
 all the senses in the palace explain to me 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.919
 and we've been in a real 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.339
 from the first contact we have been in time 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:10.239
 would keep them beach 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.099
 and celebrate this flash the basser and cc and developed like that during 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.720
 all the 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.159
 all working sessions 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.529
 and it's a 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.059
 for more than a month I love it 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:23.389
 I worshiped prayers continued to sing and we continue to see each other then 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.849
 the long and winding it's a language that I discovered that he has 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.069
 two years now 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.239
 because I'm lucky to have friends better I met friends she 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.619
 and of course to get into their words to communicate with him took well 

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:38.339
 sure I learn on the agenda 

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:41.339
 I am happy 

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.179
 with six christophe barraud is working on the 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:47.789
 spontaneity 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:50.249
 so 

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:52.800
 it was unreal a bit surprising because 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.579
 because we rarely meet directors who 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.469
 king who leaves you a little bit 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.749
 in quotation marks improvised because day labor is not that the 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:03.749
 provocation and leaves us in any case a part of improvisation 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:06.869
 did not lose because actually deby 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.499
 there is always when we are on the set and chris hobart or there is always 

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:13.179
 a look a kind look and a look of confidence 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:14.499
 and suddenly 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:16.479
 you feel confident and you 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.370
 you just have to do because we come to school I did not know 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.529
 not the children 

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:23.999
 it was the first time I met them and I had seen small 

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:25.900
 nude pics did not know each other 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 I find myself in the class whose christophe comedy bah you'll do a 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.439
 geography course 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:33.729
 except that I did not know what a geography course was 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.349
 still not thought I was going to do a geo course so I did not 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:37.830
 prepared course 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.300
 he knows that hell that was really more and more the first day 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.759
 so be careful because 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.469
 for this first day of shooting the first time we meet the 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.020
 children do not know them 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.440
 and it was issued 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.590
 and that's why the next career 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.590
 both watersheds 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.539
 that's where science teaches 

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:59.439
 I think 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:02.029
 It must also be said what does it mean in life? 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:04.419
 a match against his colleagues in heaven 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.909
 this center I re-signed for season 3 of the big season 3 season which 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.909
 will happen then after I become the director of 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.139
 from the louis-light school I think the third season will be a real 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.559
 pretty-pretty father for the next few years there are of course the outgoing 2 

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.339
 2 of films that will come out of the shadows 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:23.319
 a Franck film learns what's called 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:27.029
 oh that was the life on saint germain of the 50s and if we can then 

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:29.830
 in projects that really hold me to my heart's content 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.129
 I have just returned from Dominican Republic 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:34.039
 so I went to turn 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.479
 documentary 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:36.550
 with 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.340
 the broker with an association that I will not support the case of the actions I 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.319
 went on a 10 year old 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.569
 who lives on the dump 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:48.219
 by looking a little tender but a look at them anyway 

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:51.339
 pretty lucid on a year this reality the reality of this common 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.389
 it's a beautiful project that gets into it
