 hello everybody here is the christian barbosa 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.400
 of triad ps and in this video wanted 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.160
 share with you five tips pro 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.139
 your brain to revolve I wrote about 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.580
 this in my book the balance result 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.810
 of a study on neuroscience 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 interesting about this 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.810
 there was a lecture by a neuroscientist 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.580
 which speaks exactly five points of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.279
 lock in the book so I think it 's cool 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 to summarize this here for you guys 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.369
 give the machine more control 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.009
 important our body is because the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.829
 brain is to see is 2% our body but 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.390
 it consumes almost 75% of its energy 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.760
 body then we really have to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.190
 keep our brain literally as 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.469
 Good gas for ours is thought. 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 these decisions of our time were better 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.660
 in the first tip I'm going to take the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.420
 following and sleeping sleep makes the brain 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.579
 relax makes the brain memorize makes you 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 having better ideas really makes you 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.030
 to recover 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.180
 sleep is a fuel in your brain 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.190
 second as to regularly and things 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.379
 Good is when you eat, for example. 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.689
 cereals when you eat vegetables when 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.549
 you eat is nuts eg food 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.369
 that are my members are very moments 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.320
 positive because the brain stimulates 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.210
 the neural transmissions hormones 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.700
 then increases the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.830
 brain functions better and 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 regularly do not be slow to eat 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.299
 lunch as at dinner just like and three in 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.920
 three hours that neither solutions nutrÃ³logos 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.509
 I recommend here that it is very useful easily 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.490
 also because maintaining the levels 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.579
 that you need to make a decision 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.770
 The third point is the most important thing. 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.420
 difficult when you eat well 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.979
 then presents and have a good coffee 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.960
 The morning you make 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.150
 hence the most difficult thing of the day and 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 this breakfast after breakfast 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.640
 why are you on a slope 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.040
 enough to make better decisions 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.659
 that task does not curl if then 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.220
 lunch but soon after lunch 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.979
 more complex task because it you 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.750
 helps you use better 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.850
 brain that is fed glucose 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.479
 to make the task more complicated than 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 day 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.270
 another tip postpones decisions if any 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.969
 if you're tired by the end of the day 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.230
 because for 16 in the afternoon you can not handle it 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.510
 more think 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.890
 mental fatigue is this tiredness and 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.510
 mentally, decisions can be made 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.670
 wrong then what you do 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.380
 the decision for the next day will not 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.590
 kill and you will have a very mission 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.850
 better and the last tip is to plan 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.620
 advance form 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.450
 I still like it, I recommend it 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.370
 3d in front of you is super useful for already 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.690
 three days forward and right after 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.580
 plan three days ahead 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.800
 the day before think about activities in the 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.720
 next day 5 basic things of the 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.880
 day-to-day type or victims of such 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.010
 way tomorrow has that meeting to do 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.440
 such a way these things you think 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.270
 in advance help to have less 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.180
 decisions the next day consume less 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.820
 nikosi from the south is from its glucose base 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.890
 in the body and make the day I was better you 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.440

 better decisions are all connected with the 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.420
 Our main reason is that our 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.580
 head
