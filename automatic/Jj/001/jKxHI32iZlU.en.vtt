 shampoo in the comfort of your home with 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.630
 things that we have in the refrigerator and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.970
 that if we are not going to have good then 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.230
 we can go to buy them does not cost us 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.940
 nothing and then the benefit is going to be 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.090
 absolutely amazing this recipe yo 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.000
 I had it on the internet because like you 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.760
 You know, well, my hair was like that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.789
 very tiny and so good or never 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.699
 I have brought in super maritime veneers 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:55.469
 but I decided to cut it small and the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 truth is that as you use a service 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.469
 because you learn to prince and well 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.049
 I found that recipe there and I said 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.119
 you do not lose anything 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.670
 and if not then well there are many 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:14.440
 enough wigs saved and well 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.800
 There you go is this one I 'll comment again 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.120
 it's like that with things we have at home 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.290
 quickly then 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:26.150
 I swear I have grown up I do not know how 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.700
 as a body and I take as 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.090
 three centimeters three and a half more or 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.440
 less in these fifteen days than I have 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.450
 been using this and I really do not know 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
 well I swear to you if back 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.850
 I had nothing was super bit of 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.640
 down here the same and has grown up grows 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.370
 with brightness grows with strength grows with 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.040
 eight thousand things of the dark and good in 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.520
 this case if you iron your hair or 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.020
 so what they mold it so what 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.840
 stimulates is more so that it grows very 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.090
 fast and so you look prettier still 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.840
 and well, now I 'm going to give you the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.570
 recipe pen paper all at home there they 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.650
 the recipe is by law of good and everyone 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:16.880
 they have in house so their feathers paper 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:21.260
 all first thing we need is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.010
 to be this a shampoo this is the one 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.420
 I used before and if you add to the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.920
 really like that I started doing with the 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.980
 hair then stop using it 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:35.190
 but I stay about half 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 shampoo and then good what 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.510
 you need is a bottle of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.459
 shampoo that is roughly halved 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.260
 in this case if they were already shopping and 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.810
 have the new shampoo can 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.569
 use a gerber jar and empty 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.250
 a little bit of shampoo why little 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.049
 good because when you add the 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.910
 little things that I will tell you later 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.849
 is going to go up and then we do not want that 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.660
 spill everything and good that one side 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.269
 and on the other side is that without how 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.730
 call if it does not reach us like this 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.860
 as a super fan benefactor 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.280
 Well then, this one we suspend 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.129
 and we no longer spoil so much shampoo 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:18.560
 then the first step you already know well 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:23.540
 our little bottle smooth the second 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:25.819
 ok the second is the second 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.760
 material instrument I do not know what we're going to 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.340
 occupy will be and there go these are the 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.530
 two secret ingredients and well 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.440
 is going to be an onion or half of a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.910
 onion or a little room of an onion I 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.700
 I recommend them more or less between a 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:45.790
 fourth and half of the onion and this 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.239
 we are going to need 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:52.150
 chilito of these that are called chiles de 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.879
 tree can use other chilies to 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.640
 the truth has to be done as well as 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.739
 than a sensitivity test for 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.049
 see that I'm not going to apply them much 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.720
 because you do not cure them sometimes you 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:08.150
 take every experience then I in 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.410
 this case I will use as 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.400
 45 young children ready 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.160
 and half the onion and good will that 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.769
 let's do with all that we're going to 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.200
 chop with a little knife so super good 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.870
 in squares or so the joke is that 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.600
 fit through the hole of our shampoo 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.460
 so we can put it in then we eat well 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.280
 our half of our onion the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.810
 half of our chiles so that 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.810
 then let's move on to the other 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.090
 ok after we cried and suffered a 

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.790
 little bit with this part of the onion that 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.010
 the truth now how do you make me cry 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.350
 that's how good a guess 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.660
 because the truth does not look super chop 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.540
 ok these things but good here 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.190
 there are the chilitos so super minced and 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.390
 the onion applications reach my 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.760
 wide is ok this we are not going to like this 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.030
 As friends, the next step is 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.100
 To be 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:12.610
 obviously untie our is a point 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:15.650
 and he is doing everything that 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.969
 we cut chiles 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:21.040
 I think it served to remove a chile 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:24.230
 A) Yes 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:26.180
 and the onion 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:29.530
 and we have to put everything 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:32.810
 remember half an onion and 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.700
 like 45 chilies 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.920
 obviously depending on the size of the 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.720
 hair if you have it very small then 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.160
 do not go to put a lot of tea because 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.670
 the same with which you are going to waste 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.169
 pretty much then well that 's what you 

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:49.439
 let's fill everything 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.270
 and well I am, I say is the one 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:54.449
 I'm using there already has a little 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.150
 so that as well as I was already 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.680
 finished 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:03.080
 this field that happens after this 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.990
 what the onion was telling us is going to 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.710
 give a lot of brightness if it's going to appear 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:12.350
 as suddenly we're making a 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.289
 sauce or something like that but well the 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.389
 true if it comes back a little bit 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.410
 when you are bathing it seems that you are 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:24.590
 living in the kitchen and like that but the 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:26.509
 it really works incredibly 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.970
 results I tell you salt obinna and 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:31.040
 with me there is a picture of the before and the 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.430
 after and so everything 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.260
 and the truth is if it's worth the smell, 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.030
 lasts them all day as well as their salt in 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.950
 the bathroom I do not know and they start drying 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.070
 hair is completely odor 

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.710
 I say onion and chili pepper 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.840
 and it's super nice historical I hope 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.460
 that you liked the time of pose 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.000
 of this shampoo 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.050
 before being able to use it is of minimum 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:59.420
 about 10 days minimum so you can take out 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.610
 everything you have to take out and this one 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:03.830
 about the process, it's getting a little 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.430
 more and well, I hope you have them 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.950
 I really liked that they put it into practice 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.900
 I swear he works and this and now and 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:13.850
 will continue to see photos of me how is going 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.470
 it grew in the hair because then yes 

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.900
 He did not leave it to me until as if 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.930
 the pomps just so something something sensual 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:24.740
 for this season then good they 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:27.310
 I send many greetings and then 

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.840
 put on sunscreen this holiday 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:33.580
 I love them very much and I want to see them 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.580
 triumph goodbye
