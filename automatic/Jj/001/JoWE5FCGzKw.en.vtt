behringer x32 here I wanted to show you
guys<00:00:06.540> how<00:00:06.600> to<00:00:06.870> program<00:00:07.740> the<00:00:08.429> scribble<00:00:09.000> strips

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
guys how to program the scribble strips

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.320 
guys how to program the scribble strips
for<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.719> DCA's<00:00:10.519> the<00:00:11.519> nice<00:00:11.670> thing<00:00:11.849> about<00:00:11.880> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
for the DCA's the nice thing about the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.169 
for the DCA's the nice thing about the
software<00:00:13.259> right<00:00:13.380> now<00:00:13.620> inside<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.759> board<00:00:14.969> is

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
software right now inside the board is

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.310 
software right now inside the board is
you<00:00:15.389> can<00:00:15.630> color<00:00:16.289> code<00:00:16.560> these<00:00:16.910> scribble<00:00:17.910> strips

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 
you can color code these scribble strips

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.250 
you can color code these scribble strips
inside<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.529> board<00:00:20.960> unfortunately<00:00:21.960> you<00:00:22.050> can't

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
inside the board unfortunately you can't

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.080 
inside the board unfortunately you can't
do<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.590> with<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.100> channels<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.789> have<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
do that with the channels you have to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.740 
do that with the channels you have to
use<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.600> program<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> PC<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.510> program<00:00:27.510> these

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
use a program on a PC to program these

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.910 
use a program on a PC to program these
but<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:29.369> video<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> about<00:00:29.939> assigning<00:00:30.920> names

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
but this video is about assigning names

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.069 
but this video is about assigning names
colors<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.910> different<00:00:33.329> pictures<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.899> these

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
colors and different pictures to these

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.490 
colors and different pictures to these
so<00:00:34.860> basically<00:00:35.579> we<00:00:35.820> have<00:00:36.000> our<00:00:36.079> DCA<00:00:37.079> so<00:00:37.230> we're

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
so basically we have our DCA so we're

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.830 
so basically we have our DCA so we're
going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> go<00:00:37.800> ahead<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> select<00:00:38.420> group<00:00:39.420> DCA

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
going to go ahead and select group DCA

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.869 
going to go ahead and select group DCA
right<00:00:40.200> there<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.370> we're<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> go

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
right there and then we're going to go

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.049 
right there and then we're going to go
up<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:43.070> monitor<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.250> here<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> right

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
up to our monitor up here to the right

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
up to our monitor up here to the right
we<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.719> setup<00:00:46.289> so<00:00:46.649> we're<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.920> click

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
we have setup so we're going to click

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.959 
we have setup so we're going to click
setup<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:48.739> then<00:00:49.739> here<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.489> global

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
setup and then here we have global

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.510 
setup and then here we have global
config<00:00:51.360> remote<00:00:51.750> network<00:00:52.170> DCA<00:00:52.590> groups<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.340> what

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
config remote network DCA groups so what

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.799 
config remote network DCA groups so what
we're<00:00:53.640> going<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.120> is<00:00:54.329> we're<00:00:54.480> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> go

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the symbol that's on the DCA so if you

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
the symbol that's on the DCA so if you
wanted<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> have<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:08.910> be<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> group<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.069 
can go ahead and
the<00:02:12.370> different<00:02:12.730> things<00:02:12.939> that<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> will<00:02:13.390> be

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:14.079 
the different things that it will be

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:17.250 
the different things that it will be
assigned<00:02:14.379> to<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:14.890> here<00:02:15.329> in<00:02:16.329> this<00:02:16.780> case<00:02:17.019> it's

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
assigned to down here in this case it's

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.839 
assigned to down here in this case it's
going<00:02:17.379> to<00:02:17.439> be<00:02:17.530> a<00:02:17.620> DCA<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:18.159> we'll<00:02:18.430> leave<00:02:18.549> it<00:02:18.609> as

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
going to be a DCA so we'll leave it as

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.390 
going to be a DCA so we'll leave it as
DCA<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> now<00:02:20.859> we're<00:02:21.010> going<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.159> go<00:02:21.280> ahead

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
DCA and so now we're going to go ahead

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.030 
DCA and so now we're going to go ahead
and<00:02:21.700> change<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.209> name<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.829> naming<00:02:23.829> is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
right rotary knob right here so we're

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.720 
right rotary knob right here so we're
going<00:02:46.989> to<00:02:47.079> go<00:02:47.170> ahead<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.709> up<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.280> we're
