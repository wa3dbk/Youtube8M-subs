00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.090
 and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:26.420
 of everything because we want 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:29.150
 in ways unimaginable with the engineer 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.340
 sergio fernÃ¡ndez that is the record 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.750
 Guinness for artistic gelatin more 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.880
 biggest of the world 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.560
 I am on the leash and from the city 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.280
 from Mexico 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.280
 we start 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.400
 Well, here we have the sergio engineer 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.380
 fernandez who was the winner still 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 still the winner by the 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.810
 the world's largest artistic jelly 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.670
 and good another Mexican another talent that 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.200
 break the guiness record how you felt 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.200
 and how he continues to feel for this 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:24.030
 at the moment preparing things is not all 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.540
 the information guinness record week 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.700
 three or four months the answer and in 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.790
 the moment they warned us that the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.890
 travel had been accepted because it is 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.080
 very emotional and even sometimes even 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.210
 tears and since then it's still 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.369
 dedicating to the gelatins of the courses 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.790
 and I told them in the welcome towards 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.290
 unimaginable gelatins like the first 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.869
 that we are going to prepare today that is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:58.350
 avocado is imagined as a jelly 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:02:02.509
 avocado to elaborate however for a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.509
 mousse probably installed 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.440
 we can start preparing this gelatin 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.480
 and let's start what are the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.519
 obviously grenetin ingredients but 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.319
 less saying a little the measures 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.390
 for 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.790
 all those who are seeing us things that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.950
 they are watching us begin to take note 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 of course as ingredients we are going to 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.139
 have the following half a liter of water 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.689
 25 grams of credit the amount of 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.760
 Avocado is approximately 250 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.019
 grams and we will also use as 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.980
 condensed milk ingredient 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:42.200
 sugary technician hey and of course the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.450
 peel of our avocado that is one 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
 of the most critical vessels clear what 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.139
 let's make in our shell where 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.870
 we will serve as then 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:54.319
 let's also use a mold type 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.989
 half egg to simulate the bone of the 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.810
 avocado also with the same gelatin 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.120
 paulo then a trabazo then now 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.469
 let's start and let's put a 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.469
 small amount of water 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.380
 the amount is very little I'm 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.110
 adding very incipient 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.980
 and here I'm going to take a first listen 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.050
 welcome 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.370
 it is thrown at me that I am going to go is with 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:23.099
 urgency 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.980
 why not deposit everything if it starts to 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:28.890
 be the group sedesa form the group 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.930
 hot with another spoon for example tea 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.090
 I'm going to leave here on top of creatine and 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.549
 I'm going to drop a little jet that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.349
 they are kind of like bridge this is going 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.540
 to make life begin to sink 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.500
 sinking the grenetina takes longer 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.500
 Cooking time 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.770
 and now with gentle movements but 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.170
 continuous we will go dissolving our 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.320
 grenetina little by little this will take you 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.410
 approximately 5 or 6 minutes to 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.920
 that we have perfectly 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.920
 dissolved our belief 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.669
 about
