all the lead-based paint but we wanted
to<00:00:44.760> keep<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> hardware<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:46.020> reuse

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379

not to reuse the trim it was just too

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.750 
not to reuse the trim it was just too
much<00:00:54.539> labor<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.110> expense<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.739> try<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.489> reuse

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
much labor and expense to try and reuse

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.310 
much labor and expense to try and reuse
the<00:00:56.910> trim<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.449> were<00:00:57.539> gonna<00:00:57.660> reclad<00:00:58.140> them

original crystal hardware from the 30s
not<00:01:16.350> beautiful<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.759> had<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.030> we<00:01:18.299> had<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
not beautiful and we had to we had to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660 
not beautiful and we had to we had to
actually<00:01:18.630> find<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.259> key<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:20.189> we<00:01:20.280> found<00:01:20.460> a

actually find a key but we found a
skeleton<00:01:20.970> key<00:01:21.450> though<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> worked<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
skeleton key though it worked for it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
skeleton key though it worked for it
course<00:01:22.890> painted<00:01:23.220> pink<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> key

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
course painted pink and and the key

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.340 
course painted pink and and the key
actually<00:01:25.890> works<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.310> these<00:01:26.490> doors<00:01:26.729> as<00:01:26.939> well

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
actually works on these doors as well

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
actually works on these doors as well
what<00:01:28.350> beautiful<00:01:28.680> hardware<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> big<00:01:30.780> fan<00:01:31.049> of

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
what beautiful hardware I'm a big fan of

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.890 
what beautiful hardware I'm a big fan of
reusing<00:01:31.829> things<00:01:32.009> we<00:01:32.909> do<00:01:33.060> need<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.540> you<00:01:33.600> do

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
reusing things we do need to know you do

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.810 
reusing things we do need to know you do
need<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.619> was<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:35.250> huge

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
need to know that this was not a huge

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
need to know that this was not a huge
cost<00:01:36.210> savings<00:01:36.840> typically<00:01:37.350> when<00:01:37.470> you're

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
cost savings typically when you're

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.390 
cost savings typically when you're
redoing<00:01:37.979> doors<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> stripping<00:01:40.079> them<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:41.100> at

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
redoing doors and stripping them it's at

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.850 
redoing doors and stripping them it's at
best<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.030> wash<00:01:42.299> most<00:01:43.020> likely<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.590> gonna<00:01:43.710> be

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
best a wash most likely it's gonna be

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.950 
best a wash most likely it's gonna be
