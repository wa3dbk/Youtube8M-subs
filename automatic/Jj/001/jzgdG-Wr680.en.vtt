coming back to this one but basically

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.560 
coming back to this one but basically
there<00:01:41.990> are<00:01:42.020> two<00:01:42.200> tiers<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.740> the<00:01:42.830> power<00:01:43.040> slide

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
there are two tiers to the power slide

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.790 
there are two tiers to the power slide
you<00:01:44.570> have<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.780> first<00:01:45.020> one<00:01:45.230> which<00:01:45.410> is<00:01:45.440> a<00:01:45.590> blue

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
you have the first one which is a blue

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.440 
you have the first one which is a blue
spark<00:01:46.070> and<00:01:46.310> boosts<00:01:46.790> you<00:01:46.880> for<00:01:47.060> a<00:01:47.120> little<00:01:47.240> bit

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
spark and boosts you for a little bit

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.600 
spark and boosts you for a little bit
then<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.320> have<00:01:48.500> the<00:01:48.620> second<00:01:49.040> one<00:01:49.160> which<00:01:49.430> is<00:01:49.460> a

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
then you have the second one which is a

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.470 
then you have the second one which is a
red<00:01:49.850> spark<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.420> uses<00:01:50.720> you<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.050> longer<00:01:52.480> power

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
red spark and uses you for longer power

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.790 
red spark and uses you for longer power
sliding<00:01:53.900> is<00:01:54.020> an<00:01:54.110> extremely<00:01:54.530> helpful

technique and you should do it whenever

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.660 
technique and you should do it whenever

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.720 
these small curves I'm still able to
pull<00:02:00.380> out<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.650> first<00:02:00.890> tier<00:02:01.160> of<00:02:01.250> blue<00:02:01.400> spark

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
pull out that first tier of blue spark

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:03.190 
pull out that first tier of blue spark
and<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.330> could<00:02:02.540> mean<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.720> difference<00:02:03.110> between

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
and I could mean a difference between

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.150 
and I could mean a difference between
first<00:02:03.680> place<00:02:03.740> for<00:02:04.100> a<00:02:04.160> second<00:02:04.460> place

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.160 
first place for a second place

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.040 
first place for a second place
unfortunately<00:02:07.160> though<00:02:08.090> there<00:02:08.510> are<00:02:08.690> still

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
unfortunately though there are still

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.690 
unfortunately though there are still
places<00:02:09.260> that<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.710> can't<00:02:09.950> power<00:02:10.190> slide<00:02:10.280> one

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
places that you can't power slide one

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.420 
places that you can't power slide one
like<00:02:11.390> this<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.570> very<00:02:11.690> very<00:02:12.080> small<00:02:12.560> curve<00:02:12.830> don't

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
like this a very very small curve don't

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.340 
like this a very very small curve don't
even<00:02:13.640> bother<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.210> and<00:02:14.450> that's<00:02:14.900> perfectly

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
even bother with it and that's perfectly

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.470 
even bother with it and that's perfectly
fine<00:02:15.590> this<00:02:15.950> leads<00:02:16.280> into<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.670> next<00:02:16.850> bit<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.300> our

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
fine this leads into the next bit of our

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.670 
fine this leads into the next bit of our
discussion<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.960> may<00:02:21.080> find<00:02:21.350> yourself

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
discussion you may find yourself

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.440 
discussion you may find yourself
struggling<00:02:22.040> to<00:02:22.250> even<00:02:22.550> get<00:02:22.670> that<00:02:22.820> first<00:02:23.150> tier

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
struggling to even get that first tier

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.850 
struggling to even get that first tier
boost<00:02:23.720> that<00:02:23.960> you<00:02:23.990> want<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.500> that's<00:02:24.620> probably

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
boost that you want and that's probably

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.320 
boost that you want and that's probably
doing<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.310> smallness<00:02:25.610> of<00:02:25.850> the<00:02:25.970> term<00:02:26.150> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
doing the smallness of the term that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.630 
doing the smallness of the term that
you're<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.690> around<00:02:26.810> it<00:02:27.140> right<00:02:28.130> here<00:02:28.460> on

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
you're going around it right here on

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.490 
you're going around it right here on
that<00:02:29.420> turn<00:02:29.630> I<00:02:29.660> wasn't<00:02:30.020> able<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.230> get<00:02:30.350> that

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
that turn I wasn't able to get that

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.290 
that turn I wasn't able to get that
first<00:02:30.830> two<00:02:30.950> your<00:02:31.040> boost<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.880> here's<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.090> little

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
first two your boost but here's a little

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.880 
first two your boost but here's a little
trick<00:02:32.510> you<00:02:32.540> can<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.930> that<00:02:33.350> will<00:02:33.440> make<00:02:33.590> sure<00:02:33.620> you

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
trick you can do that will make sure you

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.280 
trick you can do that will make sure you
can<00:02:34.010> get<00:02:34.130> it<00:02:34.510> when<00:02:35.510> approaching<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.080> turn

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
can get it when approaching the turn

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.440 
can get it when approaching the turn
power<00:02:36.860> slides<00:02:37.160> to<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.400> left<00:02:37.580> this<00:02:37.730> time<00:02:37.790> don't

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
power slides to the left this time don't

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.570 
power slides to the left this time don't
actually<00:02:38.600> complete<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.200> power<00:02:39.410> slide<00:02:39.680> but<00:02:40.459> as

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
actually complete the power slide but as

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.310 
actually complete the power slide but as
you<00:02:40.700> can<00:02:40.820> see<00:02:40.880> now<00:02:41.600> when<00:02:41.720> your<00:02:41.840> parasite<00:02:42.200> to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
you can see now when your parasite to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.810 
you can see now when your parasite to
the<00:02:42.410> right<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.860> actually<00:02:43.160> get<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> small<00:02:43.580> boost

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820 
the right you actually get a small boost

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.180 
the right you actually get a small boost
this<00:02:43.910> time<00:02:44.230> when<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:45.320> started<00:02:45.680> power<00:02:45.890> sliding

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
this time when you started power sliding

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.220 
this time when you started power sliding
the<00:02:46.459> left<00:02:46.580> or<00:02:46.760> direction<00:02:47.270> you<00:02:47.630> change<00:02:47.959> the<00:02:48.110> way

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
the left or direction you change the way

you<00:02:48.290> were<00:02:48.440> facing<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.100> when<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.280> started<00:02:49.580> the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
you were facing for when you started the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.520 
you were facing for when you started the
rightward<00:02:49.940> power<00:02:50.209> side<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.720> therefore<00:02:51.170> me

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
rightward power side and therefore me

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.960 
rightward power side and therefore me
the<00:02:51.650> rightward<00:02:51.920> power<00:02:52.220> slide<00:02:52.489> happened

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the rightward power slide happened

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.240 
the rightward power slide happened
quicker<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.720> like<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.500> call<00:02:54.620> this<00:02:54.739> little<00:02:54.890> trick

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
quicker I like to call this little trick

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.490 
quicker I like to call this little trick
setting<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.000> power<00:02:56.209> slide<00:02:56.540> I'll<00:02:57.260> give<00:02:57.440> you

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
setting up a power slide I'll give you

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.880 
setting up a power slide I'll give you
another<00:02:57.709> example<00:02:59.290> by<00:03:00.290> performing<00:03:00.800> an

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
another example by performing an

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
incomplete power side to the right when

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.180 
incomplete power side to the right when
this<00:03:02.660> first<00:03:02.930> turn<00:03:03.170> I'm<00:03:03.560> able<00:03:03.830> to<00:03:03.920> get<00:03:04.040> that

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
this first turn I'm able to get that

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:05.770 
this first turn I'm able to get that
first<00:03:04.459> tier<00:03:04.670> boost<00:03:04.940> on<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.360> second<00:03:05.660> turn

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
first tier boost on the second turn

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.960 
first tier boost on the second turn
followed<00:03:06.470> by<00:03:06.590> its<00:03:06.739> second<00:03:07.220> tier<00:03:07.370> boost<00:03:07.640> on<00:03:07.910> the

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
followed by its second tier boost on the

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.320 
followed by its second tier boost on the
third<00:03:08.270> turn

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
third turn

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.700 
third turn
if<00:03:10.330> I<00:03:10.480> hadn't<00:03:10.810> started<00:03:10.990> that<00:03:11.230> first<00:03:11.380> power

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
if I hadn't started that first power

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.110 
if I hadn't started that first power
slide<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.460> wouldn't<00:03:12.670> have<00:03:12.760> gotten<00:03:12.970> the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
slide and I wouldn't have gotten the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.850 
slide and I wouldn't have gotten the
boost<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.630> second<00:03:13.960> term<00:03:16.620> there's<00:03:17.620> another

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
boost in the second term there's another

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.470 
boost in the second term there's another
trick<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.160> can<00:03:18.370> do<00:03:18.550> while<00:03:18.760> power<00:03:19.000> reciting

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
trick you can do while power reciting

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.640 
trick you can do while power reciting
and<00:03:19.660> I<00:03:19.690> don't<00:03:19.900> know<00:03:19.960> what<00:03:20.080> else<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.290> call<00:03:20.320> it

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
and I don't know what else to call it

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.100 
and I don't know what else to call it
besides<00:03:20.920> parasite<00:03:21.520> controlling<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.870> want<00:03:23.050> to

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
besides parasite controlling you want to

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.660 
besides parasite controlling you want to
use<00:03:23.260> this<00:03:23.410> technique<00:03:23.830> when<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.100> stock<00:03:24.400> power

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
use this technique when you stock power

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.580 
use this technique when you stock power
siding<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.210> a<00:03:25.270> really<00:03:25.540> long<00:03:25.690> term<00:03:25.959> such<00:03:26.350> as<00:03:26.500> the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
siding on a really long term such as the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.500 
siding on a really long term such as the
one<00:03:26.709> in<00:03:26.740> waterpark<00:03:27.310> instead<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.090> storing<00:03:28.360> up

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
one in waterpark instead of storing up

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.880 
one in waterpark instead of storing up
your<00:03:28.660> power<00:03:28.870> slide<00:03:29.080> for<00:03:29.290> the<00:03:29.350> end<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.680> turn

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
your power slide for the end of the turn

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.010 
your power slide for the end of the turn
use<00:03:30.459> it<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.820> then<00:03:31.209> start<00:03:31.480> up<00:03:31.540> another<00:03:31.780> one

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
use it and then start up another one

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:44.589 
use it and then start up another one
this<00:03:32.350> way<00:03:32.560> you'll<00:03:32.709> get<00:03:32.830> even<00:03:32.980> more<00:03:33.250> of<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.490> boost

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.720 

there's<00:03:45.590> one<00:03:45.769> last<00:03:45.890> thing<00:03:46.099> I<00:03:46.340> want<00:03:46.519> to<00:03:46.609> say

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
there's one last thing I want to say

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.099 
there's one last thing I want to say
about<00:03:46.849> power<00:03:47.120> siting<00:03:47.599> but<00:03:47.749> this<00:03:47.870> part<00:03:48.079> is

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:48.109 
about power siting but this part is

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.319 
about power siting but this part is
pretty<00:03:48.290> insignificant<00:03:48.590> see<00:03:49.430> after<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:50.030> turn

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
pretty insignificant see after this turn

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.209 
pretty insignificant see after this turn
how<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:50.599> struggle<00:03:51.139> to<00:03:51.170> get<00:03:51.379> on<00:03:51.530> the<00:03:51.650> ramps<00:03:52.040> I

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:52.219 
how I struggle to get on the ramps I

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.190 
how I struggle to get on the ramps I
skate<00:03:52.879> a<00:03:52.909> lot<00:03:53.120> and<00:03:53.420> it<00:03:53.599> actually<00:03:53.870> slows<00:03:54.019> me

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
skate a lot and it actually slows me

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.589 
skate a lot and it actually slows me
down<00:03:54.230> instead<00:03:55.189> of<00:03:55.310> wasting<00:03:55.459> precious<00:03:55.939> time<00:03:56.150> by

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
down instead of wasting precious time by

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:58.030 
down instead of wasting precious time by
skating<00:03:56.870> around<00:03:57.109> you<00:03:57.379> can<00:03:57.469> actually<00:03:57.560> power

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
skating around you can actually power

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.259 
skating around you can actually power
slide<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.549> order<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.849> better<00:03:59.030> position

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
slide in order to better position

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:04.629 
slide in order to better position
yourself<00:03:59.930> to<00:04:00.109> get<00:04:00.230> on<00:04:00.319> the<00:04:00.409> ramps<00:04:00.739> I<00:04:03.519> just<00:04:04.519> did

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
yourself to get on the ramps I just did

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.129 
yourself to get on the ramps I just did
a<00:04:04.700> very<00:04:04.849> quick<00:04:05.060> hop<00:04:05.329> and<00:04:05.569> I<00:04:05.629> was<00:04:05.750> able<00:04:05.959> to<00:04:06.019> get

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:06.139 
a very quick hop and I was able to get

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:15.879 
a very quick hop and I was able to get
on<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.349> rims<00:04:06.560> without<00:04:06.859> much<00:04:07.040> speed<00:04:07.310> loss<00:04:14.889> okay

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
on the rims without much speed loss okay

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.680 
on the rims without much speed loss okay
so<00:04:16.130> now<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.519> we've<00:04:16.669> discussed<00:04:17.000> power<00:04:17.269> siding

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
so now that we've discussed power siding

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.379 
so now that we've discussed power siding
let's<00:04:18.470> talk<00:04:18.680> about<00:04:18.829> coins<00:04:19.130> a<00:04:19.310> little<00:04:19.549> bit<00:04:19.669> this

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
let's talk about coins a little bit this

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:21.759 
let's talk about coins a little bit this
section<00:04:20.780> won't<00:04:20.959> be<00:04:21.109> as<00:04:21.199> long<00:04:21.380> as<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.590> power

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
section won't be as long as a power

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:22.870 
section won't be as long as a power
siting<00:04:22.130> but<00:04:22.250> it's<00:04:22.370> still<00:04:22.460> important<00:04:22.849> to

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
siting but it's still important to

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.140 
siting but it's still important to
mention<00:04:23.949> so<00:04:24.949> coins<00:04:25.610> started<00:04:25.910> becoming

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
mention so coins started becoming

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.140 
mention so coins started becoming
important<00:04:27.050> back<00:04:27.320> in<00:04:27.530> Mario<00:04:27.830> Kart<00:04:27.860> 7<00:04:28.280> when<00:04:29.030> they

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
important back in Mario Kart 7 when they

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.270 
important back in Mario Kart 7 when they
gave<00:04:29.330> you<00:04:29.479> boosts<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.020> sped<00:04:30.229> you<00:04:30.349> up<00:04:30.530> the<00:04:31.039> same

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
gave you boosts and sped you up the same

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.790 
gave you boosts and sped you up the same
goes<00:04:31.490> for<00:04:31.520> Mario<00:04:31.940> Kart<00:04:32.210> 8<00:04:32.500> you<00:04:33.500> can<00:04:33.650> have<00:04:33.740> a

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
goes for Mario Kart 8 you can have a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.670 
goes for Mario Kart 8 you can have a
maximum<00:04:34.009> of<00:04:34.400> ten<00:04:34.639> coins<00:04:34.880> at<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> time<00:04:35.419> and<00:04:35.720> the

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
maximum of ten coins at a time and the

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.909 
maximum of ten coins at a time and the
more<00:04:36.860> coins<00:04:37.160> you<00:04:37.250> have<00:04:37.340> the<00:04:37.759> faster<00:04:38.120> you'll<00:04:38.300> go

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
more coins you have the faster you'll go

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.800 
more coins you have the faster you'll go
additionally<00:04:39.919> each<00:04:40.460> coin<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.970> get<00:04:41.240> you'll

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
additionally each coin you get you'll

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.469 
additionally each coin you get you'll
get<00:04:41.960> a<00:04:42.020> very<00:04:42.349> small<00:04:42.650> boost<00:04:43.090> so<00:04:44.090> even<00:04:44.330> if<00:04:44.389> you

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
get a very small boost so even if you

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.029 
get a very small boost so even if you
already<00:04:44.630> have<00:04:44.870> your<00:04:45.020> full<00:04:45.229> ten<00:04:45.410> coins<00:04:45.710> it's

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
already have your full ten coins it's

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:47.290 
already have your full ten coins it's
still<00:04:46.190> worth<00:04:46.370> it<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.610> keep<00:04:46.759> collecting<00:04:46.940> them

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
still worth it to keep collecting them

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.700 
still worth it to keep collecting them
because<00:04:47.660> the<00:04:47.780> small<00:04:48.020> boost<00:04:48.259> that<00:04:48.440> it<00:04:48.530> gives

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
because the small boost that it gives

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.730 
because the small boost that it gives
you

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.770 

in<00:04:53.220> this<00:04:53.400> clip<00:04:53.670> you're<00:04:53.790> about<00:04:53.970> to<00:04:54.150> watch<00:04:54.270> the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
in this clip you're about to watch the

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.200 
in this clip you're about to watch the
ghost<00:04:55.080> has<00:04:55.470> collected<00:04:55.890> a<00:04:56.040> full<00:04:56.340> 10<00:04:56.580> coins<00:04:56.910> in

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
ghost has collected a full 10 coins in

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.880 
ghost has collected a full 10 coins in
the<00:04:57.270> first<00:04:57.510> lap<00:04:57.750> and<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.350> person<00:04:58.650> I'm<00:04:58.740> using

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
the first lap and the person I'm using

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.220 
the first lap and the person I'm using
right<00:04:59.130> now<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.580> going<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.270> get<00:05:00.390> zero<00:05:00.630> coins<00:05:00.900> and

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
right now is going to get zero coins and

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:09.830 
right now is going to get zero coins and
we'll<00:05:01.800> see<00:05:01.980> how<00:05:02.190> the<00:05:02.250> difference<00:05:02.730> is<00:05:06.290> as<00:05:08.840> you

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
we'll see how the difference is as you

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.470 
we'll see how the difference is as you
can<00:05:09.990> see<00:05:10.230> the<00:05:10.950> ghost<00:05:11.220> that<00:05:11.400> has<00:05:11.550> ten<00:05:11.790> coins<00:05:12.060> has

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
can see the ghost that has ten coins has

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.300 
can see the ghost that has ten coins has
much<00:05:12.690> more<00:05:12.900> speed<00:05:13.170> than<00:05:13.380> I<00:05:13.440> do<00:05:13.500> as<00:05:13.830> it<00:05:13.890> passes

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
much more speed than I do as it passes

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.730 
much more speed than I do as it passes
me<00:05:14.640> I<00:05:17.180> even<00:05:18.180> use<00:05:18.330> two<00:05:18.720> of<00:05:18.870> my<00:05:19.020> mushrooms<00:05:19.440> and

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
me I even use two of my mushrooms and

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:35.320 
me I even use two of my mushrooms and
I'm<00:05:19.950> still<00:05:20.100> not<00:05:20.220> able<00:05:20.370> to<00:05:20.520> catch<00:05:20.700> up<00:05:20.730> to<00:05:21.000> him

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.340 

that'll<00:05:36.330> not<00:05:36.480> do<00:05:36.630> if<00:05:36.750> you're<00:05:36.900> talking<00:05:37.050> about

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
that'll not do if you're talking about

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.830 
that'll not do if you're talking about
coins<00:05:37.730> basically<00:05:38.730> get<00:05:38.970> up<00:05:39.090> to<00:05:39.210> ten<00:05:39.420> as<00:05:39.600> quickly

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
coins basically get up to ten as quickly

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.260 
coins basically get up to ten as quickly
as<00:05:40.020> possible<00:05:40.250> but<00:05:41.250> don't<00:05:41.460> go<00:05:41.610> completely<00:05:41.790> out

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
as possible but don't go completely out

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.360 
as possible but don't go completely out
of<00:05:42.420> your<00:05:42.570> way<00:05:42.690> to<00:05:42.750> get<00:05:42.960> them<00:05:43.200> it's<00:05:43.920> still<00:05:44.040> much

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
of your way to get them it's still much

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.400 
of your way to get them it's still much
faster<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.880> hug<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:45.180> corners<00:05:45.540> and<00:05:45.750> take

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
faster to hug the corners and take

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.710 
faster to hug the corners and take
shortcuts
