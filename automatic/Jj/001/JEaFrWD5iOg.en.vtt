00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
have to do with it whether you see

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.170 
have to do with it whether you see
someone<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.790> know<00:02:55.940> who<00:02:56.090> found<00:02:56.330> someone<00:02:56.630> first

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.270 
but it also has to do with you know
there<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:01.640> some<00:03:01.850> skill<00:03:02.090> involved<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:04.069> does

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
there is some skill involved it does

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.540 
there is some skill involved it does
take<00:03:04.519> skill<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.940> play<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:06.100> and<00:03:07.100> there<00:03:07.430> are

take skill to play this and there are
you<00:03:07.940> know<00:03:08.030> predicting<00:03:08.360> stuff<00:03:08.690> predicting

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
you know predicting stuff predicting

where someone's gonna go like I knew I

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.430 
where someone's gonna go like I knew I
kind<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:11.450> guess<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.870> he<00:03:11.959> was<00:03:12.079> gonna<00:03:12.200> push

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
kind of guess that he was gonna push

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.630 
kind of guess that he was gonna push
that<00:03:12.590> bottom<00:03:12.739> aren't<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.250> know<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.370> front

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
that bottom aren't you know the front

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.759 
that bottom aren't you know the front
arch<00:03:13.820> area<00:03:14.060> where<00:03:14.810> I'm<00:03:14.870> kind<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.200> standing<00:03:15.410> and

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
arch area where I'm kind of standing and

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.930 
arch area where I'm kind of standing and
that's<00:03:16.190> when<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.340> turned<00:03:16.519> around<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.820> looked

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
that's when I turned around and looked

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.400 
that's when I turned around and looked
bottom<00:03:17.239> art<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.480> that's<00:03:17.540> why<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.750> pre<00:03:17.989> ended<00:03:18.290> in

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
bottom art and that's why I pre ended in

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.009 
bottom art and that's why I pre ended in
all<00:03:18.769> the<00:03:19.100> way<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.640> I<00:03:19.670> did<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.390> I<00:03:20.630> really<00:03:20.870> did

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
all the way so I did really I really did

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:22.180 
all the way so I did really I really did
just<00:03:21.049> predict<00:03:21.470> him<00:03:21.590> going<00:03:21.829> there<00:03:21.920> even<00:03:21.980> though

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
just predict him going there even though

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.319 
just predict him going there even though
I<00:03:22.220> didn't<00:03:22.430> tell<00:03:22.549> you<00:03:22.640> guys<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.970> was<00:03:23.120> doing

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
I didn't tell you guys that I was doing

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:24.759 
I didn't tell you guys that I was doing
that<00:03:23.450> because<00:03:23.959> I<00:03:24.140> was<00:03:24.230> talking<00:03:24.410> about<00:03:24.530> other

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
that because I was talking about other

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.690 
that because I was talking about other
stuff<00:03:26.079> but<00:03:27.079> and<00:03:27.350> the<00:03:27.920> reason<00:03:28.190> why<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.310> predicted

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
stuff but and the reason why I predicted

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.910 
stuff but and the reason why I predicted
that<00:03:28.760> is<00:03:29.030> because<00:03:30.579> he's<00:03:31.579> used<00:03:31.790> an<00:03:31.880> AC<00:03:32.000> are

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
that is because he's used an AC are

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.810 
that is because he's used an AC are
watching<00:03:33.920> lacrosse<00:03:34.190> both<00:03:34.400> times<00:03:34.579> he<00:03:34.670> watched

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
watching lacrosse both times he watched

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.460 
watching lacrosse both times he watched
across<00:03:35.060> both<00:03:35.299> rounds<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:35.870> he<00:03:35.930> got<00:03:36.079> he<00:03:36.320> got

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
across both rounds and he got he got

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.390 
across both rounds and he got he got
killed<00:03:36.880> with<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.019> mp7<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> just<00:03:40.190> had<00:03:40.310> the
