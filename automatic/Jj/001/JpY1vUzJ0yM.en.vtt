00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
of beef cattle and we would look at

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.709 
of beef cattle and we would look at
marketing<00:01:29.189> their<00:01:29.340> product<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:30.090> whether

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.849 
farmers not as beef but as a breeding
anymore<00:01:32.999> and<00:01:33.719> to<00:01:33.840> do<00:01:33.959> something<00:01:34.319> like<00:01:34.349> that<00:01:34.499> we

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
anymore and to do something like that we

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.769 
anymore and to do something like that we
needed<00:01:35.069> to<00:01:35.189> get<00:01:35.399> out<00:01:35.459> there<00:01:35.819> and<00:01:35.969> sure<00:01:36.209> that<00:01:36.659> we

00:01:36.769 --> 00:01:36.779 
needed to get out there and sure that we

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:38.660 
needed to get out there and sure that we
what<00:01:37.049> we<00:01:37.079> had<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:38.009> only<00:01:38.189> way<00:01:38.310> we<00:01:38.459> could<00:01:38.609> think

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
what we had the only way we could think

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.249 
what we had the only way we could think
of<00:01:38.909> doing<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.749> better<00:01:40.079> than

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
of doing this it's actually better than

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.859 
of doing this it's actually better than
showing<00:01:40.560> our<00:01:40.770> cattle<00:01:41.130> agriculture<00:01:41.609> shows<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
showing our cattle agriculture shows and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.639 
showing our cattle agriculture shows and
hence<00:01:43.759> why<00:01:44.759> we<00:01:44.789> yet<00:01:45.349> while<00:01:46.349> we're<00:01:46.529> actually

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
hence why we yet while we're actually

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.830 
hence why we yet while we're actually
