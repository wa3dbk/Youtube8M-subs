00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.400 

okay<00:00:01.410> so<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:03.330> gonna<00:00:03.449> be<00:00:03.629> getting<00:00:03.840> talking

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
okay so we're gonna be getting talking

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.760 
okay so we're gonna be getting talking
about<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.430> right<00:00:05.670> hand<00:00:05.879> slap<00:00:06.150> rule<00:00:06.379> so<00:00:07.379> just<00:00:07.680> a

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
about the right hand slap rule so just a

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.650 
about the right hand slap rule so just a
recap<00:00:07.950> before<00:00:08.700> this<00:00:09.059> we<00:00:09.179> learn<00:00:09.360> about<00:00:09.389> the

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
recap before this we learn about the

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.600 
recap before this we learn about the
right<00:00:09.809> hand<00:00:10.050> rule<00:00:10.170> what<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.219> know<00:00:11.340> look

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
right hand rule what you you know look

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.520 
right hand rule what you you know look
at<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:11.820> hand<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.330> look<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.080> okay

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
at my hand and it's look like this okay

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.180 
at my hand and it's look like this okay
it<00:00:14.099> tells<00:00:14.340> us<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.639> if<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.179> current

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
it tells us that if we have a current

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
it tells us that if we have a current
put<00:00:17.190> our<00:00:17.310> finger<00:00:17.580> finger<00:00:18.000> into<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> thumb<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
put our finger finger into the thumb in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.570 
put our finger finger into the thumb in
the<00:00:18.779> direction<00:00:18.900> of<00:00:19.170> current<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:20.279> fingers

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
the direction of current the fingers

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.620 
the direction of current the fingers
will<00:00:20.670> tell<00:00:20.850> us<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> direction<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
will tell us the direction of the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.359 
will tell us the direction of the
magnetic<00:00:21.779> field<00:00:22.020> so<00:00:22.830> this<00:00:22.949> current<00:00:23.189> will

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
magnetic field so this current will

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.720 
magnetic field so this current will
produce<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.789> field<00:00:24.529> coming<00:00:25.529> towards<00:00:26.400> us

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
produce a field coming towards us

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.210 
produce a field coming towards us
this<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.050> into<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:28.949> page

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
this you know here and into the page

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.650 
this you know here and into the page
over<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.550> I'll<00:00:30.060> show<00:00:30.210> you

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
over here I'll show you

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
over here I'll show you
so<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.439> above<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.040> our<00:00:32.700> fingers<00:00:33.000> are<00:00:33.120> coming

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
so on above it our fingers are coming

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.430 
so on above it our fingers are coming
towards<00:00:33.809> us<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:35.030> below<00:00:36.030> our<00:00:36.809> fingers<00:00:37.320> are

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
towards us but below our fingers are

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
towards us but below our fingers are
going<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:37.829> into<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.309> page<00:00:38.550> okay<00:00:38.969> but<00:00:39.360> that's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
going down into the page okay but that's

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.240 
going down into the page okay but that's
that's<00:00:40.050> about<00:00:40.260> this<00:00:40.469> wire<00:00:40.680> that's<00:00:40.920> filled

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
that's about this wire that's filled

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.970 
that's about this wire that's filled
this<00:00:41.399> wise<00:00:41.640> creating<00:00:42.120> okay<00:00:42.530> right<00:00:43.530> hand<00:00:43.739> slap

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this wise creating okay right hand slap

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.880 
this wise creating okay right hand slap
rule<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.430> very<00:00:45.120> different<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:46.320> saying<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.710> we

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
rule is very different it's saying if we

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.619 
rule is very different it's saying if we
have<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> wire<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.660> we<00:00:49.440> need<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.800> current

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
have a wire so one we need a current

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.420 
have a wire so one we need a current
then<00:00:51.629> -<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.020> need<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> separate<00:00:52.829> magnetic<00:00:53.250> field

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
then - we need a separate magnetic field

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
then - we need a separate magnetic field
and<00:00:53.670> another<00:00:54.059> magnetic<00:00:54.629> field<00:00:56.809> so<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> know

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and another magnetic field so I know

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.299 
and another magnetic field so I know
there's<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.440> over<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.039> that's<00:00:59.160> being

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
there's one over here but that's being

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.590 
there's one over here but that's being
created<00:00:59.430> by<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> current<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.090> it's<00:01:00.210> about<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
created by the current so it's about a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.820 
created by the current so it's about a
separate<00:01:01.170> one<00:01:01.379> such<00:01:01.980> as<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.250> one<00:01:03.530> our<00:01:04.530> force

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
separate one such as this one our force

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.980 
separate one such as this one our force
is<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.070> happen<00:01:05.659> easy<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.869> one<00:01:07.080> two<00:01:07.490> three

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
is gonna happen easy as one two three

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.170 
is gonna happen easy as one two three
okay<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.170> what<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> right<00:01:11.100> hand<00:01:11.310> slip<00:01:11.520> rule<00:01:11.729> it

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
okay so what the right hand slip rule it

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.120 
okay so what the right hand slip rule it
just<00:01:12.689> tells<00:01:12.869> us<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.350> direction<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.890> force

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
just tells us which direction the force

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.820 
just tells us which direction the force
is<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:15.750> one<00:01:15.960> which<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
is okay so here we have one which is the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
is okay so here we have one which is the
count<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.490> about<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.960> current<00:01:20.030> okay<00:01:21.030> next

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
count think about it current okay next

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.170 
count think about it current okay next
the<00:01:22.320> field<00:01:22.560> which<00:01:23.400> direction<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:23.939> feel

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
the field which direction is a feel

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.679 
the field which direction is a feel
remember<00:01:24.570> magnets<00:01:24.990> go<00:01:25.080> from<00:01:25.259> north<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> south

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.800 

field

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.750 

third<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.560> will<00:01:34.620> be<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.770> force<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.640> we

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
third so there will be a force so we

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.640 
third so there will be a force so we
just<00:01:35.880> need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.090> put<00:01:36.210> our<00:01:36.330> right<00:01:36.540> hand<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:37.050> thumb

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
just need to put our right hand a thumb

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.960 
just need to put our right hand a thumb
again<00:01:37.980> always<00:01:38.190> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.550> direction<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
again always in the direction the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.790 
again always in the direction the
current<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.810> means<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.410> direction<00:01:40.680> of

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
current now means in the direction of

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.890 
current now means in the direction of
the<00:01:40.920> field<00:01:41.100> but<00:01:41.340> note<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.910> is<00:01:42.120> an<00:01:42.270> external

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
the field but note this is an external

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.370 
the field but note this is an external
field<00:01:43.200> now<00:01:43.440> I<00:01:43.680> can't<00:01:44.580> really<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.330> this<00:01:45.540> very

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
field now I can't really do this very

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.830 
field now I can't really do this very
well<00:01:46.500> we'll<00:01:47.130> do<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.400> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.570> force

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
well we'll do that and then the force

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.570 
well we'll do that and then the force
will<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.230> the<00:01:49.320> direction<00:01:49.440> of<00:01:49.680> my<00:01:49.800> palm<00:01:50.010> to

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
will go in the direction of my palm to

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.900 
will go in the direction of my palm to
straight<00:01:50.820> down<00:01:51.590> straight<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.800> so<00:01:53.730> if<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
straight down straight down so if the

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:54.800 
straight down straight down so if the
current<00:01:54.210> was<00:01:54.300> going<00:01:54.480> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.600> other<00:01:54.720> direction

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
current was going in the other direction

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.930 
current was going in the other direction
so<00:01:55.320> let's<00:01:56.070> pretend<00:01:56.220> the<00:01:56.430> camera<00:01:56.610> was<00:01:56.760> going

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
so let's pretend the camera was going

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.580 
so let's pretend the camera was going
that<00:01:57.090> way<00:01:57.240> now<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.930> I<00:01:57.990> put<00:01:58.140> my<00:01:58.230> thumb<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.440> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
that way now so I put my thumb in the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.810 
that way now so I put my thumb in the
direction<00:02:00.050> fingers<00:02:01.050> along<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.230> field<00:02:01.820> will

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
direction fingers along the field will

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.840 
direction fingers along the field will
be<00:02:02.910> going<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.740> okay<00:02:04.740> so<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.640> how<00:02:05.790> you

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
be going up okay so that's how you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.320 
be going up okay so that's how you
figure<00:02:06.090> out

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
figure out

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.430 
figure out
therefore<00:02:06.870> if<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.620> force<00:02:08.010> is<00:02:08.280> into<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.240> page

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.380 

okay<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.800> that's<00:02:14.640> all<00:02:14.820> really<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.240> right

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
okay and that's all really the right

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.490 
okay and that's all really the right
hand<00:02:15.600> slap<00:02:15.780> rule<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.230> not<00:02:16.320> too

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
hand slap rule is it's not too

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.370 
hand slap rule is it's not too
complicated<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.660> just<00:02:18.840> need<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.080> apply<00:02:19.170> it

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
complicated but we just need to apply it

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.310 
complicated but we just need to apply it
in<00:02:19.560> different<00:02:19.830> situations<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.320> without

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
in different situations so without

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.440 
in different situations so without
further<00:02:22.590> ado<00:02:22.980> I'm<00:02:23.370> gonna<00:02:23.670> go<00:02:23.760> through<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.240> bunch

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
further ado I'm gonna go through a bunch

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.560 
further ado I'm gonna go through a bunch
of<00:02:24.600> questions<00:02:24.959> in<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.200> next<00:02:25.260> few<00:02:25.500> videos
