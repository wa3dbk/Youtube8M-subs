00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.460
 little trick that will be a little regular 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.619
 it's true that maybe that's what 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.000

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:03.250

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.810
 that in the gameplay 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.540

 crazy gameplay a live it's not my 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.000
 strong at all since I think you 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.720

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.980
 a little to my sauce I think but if you 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 have game modes proposed from 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.860
 weapons of small challenges I was not very 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.720
 original a lot of European youtube 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.310

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.050

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.910
 here I am going to lose the game 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.770
