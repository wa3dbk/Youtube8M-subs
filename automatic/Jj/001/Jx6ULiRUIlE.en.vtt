00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.160

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.170

 but here in Mexico is May 10 and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.580
 I wanted to make this recipe because it 's 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.320
 economic simple very rich and it makes me 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.359
 which is a nice detail for your mom 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
 especially because they do not spend much with 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.040

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 take care of the economy in this mexico in 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.329
 this world because the truth is very 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.309
 difficult and today's recipe is going to be a 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.379
 mango jelly with cream cheese that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.270

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.660
 for this recipe we are going to use a 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.300
 can of mango in syrup a bar 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.270
 cream cheese 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:13.030
 a cup of white sugar 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.689
 four tablespoons of hydrated gelatin 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.689
 with little water 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:26.049
 three cups of milk 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.049
 to start we will liquefy the mango 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.690
 we're all going to throw it there 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.860
 we are also going to put the cream cheese 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.510
 everything todito 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.999
 the cup of sugar 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:56.540
 and right now we're just going to use 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 two cups of milk 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:03.049
 the other one we are going to reserve 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.049
 that is the first 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.049
 we go for the second cup 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:17.790
 ready there was left and now we are going to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.790
 liquefy everything that is very well liquefied 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.610
 and that's how it was done 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.920
 now let's warm up the other cup of 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.019
 milk that I had told you 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.260
 and there we are going to put what is the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.260
 grenetina 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:42.210
 and you know we have to move him 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.300
 stir until it melts all that 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.990
 there is not any lumps something like that has 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.990
 what to look 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.720
 without anything everything clean everything well 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.610
 and now what we are going to do is the 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.410
 mixture of the milk with the grenetine is 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.410
 we're going to put it in the blender 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.790
 so that everything is stirred perfectly 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.819
 in case some small group or something 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.230
 so that it is disrupted with the 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.860
 blender 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.860
 and ready 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.720
 Now what we are going to do is fill 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.349
 some glasses also in curious glasses 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.990
 is I think it's a good portion we're going to 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.210
 fill three by now nothing else 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.150
 it is the second 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.150
 and the third one is already there 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.880
 now let's pass the cups to 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.690
 fridge 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:48.460
 so that the gelatin is made and 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.460
 Rich rich america 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.790
 Well, as you just realized 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.840
 that obviously gelatins right now 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.849
 refrigerator have to be left 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:58.769
 about two hours for 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.659
 set the truth well they are staying 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.830
 very delicious they were very very very good 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.540
 you just tried a little bit more 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.390
 clarito of which I did and the truth if 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.190
 know very rich already know so do 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.129
 you because you will not regret 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:15.840
 people and then to follow we go and ready 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:18.239
 already gelatin like that left now let's 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.850
 Decorate it with some mango squares 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.940
 that cut this if they are natural mango 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.039
 natural let's put him I say that some 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.650
 three hoses three bits of 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.020
 cuffs look very good at what you 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.900
 I'm putting are covered blueberries 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.880
 of chocolate 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.310
 it looks very good, and now we're going 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.139
 to put some mint leaves in what 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.990
 nice looks true 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.460
 good and let's move on to the other one now and 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.379
 I think I'll change a little bit 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.400
 same design I'm going to put the three 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.400
 mango bits 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.240
 but I think now we're going to put the 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.180
 cranberry with chocolate above and nothing else 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.910
 we are going to put 1 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.400
 and then I think the mint leaves 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.400
 we are going to put them on the sides 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.390
 change the design a little bit that pretty 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.320
 you look 

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:14.350
 and we went to the other cup and in this 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.010
 let's use nothing more pure 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.010
 chocolate covered blueberries 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.060
 and I think that with that they are going to be 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.780
 enough 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.780
 one more 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.920
 and now we put a mint leaf 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.970
 I think it really gives a color very 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.289
 I live very beautiful to the desserts look 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.139
 and so they remained 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.139
 how about they look very rich right 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.139
 and well this was what I felt all the 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.060
