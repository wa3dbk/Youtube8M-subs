00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
screens and computers and stuff or

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.049 
screens and computers and stuff or
networking<00:00:39.629> stuff<00:00:42.230> so<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.730> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
networking stuff so now I just need to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.000 
networking stuff so now I just need to
drill<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.510> few<00:00:45.600> holes<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> put<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:46.770> in

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

where<00:00:48.780> we're<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:50.239> well<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.860> basically

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
where we're at well this is basically

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.610 
where we're at well this is basically
what<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.219> used<00:00:53.610> for<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.030> build<00:00:54.440> they<00:00:55.440> don't

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
what I used for this build they don't

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.619 
what I used for this build they don't
have<00:00:55.739> all<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.070> boxes<00:00:56.520> here<00:00:56.789> some<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
have all the boxes here some of the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.569 
have all the boxes here some of the
optical<00:00:58.020> drive<00:00:58.410> boxes<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.070> threw<00:00:59.340> out<00:01:00.079> I<00:01:01.579> guess

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
optical drive boxes I threw out I guess

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.340 
optical drive boxes I threw out I guess
I<00:01:02.699> did<00:01:02.879> use<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> light<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.809> didn't<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
I did use that light on I didn't think I

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.840 
I did use that light on I didn't think I
use<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:05.070> it's<00:01:05.220> not<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.670> so

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
use that one but it's not in there so

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.660 
use that one but it's not in there so
must<00:01:06.060> use<00:01:06.299> though<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:10.369> there's<00:01:11.369> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
must use though so it's a there's the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.149 
must use though so it's a there's the
case<00:01:12.650> it's<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.740> cooler<00:01:14.159> master<00:01:14.810> half<00:01:15.810> 932<00:01:16.799> Black

fire surround sound speakers up
underneath<00:04:05.050> here<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.430> could<00:04:06.520> access<00:04:07.060> some

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:07.300 
underneath here so I could access some

underneath here so I could access some
easier<00:04:08.460> up<00:04:09.460> there<00:04:09.820> is<00:04:10.150> just<00:04:10.390> too<00:04:10.600> much<00:04:10.630> cable

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
easier up there is just too much cable

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.790 
easier up there is just too much cable
mess<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.430> there's<00:04:13.240> a<00:04:13.360> plenty<00:04:13.900> of<00:04:14.140> cables<00:04:14.590> back

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
mess so there's a plenty of cables back

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.670 
mess so there's a plenty of cables back
there<00:04:15.130> but<00:04:15.340> put<00:04:16.299> that<00:04:16.510> board<00:04:17.049> across<00:04:17.350> there

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
there but put that board across there

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.500 
there but put that board across there
and<00:04:17.709> most<00:04:17.980> the<00:04:18.100> cables<00:04:18.580> run<00:04:18.790> behind<00:04:19.000> it<00:04:19.360> and

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
and most the cables run behind it and

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.020 
and most the cables run behind it and
that<00:04:20.320> it's<00:04:20.440> chock<00:04:20.860> full<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.489> thick<00:04:21.730> thing

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
that it's chock full of a thick thing

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.000 
that it's chock full of a thick thing
and<00:04:22.210> cables<00:04:22.600> back<00:04:22.780> there<00:04:23.080> they<00:04:23.260> barely<00:04:23.530> fit<00:04:23.890> up

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:24.010 
and cables back there they barely fit up

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:34.320 
and cables back there they barely fit up
there<00:04:24.040> so<00:04:30.210> there's<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.690> case<00:04:33.300> with<00:04:34.300> a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
there so there's the case with a

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.110 
there so there's the case with a
computer<00:04:34.810> inside<00:04:38.100> cable<00:04:39.100> management<00:04:39.340> on<00:04:39.910> my

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.060 
computer inside cable management on my
old<00:04:40.300> computer<00:04:40.630> there<00:04:41.110> was<00:04:41.140> no<00:04:41.590> cable

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
old computer there was no cable

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.630 
old computer there was no cable
management<00:04:42.280> it's<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.290> tangle<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.040> cords<00:04:45.490> I

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:45.640 
management it's just a tangle of cords I

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.410 
management it's just a tangle of cords I
can<00:04:45.820> barely<00:04:46.120> stand<00:04:46.390> to<00:04:46.540> look<00:04:46.720> at<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.140> but<00:04:48.420> this

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:49.420 
can barely stand to look at it but this

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.030 
can barely stand to look at it but this
new<00:04:49.660> computer<00:04:50.230> I've<00:04:50.350> really<00:04:50.620> got<00:04:50.770> all<00:04:50.890> the

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
new computer I've really got all the

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.590 
new computer I've really got all the
cables<00:04:51.430> running<00:04:51.700> through<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.120> back<00:04:52.300> behind

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
cables running through the back behind

00:04:52.600 --> 00:05:00.840 
cables running through the back behind
the<00:04:52.870> motherboard<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.910> much<00:04:55.510> much<00:04:56.050> better<00:04:59.850> it's

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
the motherboard so much much better it's

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.700 
the motherboard so much much better it's
not<00:05:01.000> like<00:05:01.240> too<00:05:01.690> bright

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.740 

see<00:05:05.400> I've<00:05:05.490> got<00:05:05.550> all<00:05:05.820> the<00:05:06.000> cables<00:05:06.480> running

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
see I've got all the cables running

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.100 
see I've got all the cables running
through<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.260> back<00:05:07.470> there<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.540> top<00:05:09.570> some

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
through the back there to the top some

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.600 
through the back there to the top some
tried<00:05:13.110> to<00:05:13.140> keep<00:05:13.410> them<00:05:13.620> all<00:05:13.770> together<00:05:13.920> bundle

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
tried to keep them all together bundle

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.510 
tried to keep them all together bundle
together<00:05:14.790> is<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.540> tied<00:05:15.810> together<00:05:15.990> so<00:05:16.560> that's<00:05:17.400> a

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
together is it tied together so that's a

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.970 
together is it tied together so that's a
lot<00:05:17.670> better
