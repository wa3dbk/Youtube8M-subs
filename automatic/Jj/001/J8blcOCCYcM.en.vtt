 they are ready 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.960
 denise are due to the smell that 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.730
 irresistible right I'm suspicious to 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.440
 to say that I love chocolate but 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.840
 person who does not like chocolate she 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.980
 can modify is to make some change 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.660
 in revenue 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.730
 yes both the filling with a cover 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.960
 can be modified stuffed we did 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.060
 here of dulce de leche 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.840
 but people can do it 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.340
 make cream condensed milk is the 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.080
 cover also if the person does not like 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.120
 chocolate candy can make chocolate 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.840
 white and if it's simpler people 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.700
 also because the deed can write 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.780
 the name we can do of several 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.720
 shapes 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.990
 It matters then to use the imagination is this 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.520
 there is an ideal recipe in activity 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.350

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
 fast and economical because we have 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.050
