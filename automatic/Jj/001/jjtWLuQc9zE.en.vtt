00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
which is like the golden ratio in terms

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.540 
which is like the golden ratio in terms
of<00:00:27.570> redstone<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.710> was<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:28.980> a<00:00:29.130> really<00:00:29.429> fun

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
of redstone and it was just a really fun

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.820 
of redstone and it was just a really fun
project<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.269> work<00:00:30.480> on<00:00:30.689> so<00:00:30.929> thank<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.740> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
now I personally feel like Iron Man when

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
now I personally feel like Iron Man when
using<00:01:06.960> this<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.409> has<00:01:07.950> very<00:01:08.100> Tony<00:01:08.520> Stark<00:01:08.970> like

using this one has very Tony Stark like
stylings<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.110> know<00:01:10.229> you<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.619> travel<00:01:10.920> in

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
stylings you know you just travel in

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
stylings you know you just travel in
pushed<00:01:11.670> up<00:01:11.880> armored<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.080> then<00:01:13.229> drop<00:01:13.439> back

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
pushed up armored and then drop back

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.370 
pushed up armored and then drop back
down<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.430> cool<00:01:14.700> now<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.689> my<00:01:15.840> personal<00:01:16.259> opinion

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
down so cool now in my personal opinion

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140 
down so cool now in my personal opinion
there<00:01:16.799> are<00:01:16.830> four<00:01:17.130> different<00:01:17.580> elements<00:01:17.670> this

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
there are four different elements this

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.760 
there are four different elements this
design<00:01:18.509> there<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> bottom<00:01:19.290> double<00:01:19.530> piston

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
design there is the bottom double piston

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
design there is the bottom double piston
extender<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.610> pushes<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.659> the

extender that pushes you up into the

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.719 
extender that pushes you up into the
ceiling<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.369> iron

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
ceiling and then we have the iron

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.580 
ceiling and then we have the iron
section<00:01:24.240> which<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> linkage<00:01:25.080> redstone

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
section which is the linkage redstone

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
section which is the linkage redstone
that<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.400> connects<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> two<00:01:27.030> layers

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that will connects the two layers

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.300 
that will connects the two layers
together<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:28.409> includes<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.009> post

extender<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> top<00:01:30.240> part<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:31.110> in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
extender for the top part and then in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600 
extender for the top part and then in
the<00:01:31.470> top<00:01:31.650> part<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.189> got<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.490> double

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the top part we have got the double

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.730 
the top part we have got the double
piston<00:01:33.000> extender<00:01:33.299> again<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:34.110> retracts<00:01:34.409> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
piston extender again that retracts the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.130 
piston extender again that retracts the
ceiling<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.250> finally<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.299> dispenser<00:01:36.869> array

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
ceiling and finally the dispenser array

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929 
ceiling and finally the dispenser array
now<00:01:37.320> obviously<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.189> important<00:01:38.759> part

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
now obviously that is the important part

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.850 
now obviously that is the important part
that<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.750> equips<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.259> with<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.530> armor

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
that is what equips you with the armor

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.249 
that is what equips you with the armor
and<00:01:40.979> it's<00:01:41.549> sort<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.240> main<00:01:42.479> element<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
and it's sort of the main element of the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
and it's sort of the main element of the
design<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.890> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> explain<00:01:44.759> each<00:01:45.210> part

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
design so I'm going to explain each part

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.210 
design so I'm going to explain each part
in<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.229> bit<00:01:46.380> more<00:01:46.560> detail<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.159> can

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in a little bit more detail so you can

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
in a little bit more detail so you can
get<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.430> full<00:01:47.640> understanding<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.360> what's<00:01:48.630> going

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
get a full understanding of what's going

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.109 
get a full understanding of what's going
on<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.140> let's<00:01:49.560> go<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> first<00:01:50.790> thing<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
on so let's go so the first thing that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.730 
on so let's go so the first thing that
happens<00:01:51.450> when<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.659> hit<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> button<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.439> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
happens when you hit the button is the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.109 
happens when you hit the button is the
power<00:01:52.950> will<00:01:53.130> be<00:01:53.250> sent<00:01:53.460> into<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> linkage

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
power will be sent into the linkage

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.850 
power will be sent into the linkage
system<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:54.780> will<00:01:54.960> split<00:01:55.229> up<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.439> Redstone

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
system which will split up the Redstone

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.160 
system which will split up the Redstone
down<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.640> bottom<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> top<00:01:57.960> now

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
down to the bottom and up to the top now

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
down to the bottom and up to the top now
the<00:01:58.229> first<00:01:58.560> thing<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> happens<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
the first thing that happens is the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.609 
the first thing that happens is the
double<00:02:00.270> piston<00:02:00.450> extender<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.200> retract

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
double piston extender will retract

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.350 
double piston extender will retract
which<00:02:02.189> will<00:02:02.340> retract<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.820> block<00:02:03.090> from<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
which will retract this block from the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.179 
which will retract this block from the
ceiling<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.840> then<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.649> double<00:02:04.829> piston

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
ceiling and then the double piston

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.980 
ceiling and then the double piston
extender<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.729> bottom<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.420> then<00:02:06.540> pushes

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
extender at the bottom will then pushes

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.290 
extender at the bottom will then pushes
up<00:02:07.200> into<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.799> ceiling<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.340> then<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
up into the ceiling and then the

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
up into the ceiling and then the
dispenser<00:02:09.810> armory<00:02:10.200> will<00:02:10.440> fire<00:02:10.739> equip<00:02:11.459> us<00:02:11.610> with

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
dispenser armory will fire equip us with

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.830 
dispenser armory will fire equip us with
armor<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.180> then

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
armor and then

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.869 
armor and then
double<00:02:13.140> extender<00:02:13.349> retract<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.700> one

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
double extender retract and this one

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.820 
double extender retract and this one
will<00:02:15.030> push<00:02:15.239> down<00:02:15.269> now<00:02:15.989> this<00:02:16.200> section<00:02:16.470> that<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
will push down now this section that you

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.650 
will push down now this section that you
can<00:02:16.980> see<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.819> post<00:02:18.030> extender<00:02:18.540> and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
can see here is the post extender and

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.780 
can see here is the post extender and
that<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.200> because<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:20.099> needs<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.459> happen

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
that is because this needs to happen

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.490 
that is because this needs to happen
first<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> also<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.900> happen<00:02:22.140> last

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
first but it also has to happen last

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.860 
first but it also has to happen last
which<00:02:23.099> means<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.580> pulse<00:02:23.940> needs<00:02:24.599> to<00:02:24.750> be

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
which means this pulse needs to be

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.930 
which means this pulse needs to be
longer<00:02:25.110> than<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.830> poster<00:02:26.220> goes<00:02:26.400> down<00:02:26.640> here

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
longer than the poster goes down here

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.190 
longer than the poster goes down here
now<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> haven't<00:02:27.629> done<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.900> best<00:02:28.080> job

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
now I haven't done the best job

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.440 
now I haven't done the best job
explaining<00:02:28.800> that<00:02:29.129> at<00:02:29.220> all<00:02:29.459> I'm<00:02:29.730> really<00:02:30.150> bad<00:02:30.420> at

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
explaining that at all I'm really bad at

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.270 
explaining that at all I'm really bad at
this<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.110> thing<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:31.739> I<00:02:31.769> hope<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.129> makes

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
this kind of thing but I hope that makes

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.979 
this kind of thing but I hope that makes
a<00:02:32.459> little<00:02:32.700> bit<00:02:32.819> more<00:02:33.090> sense<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.599> has

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
a little bit more sense and has

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.839 
a little bit more sense and has
explained<00:02:34.410> some<00:02:34.739> of<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.069> elements<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
explained some of the elements of the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.970 
explained some of the elements of the
design<00:02:36.000> now<00:02:36.780> as<00:02:36.989> I<00:02:37.140> said<00:02:37.319> in<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.470> beginning<00:02:37.590> if

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
design now as I said in the beginning if

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.410 
design now as I said in the beginning if
you<00:02:38.099> want<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.340> full<00:02:38.610> explanation<00:02:38.849> of<00:02:39.239> how<00:02:39.390> it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
you want a full explanation of how it

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.479 
you want a full explanation of how it
all<00:02:39.629> works<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.019> a<00:02:40.349> tutorial<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.950> how<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.190> build

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
all works and a tutorial on how to build

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.430 
all works and a tutorial on how to build
it<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:42.269> can<00:02:42.420> head<00:02:42.599> over<00:02:42.629> to<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:42.989> Zoomers

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it then you can head over to a Zoomers

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.800 
it then you can head over to a Zoomers
video<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.950> he<00:02:44.370> will<00:02:44.549> do<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.180> that<00:02:45.269> you<00:02:45.660> will

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
video and he will do just that you will

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.170 
video and he will do just that you will
get<00:02:45.989> all<00:02:46.200> of<00:02:46.380> that<00:02:46.500> information<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.190> more<00:02:47.970> so

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
get all of that information and more so

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.580 
get all of that information and more so
I<00:02:48.209> would<00:02:48.329> definitely<00:02:48.780> suggest<00:02:48.930> checking<00:02:49.200> out

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
I would definitely suggest checking out

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.440 
I would definitely suggest checking out
but<00:02:50.160> as<00:02:50.220> far<00:02:50.400> as<00:02:50.430> I'm<00:02:50.670> concerned<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.329> the
