00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:03:40.190 

Oh

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.160 

and

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:05:10.290 

and

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.999 

yeah<00:05:11.300> I<00:05:11.330> got<00:05:11.599> no<00:05:11.780> idea<00:05:12.169> what<00:05:12.229> to<00:05:12.530> do<00:05:12.680> with<00:05:12.710> these

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:13.009 
yeah I got no idea what to do with these

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:13.450 
yeah I got no idea what to do with these
things

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
things

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.080 
things
so<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:15.020> guess<00:05:15.620> if<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:16.009> want<00:05:16.220> one<00:05:16.430> this<00:05:16.880> is

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
so I guess if you want one this is

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.460 
so I guess if you want one this is
probably<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.599> good<00:05:17.780> one<00:05:17.930> to<00:05:18.080> have<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.500> seems<00:05:18.800> to

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
probably a good one to have it seems to

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.080 
probably a good one to have it seems to
screw<00:05:21.470> up<00:05:21.590> my<00:05:21.620> tone<00:05:22.009> as<00:05:22.220> good<00:05:22.400> as<00:05:22.550> anything

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
old my mind's not creative enough for

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.969 
old my mind's not creative enough for
the<00:05:43.430> ring<00:05:43.610> modulator<00:05:44.409> but<00:05:45.409> I<00:05:45.440> like<00:05:45.650> to<00:05:45.770> say

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.020 
the ring modulator but I like to say
ring<00:05:46.250> modulator<00:05:47.800> um<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:48.860> thought<00:05:49.760> it<00:05:49.880> was<00:05:50.000> a

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
ring modulator um I thought it was a

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.290 
ring modulator um I thought it was a
cool<00:05:50.270> tremolo<00:05:50.840> sound<00:05:51.169> oh<00:05:51.729> hell<00:05:52.729> I<00:05:52.760> don't<00:05:53.000> know

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
that's what I could do with it just

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.159 
that's what I could do with it just
plugging<00:05:55.340> it<00:05:55.580> in<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:55.760> digging<00:05:56.659> around<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169 
plugging it in and digging around a

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.879 
plugging it in and digging around a
little<00:05:57.289> bit<00:05:57.530> so<00:05:57.860> give<00:05:58.580> me<00:05:58.669> some<00:05:58.849> slack<00:05:59.060> and
