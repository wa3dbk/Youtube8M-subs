00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:09.330
 Okay, so I've waited long enough for that. 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.139
 The dust I put here dried up. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.960
 cool 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.880
 the carburetor is already so mounted 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.529
 We'll just want to take the test. 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.810
 now it's going to be the gun it's gasoline 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.730
 which is the case here is not a diaphragm 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 better in the conventional carburetor but 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.660
 yes a zin piston what am I going to do alone 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.009
 mayor of testing will play a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.149
 A little of it is good here. 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:45.260
 bianca is going to show the eng around here that is 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:48.780
 What will matter to us? 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:55.070
 starting to load the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.070
 I can already see that in jd 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.559
 I had good hope it is showing up 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.150
 good 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.250
 then in other words the carburetor is 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.189
 at least that part of the manager is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.470
 working fine, cool 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.200
 So it's all set up 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.840
 jicred slow maximum valve here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.250
 I had to use the old 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.189
 by a new shaft in length 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.130
 different buoy level has already been adjusted 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.140
 according to the manual I have there and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.079
 then the owner of the car needs to be done 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.509
 some adjustment in some adjustment 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.350
 and to set the guidelines for 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:40.430
 he there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:45.860
 The next step is simply to assemble the 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.860
 carburetor athlete in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.950
 in the body this way 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.950
 unfortunately the screws are very 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.340
 old but that's what we'll have to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.700
 to use rice that is probably not 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.390
 metric then it would not be 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.509
 look for some screw service here 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.480
 because without a doubt there is nothing I do not 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.630
 I have nothing in this English pattern of 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.630
 inch 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.930
 the end piece you simply can 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.879
 use the threaded latch 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.099
 It's good and why I 'm not putting it. 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:36.959
 I was hoarse here because I'm going 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.760
 disassemble'll take this cover before the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.799
 at the time it is delivered to the owner 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.390
 or delivery I'm going to dismount because I 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.140
 I'll show them 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:56.430
 for him some things that were made 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:58.620
 here then I'm just scoring to keep 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.379
 there unfortunately in the position to 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:07.230
 run away since it was from another show 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.030
 even more that I'm going to put a 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.010
 carburetor is now ready to be 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.930
 less installed we check how it is 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.930
 How's it going to work in the Jeep? 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.620
 okay car player he goes to jail 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.379
 here in this particular model and 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.359
 on top of that lever here is good 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.819
 he will act here 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:29.970
 that in fact in the jeep is not a cable but 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.340
 rather a series of levers or metal 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.180
 whether it is in danger of breaking or 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.859
 nothing is good on all connections here 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.019
 they are metal I do not know how it is there 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.120
 because you did not see gp even more the question 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:46.500
 coming metal pipes are the servants 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.209
 here in the advancement part then it is not 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.169
 wonder that the carburetor has lasted 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:56.970
 for 50 years already the carburetor has lasted 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:58.799
 for 50 years and is probably the whole 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.060
 although it is very old and will not 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:05.669
 last for a while but the bone that 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.239
 is proof that the jeep had been 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:10.980
 made to last in fact by the way 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.849
 with which the drives and 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.639
 everything else 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:19.320
 the man that the carburetor was mounted there 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:22.620
 here's a spring here's a ball 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.870
 This piece here is here. 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.060
 butterfly stop then when I 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.700
 When he wants to accelerate, he will act. 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.830
 on top of this screw to accelerate or 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.900
 decrease the rotation and here is the screw 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.050
 of the mixture he will adjust from that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
 The way he is going to ride 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.849
 he is relatively warm engine 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.340
 he is tightening a cut 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:45.879
 back giving some intervals of 15 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:48.009
 seconds for the promoter to stabilize in the 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.979
 when the engine began to oscillate 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:53.169
 He's coming back from a quarter to a half back. 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.620
 the engine will be theoretically well 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.060
 regulated excess symptoms will look 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.270
 in here it will see if in idle 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:04.389
 It's dripping, something's cool, if 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.990
 do not have dripping is a sign that 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.969
 I do not have yes with an excess is by 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.219
 less a point to point of dribbling than 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.659
 then he can turn off the engine and look 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:16.060
 after five minutes it's dripping 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:19.389
 did not work good justice is what he 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.610
 need to do he needs to lower the float 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.440
 in this sense, now you need to stay 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:25.690
 lower 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.870
 so that the moment she reaches a 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.490
 level has already closed one level in the 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.430
 moment to reach the lowest level of 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.110
 already closes the needle and prevents the 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.330
 fuel inlet 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.310
 Ok I hope this video has 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.759
 been useful to you any doubt that 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.539
 you have undoubtedly you can 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.949
 ask at will 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.880
 Thank you for watching my 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.880
 videos and until the next
