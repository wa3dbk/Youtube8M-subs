1,000 rounds per minute because this is
a<00:01:26.329> little<00:01:26.719> bit<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.899> a<00:01:26.990> faster<00:01:27.469> firing<00:01:27.710> weapon

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
a little bit of a faster firing weapon

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
manageable not bad at all but if you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.510 
manageable not bad at all but if you
know<00:01:33.140> it's<00:01:33.289> still<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.740> little<00:01:33.979> bit<00:01:34.159> more<00:01:34.189> than

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.740 
oh that's it let's go ahead and jump
into<00:01:37.100> our<00:01:37.130> first<00:01:37.520> elite<00:01:37.880> and<00:01:38.119> find<00:01:38.359> out<00:01:38.509> what

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
into our first elite and find out what

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.590 
into our first elite and find out what
is<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:38.990> special<00:01:39.439> about<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.009> asm1<00:01:40.609> Strider<00:01:41.179> now

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
is so special about the asm1 Strider now

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.120 
is so special about the asm1 Strider now
looking<00:01:41.899> at<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.109> Carta<00:01:42.409> tells<00:01:42.619> it<00:01:42.770> has<00:01:42.920> one

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
looking at the Carta tells it has one

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.919 
looking at the Carta tells it has one
more<00:01:43.249> damage<00:01:43.640> it<00:01:43.850> has<00:01:44.119> three<00:01:44.359> less<00:01:44.509> accuracy

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
more damage it has three less accuracy

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.859 
more damage it has three less accuracy
but<00:01:45.469> it<00:01:45.619> does<00:01:45.799> have<00:01:46.100> two<00:01:46.520> more<00:01:46.969> range<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:47.719> what

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
but it does have two more range so what

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.109 
but it does have two more range so what
exactly<00:01:47.990> does<00:01:48.469> this<00:01:48.619> translate<00:01:49.119> statistic

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
exactly does this translate statistic

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.149 
exactly does this translate statistic
wise<00:01:50.329> well<00:01:50.689> this<00:01:50.810> actually<00:01:50.990> does<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.590> couple<00:01:51.890> of

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
wise well this actually does a couple of

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.429 
wise well this actually does a couple of
changes<00:01:52.609> to<00:01:52.759> the<00:01:52.850> ASM<00:01:53.359> one<00:01:53.570> so<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.140> strider

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
changes to the ASM one so the strider

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.200 
changes to the ASM one so the strider
although<00:01:54.979> it<00:01:55.130> does<00:01:55.310> have<00:01:55.549> the<00:01:55.729> same<00:01:55.939> base

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
although it does have the same base

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.480 
although it does have the same base
damage<00:01:56.689> for<00:01:57.020> up<00:01:57.319> close<00:01:57.619> and<00:01:57.829> medium<00:01:58.100> it

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
damage for up close and medium it

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.340 
damage for up close and medium it
actually<00:01:58.850> has<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.359> little<00:01:59.539> bit<00:01:59.689> of<00:01:59.810> a<00:02:00.049> higher

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
actually has a little bit of a higher

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.590 
actually has a little bit of a higher
damage<00:02:01.039> when<00:02:01.249> it<00:02:01.280> comes<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.999> its<00:02:02.149> longest

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
damage when it comes to its longest

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.050 
damage when it comes to its longest
range<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.049> instead<00:02:03.319> of<00:02:03.409> it<00:02:03.530> being<00:02:03.560> 35<00:02:04.130> 20<00:02:04.520> to<00:02:04.640> 18

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
range so instead of it being 35 20 to 18

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.440 
range so instead of it being 35 20 to 18
it's<00:02:05.509> 35<00:02:06.109> 22<00:02:06.829> and<00:02:07.069> then<00:02:07.219> 20<00:02:07.670> at<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.939> end<00:02:08.090> which

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
it's 35 22 and then 20 at the end which

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.300 
it's 35 22 and then 20 at the end which
might<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:08.840> seem<00:02:09.140> like<00:02:09.170> a<00:02:09.320> lot<00:02:09.440> but<00:02:10.070> if<00:02:10.220> you

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
might not seem like a lot but if you

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.340 
might not seem like a lot but if you
look<00:02:10.490> at<00:02:10.610> it<00:02:10.729> closely<00:02:10.940> this<00:02:11.300> makes<00:02:11.630> it<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.020> three

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
look at it closely this makes it a three

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.690 
look at it closely this makes it a three
to<00:02:12.530> five<00:02:12.800> shot<00:02:13.130> kill<00:02:13.400> what

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
to five shot kill what

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.030 
to five shot kill what
instead<00:02:14.360> of<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.569> being<00:02:14.599> a<00:02:14.930> three<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.349> six<00:02:15.380> shot

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
instead of it being a three to six shot

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.430 
instead of it being a three to six shot
kill<00:02:16.280> weapon<00:02:16.490> the<00:02:17.150> rate<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.420> fire<00:02:17.599> is<00:02:17.840> exactly

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
kill weapon the rate of fire is exactly

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.620 
kill weapon the rate of fire is exactly
the<00:02:18.620> same<00:02:18.800> 759<00:02:19.790> rounds<00:02:20.060> per<00:02:20.180> minute<00:02:20.450> because

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the same 759 rounds per minute because

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.839 
the same 759 rounds per minute because
he<00:02:20.840> first<00:02:21.080> ate<00:02:21.349> being<00:02:21.709> 1,000<00:02:22.459> rounds<00:02:22.550> per

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
he first ate being 1,000 rounds per

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.940 
he first ate being 1,000 rounds per
minute<00:02:22.940> now<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.720> big<00:02:24.110> thing<00:02:24.140> here<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:24.770> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
minute now the big thing here is that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.070 
minute now the big thing here is that
the<00:02:25.099> range<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.730> lot<00:02:26.150> longer<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.959> gonna

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
the range is a lot longer it's gonna

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.199 
the range is a lot longer it's gonna
stay<00:02:27.500> at<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.860> three<00:02:28.069> shot<00:02:28.340> kill<00:02:28.580> range<00:02:28.610> at

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
stay at that three shot kill range at

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.449 
stay at that three shot kill range at
that<00:02:29.420> four<00:02:29.690> kill<00:02:29.930> shot<00:02:30.200> range<00:02:30.440> a<00:02:30.650> lot<00:02:31.160> longer

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
that four kill shot range a lot longer

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.610 
that four kill shot range a lot longer
than<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:32.090> base<00:02:32.390> weapon<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.080> can<00:02:33.410> actually

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
than the base weapon so you can actually

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.040 
than the base weapon so you can actually
get<00:02:33.980> three<00:02:34.280> shot<00:02:34.520> kills<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:35.060> bit<00:02:35.480> further<00:02:35.780> out

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
get three shot kills a bit further out

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.809 
get three shot kills a bit further out
than<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.440> would<00:02:36.650> with<00:02:36.800> the<00:02:36.950> asm1<00:02:37.430> face

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
than you would with the asm1 face

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.479 
than you would with the asm1 face
addition<00:02:38.510> and<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:38.870> lastly<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.800> ASM<00:02:40.340> one

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
addition and then lastly the ASM one

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.720 
addition and then lastly the ASM one
Strider<00:02:40.880> has<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.420> lot<00:02:41.690> more<00:02:41.720> recoil<00:02:42.410> about<00:02:42.830> 30%

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
Strider has a lot more recoil about 30%

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.699 
Strider has a lot more recoil about 30%
more<00:02:43.819> recoil<00:02:44.420> than<00:02:44.540> you're<00:02:44.750> used<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:45.050> so<00:02:45.590> it's

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
more recoil than you're used to so it's

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.110 
more recoil than you're used to so it's
gonna<00:02:45.830> take<00:02:46.010> a<00:02:46.069> little<00:02:46.340> bit<00:02:46.459> I<00:02:46.489> would<00:02:46.610> slap<00:02:46.970> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
gonna take a little bit I would slap a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.759 
gonna take a little bit I would slap a
four<00:02:47.360> grip<00:02:47.569> on<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:47.870> guy<00:02:48.050> if<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.290> really<00:02:48.590> want

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
four grip on this guy if you really want

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.320 
four grip on this guy if you really want
this<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.040> be<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.160> lot<00:02:49.250> more<00:02:49.310> accurate<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:50.180> to

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
this to be a lot more accurate then to

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.520 
this to be a lot more accurate then to
this<00:02:50.390> guy's<00:02:50.540> with<00:02:50.750> that<00:02:50.900> said<00:02:51.110> let's<00:02:51.290> move<00:02:51.380> on

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
this guy's with that said let's move on

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.220 
this guy's with that said let's move on
now<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.769> its<00:02:52.220> elite<00:02:52.670> companion<00:02:53.330> the<00:02:53.660> asm1

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
now to its elite companion the asm1

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.080 
now to its elite companion the asm1
speakeasy<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:55.220> a<00:02:55.340> lot<00:02:55.549> of<00:02:55.670> people<00:02:55.880> really

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
speakeasy which a lot of people really

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:57.759 
speakeasy which a lot of people really
really<00:02:56.299> enjoy<00:02:56.720> looking<00:02:57.110> at<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.440> card<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
really enjoy looking at the card it

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.559 
really enjoy looking at the card it
tells<00:02:57.950> us<00:02:58.069> it<00:02:58.220> has<00:02:58.340> one<00:02:58.610> more<00:02:58.760> damage<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.390> has

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
tells us it has one more damage it has

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.690 
tells us it has one more damage it has
two<00:02:59.900> more<00:03:00.260> for<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.739> rate<00:03:00.950> of<00:03:01.100> fire<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.610> it

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
two more for the rate of fire but it

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.550 
two more for the rate of fire but it
also<00:03:01.819> has<00:03:02.120> less<00:03:02.450> rain<00:03:02.750> now<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.049> speakeasy

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
also has less rain now the speakeasy

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.559 
also has less rain now the speakeasy
actually<00:03:04.100> has<00:03:04.280> a<00:03:04.519> bit<00:03:04.910> of<00:03:05.000> a<00:03:05.090> change<00:03:05.299> to<00:03:05.450> the

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
actually has a bit of a change to the

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.479 
actually has a bit of a change to the
damage<00:03:05.930> as<00:03:06.080> well<00:03:06.319> we<00:03:06.769> talked<00:03:07.040> about<00:03:07.160> how<00:03:07.430> the

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
damage as well we talked about how the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.940 
damage as well we talked about how the
asm1<00:03:08.000> Strider<00:03:08.360> had<00:03:08.540> 20<00:03:08.900> at<00:03:09.049> its<00:03:09.200> minimum<00:03:09.650> well

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
asm1 Strider had 20 at its minimum well

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.650 
asm1 Strider had 20 at its minimum well
this<00:03:10.069> one<00:03:10.190> actually<00:03:10.340> takes<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.970> hit<00:03:11.150> as<00:03:11.360> well

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
this one actually takes a hit as well

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.320 
this one actually takes a hit as well
the<00:03:12.080> asm1<00:03:12.530> speakeasy<00:03:12.620> actually<00:03:13.610> has<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.790> drop

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
the asm1 speakeasy actually has a drop

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.410 
the asm1 speakeasy actually has a drop
off<00:03:14.569> damage<00:03:14.989> all<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.350> way<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.549> 16<00:03:16.549> now<00:03:17.209> this

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
off damage all the way to 16 now this

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.630 
off damage all the way to 16 now this
makes<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.930> believe<00:03:18.380> it<00:03:18.500> or<00:03:18.560> not<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.980> three<00:03:19.370> to

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
makes it believe it or not a three to

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.849 
makes it believe it or not a three to
seven<00:03:19.910> shot<00:03:20.359> kill<00:03:20.660> weapon<00:03:20.930> which<00:03:21.500> means<00:03:21.739> you

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
seven shot kill weapon which means you

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:23.680 
seven shot kill weapon which means you
really<00:03:22.160> really<00:03:22.549> really<00:03:22.670> want<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.359> use<00:03:23.540> the

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
really really really want to use the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.660 
really really really want to use the
asm1<00:03:24.200> speakeasy<00:03:24.290> up<00:03:25.130> close

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
asm1 speakeasy up close

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.220 
asm1 speakeasy up close
don't<00:03:25.940> even<00:03:26.030> bother<00:03:26.239> going<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:26.720> a<00:03:26.750> distance

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
don't even bother going for a distance

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.599 
don't even bother going for a distance
you're<00:03:27.470> only<00:03:27.620> gonna<00:03:27.799> be<00:03:27.890> wasting<00:03:28.340> your<00:03:28.459> ammo

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
you're only gonna be wasting your ammo

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:30.250 
you're only gonna be wasting your ammo
now<00:03:29.090> even<00:03:29.359> though<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.540> does<00:03:29.690> take<00:03:29.900> a<00:03:29.930> little

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
now even though it does take a little

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.289 
now even though it does take a little
bit<00:03:30.380> more<00:03:30.440> damage<00:03:30.950> at<00:03:31.250> its<00:03:31.430> max<00:03:31.700> range<00:03:32.000> it

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
bit more damage at its max range it

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.360 
bit more damage at its max range it
still<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.810> very<00:03:32.840> effective<00:03:33.650> up<00:03:33.769> close<00:03:34.010> and<00:03:34.250> one

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
still is very effective up close and one

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.979 
still is very effective up close and one
of<00:03:34.459> the<00:03:34.549> big<00:03:34.790> things<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.390> rate<00:03:35.630> of<00:03:35.780> fire

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
of the big things is the rate of fire

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.360 
of the big things is the rate of fire
the<00:03:36.410> asm1<00:03:36.920> speakeasy<00:03:37.070> has<00:03:37.910> a<00:03:37.940> rate<00:03:38.269> of<00:03:38.299> fire<00:03:38.570> of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
the asm1 speakeasy has a rate of fire of

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.560 
the asm1 speakeasy has a rate of fire of
1016<00:03:40.370> rounds<00:03:41.060> per<00:03:41.269> minute

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
1016 rounds per minute

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:44.259 
1016 rounds per minute
almost<00:03:41.900> 300<00:03:42.350> more<00:03:43.100> rounds<00:03:43.430> per<00:03:43.609> minute<00:03:43.730> than

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
almost 300 more rounds per minute than

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.509 
almost 300 more rounds per minute than
the<00:03:44.390> base<00:03:44.630> addition<00:03:45.079> and<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.500> asm1<00:03:46.040> Strider

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
the base addition and the asm1 Strider

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:47.949 
the base addition and the asm1 Strider
now<00:03:47.000> remember<00:03:47.269> that<00:03:47.299> those<00:03:47.510> first<00:03:47.780> eight

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
now remember that those first eight

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.080 
now remember that those first eight
shots<00:03:48.410> will<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.650> 1,000<00:03:49.340> but<00:03:49.459> then<00:03:49.549> it<00:03:49.700> speeds

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
shots will be 1,000 but then it speeds

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.690 
shots will be 1,000 but then it speeds
up<00:03:50.269> a<00:03:50.480> bit<00:03:50.870> more<00:03:51.049> it<00:03:51.140> stays<00:03:51.470> at<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.950> 1000

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
up a bit more it stays at that 1000

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.789 
up a bit more it stays at that 1000
range<00:03:52.880> which<00:03:53.090> is<00:03:53.120> amazing<00:03:53.959> you<00:03:54.079> just<00:03:54.109> melt<00:03:54.650> the

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
range which is amazing you just melt the

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.440 
range which is amazing you just melt the
competition<00:03:55.489> now<00:03:55.760> because<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.150> does<00:03:56.299> have

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
competition now because it does have

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.360 
competition now because it does have
that<00:03:56.630> very<00:03:57.079> high<00:03:57.380> increased<00:03:57.890> rate<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.190> fire

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
that very high increased rate of fire

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.620 
that very high increased rate of fire
this<00:03:58.760> doesn't<00:03:59.090> mean<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.209> it's<00:03:59.390> going<00:03:59.510> to

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
this doesn't mean that it's going to

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.630 
this doesn't mean that it's going to
have<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.959> reduced<00:04:00.470> range<00:04:00.890> now<00:04:01.160> this<00:04:01.310> means<00:04:01.519> that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
have a reduced range now this means that

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.190 
have a reduced range now this means that
it's<00:04:01.819> medium<00:04:02.120> range<00:04:02.329> is<00:04:02.450> going<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.660> drop<00:04:02.959> off

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
it's medium range is going to drop off

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.020 
it's medium range is going to drop off
quite<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.530> bit<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:04.040> basically<00:04:04.400> that<00:04:04.609> means<00:04:04.819> that

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
quite a bit so basically that means that

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.759 
quite a bit so basically that means that
if<00:04:05.209> you're<00:04:05.390> gonna<00:04:05.540> be<00:04:05.750> shifting<00:04:06.019> from<00:04:06.680> one

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
if you're gonna be shifting from one

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.770 
if you're gonna be shifting from one
range<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.400> the<00:04:07.519> other<00:04:07.700> pretty<00:04:08.150> quickly

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
range to the other pretty quickly

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.150 
range to the other pretty quickly
you<00:04:08.989> want<00:04:09.170> to<00:04:09.290> stay<00:04:09.410> up<00:04:09.530> as<00:04:09.650> close<00:04:09.950> as<00:04:10.100> possible

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
you want to stay up as close as possible

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.340 
you want to stay up as close as possible
guys<00:04:10.700> but<00:04:10.970> honestly<00:04:11.329> it's<00:04:11.600> still<00:04:11.840> a<00:04:12.019> really

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
guys but honestly it's still a really

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.870 
guys but honestly it's still a really
awesome<00:04:12.470> weapon<00:04:12.980> really<00:04:13.160> high<00:04:13.370> rate<00:04:13.549> of<00:04:13.579> fire

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
awesome weapon really high rate of fire

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.029 
awesome weapon really high rate of fire
keep<00:04:14.420> it<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.750> close<00:04:15.019> now<00:04:15.290> if<00:04:15.440> that<00:04:15.560> said<00:04:15.889> the

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
keep it up close now if that said the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:17.349 
keep it up close now if that said the
one<00:04:16.220> big<00:04:16.459> thing<00:04:16.729> that<00:04:16.760> a<00:04:16.910> lot<00:04:17.060> of<00:04:17.150> people

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
one big thing that a lot of people

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.690 
one big thing that a lot of people
really<00:04:17.600> like<00:04:17.840> about<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.470> asm1<00:04:18.950> speakeasy<00:04:19.010> is

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
really like about the asm1 speakeasy is

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.159 
really like about the asm1 speakeasy is
the<00:04:19.820> fact<00:04:20.030> that<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.239> has<00:04:20.389> an<00:04:20.600> amazing

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
the fact that it has an amazing

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:22.930 
the fact that it has an amazing
attachment<00:04:21.680> on<00:04:21.769> it<00:04:21.799> which<00:04:22.220> is<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.490> extended

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
attachment on it which is the extended

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.480 
attachment on it which is the extended
mags<00:04:23.180> which<00:04:23.450> is<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.659> barrel

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
mags which is a barrel

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.730 
mags which is a barrel
type<00:04:24.639> attachment<00:04:25.539> basically<00:04:26.139> it<00:04:26.289> bumps<00:04:26.590> up

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
type attachment basically it bumps up

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.409 
type attachment basically it bumps up
your<00:04:26.889> magazine<00:04:27.340> so<00:04:27.520> that<00:04:27.639> you<00:04:27.759> have<00:04:27.970> a<00:04:28.150> lot
