00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.920
 Welcome to our www cor 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.599
 kreativwerkstatt 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 Today I want to give you gold 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.199
 imagine meyer gold is one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.640
 acrylic paint with a beautiful 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.430
 metallic effect it in 24 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 There are different shades and these 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.760
 You can either use a brush 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.580
 process or for special effects 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.599
 use a small swimming 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.080
 At first, the driver moved once 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.080
 thoroughly 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.460
 maya gold contains great metal 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.760
 Particles but always again 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.960
 must be rolled up 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.820
 maya gold adheres to all surfaces 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.649
 So absorb and meaningless 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
 alike and you can, for example 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.520
 from a small yogurt cup one 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.160
 flowerpot conjures up as shows 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 me now 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.949
 First she takes the brush and 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.719
 also strokes like a yogurt cup 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.719
 thin layer as a sticking on 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.700
 this layer needs about three to four 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.620
 minutes to dry meyer gold is one 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.380
 very fast dry color which 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.920
 weather resistant to dry 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.630
 weather resistant is the same 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.369
 waterproof, so please think about it 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:24.950
 wash used tools immediately 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:28.119
 after that you would take the sponge and 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.119
 dabs the second layer on 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.800
 The piggy enters the paint job 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.080
 little structure should not this 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.850
 be opaque enough works after 45 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:02:02.640
 minutes of dry season a second top 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 shift to two work steps should 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.580
 Actually, if it is enough for you 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.759
 you still can not like the process 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.410
 just repeat again 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.910
 and when it's dry you have 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.250
 a yogurt cup a flower pot 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.750
 made another nice method with 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.390
 Maya Gold's work is the design 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.370
 of screens 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:27.000
 For this you need a canvas one 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.800
 template 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.410
 there are many in the vivace choral program here 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.520
 great templates that you used to come 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.600
 and for example his styrofoam heart 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.600
 First we take care of the canvas 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.730
 I especially like working at the 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.430
 Background design with foam 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 you need two to roll 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.850
 different colors which one on 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.620
 plate usually gives the plate with one 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.940
 layer by layer though for this 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.940
 afterwards can clean quickly 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.170
 then I work the color in the role 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.170
 on 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:56.740
 then just look at the role 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:58.720
 please pay close attention to the problem 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.990
 on the edge of a canvas with 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.990
 to design 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.060
 when your picture is finished is now 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.810
 by the side let it dry briefly and 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.910
 meanwhile we are dedicated to the heart that 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.090
 heart of styrofoam styrofoam is not one 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.810
 take care of the under and has pores 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.490
 That's why we need two again 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.370
 layers around a nice smooth 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:36.860
 surface to achieve a first 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.250
 thin layer maya gold on the styrofoam 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.250
 heart 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.760
 after 45 minutes drying time 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.710
 just repeat the process until you know it 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.000
 a nice smooth surface on the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.000
 styrofoam heart could recognize 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.389
 Remember her brush again 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.669
 Wash out because Maria dries 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.720
 waterproof on this year must have about 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:21.520
 to dry for five minutes 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.419
 In the meantime we can with the 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.990
 stencil on our canvas 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.990
 work on 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.449
 You can choose the template as you like 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.449
 position on the canvas 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.199
 then she works a third color maya 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.060
 gold in a chance hit full 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.350
 I use one in this case 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.789
 especially dark colors 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.000
 so that you are beautiful from the background 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.000
 expires 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:59.950
 please do not press too hard on it 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.240
 the canvas is not down 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:10.260
 the resulting shadow breaks through 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.260
 effect is absolutely wanted 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:21.690
 just peel off the template and please 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.690
 Immediately wash in a little water 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.589
 then the whole 2 amount 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:35.610
 let the heart dry 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:37.469
 positioned and you have again 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:40.969
 a great project realized with meyer 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.969
 have fun with my gold
