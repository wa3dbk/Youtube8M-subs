00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.230

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.739

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.340
 Jorge 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.200
 to all the chivas staff to all the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.070
 institution here in green valley in the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:03.710
 stadium that always gave me support 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.950
 unconditional forever there's always 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.189
 different points of view 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:14.350
 I always look forward to working 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:17.420
 always comes with immense joy 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.070
 always trying to bring my 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 experience in soccer 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.490
 there are times when things went well 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.979
 times that did not go so well 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.439
 but I think it was always for the good 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:33.110
 of the team was always for the common good 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.000
 that the team was where it should be 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.299
 be in the first places today I decide 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.299
 do my side 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.080
 I think the most important thing is that at 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.310
 team is doing well 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.200
 and also I think it's time to 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.570
 dedicate myself to my professional projects 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.159
 start my career as a director 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.130
 technical and let that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.460
 that make the decisions are in the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.460

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.770

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.300

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.860

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.860
