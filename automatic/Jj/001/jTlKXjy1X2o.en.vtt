00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.500
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.450
 this new update video in 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.240
 which I tell you about all the latest news 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.710
 about the ios jailbreak 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.269
 before I start, I take a moment 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.920
 point of the situation for the new ones 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.380
 people who follow me for those who 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.170
 they don't know the jailbreak scene 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.689
 etc. then until now the last one 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.340
 untethered jailbreak available that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:32.219
 on s6 point 1.2 in fact ios 6.1 point 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.600
 36.1 point 4 and 7 beta are not jailbreak 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.670
 skillful in hunter mode and while ios 6.3 is 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.129
 skillful jailbreak so the the red 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.829
 only for the iphone 4 the ipod touch of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.469
 fourth generation and the iphone 3gs 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.200
 now hackers have said they already have 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.719
 ready the untethered jailbreak of ios 7 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.870
 and who will release it as soon as 7 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.210
 will be released to the public and I remember that ios is 7 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.370
 should go out for the public 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.289
 September 10th then a lot 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.180
 probably already since 11 September 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.549
 we can think of getting our own 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.310
 hunter of the ios and 7 jailbreak 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.840
 compatible with all devices 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.510
 also included the iPhone 5 that will come out 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.340
 precisely to the dub delay of yes while the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 hackers said they will not release 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.830
 no untethered jailbreak 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.470
 but I s6 point 1.3 and ios 6.1 point 4 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.479
 this because it would require too much 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.820
 waste of energy for firmware 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 however they are going to become 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.390
 however, there is a problem 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.850
 old generation devices 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.829
 such as the fourth iPod touch 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.780
 generation will not receive 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.030
 update to ios and then 7 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.430
 they will be forced to get stuck 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.770
 only s6 point 1.3 and therefore not 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.619
 they will get the jailbreak 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.970
 besides who has for example a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.399
 new generation device too 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.049
 like for example an iphone 5 but it's not 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.630
 pleased to have 7 so I would like 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.119
 remain at verses 6.1 point 3 or 6 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.369
 points 1.4 will not receive the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.350
 jailbreak untethered this until all 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.890
 day before yesterday in fact yesterday the famous 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.689
 winock hacker but said he was 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.340
 managed to find exploits 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.069
 enough to perform the jailbreak 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.500
 it 6.1 untethered puntotel is therefore 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.260
 consequently also ios and 6 points 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.170
 of the iPhone 5 so no one knows yet 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.920
 when, however, the break ante 3 will also be released 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.780
 of ios 6.3 and 6.1 point 4 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.050
 one only needs to give time to the ker of 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.270
 package exploits in a tool in 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.220
 able to install cydia 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.920
 so it's still not known when 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.680
 these two ios ss jailbreaks will come out 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.050
 point 1.3 and 7.0 in any case remain 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.920
 stay tuned because i 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.680
 jailbreak 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.420
 I of course I'll make a video before 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.560
 greet you guys I want to remember you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.600
 that for all those who have 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.360
 ios 7 installed and which are not 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.430
 registered to the us of the center therefore not 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.989
 are developers I invite you to watch 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.300
 this video because it really is 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.160
 important because apple could 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.350
 then lock your devices 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.640
 follow this video in which I explain well 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.380
 the story 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.510
 having said this I greet you I remind you of 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.910
