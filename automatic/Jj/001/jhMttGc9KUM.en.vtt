00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.480 
of Germany's personal physician and he
basically<00:00:24.960> developed<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:25.920> energetic

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
basically developed this as an energetic

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.139 
basically developed this as an energetic
medicine<00:00:27.890> which<00:00:30.439> basically<00:00:31.439> turned<00:00:31.830> out<00:00:32.149> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
medicine which basically turned out to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.670 
medicine which basically turned out to
be<00:00:34.130> capturing<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.640> vibration<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:37.040> plant<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.660> a

in you between your fingers then you

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.430 
in you between your fingers then you
have<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:38.940> vibration<00:02:39.780> now<00:02:40.650> if<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.580> expand<00:02:42.120> it

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
have that vibration now if you expand it

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.770 
have that vibration now if you expand it
if<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:43.530> let<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.739> all<00:02:44.099> grow<00:02:44.430> bit<00:02:45.390> by<00:02:45.569> bit<00:02:45.599> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
if you let that all grow bit by bit and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.240 
if you let that all grow bit by bit and
this<00:02:45.959> one's<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.319> really<00:02:46.590> growing<00:02:46.830> very<00:02:46.980> fast

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
this one's not really growing very fast

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.910 
this one's not really growing very fast
for<00:02:47.610> me<00:02:50.299> you<00:02:51.299> can<00:02:51.480> then<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.530> know<00:02:52.650> you<00:02:52.709> can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920

not a problem whatever yeah what you can

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:58.490 
not a problem whatever yeah what you can
do<00:03:56.819> with<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.239> technique<00:03:57.870> once<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.230> develop

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
do with this technique once you develop

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.349 
do with this technique once you develop
this<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.920> can<00:03:59.069> eventually<00:03:59.730> use<00:04:00.090> it<00:04:00.239> in<00:04:00.299> the

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
this you can eventually use it in the

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.030 
this you can eventually use it in the
Taiji<00:04:00.690> acupuncture<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.440> you<00:04:01.530> can<00:04:01.680> take<00:04:01.889> them

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
Taiji acupuncture and you can take them

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.080 
Taiji acupuncture and you can take them
take<00:04:02.459> a<00:04:02.510> medicine<00:04:03.510> and<00:04:04.079> put<00:04:04.410> it<00:04:04.530> inside<00:04:05.090> a

take a medicine and put it inside a
point<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.620> increase<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.250> healing<00:04:09.019> in<00:04:10.019> that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
point and increase the healing in that

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.229 
point and increase the healing in that
way<00:04:12.650> you<00:04:13.650> can't<00:04:13.919> really<00:04:14.130> do<00:04:14.370> it<00:04:14.400> with

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
way you can't really do it with

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.690 
way you can't really do it with
traditional<00:04:15.900> Chinese<00:04:16.200> medicine<00:04:16.650> but<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:16.979> but

you<00:04:17.760> could<00:04:18.090> for<00:04:18.329> example<00:04:18.359> take<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:18.930> traditional

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
you could for example take a traditional

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.960 
you could for example take a traditional
chinese<00:04:19.739> medicine<00:04:19.889> remedy<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.639> take<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
chinese medicine remedy and take the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.920 
chinese medicine remedy and take the
energy<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.419> it<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:22.669> reverse<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.720> by<00:04:24.720> taking

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
energy of it and reverse it by taking

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.909 
energy of it and reverse it by taking
