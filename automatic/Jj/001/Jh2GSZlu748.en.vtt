I'd probably get fired that's why I've

meantime<00:04:13.669> spend<00:04:14.669> a<00:04:14.760> few<00:04:14.970> moments<00:04:15.389> to<00:04:15.510> stop<00:04:15.810> and

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
meantime spend a few moments to stop and

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.259 
meantime spend a few moments to stop and
really<00:04:16.289> think<00:04:16.380> about<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.849> let's<00:04:17.849> say<00:04:18.090> that

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
really think about it let's say that

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:19.939 
really think about it let's say that
I've<00:04:18.419> developed<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.959> system<00:04:19.349> that<00:04:19.500> works<00:04:19.680> all

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
I've developed a system that works all

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:20.330 
I've developed a system that works all
the<00:04:20.099> time

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
the time

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.460 
the time
and<00:04:20.609> I<00:04:21.030> share<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.479> with<00:04:21.599> you<00:04:21.870> right<00:04:21.900> here<00:04:22.409> on

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
and I share it with you right here on

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.680 
and I share it with you right here on
the<00:04:22.650> Internet<00:04:23.010> now<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.820> would<00:04:24.060> go<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.330> use<00:04:24.510> it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
the Internet now you would go and use it

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.379 
the Internet now you would go and use it
wouldn't<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:25.409> of<00:04:25.770> course<00:04:26.099> you<00:04:26.250> would<00:04:26.460> so
