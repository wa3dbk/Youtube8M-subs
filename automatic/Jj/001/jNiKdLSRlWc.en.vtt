00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
this child of gravity that's it if we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.600 
this child of gravity that's it if we
can<00:01:42.420> somehow<00:01:42.750> harness<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.829> prayer<00:01:44.100> into<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
can somehow harness the prayer into a

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.430 
can somehow harness the prayer into a
chemical

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
chemical

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.770 
chemical
that<00:01:45.680> we<00:01:46.160> can<00:01:46.370> change<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.060> oppressor<00:01:47.600> from

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
the inside out I think that's how we'll

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.020 
the inside out I think that's how we'll
change<00:01:51.110> happen<00:01:51.680> just<00:01:51.920> hit<00:01:52.190> from<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.820> end

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030
