let's play in the key of F on this one
and<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> program<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:58.379> six<00:00:59.059> two

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
and the program for this is one six two

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.640 
and the program for this is one six two
or<00:01:00.329> four<00:01:00.780> which<00:01:01.320> is<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.710> relative<00:01:02.160> six<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.640> five

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
or four which is a relative six and five

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
or four which is a relative six and five
which<00:01:04.650> would<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.979> F

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
which would be F

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.530 
which would be F
the<00:01:07.380> matter

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.839 

real<00:02:25.409> simple<00:02:25.680> line<00:02:25.950> guys<00:02:26.220> let's<00:02:26.580> start<00:02:26.700> on

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
real simple line guys let's start on

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.839 
real simple line guys let's start on
string<00:02:27.180> seven<00:02:27.659> at<00:02:27.780> fret<00:02:27.989> 5<00:02:28.549> we're<00:02:29.549> going<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.730> be

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
string seven at fret 5 we're going to be

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.690 
string seven at fret 5 we're going to be
using<00:02:30.060> five<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.750> seven<00:02:31.110> ready<00:02:31.400> seven<00:02:32.400> slide

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
using five and seven ready seven slide

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.420 
using five and seven ready seven slide
up

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.809 

now<00:02:37.430> let's<00:02:37.640> build<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.750> six<00:02:39.050> core

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.339 

so<00:02:42.299> what<00:02:42.450> I'm<00:02:42.540> doing<00:02:42.569> is<00:02:42.810> dropping<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.319> a

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
so what I'm doing is dropping the a

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:56.699 
so what I'm doing is dropping the a
petal<00:02:43.799> on<00:02:43.890> string<00:02:44.219> five

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.220 

now

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
now

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.420 
now
leave<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.980> B<00:02:59.129> pedal<00:02:59.340> down<00:02:59.610> race<00:02:59.970> they<00:03:01.430> slide

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
leave the B pedal down race they slide

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:09.220 
leave the B pedal down race they slide
back<00:03:02.459> to<00:03:02.700> fret<00:03:03.060> six<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.569> strike<00:03:03.840> string<00:03:04.260> seven

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.520 

so<00:03:09.800> I<00:03:09.830> believe<00:03:10.220> Allentown

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.650 

dropping<00:03:15.530> a<00:03:15.620> metal

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.950 

raise<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.230> again<00:03:19.710> and<00:03:20.180> when<00:03:21.180> we<00:03:21.300> raise<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.570> B

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
raise it again and when we raise the B

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.589 
raise it again and when we raise the B
pedal<00:03:22.230> strike<00:03:23.220> five<00:03:23.520> six<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.030> nine

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.690 

and<00:03:27.719> hopefully<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.230> all<00:03:28.379> see<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.159> I'm

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
and hopefully you all see that now I'm

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.750 
and hopefully you all see that now I'm
in<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.030> C<00:03:30.209> position<00:03:30.420> and<00:03:31.349> have<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.739> fifth<00:03:32.129> the
