after you've ridden the bike so here are

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
back and that makes the seat tube angle

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
back and that makes the seat tube angle
steeper<00:01:15.150> remember<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> road<00:01:16.470> bike<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
steeper remember that on a road bike the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
steeper remember that on a road bike the
seat<00:01:17.310> tube<00:01:17.340> angle<00:01:17.640> is<00:01:17.850> about<00:01:17.970> 73<00:01:18.600> degrees<00:01:18.900> on<00:01:19.170> a

seat tube angle is about 73 degrees on a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.429 
seat tube angle is about 73 degrees on a
triathlon<00:01:20.040> bike<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.790> 78<00:01:21.540> degrees<00:01:21.750> but

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
triathlon bike it's about 78 degrees but

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.920 
triathlon bike it's about 78 degrees but
