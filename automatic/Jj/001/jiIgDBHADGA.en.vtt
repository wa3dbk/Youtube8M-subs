connection<00:01:03.789> issues<00:01:04.059> was<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.420> but<00:01:04.960> the

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:05.079 
connection issues was that but the

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:07.069 
connection issues was that but the
surface<00:01:05.409> RT<00:01:05.799> though<00:01:05.979> you<00:01:06.250> remember<00:01:06.670> was<00:01:06.820> a

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:07.079 
surface RT though you remember was a

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:10.260 
surface RT though you remember was a
raging<00:01:08.079> success<00:01:08.259> based<00:01:09.219> up<00:01:09.520> running<00:01:09.880> Windows

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
raging success based up running Windows

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.899 
raging success based up running Windows
but<00:01:10.479> based<00:01:10.689> on<00:01:10.869> arm<00:01:11.289> so<00:01:12.009> the<00:01:12.159> only<00:01:12.340> apps<00:01:12.670> that

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
but based on arm so the only apps that

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.139 
but based on arm so the only apps that
it<00:01:13.030> could<00:01:13.149> run<00:01:13.360> were<00:01:13.570> Windows<00:01:14.530> 8<00:01:14.829> apps<00:01:15.149> that

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
it could run were Windows 8 apps that

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:21.149 
it could run were Windows 8 apps that
were<00:01:16.359> also<00:01:17.009> compiled<00:01:18.009> for<00:01:18.369> the<00:01:18.850> arm<00:01:20.159> mic

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
were also compiled for the arm mic

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.840 
were also compiled for the arm mic
architecture<00:01:21.399> and<00:01:23.039> then<00:01:24.039> like<00:01:24.399> they<00:01:24.640> had<00:01:24.820> a

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
architecture and then like they had a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.880 
architecture and then like they had a
version<00:01:25.359> of<00:01:25.450> office<00:01:25.899> that<00:01:26.200> they<00:01:26.350> shipped<00:01:26.409> i

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
version of office that they shipped i

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.069 
version of office that they shipped i
think<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.399> like<00:01:27.430> was<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> only<00:01:28.210> desktop<00:01:28.869> app

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
think that like was the only desktop app

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.499 
think that like was the only desktop app
that<00:01:29.320> would<00:01:29.380> run<00:01:29.530> in<00:01:29.710> desktop<00:01:30.100> mode<00:01:30.130> on<00:01:30.460> it<00:01:30.609> it

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
that would run in desktop mode on it it

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.840 
that would run in desktop mode on it it
was<00:01:31.689> a<00:01:31.719> weird<00:01:31.990> I<00:01:32.289> had<00:01:32.469> no<00:01:32.679> pad<00:01:32.920> Oh<00:01:33.189> II<00:01:33.460> had<00:01:33.820> no

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
was a weird I had no pad Oh II had no

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.359 
was a weird I had no pad Oh II had no
pet<00:01:34.240> okay<00:01:34.539> it<00:01:34.659> was<00:01:34.780> a<00:01:34.810> weird<00:01:35.200> product<00:01:36.009> it<00:01:36.219> was<00:01:36.340> a

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
pet okay it was a weird product it was a

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.999 
pet okay it was a weird product it was a
weird<00:01:36.759> and<00:01:37.149> I<00:01:37.869> think<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.649> reason<00:01:38.829> that

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
weird and I think the reason that

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.919 
weird and I think the reason that
Microsoft<00:01:39.579> did<00:01:39.789> it<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:39.969> part<00:01:40.270> was<00:01:40.450> because

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:40.929 
Microsoft did it in part was because

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.039 
Microsoft did it in part was because
they<00:01:41.320> saw<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:42.310> mobile<00:01:42.609> world<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:43.509> armed

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:44.049 
they saw the mobile world going armed

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.700 
they saw the mobile world going armed
and<00:01:44.229> they<00:01:44.320> didn't<00:01:44.619> want<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:46.710> their

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
and they didn't want to have their

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.349 
and they didn't want to have their
device<00:01:47.979> have<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.280> be<00:01:48.399> thicker<00:01:48.700> or<00:01:48.850> slower

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:49.359 
device have to be thicker or slower

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:52.499 
device have to be thicker or slower
heavier<00:01:50.020> or<00:01:50.170> shorter<00:01:51.039> battery<00:01:51.219> life<00:01:51.670> because

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509 
heavier or shorter battery life because

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.779 
heavier or shorter battery life because
it<00:01:52.659> used<00:01:52.840> an<00:01:53.020> Intel<00:01:53.409> processor<00:01:53.490> but<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.670> know

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
it used an Intel processor but you know

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.709 
it used an Intel processor but you know
intel<00:01:55.420> has<00:01:55.450> put<00:01:56.249> itself<00:01:57.249> at<00:01:57.520> parity<00:01:58.149> more<00:01:58.600> or

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
intel has put itself at parity more or

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.099 
intel has put itself at parity more or
less<00:01:58.929> with<00:01:59.679> the<00:01:59.710> arm<00:02:00.340> SOC<00:02:00.729> makers<00:02:01.359> at<00:02:01.869> least

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
air montecore and which is basically a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.820 
air montecore and which is basically a
die<00:02:26.270> shrink<00:02:26.480> to<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.810> 40<00:02:27.200> nanometer<00:02:27.620> process

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
die shrink to the 40 nanometer process

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.780 
die shrink to the 40 nanometer process
of<00:02:28.430> bay<00:02:28.940> trail<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.330> came<00:02:29.510> before<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.800> it<00:02:31.520> you

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
know it looks like like in theory when I

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.940 
know it looks like like in theory when I
saw<00:02:35.630> this<00:02:35.810> announcement<00:02:36.170> Jeff<00:02:36.560> I'd<00:02:36.710> only<00:02:36.830> by
