00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.530
 hello in this early morning my 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.690
 dear friends 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.400
 it has come a package for me already 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.439
 again a package you ask yourself something 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.740
 border to be in there this time 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.169
 Well , we see now I can see 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.009
 So much to say the package is coming out 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:34.360
 In the year the ta klimas and one aims 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:40.019
 First of all if you want something because you are fuller 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.879
 red so first level for stage party 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.730
 Making people was a bit fun always 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.059
 factually makes can do what I have 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.059
 because here 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:01.239
 it is broken playstation vita tv or 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:06.159
 like the Chinese or Japanese factual 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:07.390
 really no bidder fight experience so 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.030
 or just look pure 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 I do it on the table the zoomer 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.840
 now here 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:24.790
 do something so bitter enough 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:29.530
 playstation vita tvm unboxing videos im 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.890
 internet but not in german so if 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.050
 We also do that first 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.180
 the playstation vita tv man is coming 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.560
 direct train whipped cream directly above 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.670
 That's why it's now determined 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.940
 broken because it so much off me 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.960
 that's just how it looks right now 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.360
 whole from really really small so 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 comparable to me as an ex smoker 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.830
 would say yes cigarette box yet 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.240
 not even a big box would I say 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.760
 Yes 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.400
 and here but the connections everything hdmi 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:05.170
 ethernet 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:06.970
 that still has over for memory card usb 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.399
 usb we have to do that thing 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.970
 connect the joypad and here comes 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.969
 the vita map are purely the time was 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:21.310
 a side if that is all travel 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:31.200
 let's do it here and fight it 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:33.819
 gives instructions on japan japan japan 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.969
 well if you look at your shelf 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.840
 buy the old master qadhafis at least 

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:40.870
 so happens 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:45.510
 yes, but we still collect here we have 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.510
 actually a hdmi cable right there 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.209
 then we have here h 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:57.010
 Of course that's here because from Japan 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:59.469
 But this Japanese plug will 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:04.239
 actually not a problem because 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:06.989
 here this power supply has what is there 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.879
 yes again here this connection 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.010
 and if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.739
 that have the same specification as 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.840
 the part of the normal playstation 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.010
 vita and then I just put it away 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.900
 From the very her yes is here now 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.239
 You have this connection we have 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.939
 two more games playstation 3 or halt 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:30.010
 at the adapter thing from the 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.540
 playstation vita and then you take 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.099
 you just throw it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.769
 away you need something similar be it flies 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:37.359
 to visit japan in cascade what to do 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:38.889
 Flying around at home has a thousandfold 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.040
 to hear even at tape player 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:51.389
 and so yes and that's all in 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:53.400
 this pack is in there you have to yes 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.779
 be a wrapper artist or fendt 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.120
 packaging artist from pack artist 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:04:03.510
 Anyway, let's go for it 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.859
 pow 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.590
 so looks a lot outward that too 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:11.860
 image 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.860
 yes my base breeder does not matter 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.060
 Unfortunately, the compatibility of the 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.959
 I do not like it that much and you do not 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.229
 needs a playstation network account 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:25.160
 in japan so on Japanese 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.720
 Fortunately, have the playstation 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.400
 vita we already import then 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.630
 let out of the century because of that 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.220
 the time still a Japanese 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.800
 playstation network account otherwise 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.290
 You can also create things like that 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.790
 and the compatibility is unfortunately not 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.229
 very high to the I play my I 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.330
 have so far almost every provider 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.470
 I'll try all by myself but me 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.970
 also have a list from internally 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.120
 downloaded what is compatible and 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.650
 which is not and there is not much but what 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.500
 compatible with that would be me 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.729
 then use for which and so on 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:05:00.100
 playstation thanks for watching 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:05:00.100
