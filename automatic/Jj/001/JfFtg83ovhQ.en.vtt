been trying to make videos it's just
they<00:00:18.960> haven't<00:00:19.199> come<00:00:19.500> out<00:00:19.590> exactly<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.189> way<00:00:20.310> I

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
they haven't come out exactly the way I

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.040 
they haven't come out exactly the way I
wanted<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> they're<00:00:21.180> not<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.600> they're<00:00:21.900> not

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
wanted and they're not and they're not

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.679 
wanted and they're not and they're not
even<00:00:22.170> close<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.619> quality<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.340> my<00:00:23.880> earlier

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
even close to the quality of my earlier

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
even close to the quality of my earlier
videos<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.650> that's<00:00:25.920> partly<00:00:26.310> why<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.849> leaving

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
videos and that's partly why I'm leaving

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.630

I<00:00:27.539> mean<00:00:27.779> there<00:00:28.680> isn't<00:00:28.920> much<00:00:29.039> left<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.400> Mario

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
I mean there isn't much left in Mario

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.240 
I mean there isn't much left in Mario

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.850 
Kart Wii to do I've been having trouble
trying<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.579> make<00:00:32.730> new<00:00:32.940> videos<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.649> just

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
trying to make new videos and it just

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.819 
trying to make new videos and it just
hasn't<00:00:35.309> been<00:00:35.460> working<00:00:35.820> out<00:00:35.969> so<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:37.410> know<00:00:37.469> Mario

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
hasn't been working out so I know Mario

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.940 
hasn't been working out so I know Mario
Kart<00:00:38.040> 8<00:00:38.190> is<00:00:38.309> coming<00:00:38.610> up<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.719> think<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.770> lot<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Kart 8 is coming up and I think a lot of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.160 
Kart 8 is coming up and I think a lot of
people<00:00:41.219> have<00:00:42.120> fun<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.960> next

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
people have fun with that in the next

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
people have fun with that in the next
month<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.129> think<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:44.730> marikar<00:00:45.329> we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
month and I think basically marikar we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.470 
month and I think basically marikar we
will<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.140> left<00:00:46.350> behind<00:00:46.500> except<00:00:47.010> for<00:00:47.480> except

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
will be left behind except for except

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.660 
will be left behind except for except
for<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.780> tosses<00:00:49.680> which<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.070> imagine<00:00:50.489> will

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
for probably tosses which I imagine will

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.729 
for probably tosses which I imagine will
continue<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.930> know<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.079> never<00:00:52.350> did<00:00:52.590> much

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
continue but you know I never did much

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.189 
continue but you know I never did much
of<00:00:52.800> those<00:00:53.010> anyways<00:00:53.510> I'm<00:00:54.510> not<00:00:54.870> gonna<00:00:54.989> be

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
of those anyways I'm not gonna be

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.930

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
getting Mario Kart 8 simply because I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.200 
getting Mario Kart 8 simply because I
don't<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.300> Wii<00:00:57.539> U<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.050> I<00:00:58.140> don't<00:00:58.469> plan<00:00:58.800> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
but I'm sure it'll be a great game and I

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.349 
but I'm sure it'll be a great game and I
can't<00:01:02.039> wait<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.489> all<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.789> cool<00:01:03.090> things

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
