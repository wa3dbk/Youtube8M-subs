and then some sequins I got these from

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.370 
and then some sequins I got these from
Inglot<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.020> thing<00:00:19.140> you're<00:00:19.230> going<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
Inglot the first thing you're going to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310 
Inglot the first thing you're going to
want<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.650> do<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.130> paint<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.150> nude<00:00:21.510> color<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
want to do is paint a nude color and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.230 
want to do is paint a nude color and
hopefully<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.220> find<00:00:23.279> one<00:00:23.640> that's<00:00:23.820> opaque

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
hopefully you can find one that's opaque

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.700 
hopefully you can find one that's opaque
enough<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:24.869> don't<00:00:24.900> have<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.439> two

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
enough that you don't have to do two

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.009 
enough that you don't have to do two
coats<00:00:26.029> because<00:00:27.029> there<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> lot<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.720> layers

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
coats because there is a lot of layers

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.800 
coats because there is a lot of layers
to<00:00:28.289> this<00:00:28.439> look<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.849> less<00:00:30.150> coats<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
to this look and the less coats the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.650 
to this look and the less coats the
better<00:00:31.250> because<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.700> are<00:00:32.910> using<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.390> scotch

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
better because you are using the scotch

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.840 
better because you are using the scotch
tape<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.380> if<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.340> away<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.730> just

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
tape so if you can get away with just

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
tape so if you can get away with just
doing<00:00:36.149> one<00:00:36.360> coat<00:00:36.690> that's<00:00:36.989> going<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> be<00:00:37.440> your

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
doing one coat that's going to be your

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
doing one coat that's going to be your
best<00:00:37.950> bet<00:00:39.050> so<00:00:40.050> after<00:00:40.170> you<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.829> out

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
best bet so after you do that get out

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.729 
best bet so after you do that get out
your<00:00:41.160> scotch<00:00:41.489> tape<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.750> put<00:00:43.379> on<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.530> back

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
your scotch tape you can put on the back

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.529 
your scotch tape you can put on the back
your<00:00:43.950> hand<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.250> few<00:00:44.430> times<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:45.030> make<00:00:45.180> sure<00:00:45.239> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
your hand a few times to make sure it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.110 
your hand a few times to make sure it's
not<00:00:45.629> too<00:00:46.170> sticky<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.950> then<00:00:47.730> you're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.030> to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
not too sticky and then you're going to

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.319 
not too sticky and then you're going to
tape<00:00:48.510> off<00:00:48.950> half<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.250> the<00:00:50.489> nail<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.090> can<00:00:51.239> do

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
tape off half of the nail so you can do

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.319 
tape off half of the nail so you can do
this<00:00:51.449> horizontally<00:00:52.079> or<00:00:52.289> vertically<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.940> mean<00:00:54.239> I

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
this horizontally or vertically I mean I

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.110 
this horizontally or vertically I mean I
just<00:00:54.360> chose<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:54.989> this<00:00:55.079> design<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.770> it

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
just chose for this design to do it

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.020 
just chose for this design to do it
horizontally<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.829> it's<00:00:59.010> going<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.309> cut

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
horizontally so that it's going to cut

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.979 
horizontally so that it's going to cut
it<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.629> half<00:01:00.719> down<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.440> middle<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> go

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
it right in half down the middle you go

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
it right in half down the middle you go
ahead<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.439> those<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.159> all<00:01:05.339> ten

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
ahead and put that those on all ten

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.850 
ahead and put that those on all ten
fingers<00:01:08.990> then<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.170> ahead<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.500> out<00:01:10.619> your

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
fingers then go ahead and get out your

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.950 
fingers then go ahead and get out your
new<00:01:11.040> black<00:01:11.340> gradient<00:01:11.939> set<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.540> don't<00:01:12.780> have

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
new black gradient set if you don't have

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.469 
new black gradient set if you don't have
this<00:01:13.110> set<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:14.310> colors<00:01:14.700> just<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.150> line

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
this set you can use colors just in line

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.370 
this set you can use colors just in line
that<00:01:16.170> go<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.590> light<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.280> dark<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.930> I<00:01:18.930> am<00:01:19.140> just

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
that go from light to dark and I am just

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.060 
that go from light to dark and I am just
going<00:01:19.650> along<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.369> five<00:01:20.640> nails<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.390> going

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
going along all five nails and going

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.429 
going along all five nails and going
across<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.549> light<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:23.850> dark<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.200> will<00:01:25.409> be

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
across from light to dark so it will be

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.999 
across from light to dark so it will be
a<00:01:25.860> gradient<00:01:26.520> effect<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:28.020> goes<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> way

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
a gradient effect that goes all the way

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.700 
a gradient effect that goes all the way
across<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.850> think<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> looks<00:01:30.840> really<00:01:31.259> cool

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
get and I absolutely love it I think

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.350 
get and I absolutely love it I think
it's<00:01:52.439> super<00:01:52.799> super<00:01:52.950> cool<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> wanted<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it's super super cool but I wanted to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's super super cool but I wanted to
finish<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.750> off<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> matte<00:01:55.380> topcoat<00:01:55.710> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
finish it off with a matte topcoat just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
finish it off with a matte topcoat just
to<00:01:56.790> give<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> cool<00:01:57.270> effect<00:01:57.649> because<00:01:58.649> I

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
to give it a cool effect because I

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.300 
to give it a cool effect because I
thought<00:01:58.950> that<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.549> add<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> it

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310
