these as pinch a pouch and it lasted him
the<00:05:08.040> whole<00:05:08.190> year<00:05:08.400> cuz<00:05:09.150> normally<00:05:09.300> we<00:05:09.600> have<00:05:09.630> to

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
be very high quality and yeah and if you

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.530 
be very high quality and yeah and if you
