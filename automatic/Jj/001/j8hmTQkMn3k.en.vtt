00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.910
 No start the game after three seconds at 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.920

 very very quickly people do not merge 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.760
 I understand why, but they are somehow very 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.790
 quickly fighting each other and dying 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.649
