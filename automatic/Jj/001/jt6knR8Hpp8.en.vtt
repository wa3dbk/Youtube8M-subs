if you know as a gay man I would say

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.750 
if you know as a gay man I would say
that<00:03:38.110> that's<00:03:38.230> probably<00:03:39.010> true<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> other

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
that that's probably true on the other

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.750 
that that's probably true on the other
hand<00:03:40.299> he<00:03:40.900> was<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.200> closeted<00:03:41.950> most<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.519> time

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
hand he was so closeted most of the time

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.699 
hand he was so closeted most of the time
that<00:03:43.090> there's<00:03:43.329> probably<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.959> lot<00:03:44.170> they<00:03:44.410> didn't

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
that there's probably a lot they didn't

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.009 
that there's probably a lot they didn't
know<00:03:44.970> okay<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.390> do<00:03:46.480> you<00:03:46.540> think<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.720> movie<00:03:46.870> was

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
know okay so do you think the movie was

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.420 
know okay so do you think the movie was
being<00:03:47.230> responsible<00:03:47.560> or<00:03:48.070> do<00:03:48.130> you<00:03:48.220> think<00:03:48.250> it

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
being responsible or do you think it

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.130 
being responsible or do you think it
wasn't<00:03:48.579> being<00:03:48.880> yeah<00:03:49.510> I<00:03:49.720> think<00:03:49.959> they<00:03:50.049> were

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
wasn't being yeah I think they were

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.960 
wasn't being yeah I think they were
using<00:03:50.230> facts<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.280> they<00:03:51.400> were<00:03:51.459> pretty<00:03:51.760> well

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
using facts that they were pretty well

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.509 
using facts that they were pretty well
sure<00:03:52.870> of<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.350> I<00:03:53.829> mean<00:03:53.980> there<00:03:54.160> were<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> lot<00:03:54.400> of

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
sure of it I mean there were a lot of

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.819 
sure of it I mean there were a lot of
private<00:03:54.940> moments<00:03:55.329> between<00:03:55.510> the<00:03:55.870> two<00:03:56.079> guys

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
private moments between the two guys

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.670 
private moments between the two guys
that<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.760> was<00:03:58.150> wondering<00:03:58.750> how<00:03:58.959> would<00:03:59.019> they<00:03:59.350> know

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
that I was wondering how would they know

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.210 
that I was wondering how would they know
that<00:04:00.329> these<00:04:01.329> these<00:04:02.019> conversations<00:04:02.980> take

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
that these these conversations take

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520 
that these these conversations take
place<00:04:03.250> right<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.090> felt<00:04:04.480> like<00:04:04.630> the<00:04:04.870> writing<00:04:05.320> was

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
place right I felt like the writing was

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.840 
place right I felt like the writing was
a<00:04:05.560> little<00:04:05.920> bit<00:04:06.070> uneven

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
a little bit uneven

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.880 
a little bit uneven
like<00:04:07.030> Justin<00:04:07.600> Dustin<00:04:08.140> Lance<00:04:08.290> Black<00:04:08.650> he's<00:04:08.860> a

the love of his life Jagga Hoover and
the<00:04:24.000> bureau<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:24.750> felt<00:04:24.960> like<00:04:25.020> he<00:04:25.140> was

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
the bureau and I felt like he was

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.990 
the bureau and I felt like he was
dealing<00:04:25.410> with<00:04:25.710> like<00:04:25.980> more<00:04:26.220> than<00:04:26.400> just<00:04:26.460> one<00:04:26.850> or

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
dealing with like more than just one or

dealing with like more than just one or
two<00:04:27.050> too<00:04:28.050> many<00:04:28.080> subjects<00:04:28.710> for<00:04:28.890> him<00:04:29.010> that's<00:04:29.400> why

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
two too many subjects for him that's why

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.920 
two too many subjects for him that's why
I<00:04:29.580> became<00:04:29.880> really<00:04:30.090> uneven<00:04:30.540> because<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.810> feels

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
I became really uneven because it feels

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.770 
I became really uneven because it feels
like<00:04:31.020> different<00:04:31.590> films<00:04:32.040> in<00:04:32.190> different<00:04:33.150> parts

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
like different films in different parts
