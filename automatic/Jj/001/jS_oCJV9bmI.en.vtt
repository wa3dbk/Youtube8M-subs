the Cape kind of ballpark you just kind

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.100 
the Cape kind of ballpark you just kind
of<00:05:32.920> spread<00:05:33.100> it<00:05:33.400> around<00:05:33.550> it's<00:05:34.480> the<00:05:34.600> middle<00:05:34.930> to

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
of spread it around it's the middle to

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.630 
of spread it around it's the middle to
you<00:05:35.200> so<00:05:35.410> it<00:05:35.470> doesn't<00:05:35.680> really<00:05:35.740> matter<00:05:35.950> camera

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
you won't be able to see it because

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.560 
you won't be able to see it because
it'll<00:05:38.920> be<00:05:38.980> in<00:05:39.070> between<00:05:39.190> time<00:05:39.940> allowing<00:05:40.150> mine

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
it'll be in between time allowing mine

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.310 
it'll be in between time allowing mine
so<00:05:41.760> just<00:05:42.760> keep<00:05:42.940> spreading<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.540> on<00:05:43.720> there<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
so just keep spreading it on there to
