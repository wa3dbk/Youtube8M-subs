00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
binding go to it the same as we did two

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
binding go to it the same as we did two
or<00:01:40.160> three<00:01:40.340> cokes<00:01:42.190> keep<00:01:43.190> it<00:01:43.370> as<00:01:43.460> accurate<00:01:43.970> as

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
or three cokes keep it as accurate as

or three cokes keep it as accurate as
you<00:01:44.180> possibly<00:01:44.570> can<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.620> keep<00:01:46.400> it<00:01:46.610> down<00:01:46.730> to

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
you possibly can but keep it down to

you possibly can but keep it down to
where<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:47.390> want<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:48.550> way<00:01:49.550> you<00:01:49.580> want<00:01:49.790> my

cut in there of the brown fading to
light<00:02:14.170> midco<00:02:15.170> let's<00:02:15.380> pray<00:02:15.790> towards<00:02:16.790> the

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
light midco let's pray towards the

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.390 
light midco let's pray towards the
bottom<00:02:17.060> don't<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.630> light<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.930> too<00:02:18.290> much<00:02:18.470> because

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
bottom don't I light it too much because

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.330 
bottom don't I light it too much because
otherwise<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:20.090> gets<00:02:20.240> a<00:02:20.450> bit<00:02:21.190> smudgy<00:02:22.190> with

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
otherwise it gets a bit smudgy with

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.880 
otherwise it gets a bit smudgy with
mixed<00:02:22.700> with<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.850> brown<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:24.200> I've<00:02:24.650> only

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
mixed with the brown and so I've only

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.920 
mixed with the brown and so I've only
taken<00:02:25.100> him<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.610> i<00:02:25.670> can<00:02:25.850> make<00:02:26.000> great<00:02:26.300> there<00:02:26.510> he

taken him so i can make great there he

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.630 
taken him so i can make great there he
can<00:02:27.110> take<00:02:27.380> him<00:02:27.530> to<00:02:27.770> white<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.250> give<00:02:28.520> you<00:02:28.610> a
