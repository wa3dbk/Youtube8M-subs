the<00:01:31.850> amount<00:01:32.119> of<00:01:32.180> power<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.540> can<00:01:32.810> create<00:01:33.110> is

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
the amount of power that can create is

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.749 
the amount of power that can create is
has<00:01:35.000> to<00:01:35.180> be<00:01:35.270> seen<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.539> be<00:01:35.720> believed<00:01:36.759> we've

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
has to be seen to be believed we've

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.020 
has to be seen to be believed we've
there<00:01:37.940> traffic

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
there traffic

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.969 
there traffic
so<00:01:40.600> that<00:01:40.750> means<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.110> can't<00:01:41.320> really<00:01:41.619> see<00:01:41.830> what

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
so that means we can't really see what

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.070 
so that means we can't really see what
this<00:01:42.100> thing<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.369> do<00:01:42.700> but<00:01:43.510> it<00:01:43.630> does<00:01:43.810> mean<00:01:44.020> that

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
this thing can do but it does mean that

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160 
this thing can do but it does mean that
we're<00:01:44.440> saving<00:01:44.920> energy<00:01:45.070> there's<00:01:45.900> 151<00:01:46.900> miles

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
we're saving energy there's 151 miles

we're saving energy there's 151 miles
left<00:01:47.500> on<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:48.190> range<00:01:48.430> so<00:01:49.090> it<00:01:49.240> looks<00:01:49.270> like<00:01:49.720> we

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
left on the range so it looks like we

00:01:50.080 --> 00:02:04.730 
left on the range so it looks like we
might<00:01:50.500> just<00:01:50.860> make<00:01:51.040> it

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.570 

you<00:02:04.799> think<00:02:04.979> I<00:02:05.100> mean<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> great<00:02:05.700> guy

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
you think I mean the great guy

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:18.020 
you think I mean the great guy
or<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.300> racing<00:02:08.750> driver

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.540 

just<00:02:18.870> faster<00:02:19.290> still<00:02:19.470> I'm<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.709> is<00:02:19.860> 80<00:02:20.160> miles

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
just faster still I'm this is 80 miles

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.490 
just faster still I'm this is 80 miles
to<00:02:20.670> Heathrow<00:02:21.180> which<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> where<00:02:22.050> we<00:02:22.230> want<00:02:22.440> to

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
to Heathrow which is where we want to

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.970 
to Heathrow which is where we want to
get<00:02:22.650> off<00:02:22.800> where<00:02:23.100> we<00:02:23.130> start<00:02:23.580> on<00:02:23.700> our<00:02:23.790> journey

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
get off where we start on our journey

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.510 
get off where we start on our journey
only<00:02:25.980> 76<00:02:26.670> left<00:02:27.000> on<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.420> range<00:02:28.319> meter<00:02:28.740> our

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
only 76 left on the range meter our

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610 
only 76 left on the range meter our
battery<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> definitely<00:02:30.810> running<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.260> bit<00:02:31.440> low

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
battery is definitely running a bit low

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.390 
battery is definitely running a bit low
so

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
so

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.030 
so
who<00:02:33.939> knows<00:02:34.180> we<00:02:34.629> might<00:02:34.810> make<00:02:35.019> it<00:02:35.079> we<00:02:35.829> might<00:02:35.980> not

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
who knows we might make it we might not

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.670 
who knows we might make it we might not
if<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.220> break<00:02:39.459> down<00:02:39.959> I'm<00:02:40.959> gets<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.439> we're<00:02:41.560> going

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
if we break down I'm gets it we're going

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.880 
if we break down I'm gets it we're going
to<00:02:41.739> have<00:02:41.860> to<00:02:41.980> call<00:02:42.189> the<00:02:42.370> AAA<00:02:42.519> or<00:02:42.879> the<00:02:43.060> RAC<00:02:43.890> and
