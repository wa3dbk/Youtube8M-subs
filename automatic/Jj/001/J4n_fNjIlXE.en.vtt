00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 We should have a warm welcome 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.859
 Welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.630
 414 career mode with ac milan and me 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.929
 show you today a game against as 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.929
 rom and at the same time yes 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.310
 I answer a few questions to me 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.750
 You can also have asked me 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.180
 continue to ask questions 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.890
 that is still possible and catch 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.760
 we just go straight to the first one 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.900
 question 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.730
 it comes from the silent question who 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.520
 do you believe that the season is in the second 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.190
 bundesliga descends so where who who 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.230
 descends and in the exact you believe that 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 Nuremberg still manages to do it 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.540
 The table is from place 12 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.020
 until place 17 5 points difference so 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.210
 there is so much possible 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.129
 So that's why I do not know if you're 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.719
 that can really say so is just gone 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.570
 in the descent area you can 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.210
 definitely say five points that is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.920
 not much 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.559
 So there are seven days left 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.019
 a whole lot of points he scores 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.489
 can be distributed 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.460
 that's why I do not know if you're like that already 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 can really tell who is descending I am 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 I'm pretty sure that 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.549
 but Brunswick descends from the others 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.740
 it is all very very doubtful until 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.320
 Place twelve is definitely very, very very 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.000
 little space and therefore some of it 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.970
 probably descend Nuremberg 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.710
 Maybe you do not know hamburg 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.140
 maybe stuttgart you know it all 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 that's not how I get in the game now 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
 we are also making our descent 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.000
 namely mario mandzukic the skin on us 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.250
 it is very nice just has free 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.770
 the place makes a controlled 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.470
 Shot down right into the corner and yes 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.650
 sharp action makes perfect so 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.540
 you do that 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.300
 marco reus sends mario balotelli there 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.850
 then shoot it again 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.020
 The goalkeeper keeps but so and fifa seven 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.250
 and asked me which ones 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.410
 districts have begun 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 I think that was fifa 12 and not 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.650
 right at the beginning as you get 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.690
 Maybe you can think no but 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.460
 just before 13 came out many times is that 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.120
 not a great action because you can handle it 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.700
 can start 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.400
 yes so i am a total fifa only 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.250
 notice so and there is also directly from around 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:20.260
 through and hits the 2 0 is not 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:21.760
 nice if you like this episode that 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.350
 Definitely thumb up there that 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.490
 but it is beautiful as we here from as rom 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.520
 be taken apart 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.800
 There is nothing nicer about us 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.900
 they really have to fight with that 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.600
 get through with the positional game here 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.220
 marco reus from the super position and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.780
 shoots really stupid next to it extra 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.490
 trimmed and so on 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.700
 somehow the thing did not want to go in there 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.170
 pity really mega mega pity I would have 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.000
 I was really happy when it rang 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.180
 Unfortunately, it did not have it that way 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.860
 worked perfectly 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.420
 still a shot but directly on some 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.180
 city as long as it should have 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.920
 really can look a lot better 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.320
 and now, of course, is back from rome 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.489
 on the train with the flank in me 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.070
 try to head away 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.810
 our defender has no chance though 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.030
 you look at this in slow motion 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.340
 would you see like ours? 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.160
 Defender already with his head on the ball 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.380
 is still 1 meter during mario mandzukic 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.840
 with his head away from the ball 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.290
 and it still manages ours 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.880
 Defenders move the ball away from the nose 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.030
 Head into the gate 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.920
 it's just i dont understand it me 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.680
 do not understand this header logic 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.000
 why our defenders or anyone else 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.110
 It can not do such a header 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.549
 to get away in time 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.410
 Why does it take so long to live 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.620
 the time well managed 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.390
 Attacking is as fast as we can 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.360
 three to zero back it is on everyone 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.690
 a bit on the mega scale 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.150
 Frosted on frustrated and pissed off by 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.380
 the action in total 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.989
 well, mario balotelli is still trying here 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.970
 times with the goal and wide inside 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.780
 It's easy there is a possibility here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.389
 to do the things 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.220
 it is sometimes real as if bewitched 

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:08.680
 So there you have very strange state 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.139
 either first 30 or nothing 30 behind 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.750
 This is really amazing, my club 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.690
 evening to join in as here is the 3 1 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.959
 now here is the beginning of one 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.919
 a comeback, so to speak 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.639
 we get there ran not really 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.320
 jefferson holding the pill firmly of 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:29.470
 the pill with a dangerous 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.210
 straddling korea on marco reus the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.770
 dribble there in the defense has one 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.070
 little space shoots on the long corner 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.450
 and hits in the 80 minute to 3 2 10 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.669
 minutes are only to play here 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.280
 and of course that's always very, very 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:46.150
 little time ten minutes 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.440
 yes there is almost nothing in there but you 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.310
 just has to do a lot of pressure and 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.970
 maybe a little more now 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.010
 replacement 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.660
 that is always very nice if me 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.600
 at the Kunsthaus, and the gamer 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.270
 and asked yourself at the nets 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.560
 placer one felt already insecure 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.840
 I can say look at you 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.430
 Let's play our first let's play that on 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.350
 our old channel just youtube / 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:12.610
 vaduz and there we have ps 2011 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.130
 i played or 10 11 i believe 11 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.030
 would it have been 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.940
 and that's how I answered 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.830
 as then said the only one coming here 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.139
 to our new let's play 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.560
 I am the dammbau and that is the place 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.170
 so hello 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.350
 that's how I talked, that I know too 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.840
 not why it was really very strange 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.290
 we fight here in the place very mega 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.870
 blatant to hit once again and 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.820
 I do not know but somehow 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.490
 the lukaku is unfortunately in a very long time 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.630
 away and that's all very much 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.050
 continue to ask through more calmly 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.460
 put 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.110
 I will continue to ask diligently 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:52.140
 answer too many in a row 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:53.550
 I do not why it can be a 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:57.420
 It will take a while until the list goes down 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.370
 and after worked off and yes and 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.930
 if it would like it to me for mega 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.660
 happy if her thumb up there 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.200
 Last ask for comments 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.090
 general nature or thumbs up 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.190
 partly with your friends and so on 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.830
 and anything you can do right away 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:15.270
 Wanted to do that would be us 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.370
 definitely help and also mega 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.320
 rejoicing and complaining i think i have 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.670
 a bit over 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.750
 Other things can be talked about in this let's 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.730
 play is not that nice when 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.830
 you ask so I think there I can 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.170
 Of course, do not keep talking like big 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.880
 for example, in the beginning who will 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.830
 Maybe you can still dismount 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.360
 analyze and why will he descend 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:34.530
 so I can not make a stop directly 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.520
 but i can try such a few 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.900
 short comments to answer 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:45.240
 then it was the first time with the 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:46.830
 history yes what can there be here 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.480
 Finally, I think exactly bacardi 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.220
 He is totally dissatisfied that he is not 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.440
 plays because she has signed one 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.270
 I told myself I can play and 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.370
 What should I do there if 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:58.260
 you are in the ass because you 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.060
 national team have played and so on 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.380
 On and on he has no energy 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.460
 What should I do to them? 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.510
 then you can set it all up 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.170
 Bone breaks that's nonsense me 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:09.540
 do not understand why this so one 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:12.030
 nonsense in there have done 

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.730
 if i could out so i can make you 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:16.470
 choose 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.090
 Although it is sometimes what should you do 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.800
 do there 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.090
 oh well so I know here's something 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.350
 the tactics at the exhibition and so on 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.760
 on and on and we'll see each other 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.770
 then definitely in the next episode 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.530
 So again, you 'll be fine until the next one 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.880
 times 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.880
 that was it again for this one 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.020
 414 career mode follow with the ac milan 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.250
