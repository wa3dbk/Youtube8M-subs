00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.779
 Jesus as long as you did not have 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.439
 great teacher because you help almost two thousand 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.990
 years but warned that you will fail is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 It's true but it's always a pleasure to 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.720
 friend saw jesus 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.420
 I learned from the input that 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.790
 It happened to me in the past, and Ezekiel 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.430
 sent away telling everything 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.780
 unfortunate continuous liar doubts 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.550
 as always the same 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.550
 Forget that I'm the son of the country. 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.600
 But, okay, I forgive myself. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.340
 business is now moving forward 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:56.730
 the focus is also since forgetting 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 of a tag sounds complicated summer project 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 nowadays my robe no longer serves me 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.559
 more 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.690
 nowadays with this food 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.949
 because it's not the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.810
 same thing as that roll 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 round side of the whale I 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.290
 I could divide for 100 people 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.689
 they criticize Zinho that he sold in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.720
 Jaco was even on your street in 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.220
 with the street between the Nile River and 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.390
 red but it's more or less what it is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.689
 listening 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.689
 I think you have better yourself or if you have here. 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.609
 jesus is the son of the creator created heaven to 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.069
 land the sea 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:41.350
 the fish that swims in the sea the bird that 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:49.600
 flies how you can create what 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:56.229
 justify the manager of you and I 'll tell you 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:02:01.569
 fucking one who had the right to hold 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.119
 and I know Mary Magdalene and you who 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:06.869
 Holy crap, this Jesus, I do not know. 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.869
 it was to be a good player 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:15.390
 now look what it's about the coverage JosÃ© 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.060
 two of the cover 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.480
 because it was very positive as if it were 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.480
 the first time
