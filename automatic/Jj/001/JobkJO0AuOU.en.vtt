00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.880
 new breakfast so here I am in 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.560
 following the video 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.060
 of yesterday so you see a little in what 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.619
 state I am I did not do that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.750
 nick I could do it but it was 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.010
 just a personal choice and the only 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.300
 times when I was not we read faith 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.630
 happening you saw what we know 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.220
 shoot 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.230
 she's right there the map she's 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.619
 just right there she is huge she is super 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.119
 rebel 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:32.830
 if you want to know what it is 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.960
 direction the video of yesterday if you do it 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.160
 will not know and here we are today 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.440
 found with a new booster a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.000
 Booster of the plasma explosion series 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.559
 so obviously I already had them 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.700
 three boosters of each and we in 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.410
 still have a few tasma exhibitors 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.420
 this one is another who will come in 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.610
 the next few days and so I hope 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.840
 that he is going to be lucky I hope in everything 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.399
 case that you will bring me luck 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.539
 like the latest videos I hope 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.410
 we're going to start this week 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:55.090
 We are Monday 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.309
 there is way we are a very very 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.879
 good pick I'll stop you 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.219
 to languish 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.480
 we're gone I take this little boost 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:03.039
 yesterday not the case that is very beautiful he 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.670
 worth the trip and the 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.229
 beautiful 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.670
 I love the series that the location when 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.200
 even we talk about very nice booster 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.580
 and I am very happy 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.619
 appreciated it no more than that it was the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.270
 darse elected from this block personally 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.049
 less alone and I have always had 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.479
 good picks in the exclusions 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.890
 plasma then that's the back of a booster 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.720
 do not hesitate to pause if you 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.130
 want to read the description and as for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.080
 I have part in the opening of his cheeks 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.670
 greenhouse anyway I am very happy 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.990
 to have chosen without false plasma 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 plasma explosion for those to open 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.290
 a breakfast there these last days because 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.540
 that frankly the trap that succeeded 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.060
 greatly black and white block compared 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.130
 at the block ex y it works well it works 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.900
 very well so I'm fine 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.700
 really a very good pick at the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.479
 also saw a world if we have a rare 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.430
 it would be normal 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.470
 go we start all the booster 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.329
 day with a super when white in a 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.460
 little meadow with his baby very beautiful 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.329
 pretty family illustration she touches 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.270
 she is happy 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:54.009
 then we continue with a judo 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.350
 will crack the wii on the other hand if 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:58.299
 completely the opposite of the congo ex it 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.729
 is hot potato to do this a fight 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.890
 then we have muda snails even 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.240
 Blears are super happy super nice to 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.310
 can there be this cash 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.660
 I did a little bit of a mixture 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.360
 pokemon is super cute 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.910
 then we have a bear haring the 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.780
 plasma team and not the convenient air of 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.580
 everything we continue with 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.860
 if it is the supporters of the 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.900
 professor k telleria behind us 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.250
 will have a bow and so small that comes 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.750
 of a fossil the fossil prime 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.440
 normally by the way I think pretty 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.760
 nice card 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.740
 frankly it's a pokemon we've 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.750
 rarely seen even very rarely in the 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.100
 tcg and it's worth the trip then 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.280
 attention drum bearings the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.230
 rivers carat clients rivers it is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.120
 not bad at all it's not bad at all 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 frankly after judo cra who 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.450
 did fighting techniques 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.880
 today we have the karak they do 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.260
 haouachi of ultimate good and not bad 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.850
 arrive at the last card of the day 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.930
 what are we going to have is from 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.750
 3.2 or the lolo has not rallied all that 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.100
 thor tank in holography that I love them 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.720
 black and white series anyway 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.340
 frankly the boosters that I have 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.940
 ordered the six booster there is a 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.140
 crazy thing 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.330
 frankly I recommended at home 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.730
 in not very long huge tartan 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.810
 graphic colo has for me I believe that 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.250
 it's even the best holographic of 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.880
 7c it's a pokemon of the first 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.800
 generations 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.319
 that's for sure it's good 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.750
 trap very very good taste stark scraped 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.980
 judo crack thor tank arched to small one has 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.900
 had super nice map 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.250
 go I show you the big unbalance 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.810
 with his big guns closer 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.650
 look me how the fuck 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.239
 this illustration 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.680
 frankly a look with a look there 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.450
 like that mischievous 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.250
 I like it anyway I hope that 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.959
 this idea I will have pleased you then I 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.850
 frames and the best cards for the 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.260
 end I'm starting to have a lot of time 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.360
 next door since I seem to you all 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.190
 videos in a row 1 I meant to to 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.900
 hand so it's not obvious to me a 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.220
 big video should appear in the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.630
 week do not worry I have 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.410
 normally provided anyway at least 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.670
 a big video 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.200
 I would like to make a presentation 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.489

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.470
 exam champagne and I want to make a 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.060
 presentation images you even imagine 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.500
 not the time it takes to do in 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.150
 Anyway I hope this breakfast
