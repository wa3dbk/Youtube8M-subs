mini muffin pans and then you're just

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.420 
mini muffin pans and then you're just
going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.610> put<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.060> avocado<00:01:46.210> into<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.830> mini

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
going to put the avocado into the mini

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.700 
going to put the avocado into the mini
muffin<00:01:48.729> pans<00:01:48.909> notice<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.930> avocados<00:01:50.500> have

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
muffin pans notice the avocados have

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.230 
muffin pans notice the avocados have
Peaks<00:01:51.009> or<00:01:51.250> holes<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.610> them<00:01:51.790> if<00:01:51.940> you're<00:01:52.149> going

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
Peaks or holes in them if you're going

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.670 
Peaks or holes in them if you're going
to<00:01:52.330> leave<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:52.630> way<00:01:52.780> that's<00:01:53.259> how<00:01:53.380> it's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
to leave it that way that's how it's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.800 
to leave it that way that's how it's
going<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:53.920> look<00:01:54.040> like<00:01:54.100> when<00:01:54.610> you<00:01:54.820> freeze<00:01:55.330> it<00:01:55.540> if

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
going to look like when you freeze it if

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.840 
going to look like when you freeze it if
you<00:01:56.140> wanted<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.590> look<00:01:56.710> nicer<00:01:57.190> smooth<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.759> out

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you wanted to look nicer smooth it out

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.300 
you wanted to look nicer smooth it out
with<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> spoon<00:01:58.420> so<00:01:59.320> the<00:01:59.440> next<00:01:59.649> step<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.130> to

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
with a spoon so the next step is to

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.730 
with a spoon so the next step is to
freeze<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.880> avocado<00:02:01.360> ice<00:02:01.570> candy<00:02:01.869> so<00:02:02.590> what<00:02:02.710> I

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
freeze the avocado ice candy so what I

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.950 
freeze the avocado ice candy so what I
did<00:02:02.860> was<00:02:03.250> wrap<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:03.759> foil<00:02:04.030> so<00:02:04.450> it<00:02:04.479> doesn't

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
did was wrap it in foil so it doesn't

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.529 
did was wrap it in foil so it doesn't
get<00:02:05.050> anything<00:02:05.320> in<00:02:05.740> it<00:02:05.920> or<00:02:06.190> freezer<00:02:06.940> burns<00:02:07.210> I

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
get anything in it or freezer burns I

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.990 
get anything in it or freezer burns I
froze<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.140> overnight<00:02:08.649> but<00:02:08.920> I<00:02:09.250> checked<00:02:09.550> for

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
froze it overnight but I checked for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.390 
froze it overnight but I checked for
hours<00:02:10.479> after<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.230> put<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.650> in<00:02:11.769> the<00:02:11.860> freezer<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
hours after I put it in the freezer and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.370 
hours after I put it in the freezer and
it<00:02:12.730> was<00:02:12.910> pretty<00:02:13.150> solid<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:13.959> if<00:02:14.080> I<00:02:14.200> use<00:02:14.350> a

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
it was pretty solid so if I use a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.199 
it was pretty solid so if I use a
smaller<00:02:14.769> container<00:02:15.280> for<00:02:15.519> the<00:02:15.550> ice<00:02:15.760> candy

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
smaller container for the ice candy

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.449 
smaller container for the ice candy
it<00:02:16.390> would<00:02:16.480> only<00:02:16.720> probably<00:02:17.019> take<00:02:17.230> 4<00:02:17.530> hours<00:02:17.680> but

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
it would only probably take 4 hours but

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.160 
it would only probably take 4 hours but
if<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.880> larger<00:02:19.360> container<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:20.110> will

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
if you use a larger container it will

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:27.120 
if you use a larger container it will
take<00:02:20.590> overnight<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.310> freeze<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:26.830> next

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
take overnight to freeze the next

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.710 
take overnight to freeze the next
morning<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.489> took<00:02:27.550> out<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.970> avocados<00:02:28.480> from<00:02:28.630> the

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720

morning I took out the avocados from the
freezer<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:32.739> is<00:02:32.920> how<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.220> looks<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:35.549> so

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
freezer and this is how it looks like so

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.759 
freezer and this is how it looks like so
how<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> remove<00:02:37.299> the<00:02:37.570> avocados<00:02:38.200> from<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.560> mini

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769

muffin pan I dipped it in water for

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.100 
muffin pan I dipped it in water for
about<00:02:40.890> 5<00:02:41.890> seconds<00:02:42.610> um<00:02:43.180> that<00:02:43.570> actually<00:02:43.930> was<00:02:44.079> a

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
about 5 seconds um that actually was a

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.420 
about 5 seconds um that actually was a
little<00:02:44.380> bit<00:02:44.470> too<00:02:44.620> long<00:02:44.769> probably<00:02:45.070> three

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
little bit too long probably three

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.370 
little bit too long probably three
seconds<00:02:45.820> is<00:02:45.910> good<00:02:46.060> enough<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.600> then<00:02:47.140> I<00:02:47.230> just

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
seconds is good enough and then I just

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.590 
seconds is good enough and then I just
took<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> fork<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.370> look<00:02:48.700> how<00:02:48.940> easy<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.420> was<00:02:49.570> to
