down arm got it in the up position and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.000 
down arm got it in the up position and
it's<00:00:49.280> recording<00:00:50.260> and<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.350> have<00:00:51.500> tested<00:00:51.769> the

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
it's recording and I have tested the

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
recording the autofocus works the zoom

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.639 
recording the autofocus works the zoom
works<00:00:55.570> although<00:00:56.570> it's<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:57.019> very<00:00:57.670> archaic<00:00:58.670> old

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
works although it's a very archaic old

technology zooming in and zooming out is

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.440 
technology zooming in and zooming out is
very<00:01:03.920> slow<00:01:04.369> just<00:01:05.300> how<00:01:05.449> it's<00:01:05.690> designed<00:01:07.450> and

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
very slow just how it's designed and

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.540 
very slow just how it's designed and
will<00:01:09.140> it<00:01:09.259> stop<00:01:09.590> or<00:01:10.990> stop<00:01:11.990> recording<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.250> for

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
will it stop or stop recording and for

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.900 
will it stop or stop recording and for
the<00:01:13.610> button<00:01:14.619> turn<00:01:15.619> on<00:01:15.800> the<00:01:16.039> VTR<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.830> I'll<00:01:19.729> use

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
the button turn on the VTR and I'll use

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.300 
the button turn on the VTR and I'll use
the<00:01:20.090> remote<00:01:20.390> control<00:01:20.899> to<00:01:21.490> rewind<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:24.310> yeah

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
the remote control to rewind it yeah

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.779 
the remote control to rewind it yeah
it's<00:01:25.520> got<00:01:25.729> a<00:01:25.759> remote<00:01:26.060> control<00:01:26.119> and<00:01:27.789> the

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
it's got a remote control and the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.290 
it's got a remote control and the
wireless<00:01:29.210> remote<00:01:29.420> control<00:01:29.570> box<00:01:31.030> I'm<00:01:32.030> sure

wireless remote control box I'm sure

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.060 
wireless remote control box I'm sure
that<00:01:32.479> was<00:01:32.630> an<00:01:32.780> added<00:01:33.020> accessory<00:01:33.649> that<00:01:33.679> didn't

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
that was an added accessory that didn't

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.440 
that was an added accessory that didn't
come<00:01:34.220> with<00:01:34.399> this<00:01:34.490> initially<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.520> we<00:01:38.030> hit<00:01:38.149> play

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
come with this initially and we hit play

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.690 
come with this initially and we hit play
and<00:01:40.840> it's<00:01:41.840> playing<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.409> did<00:01:42.590> review<00:01:43.520> the

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
and it's playing and I did review the

and it's playing and I did review the
play<00:01:43.909> through<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.509> television<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.439> it's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
play through the television and it's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.420

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.039 

it's<00:02:04.320> certainly<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:05.429> a<00:02:05.490> fast<00:02:05.880> fast<00:02:06.509> forward

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049

it's certainly not a fast fast forward
nor<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.220> fast<00:02:08.610> rewind<00:02:09.379> but<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.470> does

nor is that a fast rewind but it does
