00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
 and of course are already in dutch 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.180
 very many of his beautiful short 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.619
 stories appeared as short stories 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.449
 write 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.329
 jean forever compared to czech 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.850
 or has the same melancholy 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.559
 humorous approach as chef or zelda 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.700
 sadness 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.360
 and there comes on seeing something 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.579
 bee had a wonderfully beautiful poetic 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.690
 elegant style and come really beautiful 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.579
 write 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.340
 therefore it was surprising that 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.710
 his debut from 1957 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.840
 his first novel so never in it 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.090
 dutch no wax but that shift 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 is now well made and now it is suffering 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.350
 the webshop chronicle 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.110
 in the Dutch chronicle of the family 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.090
 webshop are in front of us 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.490
 incomprehensible until a book never before 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.030
 appeared because this is one of his 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.640
 all the most beautiful and all the best books 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.890
 incredibly funny and witty and one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.090
 Buddhist of course is not a novel 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.680
 in one piece 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 they are actually short stories 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.700
 are strung together because they 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.460
 all are about the same main character 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.189
 a nonsense of a father in just one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.659
 bit on a river around two suggests 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.090
 sons who actually have a little bit 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.400
 idlers are his natural defenses 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.710
 two brothers, or rather himself who came 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.390
 from a family of two brothers 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 it's all autobiographical and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.259
 mother runs a small shop and then 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.159
 there is also an aunt in the background 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.469
 aunt om bora that everything 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.079
 launches because family itself who can 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.060
 provide no means of support 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.340
 is full of the owner so the stories 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.219
 for example off and aunt at lake sunset 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.560
 suffering is in the garden for carrots 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.420
 and always get up and down 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.909
 behavior prevent root 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.000
 which she says he looks like the 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.860
 noble parts of her husband blessed 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.260
 and with that carrot then go to 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.599
 an old maid and tell that old one 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.250
 freeman look that looks like that 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.230
 Well good that you finally agree 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.959
 see what that looks like this looks like 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.500
 that there is so that book full of most 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.480
 funny entertaining the peculiar 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.610
 wonderful stories a little 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.220
 margins of American society 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.230
 a whole different world than that from 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.640
 other novels are used to 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.640
 is really beautiful
