00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
so we're going to work on the jawbone

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.769 
so we're going to work on the jawbone
now<00:00:03.890> we<00:00:04.890> store<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.190> lot<00:00:05.460> of<00:00:05.490> stress<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.569> tension

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.910 
now we store a lot of stress and tension
in<00:00:07.410> our<00:00:07.770> jaws<00:00:08.540> biting<00:00:09.540> down<00:00:09.719> our<00:00:09.990> jaws<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.710> lot

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
small circles with my fingers small

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.220 
small circles with my fingers small
circles<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.629> starting<00:00:43.200> at<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:44.480> just<00:00:45.480> just

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
circles just starting at the just just

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.260 
circles just starting at the just just
below<00:00:46.590> her<00:00:47.960> earlobes<00:00:49.399> it's<00:00:50.399> hard<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.760> see

below her earlobes it's hard to see
where<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.449> am<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:51.930> angle<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:56.120> we<00:00:57.120> hold<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
where I am at this angle but we hold a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
where I am at this angle but we hold a
lot<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.989> our<00:00:58.440> jaw<00:00:59.629> so<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.719> starting<00:01:01.199> here<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
lot in our jaw so I'm starting here and

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
lot in our jaw so I'm starting here and
I'm<00:01:02.640> working<00:01:03.059> my<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:03.870> down

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I'm working my way all the way down

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.760 
I'm working my way all the way down
towards<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.890> chin<00:01:05.750> slow<00:01:06.750> circle<00:01:07.380> slow

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
towards the chin slow circle slow

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.179 
towards the chin slow circle slow
circles<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.549> lose<00:01:09.540> circle<00:01:10.049> here<00:01:10.530> move<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> a

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
circles so lose circle here move to a

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.740 
circles so lose circle here move to a
point<00:01:11.490> here<00:01:11.780> move<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> point<00:01:13.380> here<00:01:14.299> about<00:01:15.299> 4

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
point here move to a point here about 4

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.219 
point here move to a point here about 4
or<00:01:15.780> 5<00:01:15.930> points<00:01:16.409> until<00:01:16.860> you<00:01:17.009> get<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> chin

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
or 5 points until you get to the chin

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.660 
or 5 points until you get to the chin
depending<00:01:19.229> how<00:01:20.180> big<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> jaws<00:01:22.310> but<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.490> is

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
depending how big the jaws but this is

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.770 
depending how big the jaws but this is
this<00:01:24.060> tends<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.540> be<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:26.210> greatest<00:01:27.210> culprit

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this tends to be the greatest culprit

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.609 
this tends to be the greatest culprit
right<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:29.280> first<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.530> before<00:01:31.530> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
right here the first one just before it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.060 
right here the first one just before it
makes<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.009> turn<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.670> be<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> straight<00:01:33.150> line

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
makes that turn to be a straight line

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.319 
makes that turn to be a straight line
that<00:01:35.070> jaw<00:01:35.460> muscle<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.759> hold<00:01:39.090> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
that jaw muscle you can actually hold it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.560 
that jaw muscle you can actually hold it
there<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.810> while<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.729> just<00:01:41.729> increase<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
there for a while and just increase the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.910 
there for a while and just increase the
pressure<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.649> ever<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.250> slightly<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.920> I'm

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
pressure just ever so slightly so I'm

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
pressure just ever so slightly so I'm
pushing<00:01:47.640> up<00:01:47.820> I'm<00:01:48.360> pushing<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:48.930> towards<00:01:49.259> the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pushing up I'm pushing up towards the

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.130 
pushing up I'm pushing up towards the
ceiling

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.910 

freeze<00:01:56.540> so<00:01:57.540> I'm<00:01:57.600> moving<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> jaw<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
freeze so I'm moving down the jaw a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:18.960 
freeze so I'm moving down the jaw a
little<00:01:59.520> further<00:01:59.730> down<00:02:02.780> it<00:02:03.780> feels<00:02:04.050> really<00:02:04.350> good

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.410 

and<00:02:19.510> when<00:02:19.630> you<00:02:19.690> get<00:02:19.810> down<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.410> chin<00:02:21.420> we're

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
and when you get down to the chin we're

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.170 
and when you get down to the chin we're
going<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.750> move<00:02:22.960> to<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.350> chin<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:24.180> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
going to move to the chin here and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.960 
going to move to the chin here and
create<00:02:25.540> a<00:02:25.600> little<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:26.080> of<00:02:26.140> pressure<00:02:26.970> right

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
create a little bit of pressure right

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.150 
create a little bit of pressure right
here<00:02:28.270> at<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.450> chin<00:02:28.750> these<00:02:29.530> two<00:02:29.860> little

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
here at the chin these two little

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.920 
here at the chin these two little
dimples<00:02:30.600> that<00:02:31.600> go<00:02:31.810> underneath<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.560> chin<00:02:32.860> bone

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
dimples that go underneath the chin bone

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.840 
dimples that go underneath the chin bone
and<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:35.170> hold<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.850> place<00:02:36.850> right<00:02:37.150> there<00:02:38.850> you

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
and just hold that place right there you

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.260 
and just hold that place right there you
can<00:02:40.000> even<00:02:40.270> smooth<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.230> out<00:02:42.090> starting<00:02:43.090> at<00:02:43.180> the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
can even smooth it out starting at the

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.340 
can even smooth it out starting at the
center<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.840> moving<00:02:44.350> outward

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.250 

we're<00:02:50.350> leaving<00:02:50.740> whatever<00:02:51.840> tension<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:52.990> hold

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
we're leaving whatever tension we hold

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.400 
we're leaving whatever tension we hold
in<00:02:53.500> our<00:02:53.620> jaw<00:02:54.610> on<00:02:54.850> our<00:02:55.030> chin<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.720> when<00:03:01.900> we<00:03:02.020> return

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
in our jaw on our chin so when we return

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.880 
in our jaw on our chin so when we return
I'll<00:03:02.740> resume<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.220> work<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.640> face
