00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:12.490
 good again all 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:14.709
 dispute the ball between me it seems that 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.180
 did not apply the regulation as not 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.270
 applied the referee is court for the 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.700
 good and for bad 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.370
 hits the great referee in the face 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.370
 shameful but can not find a region 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.340
 there is some kind of surgery they say so that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.829
 brought you a fan of this section of 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.739
 Nicolas friends is what this is for 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.899
 will have to see this has been that sometimes 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.079
 old age for another time is for others 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.120
 yes Carlos says good if it can happen to 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.829
 the best ones we do not even go to ramón and 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.879
 the ramón campaign forgive I want 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.879
 of real garcilaso 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.690
 and it helped a lot 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:59.340
 itches before me I love the way 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.860
 defender was 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.290
 very high quality and gareth bale in the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.140
 definition a match is integrated 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.320
 hot intense as intuitive but not 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.320
 a product 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.610
 regards 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.789
 florence 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.430
 that has happened 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.020
 because there you can underestimate the 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.160
 effort made by players 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:44.550
 everything was played upside down 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:48.360
 so that the much demanded 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.230
 so obviously it's not good for 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.110
 no one 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.260
 against nobody ever like this 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.280
 I saw torrico go for oil tanker 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.410
 marked with the strongest shirt 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.220
 in his own goal 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:04.510
 look modest 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.510
 what letter 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.930
 they were with a player is terrible 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:18.350
 because I take it out but it matters there 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.350
 If I hear something, it makes reference 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.310
 so 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.960
 it's fine not terrible but good in the 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.850
 horrible exit and then with the bow 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.220
 Vaca Rafael Lopez loses it for the 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.270
 belenenses 0 academic 0 1 for you 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.050
 suit 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.050
 and now 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.930
 staying with feeling too little 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.640
 with the bow only loses Luis Carlos 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.640
 ruiz for junior 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.540
 and this I cracked the mir in the past to 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.950
 pay against 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:08.140
 a team that in the face of diversity 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:08.140
 crumble chest is amazing 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.180
 luqueño against in the goal in favor of 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.820
 national in for the Paraguayan league and 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.160
 the number 1 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.590
 what does 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.680
 If something is not determined alone 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.989
 I just do not know if the house will want them 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.989
 also to the last terminal only 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.620
