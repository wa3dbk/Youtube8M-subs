 after bought a cupid it 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.460
 need no two days 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.369
 this way the fish meat will become harder 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.369
 and the taste will be special 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.960
 the second secret is 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.530
 fish dressing 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.400
 we start the bridge 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730
 share usually does started with head 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.050
 I understand now that it was wrong 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.050
 you can start with the bridge yes right 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.590
 the task is cut along the spine yes 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.439
 slowly cut the fish along 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.290
 spine 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.960
 and then cut it into two halves 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.090
 when it comes to the head like this 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.680
 cut into the head with a knife 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.060
 we cut the year of the end 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.990
 yes cut to the end 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.610
 these two halves we call the male and 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.359
 female 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.689
 part of the spine is a male without 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:15.859
 spine it myself 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.549
 her husband's fish was cut 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.749
 now the male and female need to be cut further 

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:21.969
 six pieces 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.629
 to the station in the place where the meat is more tightly we 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.229
 do on the segment 

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.099
 why do we do it 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:29.969
 while cooking fish 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.239
 cooked evenly 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.479
 at the start we make 5 addresses 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:37.969
 first two cuts 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.899
 make grandfather the end 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:42.489
 third cut 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.039
 we cut the fish to the end 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:46.629
 This is the second Andreev 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.969
 yes second 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:50.989
 the distance between the chairs should be 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.689
 the same 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.779
 remember the same yes 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:58.779
 This is for beauty guys 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.479
 during the third of November for repairs 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 design to the end exactly 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.989
 on the remaining half doing again 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.049
 two by three meters 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.470
 yes after the fish is ready 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.989
 she will have a very beautiful shape 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.819
 besides, she is better soaked 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.759
 seasoning main purpose 

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:20.169
 so on will be including Mongolia 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.029
 and males do not need to pump 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:23.200
 right not to 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.250
 if you cut it after boiling it 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.459
 will be ugly shape 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.909
 but in order to cook this dish 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.799
 saline stands 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:32.809
 true this is the third secret why is it 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:33.689
 is done 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.159
 because we will talk about support 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.209
 after the water boils we request 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.719
 fish in the pan 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.979
 the fish did not feed for two days therefore the meat 

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.859
 ready to cook 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.539
 during cooking we add a little 

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:49.539
 empire to make fish meat more delicious 

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:53.069
 fish should be lowered only when water 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.209
 boils 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.109
 when we drop fish 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:59.109
 you need to put the pieces together 

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:07.619
 we lower 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.399
 and how much to cook before 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:13.409
 shoot fire 3 4 minutes 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.659
 anya 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:16.979
 if the fish polish about that you can cook and 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.599
 more 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:21.879
 so three minutes went by look at our 

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.590
 century can be understood 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.699
 but in the meantime shot down part 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.580
 happy to leave a little on the post 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.900
 reserve 150 milliliters of fish 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:31.979
 broth 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.979
 further add rice wine 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.009
 will be saved 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.419
 soy sauce 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:43.620
 sprinkle 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.610
 now both tastes 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.460
 favorite rights 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.110
 turned out beautifully 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.280
 look further boiled fish by 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.379
 quarters set aside for 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:54.059
 a plate 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.649
 and then we start to engage the sun for 

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:59.649
 start we lost it 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.840
 the fourth secret of our spit 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.259
 is cooking 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.379
 no sweet and sour sauce 

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:11.379
 the main thing to add sugar 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.779
 and soy sauce 

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:17.490
 proportion should be 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.610
 one 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.419
 half of them half 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.419
 that is, sugar as well 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.379
 low-salt garden 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.020
 and a half of vinegar 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:46.400
 now we consider this foul 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.029
 broth in which the mode was brewed 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.029
 yes this is the fifth secret of our dish 

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:59.359
 already gone bubbles means it's time 

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.930
 turn on the fire 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.680
 began to boil excerpts appeared 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.330
 note 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:08.800
 so turn off the fire add starch 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.340
 as soon as the map was added 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.300
 how little it was made to me immediately 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.419
 exactly 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:16.669
 she immediately became very thick because 6 years 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.610
 very beautiful songs and poems 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.059
