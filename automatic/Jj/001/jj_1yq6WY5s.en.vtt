00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.640
Insurgent kicks off in the bright, rustic
world of the Amity faction, with its huge

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.960
meadow and earth-tone colour palette, but
don’t let that fool you: Insurgent is darker

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:15.610
in tone, and ultimately a more satisfying
movie, than the first film in the Divergent

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.610
series.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.800
Set in a futuristic dystopian Chicago, whose
citizens are divided into 5 factions according

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.619
to personalities and preferences, Insurgent
follows Tris and her allies as they’re hunted

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.370
down because they’re Divergent, in other
words, they have traits of multiple factions,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.250
which means they’re considered a threat.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.090
Based on Veronica Roth’s best-selling novels,
Insurgent continues the world-building of

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.750
the movie Divergent, introducing new factions,
each of which is cleverly designed to convey

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.400
the different traits of its people.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.300
So, the peaceful Amity faction is kinda hippie
and inspired by nature; the honest Candor

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.250
faction is all glass and mirrors; and the
Factionless is a hodge-podge of influences.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.760
Just as in Divergent, there’s good performances
all round, with the young cast matching their

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.540
more experienced colleagues.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.640
Shailene Woodley is a phenomenal young actress.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.680
She completely blew me away the first time
I saw her as George Clooney’s on-screen

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.790
daughter in The Descendants, and she continues
to light up the big screen in this movie.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.700
There’s just something very truthful and
very natural about her acting.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.090
One thing I could live without in the character
of Tris though – and this has got nothing

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.240
to do with Woodley’s performance – is
the number of times she needs to be rescued,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.500
particularly by her on-screen boyfriend, Four.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.450
Still, Woodley and Theo James, who plays Four,
continue to share a decent on-screen chemistry.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.869
Apart from a small role in Downton Abbey,
so far I’ve only seen James in The Divergent

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.640
Series, but he brings an intensity to the
role of Four.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.380
By the way, does anyone else think he looks
like a young Moritz Bleibtreu, the German

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.060
actor from Run Lola Run and Munich?

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.310
Ansel Elgort gets to add some ambiguity to
his portrayal of Tris’s brother Caleb in

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.380
this movie.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.470
And Miles Teller is also back as the incredibly
cocky and smart-mouthed Peter.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.950
Teller’s another brilliant young actor,
who I’ve been a fan of since I saw him opposite

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.110
Nicole Kidman in the movie Rabbit Hole.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.780
And he does some spot-on work here again,
adding a nice touch of humour to the film.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.360
Jai Courtney only has one note to play as
the vicious Dauntless leader Eric, but he

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.909
does a good job of being suitably menacing,
to the point that you really detest his character.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.249
In fact, Courtney’s performance in this
film and Divergent almost makes me forgive

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:27.969
him for Die Hard 5… only almost though ‘cause
I don’t know if I’m ever really gonna

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:33.090
be able to forgive anyone for sullying the
good name of Die Hard with that colossal crock

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.090
of crap.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.609
Kate Winslet may not have the most multi-dimensional
character to work with, but she plays the

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.139
cold and calculating Jeanine well.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:45.310
Given what a great actress she is, I was a
bit disappointed that Octavia Spencer didn’t

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.459
have more to do as the Amity leader, Johanna.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.280
And Naomi Watts keeps us wondering about her
character Evelyn, the Factionless leader.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.609
The movie maintains a nice pace throughout.

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.749
And if you’re looking for action, Insurgent
really ramps that up, compared to the first

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.989
film in the series, with some great, big action
set-pieces.

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.930
Expect speeding trains, shoot-outs, chase
scenes, close-quarters combat, zip-lining,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.930
and much more.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.129
As for the film’s visual effects, they’re
pretty amazing.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.969
The simulated worlds that Tris has to enter
as a test are really attention-grabbing and

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.329
well-realised.

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.489
And at times, the filmmakers skilfully blur
the line between reality and fantasy, upping

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.510
the tension and keeping us guessing.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.370
Ok, so, Insurgent does share familiar beats
with other dystopian YA movies we’ve seen

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.760
over the last few years, like The Hunger Games
and The Maze Runner, and a few plot points

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.409
do feel reminiscent of the first film in the
series, Divergent.

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.409
Insurgent isn’t ground-breaking in terms
of plot or dialogue, so you don’t need to

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.799
have read Veronica Roth’s books to know
where the movie’s headed more or less throughout.

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.409
But if you got on board with the movie Divergent,
Insurgent does make for perfectly entertaining

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.739
viewing thanks to its cast, action, visual
effects, and darker tone.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.089
So, to sum up: Insurgent is a satisfyingly
dark journey into the expanded world of the

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:09.419
Divergent series with good performances, lots
of action and top-notch visual effects.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:13.339
Insurgent gets 3.5 out of 5 Flicks.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:15.260
What did you think of Insurgent?

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.549
Have you read the books?

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.389
And if so, what do you think of how they’ve
been adapted?

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.180
And what are you looking forward to about
the final movies in the series, Allegiant?
