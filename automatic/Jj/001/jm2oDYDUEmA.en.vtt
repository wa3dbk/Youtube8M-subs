00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we are going to see how to measure the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.530 
we are going to see how to measure the
armhole<00:00:15.930> and<00:00:16.110> how<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:16.980> cut<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.730> armhole<00:00:18.360> and

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
armhole and how to cut the armhole and

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.310 
armhole and how to cut the armhole and
for<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:20.130> bought<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.940> model<00:00:21.510> today<00:00:21.840> that's

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
for that I bought a model today that's

my daughter and she's going to help me
in<00:00:26.010> taking<00:00:26.610> the<00:00:26.820> measurement<00:00:27.390> on<00:00:27.630> her<00:00:28.200> and<00:00:28.640> say

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
in taking the measurement on her and say

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.840 
in taking the measurement on her and say
hi<00:00:31.520> okay<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.600> let's<00:00:33.600> get<00:00:33.750> started<00:00:33.949> see<00:00:34.949> we<00:00:35.699> are

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
hi okay so let's get started see we are

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
hi okay so let's get started see we are
before<00:00:36.330> measuring<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> armhole<00:00:37.559> make<00:00:37.800> sure

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
before measuring the armhole make sure

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040 
before measuring the armhole make sure
you<00:00:38.280> keep<00:00:38.580> place<00:00:38.850> your<00:00:39.090> hand<00:00:39.330> like<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.600> and

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you keep place your hand like this and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.210 
you keep place your hand like this and
you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.370> see<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:42.269> stretch<00:00:43.080> line<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.650> your

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
you can see the stretch line of your

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.509 
you can see the stretch line of your
garment<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:45.659> place<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.170> tape<00:00:46.440> exactly<00:00:47.159> on<00:00:47.280> top

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
garment so place the tape exactly on top

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.140 
garment so place the tape exactly on top
of<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.210> starting<00:00:48.720> from<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:49.229> and

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
of that that is starting from one and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.229 
of that that is starting from one and
just<00:00:51.150> run<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.930> tape<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.040> center<00:00:53.640> point<00:00:54.000> of

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
just run the tape at the center point of

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.299 
just run the tape at the center point of
the<00:00:54.600> armhole<00:00:55.019> so<00:00:55.290> you're<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:55.800> you'd<00:00:56.100> be

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the armhole so you're also you'd be

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.689 
the armhole so you're also you'd be
having<00:00:56.580> the<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> switch<00:00:59.070> line<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
having the the switch line of the

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.899 
having the the switch line of the
garment<00:01:00.120> so<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.960> make<00:01:01.890> sure<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.670> into

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
garment so just make sure you get into

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:05.840 
garment so just make sure you get into
that<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:04.110> halfway<00:01:04.379> is<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.370> be<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that so the halfway is going to be the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.600 
that so the halfway is going to be the
six<00:01:06.180> inches<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.620> arm<00:01:07.799> holds<00:01:08.370> true

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
six inches so the arm holds true

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.940 
six inches so the arm holds true
measurement<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.960> six<00:01:10.350> inches

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
measurement is going to be six inches

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.450 
measurement is going to be six inches
now<00:01:11.659> so<00:01:12.659> if<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:12.990> don't<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.979> exact

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
now so if you don't know the exact

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.550 
now so if you don't know the exact
midpoint<00:01:14.789> of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.539> harm<00:01:15.810> hole<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.530> have

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
midpoint of the harm hole you have

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
midpoint of the harm hole you have
another<00:01:17.070> way<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.969> place<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.450> hand<00:01:18.719> like

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
another way just place your hand like

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.300 
another way just place your hand like
this<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.399> run<00:01:20.399> your<00:01:20.640> tape<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.100> take<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this and run your tape in and take the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.389 
this and run your tape in and take the
full<00:01:23.670> measurement

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:25.399 
full measurement

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:28.450 
full measurement
of<00:01:25.549> your<00:01:26.240> unwhole<00:01:26.689> this<00:01:26.990> is<00:01:27.140> going<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.740> be<00:01:27.920> 12

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
of your unwhole this is going to be 12

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.080 
of your unwhole this is going to be 12
inches

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
inches

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.120 
inches
however<00:01:29.479> enough<00:01:29.840> space<00:01:30.200> to<00:01:30.439> move<00:01:30.710> your<00:01:30.890> hand

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
however enough space to move your hand

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.109 
however enough space to move your hand
is<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.700> tight<00:01:32.179> circle<00:01:33.100> okay<00:01:34.100> see<00:01:34.429> now<00:01:34.609> it's<00:01:35.060> not

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
is a tight circle okay see now it's not

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.840 
is a tight circle okay see now it's not
too<00:01:35.450> tight<00:01:35.719> so<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.380> should<00:01:36.560> be<00:01:36.710> like<00:01:36.920> that<00:01:36.950> so

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
too tight so it should be like that so

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.539 
too tight so it should be like that so
this<00:01:38.210> is<00:01:38.329> 12<00:01:38.630> inches<00:01:38.869> so<00:01:39.109> when<00:01:39.469> you<00:01:39.619> divide<00:01:39.979> 12

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
this is 12 inches so when you divide 12

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.199 
this is 12 inches so when you divide 12
by<00:01:40.700> 2<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.600> going<00:01:41.899> to<00:01:42.079> be<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.409> 6<00:01:42.770> inches<00:01:43.399> so

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
by 2 it's going to be the 6 inches so

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:46.630 
by 2 it's going to be the 6 inches so
after<00:01:44.630> measuring<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.289> armhole<00:01:45.860> you're<00:01:46.369> going

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
after measuring the armhole you're going

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.149 
after measuring the armhole you're going
to<00:01:46.819> measure<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:47.450> chest<00:01:47.810> let's<00:01:48.409> run<00:01:48.679> the<00:01:48.890> tape

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
to measure the chest let's run the tape

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.330 
to measure the chest let's run the tape
in<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.789> take<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.990> chest<00:01:51.619> measurement<00:01:52.219> that

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
in and take the chest measurement that

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.099 
in and take the chest measurement that
is<00:01:52.399> going<00:01:52.909> to<00:01:53.119> be<00:01:53.409> 24<00:01:54.409> inches<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:55.729> 24<00:01:56.420> inches<00:01:56.869> is

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
is going to be 24 inches so 24 inches is

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:00.039 
is going to be 24 inches so 24 inches is
the<00:01:57.289> exact<00:01:57.799> measurement<00:01:58.459> I'm<00:01:59.000> going<00:01:59.750> to<00:01:59.869> add

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
the exact measurement I'm going to add

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.949 
the exact measurement I'm going to add
or<00:02:00.380> 2<00:02:00.709> inches<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.459> that<00:02:01.670> so<00:02:02.179> it's<00:02:02.390> going<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.750> be

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
or 2 inches to that so it's going to be

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:07.749 
or 2 inches to that so it's going to be
26<00:02:03.530> inches<00:02:04.039> so<00:02:04.670> 26<00:02:05.270> inches<00:02:05.750> divided<00:02:06.679> by<00:02:06.979> 4<00:02:07.489> is

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
26 inches so 26 inches divided by 4 is

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.699 
26 inches so 26 inches divided by 4 is
going<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.479> be<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:09.079> exact<00:02:09.819> measurement<00:02:11.709> okay

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
going to be the exact measurement okay

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.199 
going to be the exact measurement okay
and<00:02:12.950> see<00:02:13.670> if<00:02:13.910> you<00:02:14.209> want<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:16.610> coming<00:02:17.000> the

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.490 
would be to the maximum of twenty six
point<00:04:41.830> six<00:04:42.830> point<00:04:43.130> five<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.729> six<00:04:44.060> point<00:04:44.390> six<00:04:44.840> so

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
point six point five to six point six so

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.650 
point six point five to six point six so
this<00:04:45.710> is<00:04:45.890> going<00:04:46.220> to<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.790> exact<00:04:47.270> chest
