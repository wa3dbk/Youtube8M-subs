so today we're really excited to
introduce<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.530> family<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.490> radiofrequency

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
introduce the family of radiofrequency

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.220 
introduce the family of radiofrequency
treatments<00:00:16.439> by<00:00:16.800> thermi<00:00:17.250> RF<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:18.419> fantastic<00:00:19.110> a

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
treatments by thermi RF the fantastic a

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.960 
treatments by thermi RF the fantastic a
thing<00:00:19.410> about<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.950> thermi<00:00:20.279> RF<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:20.820> we're

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
thing about the thermi RF that we're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.999 
thing about the thermi RF that we're
really<00:00:21.270> pleased<00:00:21.689> about<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.349> direct

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:23.009 
really pleased about it is direct

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.460 
really pleased about it is direct
science<00:00:23.669> of<00:00:23.820> heat<00:00:24.000> it<00:00:24.450> allows<00:00:24.779> us<00:00:25.110> to<00:00:25.260> once

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
science of heat it allows us to once

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
science of heat it allows us to once
again<00:00:25.619> deliver<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.580> heat<00:00:26.760> underneath<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
again deliver the heat underneath the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.720 
again deliver the heat underneath the
skin<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.500> small<00:00:28.859> pinpoint<00:00:29.460> there<00:00:29.640> is

financial responsibilities is about the
half<00:01:20.609> of<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.909> cost<00:01:21.179> of<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> facelift<00:01:21.929> if<00:01:22.140> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
half of the cost of a facelift if you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
half of the cost of a facelift if you
will<00:01:22.469> there<00:01:22.950> are<00:01:23.039> several<00:01:23.369> treatments<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.000> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
will there are several treatments on the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.849 
will there are several treatments on the
market<00:01:24.749> that<00:01:24.869> use<00:01:25.109> external<00:01:25.799> energy<00:01:26.789> othera

00:01:27.849 --> 00:01:27.859 
market that use external energy othera

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:30.830 
market that use external energy othera
Thermage<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:29.280> essentially<00:01:30.149> they're<00:01:30.359> betting

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
Thermage and essentially they're betting

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.109 
Thermage and essentially they're betting
on<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> fact<00:01:31.649> that<00:01:31.859> the<00:01:32.159> heat<00:01:32.399> and<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> warmth

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
on the fact that the heat and the warmth

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.760 
on the fact that the heat and the warmth
from<00:01:33.179> the<00:01:33.390> outside<00:01:33.899> will<00:01:34.109> get<00:01:34.259> down<00:01:34.469> deep

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
from the outside will get down deep

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.219 
from the outside will get down deep
enough<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> cause<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> contraction<00:01:36.270> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
enough to cause a contraction the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.749 
enough to cause a contraction the
difference<00:01:37.649> is<00:01:37.799> by<00:01:38.039> putting<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.579> heat

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
difference is by putting the heat

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
difference is by putting the heat
directly<00:01:39.270> underneath<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.719> skin<00:01:40.079> we<00:01:40.380> get<00:01:40.530> a

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
directly underneath the skin we get a

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.819 
directly underneath the skin we get a
great<00:01:40.979> contraction<00:01:41.819> and<00:01:42.689> more<00:01:43.229> importantly<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
great contraction and more importantly a

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.730 
great contraction and more importantly a
much<00:01:44.280> more<00:01:44.579> consistent<00:01:45.149> product<00:01:45.929> that<00:01:46.289> we<00:01:46.530> can

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
much more consistent product that we can

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.950 
much more consistent product that we can
actually<00:01:47.039> deliver<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> client<00:01:48.509> who<00:01:48.929> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
actually deliver to the client who is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.749 
actually deliver to the client who is
going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.439> be<00:01:49.530> much<00:01:49.890> more<00:01:50.100> pleased<00:01:50.399> with<00:01:50.429> the

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
going to be much more pleased with the

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.059 
going to be much more pleased with the
end<00:01:50.880> result<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.630> lot<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.049> my<00:01:52.139> folks<00:01:52.409> ask<00:01:52.649> me<00:01:52.859> hey

end result a lot of my folks ask me hey

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.520 
end result a lot of my folks ask me hey
will<00:01:53.819> this<00:01:54.210> really<00:01:54.749> because<00:01:55.200> there's<00:01:55.380> no

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
will this really because there's no
