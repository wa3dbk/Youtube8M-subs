00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 Croquettes with meat. Pancake dough: Wheat flour 300 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
 g, eggs 3 pcs, milk 300 ml, sparkling mineral water 250 ml, salt, oil - of these 

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:03.720
 ingredients comes out about 20 pcs of pancakes. 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:22.230
 I use a cast-iron skillet for frying - now I use it for frying 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:42.480
 only a copper pan. On slightly oiled pans 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:59.030
 pour a portion of pancake cake - we can also dry fry ale 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:15.520
 then we must grow more pancakes. 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:35.200
 Spread the dough evenly over the entire surface of the frying pan - by tipping 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.140
 Let's eat it until the pancake is brown - we can have fun in the circus performer 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.480
 tossing pancakes - or using a spatula to turn over. 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.850
 We also burn the other side. We're baking further pancakes. 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.480
 We're waiting for you to get blown-turn over. 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:03:20.910
 The next pancake. We're cooking to finish our cake. 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:28.470
 And hopla, we toss pancakes and forward. We've finished frying pancakes- 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.870
 which we arranged in the pyramid. Recipe for meat stuffing: 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.520
 300 g boneless beef, 300 g boneless pork, 100-150 g 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.060
 onions, approx. 40 g oil, 1 roll soaked in milk, salt, pepper. 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.930
 How to make: Cook meat or stew on 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.530
 soft-grind in a food processor with fried onions and a pressed roll 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.900
 season with salt and pepper and separate into prepared pancakes. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.340
 If we want to have thicker croquettes, we increase the amount of stuffing. 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:04:04.400
 Wrap the stuffing in pancakes - cut them in half and coat in egg and breadcrumbs. 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:18.300
 We cook by putting on hot fat, arranging 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:06:50.780
 closely next to each other - fry on both sides. We put on a plate or dish. 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:57.270
 Enjoy your meal. WELCOME TO THE COMMON 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:02.490
 COOKING. Thank you. I am inviting you to cinema. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.640
 This is one of my first films shot in 2006.
