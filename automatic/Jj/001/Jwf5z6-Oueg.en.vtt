00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.340
 when the terrain is very bumpy it has 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.889
 many obstacles with fallen trees 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.890
 many stones rocks is interesting 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.400
 carrying firewood and I go 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.410
 give a tip to do this I'll use 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.699
 two rope segments passing through 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.699
 Cast down the chin 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:39.440
 I'm going to make a simple supper on the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:42.510
 each string put a chopstick here 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:48.859
 to be easier and untie the knot 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.859
 then the two sides 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.490
 I'll pass the other side of each cable through 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.490
 within the 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.430
 a piece of the dry block will improvise 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 a carry handle carried a 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 beam of wood 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.340
 You can make the name of your 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:34.730
 preference 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:39.340
 I'm going to make the iron return I do not want 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.540
 cut the leftover cable was roll here 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.330
 you can adjust the height of the handle 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.410
 You did a little coiling. 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.410
 it's very simple 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.010
