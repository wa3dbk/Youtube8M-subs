00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.720
 it was a few hours ago microsoft 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.820
 did his show in san francisco for the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 build the developer meeting 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.170
 visibly microsoft has seduced his 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.330
 microsoft developers who opens the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.400
 door to android to apple for his 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.050
 microsoft smartphones that prepares 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.060
 especially the arrival of windows 10 we see 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.750
 that in detail with Eric the bourlout 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:29.039
 present in san francisco for the moment 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.929
 they are a little behind microsoft 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.820
 face to android for example and its full 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.590
 blind with several more than one 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.329
 million apps ditto for apple 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.370
 they are a little behind we will say 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.629
 with his windows store that has throws 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 with windows 8 but that does not work 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.460
 very well and so they want to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.750
 revive 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.489
 they want to go much further 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.780
 and so what they did and it's a 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.789
 still pretty important 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.980
 that they had to developers bah you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.480
 see if you have already designed a 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.340
 application for another platform 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.739
 banon will allow you very easily 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.969
 to adapt it for windows 10 otherwise 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.239
 says if you designed an application 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.000
 for android and well one with some 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.860
 code changes you will be able to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.420
 transform it adapt it and make it 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.189
 turn on windows tice and all 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 devices that will turn innodis 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.990
 mainly for android anyway 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.990
 the phone 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.870
 what is noteworthy is also microsoft 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.010
 has therefore formalized the name of his 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.200
 new browser called edge this 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.850
 project sporten this is then what is 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.870
 funny is that this trial has jh 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.070
 it starts with an e we keep it anyway 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.660
 it has nothing to do with the internet 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.250
 explore but we still keep this 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.360
 logo that looks a bit like that of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.100
 gold etc 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.050
 it was the spartan project it becomes 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.760
 help they took the opportunity to show 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.130
 some new features 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.260
 news new page start and there 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.300
 still unfortunately the support of the extensions 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.770
 which is very important for all 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.090
 for all the geeks who likes to go 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.710
 a little further from their browser 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.410
 so these extensions there is actually a 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.600
 beast extension built around two 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.650
 web technologies so in fact that's it 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.970
 a bit like that ie you can 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.830
 do the developers can very 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.590
 easily retrieve an extension 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.590
 chrome or firefox and the scope on age 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.390
 microsoft has announced a function that will 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:13.680
 allow when you buy a windows 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.140
 phone but upscale 1 this 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.820
 will not be on all windows phones from 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.560
 make it run as pc that's at 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.959
 to say you simply have your 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 phone you plug it in first by 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 cable but then possibly without 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.370
 wire to a television and there you have a 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.560
 other interface an interface 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.970
 computers can connect a 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.040
 mouse a bluetooth keyboard to your 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.959
 phone and you're at once 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.950
 a phone a real computer and that's 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.090
 not bad at all there are harder 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.920
 company that had already tried to 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.930
 do this here and there it shows that 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.160
 makes their application that both a 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.660
 phone application is a 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.520
 classic windows application 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.739
 well it shows a little the potential of six 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.390
 to ten questions because we see that 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.470
 you have a powerpoint on the phone 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.709
 but he can turn himself a 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.560
 powerpoint for for your your windows 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.760
 traditional very easily and it's 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.920
 rather bluffing better I'll try 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.720
 to go to try it too ah yeah that's 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.070
 in the name so the smartphone that will become 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.050
 the small pc 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.580
 finally with a whole face that we have 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.620
 the little low pc and especially when we 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.480
 is not interested anymore 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.680
 to the type of machine we all have on all 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.680
 the screens what is the concept 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.569
 microsoft is very advanced on this project 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.010
 since they already have there at the Bible they 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.690
 will bring us hundreds of them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.280
 have said they have squarely created because 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.230
 face windows for virtual reality 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.470
 which is quite which is pretty crazy 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.659
 so guys we can test the 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.269
 applications plated his video player 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.829
 against a wall can be pressed photos 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.230
 of season between another wall one can 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.220
 display the weather on this table on his 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.359
 dinner table 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.000
 it's very amazing there is and they 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:46.799
 also think of already to 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.170
 business applications in particular 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.069
 for architecture for for the 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.510
 construction etc 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.010
 they already have people working 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.739
 with them on concrete applications 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.019
 so this lolene helmet what we could 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.670
 a little thought for a pure cash from 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.629
 gadget is made to make the effect wow 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.250
 at the end of a conf 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:04.859
 in fact they are very serious about it 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.970
 and he really thinks it's the 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.650
 new a new platform 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.650
 computer science etc that's a bit of the future
