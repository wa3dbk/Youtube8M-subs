00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.820 
are free riding or doing crazy things
hopping<00:02:11.700> stairs<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.450> doing<00:02:13.170> crazy<00:02:13.290> things

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
hopping stairs and doing crazy things

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.310 
hopping stairs and doing crazy things
and<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.670> break<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> hanger<00:02:15.480> or<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.900> bend<00:02:16.140> it

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
and you break the hanger or you bend it

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.820 
and you break the hanger or you bend it
or<00:02:16.560> mangle<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.300> just<00:02:18.300> let<00:02:19.290> them<00:02:19.440> know<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
or mangle it just let them know and

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.160 
or mangle it just let them know and
they'll<00:02:20.070> replace<00:02:20.490> it<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:21.180> like<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.660> long<00:02:21.960> as

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
they'll replace it for like as long as

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.240 
they'll replace it for like as long as
you<00:02:22.260> have<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> trucks<00:02:22.860> they'll<00:02:23.100> keep

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
you have the trucks they'll keep

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.340 
you have the trucks they'll keep
replacing<00:02:23.580> them<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.930> really<00:02:25.200> nice

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
replacing them so that is a really nice

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.620 
replacing them so that is a really nice
advantage<00:02:25.950> of<00:02:26.100> these<00:02:26.250> trucks<00:02:27.560> let's<00:02:28.560> see<00:02:28.830> here

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
advantage of these trucks let's see here

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.840 
advantage of these trucks let's see here
these<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:31.200> one<00:02:31.680> thing<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.100> separates<00:02:32.550> these

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
these the one thing that separates these

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.750 
these the one thing that separates these
trucks<00:02:33.240> from<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:34.500> Randall's<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.250> bears<00:02:35.550> and

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
trucks from like Randall's and bears and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.950 
trucks from like Randall's and bears and
stuff<00:02:35.850> is<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:37.650> bushing<00:02:38.220> seat<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.820> your<00:02:39.690> board

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
stuff is the bushing seat on your board

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.290 
stuff is the bushing seat on your board
side<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:41.070> when<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> it's<00:02:41.760> sitting<00:02:42.060> like<00:02:42.270> this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
side so when the it's sitting like this

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.350 
side so when the it's sitting like this
this<00:02:42.900> bushing<00:02:43.200> here<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:44.520> seat<00:02:44.790> that<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.120> sits

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
this bushing here the seat that it sits

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.430 
this bushing here the seat that it sits
in<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.780> deeper<00:02:46.530> than<00:02:47.090> most<00:02:48.090> trucks<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:49.260> it's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
in is deeper than most trucks so it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.630 
in is deeper than most trucks so it's
just<00:02:49.650> gonna<00:02:49.770> give<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.190> little<00:02:50.490> more

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
just gonna give you a little more

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.110 
just gonna give you a little more
response<00:02:51.210> and<00:02:52.490> resistance<00:02:53.490> I<00:02:53.670> guess<00:02:53.850> out<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
response and resistance I guess out of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.940 
response and resistance I guess out of
your<00:02:54.300> bushings<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.350> it's<00:02:55.500> really<00:02:55.710> gonna

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
your bushings so it's really gonna

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.610 
your bushings so it's really gonna
maximize<00:02:56.430> your<00:02:56.790> bushing<00:02:57.290> that's<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.440> nice

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
maximize your bushing that's a nice

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.230 
maximize your bushing that's a nice
feature<00:02:58.890> if<00:02:59.250> you're<00:02:59.520> free<00:02:59.730> riding<00:02:59.940> and

feature if you're free riding and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.600 
feature if you're free riding and

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
carving and dancing and doing stuff like

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.830 
carving and dancing and doing stuff like
