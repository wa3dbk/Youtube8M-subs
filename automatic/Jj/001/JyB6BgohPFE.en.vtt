00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I always used to think that this fuel

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
I always used to think that this fuel
rod<00:01:43.920> Gun<00:01:43.950> even<00:01:44.430> back<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> Halo<00:01:44.850> 3<00:01:45.090> days<00:01:45.240> was

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
rod Gun even back in Halo 3 days was

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.940 
rod Gun even back in Halo 3 days was
really<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.110> big<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:46.590> kind<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.799> out<00:01:46.920> of

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
really really big and was kind of out of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.910 
really really big and was kind of out of
scale<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:48.290> when<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.380> comes<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.740> reach

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
scale but when it comes to the reach

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.249 
scale but when it comes to the reach
figures<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.579> seems<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.939> fit<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.570> it's

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
figures it seems to fit right in it's

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
figures it seems to fit right in it's

very easy to get him to hold them to be

kind of latch it around his fingers

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.429 
kind of latch it around his fingers
takes<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.509> second<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> don't<00:01:58.110> want<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> break

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
takes a second I don't want to break

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.620 
takes a second I don't want to break
them<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:59.310> you're<00:01:59.490> on<00:01:59.640> cannons<00:02:00.030> handles<00:02:00.479> those

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
them if you're on cannons handles those

them if you're on cannons handles those
were<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.049> sensitive

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
were a little sensitive

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.300 
were a little sensitive
then<00:02:01.940> the<00:02:02.120> boom<00:02:02.960> in<00:02:03.350> his<00:02:03.470> hands<00:02:03.770> and<00:02:04.100> he<00:02:04.190> can

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
then the boom in his hands and he can

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.020 
then the boom in his hands and he can
hold<00:02:04.430> it<00:02:04.580> and<00:02:04.850> it<00:02:05.030> looks<00:02:05.210> very<00:02:05.420> cool<00:02:05.660> with<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
hold it and it looks very cool with it

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.400 
hold it and it looks very cool with it
the<00:02:08.030> only<00:02:08.150> downside<00:02:08.570> is<00:02:08.600> that<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:08.990> gold<00:02:09.229> on

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the only downside is that the gold on

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.960 
the only downside is that the gold on
the<00:02:09.530> fuel<00:02:09.770> rod<00:02:09.920> cam<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.340> different<00:02:10.700> shade<00:02:10.940> of

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the fuel rod cam is a different shade of

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.270 
the fuel rod cam is a different shade of
gold<00:02:11.240> from<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.110> armour<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.500> Ely<00:02:12.830> general<00:02:13.130> here

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
gold from the armour of Ely general here

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.160 
gold from the armour of Ely general here
but<00:02:13.430> that's<00:02:13.520> not<00:02:13.610> a<00:02:13.700> big<00:02:13.880> deal<00:02:14.090> now<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:14.930> fuel

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
but that's not a big deal now the fuel

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.230 
but that's not a big deal now the fuel
rod<00:02:15.320> cannon<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.950> was<00:02:16.730> really<00:02:16.910> looking<00:02:17.120> forward

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
rod cannon I was really looking forward

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520 
rod cannon I was really looking forward
to<00:02:17.330> getting<00:02:17.510> sadly<00:02:18.020> it<00:02:18.080> doesn't<00:02:18.290> really<00:02:18.380> work

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
to getting sadly it doesn't really work

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
to getting sadly it doesn't really work
with<00:02:18.680> anything<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.220> can<00:02:19.400> really<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.760> my

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
with anything it can really get my

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.400 
with anything it can really get my
grunts<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.360> hold<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.690> even<00:02:20.870> though<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.200> ground

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
grunts to hold it even though the ground

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.510 
grunts to hold it even though the ground
heavy<00:02:21.530> should<00:02:21.800> have<00:02:21.890> came<00:02:22.070> with<00:02:22.100> one<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.460> the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
heavy should have came with one of the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.740 
heavy should have came with one of the
fuel<00:02:22.670> run<00:02:22.790> cannons<00:02:23.090> but<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.240> mean<00:02:23.390> even<00:02:23.570> with<00:02:23.690> a

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
fuel run cannons but I mean even with a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:24.910 
fuel run cannons but I mean even with a
grunt<00:02:24.020> here<00:02:24.230> if<00:02:24.320> I<00:02:24.380> just<00:02:24.530> put<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.740> up<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.890> his

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
grunt here if I just put it up to his

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.700 
grunt here if I just put it up to his
hands<00:02:25.280> if<00:02:25.730> you're<00:02:25.940> on<00:02:26.090> cannon<00:02:26.480> is<00:02:26.660> very<00:02:27.290> small

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
hands if you're on cannon is very small

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.380 
hands if you're on cannon is very small
it<00:02:27.890> actually<00:02:28.160> looks<00:02:28.340> more<00:02:28.460> like<00:02:28.520> a<00:02:28.700> larger

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
it actually looks more like a larger

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.250 
it actually looks more like a larger
plasma<00:02:29.990> repeater<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:32.570> is<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.720> downside<00:02:33.110> if

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
plasma repeater so that is a downside if

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.240 
plasma repeater so that is a downside if
I<00:02:33.350> get<00:02:33.530> up<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.770> I<00:02:33.800> figure<00:02:33.980> out<00:02:34.040> a<00:02:34.100> way<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
I get up and I figure out a way to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.680 
I get up and I figure out a way to
really<00:02:34.400> get<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.640> elite<00:02:34.820> or<00:02:35.060> grunts<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> bill

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
really get the elite or grunts the bill

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.510 
really get the elite or grunts the bill
hold<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.140> fuel<00:02:36.560> rod<00:02:36.650> cannon<00:02:36.890> I'll<00:02:37.160> do<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.400> video

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
hold the fuel rod cannon I'll do a video

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.100 
hold the fuel rod cannon I'll do a video
about<00:02:37.730> that<00:02:38.000> I<00:02:38.240> didn't<00:02:38.570> happen<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.840> have<00:02:38.900> one

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
about that I didn't happen to have one

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.480 
about that I didn't happen to have one
of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.290> blow<00:02:39.560> dryers<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.040> me<00:02:40.190> which<00:02:40.340> is<00:02:40.460> the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
of the blow dryers with me which is the

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.900 
of the blow dryers with me which is the
usual<00:02:40.970> way<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:42.280> get<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.400> figures<00:02:43.670> to<00:02:43.700> hold

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
usual way that I get the figures to hold

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:44.980 
usual way that I get the figures to hold
their<00:02:44.000> weapons<00:02:44.270> that<00:02:44.330> are<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> little<00:02:44.600> more

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
their weapons that are a little more

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.810 
their weapons that are a little more
difficult<00:02:45.500> I<00:02:45.680> ain't<00:02:45.980> had<00:02:46.070> one<00:02:46.100> with<00:02:46.370> me<00:02:46.520> but

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
difficult I ain't had one with me but

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.910 
difficult I ain't had one with me but
now<00:02:47.030> but<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.080> elite<00:02:48.230> general<00:02:48.530> here

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
now but the elite general here

moving<00:02:49.670> on<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.850> Justin<00:02:50.150> figure<00:02:50.450> I<00:02:50.630> will<00:02:50.870> say

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
moving on to Justin figure I will say

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.250 
moving on to Justin figure I will say
that<00:02:51.410> MacFarlane<00:02:51.830> has<00:02:51.920> done<00:02:52.070> an<00:02:52.160> outstanding

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
that MacFarlane has done an outstanding

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.890 
that MacFarlane has done an outstanding
paint<00:02:54.260> job<00:02:54.560> on<00:02:54.770> this<00:02:55.130> figure<00:02:55.900> outstanding

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
paint job on this figure outstanding

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.300 
paint job on this figure outstanding
definitely<00:02:57.380> one<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.680> best<00:02:57.920> of<00:02:58.160> this

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
definitely one of the best of this

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.510 
definitely one of the best of this
series<00:02:59.050> usually<00:03:00.050> in<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.680> past<00:03:00.860> with

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
series usually in the past with

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.770 
series usually in the past with
prominent<00:03:01.730> figures<00:03:02.000> are<00:03:02.120> great<00:03:02.420> with<00:03:02.570> paint

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
prominent figures are great with paint

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.330 
prominent figures are great with paint
jobs<00:03:02.990> in<00:03:03.170> detail<00:03:03.470> but<00:03:03.830> I've<00:03:03.950> got<00:03:04.070> to<00:03:04.160> see<00:03:04.250> if

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
jobs in detail but I've got to see if

you'll<00:03:34.880> love<00:03:35.060> getting<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.540> figured<00:03:35.810> if<00:03:35.900> you

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:35.959 
you'll love getting this figured if you

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.270 
you'll love getting this figured if you
want<00:03:36.080> to<00:03:36.170> keep<00:03:36.230> it<00:03:36.350> in<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.470> box<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.860> still<00:03:37.100> looks

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
want to keep it in a box it still looks

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.699 
want to keep it in a box it still looks
great<00:03:37.630> so<00:03:38.630> anyway<00:03:38.870> that's<00:03:39.019> pretty<00:03:39.170> much<00:03:39.560> the

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
great so anyway that's pretty much the

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.710 
great so anyway that's pretty much the
gist<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:40.070> this<00:03:40.160> figure<00:03:40.519> I've<00:03:41.390> got<00:03:41.450> them

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
gist of this figure I've got them

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.690 
gist of this figure I've got them
understanding<00:03:42.260> the<00:03:42.560> universal<00:03:43.280> standing

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
understanding the universal standing

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.920 
understanding the universal standing
pose<00:03:43.910> that<00:03:44.180> they<00:03:44.269> usually<00:03:44.420> stand<00:03:44.810> in

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
pose that they usually stand in

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.390 
pose that they usually stand in
otherwise<00:03:45.230> he'll<00:03:45.410> follow<00:03:45.650> I<00:03:46.010> would

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
otherwise he'll follow I would

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.770 
otherwise he'll follow I would
definitely<00:03:46.760> recommend<00:03:46.850> using<00:03:47.330> one<00:03:47.510> of<00:03:47.630> the

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
definitely recommend using one of the

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.840 
definitely recommend using one of the
halo<00:03:48.050> 3<00:03:48.320> fuel<00:03:48.860> rod<00:03:49.070> cannons<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.580> go<00:03:49.700> with

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
halo 3 fuel rod cannons to go with

halo 3 fuel rod cannons to go with
repeat<00:03:50.150> general<00:03:50.330> year<00:03:51.730> one<00:03:52.730> it<00:03:52.850> comes<00:03:53.030> with<00:03:53.209> is

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 
repeat general year one it comes with is

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.860 
repeat general year one it comes with is
just<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.050> tiny<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:55.670> guess<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.750> would<00:03:56.840> be

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
just so tiny I guess that would be

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.070 
just so tiny I guess that would be
another<00:03:57.110> example<00:03:57.200> of<00:03:57.680> McFarlane<00:03:58.870> instead<00:03:59.870> of

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:00.080 
another example of McFarlane instead of

another example of McFarlane instead of

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
designing these things for the figures

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.430 
designing these things for the figures
to<00:04:01.430> be<00:04:01.610> able<00:04:01.670> to<00:04:01.760> hold<00:04:02.030> they<00:04:02.420> design<00:04:02.690> a<00:04:02.720> bike<00:04:02.959> to

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:03.440 
to be able to hold they design a bike to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.490 
to be able to hold they design a bike to
the<00:04:03.470> letter<00:04:03.830> for<00:04:04.400> how<00:04:04.700> they<00:04:04.850> look<00:04:05.000> in<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.209> game

the letter for how they look in the game
and<00:04:06.500> I'm<00:04:06.769> one<00:04:07.070> of<00:04:07.100> those<00:04:07.220> people<00:04:07.280> who<00:04:07.850> would

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
and I'm one of those people who would
