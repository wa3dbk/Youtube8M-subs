00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
concepts of using a sewing machine then

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.370 
concepts of using a sewing machine then
you'll<00:00:27.390> understand<00:00:27.779> how<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.170> but

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
you'll understand how to do this but

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.470 
you'll understand how to do this but
this<00:00:28.560> is<00:00:28.800> my<00:00:28.980> fabric<00:00:29.519> was<00:00:29.670> doubled<00:00:30.000> over<00:00:30.119> I

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
this is my fabric was doubled over I

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.120 
this is my fabric was doubled over I
just<00:00:31.439> fold<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.099> half<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.309> like<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:34.130> so

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
just fold it in half just like this so

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.190 
just fold it in half just like this so
go<00:00:36.059> ahead<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.239> put<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> foot<00:00:36.750> down<00:00:36.809> I'm

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
go ahead and put the foot down I'm

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.720 
go ahead and put the foot down I'm
listening<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.649> really<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.129> rolling<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
listening and really get rolling on the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.030 
listening and really get rolling on the
 again

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
 again

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.550

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:53.500 

work<00:00:47.560> within<00:00:47.830> a<00:00:48.550> petal

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.650 

all<00:00:54.510> right<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.940> anyways<00:00:56.940> I'm<00:00:57.090> using<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.420> cross

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
all right so anyways I'm using a cross

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.530 
all right so anyways I'm using a cross
stitch<00:00:58.250> or<00:00:59.250> kind<00:00:59.790> of<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.970> left<00:01:00.240> right<00:01:00.510> left

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
stitch or kind of like left right left

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.150 
stitch or kind of like left right left
right<00:01:00.840> left<00:01:00.990> where<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.440> looked<00:01:01.650> right<00:01:01.800> kind<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
right left where it looked right kind of

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.189 
right left where it looked right kind of
stitch<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.670> find<00:01:03.630> that<00:01:03.780> it's<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.989> little<00:01:04.050> bit

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
stitch I find that it's a little bit

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
stitch I find that it's a little bit
stronger<00:01:04.770> than<00:01:04.800> it's<00:01:05.610> doing<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.910> straight

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
stronger than it's doing a straight

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.560 
stronger than it's doing a straight
stitch<00:01:06.600> right<00:01:06.930> down<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.530> material<00:01:11.210> if<00:01:12.210> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
stitch right down the material if you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.590 
stitch right down the material if you
want<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.900> do<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> first<00:01:13.560> weight<00:01:14.400> I'd<00:01:14.850> say<00:01:15.180> into

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
want to do the first weight I'd say into

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.060 
want to do the first weight I'd say into
the<00:01:15.720> stitch<00:01:15.990> maybe<00:01:16.260> inch<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> half<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.010> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the stitch maybe inch and a half of the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.120 
the stitch maybe inch and a half of the
stitch<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.120> want<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.360> go<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.600> reverse<00:01:19.130> while

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
stitch you want to go and reverse while

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.890 
stitch you want to go and reverse while
you<00:01:20.220> stitch<00:01:20.460> forward<00:01:20.760> going<00:01:21.119> reverse<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
you stitch forward going reverse and

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.750 
you stitch forward going reverse and
then<00:01:22.350> stitch<00:01:22.650> forward<00:01:22.979> again<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.580> way<00:01:23.700> you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
then stitch forward again that way you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.340 
then stitch forward again that way you
make<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> first<00:01:24.360> part<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.840> stitch<00:01:25.080> really

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
make the first part of the stitch really

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.560 
make the first part of the stitch really
strong<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> do<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.910> same<00:01:27.090> thing<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.479> the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
strong and you do the same thing for the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:50.860 
strong and you do the same thing for the
last<00:01:27.720> stitch

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
little bit of a tail here at the end

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.250 
little bit of a tail here at the end
that<00:01:58.530> way<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.890> lose<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.070> string<00:01:59.910> and
