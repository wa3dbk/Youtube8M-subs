00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.299
 Hello everyone today on April 6 show 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.530
 want 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.269
 ground difference prepared land 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 what a very big difference while we are with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.140
 you are watching attack beautiful picture 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.199
 here we have two cucumbers very german 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.060
 so good we liked while we here 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.269
 we see a lot of cucumbers 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.429
 everything is cool everything is well we rise above 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:32.219
 here we can see and are visible everywhere on the background 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.399
 everything is fine with flowers everything is fine still 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.460
 above we look at everything agree everything is fine 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.489
 and turn around 180 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 here you can watch the same sort 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 Hermann but the land he is and behold himself 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.760
 a conclusion comes out of the leaves 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.030
 some kind of nondescript cucumber like 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.680
 but there is no strength in cucumber to feed 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 he is also trying to get across 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.760
 absolutely identical term absolutely 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.799
 equally plants got into different 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.939
 conditions here on earth are ordinary land 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:08.310
 none prepared after it was 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.710
 put to shame because I stayed 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.170
 cucumber there is the same drip irrigation 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.590
 Here we can also observe everything 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.500
 all the same water all the same 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.600
 while watering but here here in 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.560
 such a state is cucumbers and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.920
 notice all 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.890
 no difference is the word the same condition and 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.430
 right here we turn around here are 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 they are in the same conditions but cucumbers and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.869
 turned out different in fact if we are not 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 visible specially prepared land 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.990
 which we have shown before these same 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.820
 Finnish sausages that take us all down 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.940
 insulated blanks on the board from the ground 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.729
 much warmer and earth much better 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.580
 actually see what's the difference here 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:58.479
 already where the cucumber is already at the top already braid 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.520
 everything here is much worse
