because not only is California is such a
big<00:00:33.600> state<00:00:33.899> but<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.920> mean<00:00:35.250> they<00:00:35.520> have<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:35.790> many

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of there so being top five you think you

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.479 
of there so being top five you think you
know<00:00:39.629> he'd<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:39.960> recruited<00:00:40.649> very<00:00:40.890> heavily<00:00:41.219> by

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
know he'd be recruited very heavily by

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.600 
know he'd be recruited very heavily by
you<00:00:41.550> know<00:00:41.790> UCLA's<00:00:42.860> Arizona's<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.399> being

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
you know UCLA's Arizona's you know being

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.220 
you know UCLA's Arizona's you know being
out<00:00:44.730> in<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.910> West<00:00:45.149> but<00:00:45.660> he<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.930> really

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
out in the West but he just really

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
out in the West but he just really
wasn't<00:00:46.379> recruited<00:00:46.770> off<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.760> very

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wasn't recruited off which was very

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.180 
wasn't recruited off which was very
surprising<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.660> he<00:00:48.780> went<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.989> Harvard<00:00:49.379> played

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
surprising so he went to Harvard played

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.270 
surprising so he went to Harvard played
there<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:52.140> actually<00:00:52.680> he<00:00:53.039> didn't

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
