this<00:03:57.350> is<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.530> fastest<00:03:57.950> kind<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.220> bike

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
this is the fastest kind of bike

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.480 
this is the fastest kind of bike
pretty<00:04:00.350> much<00:04:00.530> anywhere<00:04:00.980> you're<00:04:01.160> gonna<00:04:01.250> ride

this would be the fastest kind of bike

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.360 
this would be the fastest kind of bike
and<00:04:02.959> because<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.319> suspension<00:04:03.709> is<00:04:03.920> forgiving

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
and because the suspension is forgiving

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.280 
and because the suspension is forgiving
it's<00:04:04.910> pretty<00:04:05.209> comfortable<00:04:05.690> if<00:04:05.930> you<00:04:06.080> get<00:04:06.260> a

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
it's pretty comfortable if you get a

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.980 
it's pretty comfortable if you get a

mistakes and the stupid things you do

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:12.610 
mistakes and the stupid things you do
and<00:04:10.970> because<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.480> bike<00:04:11.870> has<00:04:12.140> less<00:04:12.290> power

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
and because the bike has less power

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.650 
and because the bike has less power
you'll<00:04:13.490> twist<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:13.850> throttle<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:14.450> you<00:04:14.510> won't

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
you'll twist that throttle and you won't

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.470 
you'll twist that throttle and you won't
kill<00:04:14.840> yourself<00:04:15.200> instantly<00:04:15.410> you<00:04:16.040> know<00:04:16.480> they'll

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
kill yourself instantly you know they'll

kill yourself instantly you know they'll
give<00:04:17.630> you<00:04:17.720> a<00:04:17.810> chance<00:04:17.989> to<00:04:18.139> not<00:04:18.350> die

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.040 

so<00:04:31.199> in<00:04:32.199> the<00:04:32.410> end<00:04:32.560> you<00:04:32.860> can<00:04:33.130> if<00:04:33.970> you're<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.300> brand
