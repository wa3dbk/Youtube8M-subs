00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
kind of rated and that was a problem to

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.820 
kind of rated and that was a problem to
have<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.480> move<00:00:12.660> over<00:00:13.280> and<00:00:14.280> so<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.800> so<00:00:16.800> that

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
have to move over and so that so that

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.290 
have to move over and so that so that
was<00:00:17.070> initiative<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.699> was<00:00:17.850> getting<00:00:18.180> ready

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
was initiative so it was getting ready

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.880 
was initiative so it was getting ready
to<00:00:18.449> move<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.170> I<00:00:19.289> was<00:00:19.410> trying<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.590> find<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.800> new

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to move it I was trying to find a new

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
to move it I was trying to find a new
area<00:00:20.100> when<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.699> know<00:00:20.789> farther<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.449> than<00:00:21.480> I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
area when you know farther out than I

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.359 
area when you know farther out than I
did<00:00:21.750> before<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.050> four<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.010> five<00:00:23.070> times

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
did before like four or five times

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.310 
did before like four or five times
farther<00:00:23.880> out<00:00:24.150> in<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:25.050> really<00:00:25.289> weird

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
farther out in just a really weird

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.830 
farther out in just a really weird
location<00:00:26.220> makes<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.580> more<00:00:27.119> difficult<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.539> find

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
location makes it more difficult to find

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.080 
location makes it more difficult to find
and<00:00:28.080> I<00:00:28.590> started<00:00:28.920> in<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.130> know<00:00:29.369> trying<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> find

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
and I started in you know trying to find

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580 
and I started in you know trying to find
a<00:00:30.119> new<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.480> then<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.689> went<00:00:30.779> back<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.109> move

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
a new one but then it went back to move

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.549 
a new one but then it went back to move
some<00:00:31.769> move<00:00:31.980> some<00:00:32.250> my<00:00:32.369> stuff<00:00:32.640> over<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.960> I<00:00:34.350> saw

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
some move some my stuff over and I saw

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.860 
some move some my stuff over and I saw
that<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.800> was<00:00:34.920> rated<00:00:35.219> again<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:36.480> could<00:00:36.780> have

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
that I was rated again so I'm could have

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
that I was rated again so I'm could have
been<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.020> same<00:00:37.170> people<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.559> just<00:00:37.800> came<00:00:38.010> back

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
been the same people that just came back

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.600 
been the same people that just came back
would<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.940> made<00:00:39.059> sense<00:00:39.090> but<00:00:39.719> um<00:00:40.590> I've<00:00:41.190> that's

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
would have made sense but um I've that's

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.700 
would have made sense but um I've that's
my<00:00:41.760> new<00:00:42.000> okay<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> serious<00:00:43.320> problem<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
my new okay this is a serious problem I

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
my new okay this is a serious problem I
need<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:44.070> ramp<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> security<00:00:45.270> on<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.870> so

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
need to ramp up the security on this so

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470 
need to ramp up the security on this so
I<00:00:46.440> think<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.489> pretty<00:00:47.879> much<00:00:48.180> an

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
I think this is pretty much an

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.090 
I think this is pretty much an
unreadable<00:00:48.840> base<00:00:49.170> here's<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.559> bottom<00:00:49.890> floor

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
unreadable base here's the bottom floor

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
unreadable base here's the bottom floor
it's<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.090> lot<00:00:51.270> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:52.190> niceness<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.820> what

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
it's a lot you know niceness is not what

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's a lot you know niceness is not what
you<00:00:54.149> know<00:00:54.329> it's<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.660> doesn't<00:00:55.620> look<00:00:55.739> very<00:00:55.770> good

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you know it's not doesn't look very good

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
you know it's not doesn't look very good
or<00:00:56.309> anything<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.670> but<00:00:57.120> it<00:00:57.300> serves<00:00:57.840> his

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
or anything like that but it serves his

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.930 
or anything like that but it serves his
purpose<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.620> plots<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.460> room<00:00:59.730> for

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
purpose about plots or you know room for

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
purpose about plots or you know room for
chest<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.600> add<00:01:00.809> more<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.710> add

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
chest here that I can add more and add

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.250 
chest here that I can add more and add
more<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.570> which<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> was<00:01:04.080> going

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
more down here which is what I was going

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710 
more down here which is what I was going
for<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.670> I'll<00:01:05.760> show<00:01:05.909> you<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.150> outside<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:06.630> if

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
for and I'll show you the outside so if

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.250 
for and I'll show you the outside so if
i<00:01:06.780> do<00:01:06.840> /<00:01:07.140> home<00:01:07.500> um<00:01:08.540> I'll<00:01:09.540> show<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.869> how<00:01:10.229> it's

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
i do / home um I'll show you how it's

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
i do / home um I'll show you how it's
really<00:01:10.650> hard<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.400> get<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.510> this

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
really hard to get in and I think this

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.390 
really hard to get in and I think this
is<00:01:12.659> pretty<00:01:12.990> pretty<00:01:13.710> much<00:01:13.860> how<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.010> do<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.250> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is pretty pretty much how you do it so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.100 
is pretty pretty much how you do it so
the<00:01:14.939> first<00:01:15.150> thing<00:01:15.240> that's<00:01:15.420> helpful<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.930> that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the first thing that's helpful is that

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.380 
the first thing that's helpful is that
it's<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.590> in<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> middle<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.220> nowhere<00:01:17.549> way

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
it's just in the middle of nowhere way

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.620 
it's just in the middle of nowhere way
down<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:19.880> you<00:01:20.880> know<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.210> no<00:01:21.360> cave

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
down here you know there's no cave

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.870 
down here you know there's no cave
systems<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> connect<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.670> easy

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
systems that connect to it really easy

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
systems that connect to it really easy
so<00:01:24.060> it's<00:01:24.659> hard<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.680> know<00:01:25.740> see<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
so it's hard to you know see in the

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.520 
so it's hard to you know see in the
first<00:01:26.520> place<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.000> then<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> find<00:01:28.170> it<00:01:28.350> I

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
first place and then if you find it I

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.240 
first place and then if you find it I
believe<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.310> this<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:30.890> unreadable<00:01:31.890> from

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
believe that this is unreadable from

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.740 
believe that this is unreadable from
what<00:01:32.400> I've<00:01:32.520> seen<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.880> might<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.450> new

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
what I've seen there might be some new

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.170 
what I've seen there might be some new
you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.290> way<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.619> get<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:35.220> but<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:36.090> I've

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
you know way to get it but what I've

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
you know way to get it but what I've
seen<00:01:36.390> from<00:01:36.450> what<00:01:36.840> i've<00:01:36.960> read<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.680> pretty

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
seen from what i've read this is pretty

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.160 
seen from what i've read this is pretty
much<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.540> an

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
much do it so what it is it's an

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.679 
much do it so what it is it's an
obsidian<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.159> sort<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> thing<00:01:41.850> with

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
obsidian like how sort of thing with

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.139 
obsidian like how sort of thing with
fence<00:01:43.110> all<00:01:43.380> around<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.920> which<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.729> guess<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
fence all around it which I guess the

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.270 
fence all around it which I guess the
fence<00:01:45.390> creates<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.140> problem<00:01:46.320> with<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
fence creates a problem with some of the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.910 
fence creates a problem with some of the
cannons<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.299> like<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.649> weird

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
cannons because it like it's a weird

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.480 
cannons because it like it's a weird
block<00:01:50.729> size<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.229> kind<00:01:52.500> of<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:53.009> weird

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
block size and it's kind of just a weird

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.730 
block size and it's kind of just a weird
shape<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:54.149> know<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.470> doesn't

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
shape you know for it and so it doesn't

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.770 
shape you know for it and so it doesn't
work<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.009> well<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.670> water<00:01:56.909> makes<00:01:57.630> it

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
work as well and then the water makes it

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.660 
work as well and then the water makes it
so<00:01:57.899> TNT<00:01:58.259> can't<00:01:58.710> blow<00:01:58.920> up<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.579> or

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so TNT can't blow up you know or

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.600 
so TNT can't blow up you know or
anything<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:00.810> um<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.979> yeah<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.369> if<00:02:02.460> it's

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
anything on it um so yeah so if it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.980 
anything on it um so yeah so if it's
just<00:02:02.790> water<00:02:02.939> during<00:02:03.210> obsidian<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> think<00:02:03.869> you'd

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
just water during obsidian I think you'd

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.510 
just water during obsidian I think you'd
make<00:02:04.110> like<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> sand<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.890> or<00:02:05.040> something<00:02:05.130> that

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
make like a sand can or something that

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.069 
make like a sand can or something that
could<00:02:05.640> do<00:02:05.700> it<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> fence<00:02:06.570> adds<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.960> new

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
could do it but the fence adds a new

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.869 
could do it but the fence adds a new
level<00:02:07.229> security<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.979> might<00:02:08.550> still<00:02:08.789> be

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
level security so might still be

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.850 
level security so might still be
readable<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.989> know<00:02:10.020> much<00:02:10.500> harder

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
readable but it's you know much harder

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.680 
readable but it's you know much harder
and<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.790> also<00:02:11.940> goes<00:02:12.239> all<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.450> way<00:02:12.569> down<00:02:12.720> to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
and it also goes all the way down to

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.750 
and it also goes all the way down to
admin<00:02:14.690> IAM<00:02:14.870> down<00:02:15.050> here<00:02:15.430> which<00:02:16.430> is<00:02:16.460> also

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
admin IAM down here which is also

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.520 
admin IAM down here which is also
helpful<00:02:17.120> because<00:02:17.330> that<00:02:17.570> obviously<00:02:18.140> can't<00:02:18.410> be

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
helpful because that obviously can't be

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.770 
helpful because that obviously can't be
broken<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.520> that's<00:02:19.670> pretty<00:02:19.910> cool<00:02:20.000> I'm<00:02:20.510> gonna

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
broken so that's pretty cool I'm gonna

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.860 
broken so that's pretty cool I'm gonna
drown<00:02:21.560> here<00:02:22.000> much<00:02:23.000> better<00:02:23.240> than<00:02:23.300> my<00:02:23.450> last<00:02:23.480> face

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
drown here much better than my last face

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.580 
drown here much better than my last face
I<00:02:24.050> think<00:02:24.290> might<00:02:25.040> end<00:02:25.250> up<00:02:25.340> moving<00:02:25.520> again<00:02:25.940> but

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
I think might end up moving again but

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.130 
I think might end up moving again but
definitely<00:02:27.590> good<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:27.950> have<00:02:28.070> this<00:02:28.340> base<00:02:28.580> that's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
definitely good to have this base that's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.720 
definitely good to have this base that's
secures<00:02:30.140> from<00:02:30.530> what<00:02:30.680> I<00:02:30.710> can<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:31.490> what<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.640> can

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
secures from what I can from what I can

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.900 
secures from what I can from what I can
tell<00:02:32.620> or<00:02:33.620> at<00:02:33.950> least<00:02:33.980> much<00:02:34.250> more<00:02:34.460> secure<00:02:34.760> than

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
tell or at least much more secure than

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.750 
tell or at least much more secure than
it<00:02:34.970> was<00:02:35.210> before<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:36.380> yeah<00:02:36.530> so<00:02:36.740> that's<00:02:36.920> my<00:02:37.580> new

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
it was before so yeah so that's my new

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.780 
it was before so yeah so that's my new
base<00:02:38.000> i'll<00:02:38.330> go<00:02:38.570> ahead<00:02:38.600> and<00:02:38.900> show<00:02:39.170> you<00:02:39.550> up<00:02:40.550> up

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
base i'll go ahead and show you up up

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.350 
base i'll go ahead and show you up up

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
here so i can show you my chest system

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.720 
here so i can show you my chest system
and<00:02:44.480> everything<00:02:44.540> like<00:02:44.780> that<00:02:45.850> there<00:02:46.850> we<00:02:46.910> go<00:02:47.530> um

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
very easily from here because i have it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.530 
very easily from here because i have it
all<00:02:54.320> secured<00:02:54.620> up<00:02:54.740> i<00:02:54.830> might<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:55.190> up<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.550> you

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
all secured up i might end up just you

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.120 
all secured up i might end up just you
know<00:02:56.630> when<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:56.959> want<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.230> get<00:02:57.320> out<00:02:57.440> just<00:02:57.590> dig<00:02:57.920> out

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
know when I want to get out just dig out

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.830 
know when I want to get out just dig out
from<00:02:58.160> here<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.880> then<00:02:58.970> just<00:02:59.150> plug<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.480> up<00:02:59.540> again

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
from here and then just plug it up again

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.020 
from here and then just plug it up again
because<00:02:59.930> it's<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.770> awful<00:03:01.550> or<00:03:01.730> anything<00:03:02.000> like

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
because it's not awful or anything like

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.220 
because it's not awful or anything like
that<00:03:02.150> I<00:03:02.300> just<00:03:02.390> need<00:03:02.570> to<00:03:02.630> find<00:03:02.750> a<00:03:02.870> good<00:03:02.959> pathway

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that I just need to find a good pathway

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.030 
that I just need to find a good pathway
and<00:03:03.680> then<00:03:04.580> plug<00:03:04.820> it<00:03:04.970> up<00:03:05.060> but<00:03:05.620> I'm<00:03:06.620> here<00:03:06.890> my

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
and then plug it up but I'm here my

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.500 
and then plug it up but I'm here my
chest<00:03:07.280> I<00:03:07.580> haven't<00:03:07.820> organized<00:03:08.120> them<00:03:08.300> at<00:03:08.390> all

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
chest I haven't organized them at all

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.010 
chest I haven't organized them at all
I've<00:03:09.170> just<00:03:09.230> I<00:03:10.120> was<00:03:11.120> like<00:03:11.270> no<00:03:11.510> gas<00:03:11.690> that<00:03:11.930> could

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
I've just I was like no gas that could

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.330 
I've just I was like no gas that could
be<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> problem<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:12.410> that's<00:03:12.620> I<00:03:12.860> had<00:03:13.100> these

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
be a problem but that's I had these

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.550 
be a problem but that's I had these
later<00:03:13.730> so<00:03:13.940> there's<00:03:14.090> nothing<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.450> those<00:03:14.570> yet<00:03:14.840> so

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
later so there's nothing in those yet so

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.800 
later so there's nothing in those yet so
here's<00:03:15.800> some<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.190> my<00:03:16.220> stuff<00:03:16.760> there<00:03:17.120> nothing

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
here's some of my stuff there nothing
