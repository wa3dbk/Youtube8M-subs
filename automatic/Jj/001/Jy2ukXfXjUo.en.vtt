you increasing your team's chemistry

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.839 
you increasing your team's chemistry
with<00:00:25.710> formation<00:00:26.189> cards<00:00:26.849> if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.630> see

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
with formation cards if you see

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.139 
with formation cards if you see
formation<00:00:29.849> cards<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.480> for<00:00:30.929> 42<00:00:31.410> or<00:00:31.679> 43<00:00:32.070> 3<00:00:32.579> or<00:00:32.820> 4

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
formation cards like for 42 or 43 3 or 4

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.340 
formation cards like for 42 or 43 3 or 4
12<00:00:33.600> 12<00:00:34.100> cost<00:00:35.100> a<00:00:35.280> lot<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> them<00:00:36.540> also<00:00:36.899> more

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
12 12 cost a lot some of them also more

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.639 
12 12 cost a lot some of them also more
than<00:00:37.590> 10k<00:00:38.100> credits<00:00:38.640> but<00:00:39.329> sometimes<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.620> need

than 10k credits but sometimes you need

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.290 
than 10k credits but sometimes you need
to<00:00:41.399> buy<00:00:41.750> them<00:00:42.750> because<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.649> cannot<00:00:43.950> find

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
to buy them because you cannot find

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
to buy them because you cannot find
always<00:00:45.300> players<00:00:45.809> with<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.980> favorite

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
always players with the favorite

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.920 
always players with the favorite
formation<00:00:48.420> like<00:00:48.570> yours<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.430> you<00:00:50.430> cannot<00:00:50.930> have

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
formation like yours and you cannot have

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.319 
formation like yours and you cannot have
a<00:00:51.960> team<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.680> every<00:00:53.399> player<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> red

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a team with every player with a red

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.619 
a team with every player with a red
formation<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.680> need<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> buy<00:00:56.329> formation<00:00:57.329> cars

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
formation you need to buy formation cars

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.689 
formation you need to buy formation cars
to<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.070> chemistry<00:00:59.640> ok<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.370> show<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
to get the chemistry ok I I can show you

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.820 
to get the chemistry ok I I can show you
a<00:01:03.260> way<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:06.630> increase<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.080> chemistry

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
a way to to increase your chemistry

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.429 
a way to to increase your chemistry
without<00:01:08.580> spending<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.540> many<00:01:09.689> credits<00:01:10.229> on

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
without spending so many credits on

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.990 
without spending so many credits on
formation<00:01:11.070> cards<00:01:11.750> basically<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:14.000> you

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
formation cards basically you can you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.350 
formation cards basically you can you
can<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.780> formations<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.939> of<00:01:17.939> your

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can make the formations of of your

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
can make the formations of of your
players<00:01:18.770> dark<00:01:19.770> green<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.610> means<00:01:20.850> not

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
players dark green that means not

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.200 
players dark green that means not
exactly<00:01:21.780> their<00:01:22.110> favorite<00:01:22.830> formation<00:01:23.580> but

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
exactly their favorite formation but

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.929 
exactly their favorite formation but
good<00:01:24.479> enough<00:01:24.720> for<00:01:25.020> your<00:01:25.140> chemistry<00:01:25.939> let's

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
good enough for your chemistry let's

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.380 
good enough for your chemistry let's
take<00:01:27.119> for<00:01:27.299> example<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.840> 433<00:01:28.549> I<00:01:29.549> really

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
take for example the 433 I really

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.899 
take for example the 433 I really
recommend<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:31.079> buy<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.290> four<00:01:31.770> three<00:01:32.220> two<00:01:32.640> one

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
recommend to buy the four three two one

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.780 
recommend to buy the four three two one
or<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.450> four<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.229> two<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.770> if<00:01:35.549> you<00:01:35.700> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
or the four three one two or if you have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.030 
or the four three one two or if you have
a<00:01:35.850> table<00:01:36.210> with<00:01:36.299> four<00:01:36.570> defenders<00:01:37.170> every

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
a table with four defenders every

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.450 
a table with four defenders every
formation<00:01:38.430> with<00:01:38.820> four<00:01:39.150> defenders<00:01:39.740> can<00:01:40.740> make

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
formation with four defenders can make

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.899 
formation with four defenders can make
your<00:01:41.820> chemistry<00:01:42.659> dark<00:01:43.020> green<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:44.369> same<00:01:44.670> with

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
your chemistry dark green the same with

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.160 
your chemistry dark green the same with
the<00:01:45.090> 442<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:46.200> you<00:01:46.470> buy<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.710> 4411<00:01:48.170> your

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the 442 if you buy the 4411 your

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.570 
the 442 if you buy the 4411 your
chemistry<00:01:49.770> is<00:01:50.040> okay<00:01:50.460> anyways<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.570> pay

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
chemistry is okay anyways and you pay

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.540 
chemistry is okay anyways and you pay
the<00:01:52.700> less<00:01:53.090> credits<00:01:53.750> on<00:01:53.990> them<00:01:54.290> so<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.310> was

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
the less credits on them so this was

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.890 
the less credits on them so this was
basically<00:01:55.820> my<00:01:56.240> very<00:01:57.020> short<00:01:57.740> first<00:01:58.370> tip<00:01:58.900> like

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
basically my very short first tip like

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.630
