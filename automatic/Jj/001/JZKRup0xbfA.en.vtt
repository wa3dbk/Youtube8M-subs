00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.109
 hopefully a new roof will come with it 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.680
 thought and also neat to them 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.300
 insulated 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.700
 Let's have a look at the matter 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.470
 An old mineral fiber insulation is 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.960
 already available but a bit thin 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.800
 there is also a thick 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.449
 insulation draufgesetzt well 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:30.449
 and how it looks over there in the new cultivation 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:32.000
 from a nice room and really good 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.170
 insulated as it looks 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:41.070
 We are curious how we are 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:43.320
 Immediately measure this very nice 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.649
 Old roof is 23 centimeters 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.590
 Insulation excellent insulation 18 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.809
 centimeters lie between the rafters 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.289
 another five centimeters will be under the 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.510
 rafters installed 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.180
 you already notice an advantage 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.760
 this over 30 degrees hot summer day 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.760
 it stays pleasantly cool in the roof room 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.429
 Let's look inside and out 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.950
 temperatures in the course of this day 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:20.380
 once exactly 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.479
 although the thermometer is outside at 36 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.770
 just climbs the heat comes 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.990
 not in the house 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.350
 through the insulation it stays round inside 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.299
 ten degrees cooler than outside 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.819
 at night it will then cool in while open 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.859
 window clearly off so is the living room 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.310
 and the roof well prepared for the roof 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:44.110
 next summer day 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:46.060
 and how does it look in winter? 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.590
 You can see these hardly insulated roofs 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.369
 yes, the heat losses with mere 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.679
 eye 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.780
 such pictures belong with good insulation 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.099
 the past because the heat 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.520
 stay in the rooms the snow stays 

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:02.379
 lying on the roof 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.179
 pay by the heating cost savings 

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:07.299
 the costs of roof insulation with 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.640
 safety back a good one 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.519
 Roof insulation works in summer and summer 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.130
 winter comfort throughout the year 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.560
 well thought and above all things well 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 this is insulated for the next 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.030
 Prepared 50 years again 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.459
 more information about roof insulation and 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.720
 on other topics of energy saving 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.650
 get it at the Hessian 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.650
 Energy saving action
