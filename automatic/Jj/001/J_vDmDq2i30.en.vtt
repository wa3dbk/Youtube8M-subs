one<00:00:43.469> hit<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:45.000> wasn't<00:00:45.180> good<00:00:45.420> also<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
one hit so here wasn't good also that I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
one hit so here wasn't good also that I
was<00:00:46.170> not<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.379> comfortable<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.129> car<00:00:47.309> it

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
was way too small so I think he would be

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.510 
was way too small so I think he would be
there<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.829> short<00:00:50.190> us<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.239> was<00:00:51.600> uh<00:00:52.280> the<00:00:53.280> knees

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
was a four of us going for the win and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.010 
was a four of us going for the win and
then<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.540> race<00:02:13.720> itself<00:02:14.050> was<00:02:14.890> just<00:02:16.020> control

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
then the race itself was just control

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.230 
then the race itself was just control
yep<00:02:17.380> I<00:02:17.590> could<00:02:18.190> manipulate<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.820> gap<00:02:18.970> quite

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
yep I could manipulate the gap quite

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.370 
yep I could manipulate the gap quite
comfortable<00:02:19.630> and<00:02:19.780> it<00:02:19.840> was<00:02:19.930> one<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.170> those<00:02:20.320> days

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
comfortable and it was one of those days

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.450 
comfortable and it was one of those days
where<00:02:20.710> everything<00:02:20.740> just<00:02:20.950> went<00:02:21.190> very<00:02:21.370> very

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
where everything just went very very

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.070 
where everything just went very very
well<00:02:21.640> a<00:02:21.760> lot<00:02:21.940> of<00:02:21.970> safety<00:02:22.300> cars<00:02:22.510> unfortunately

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
well a lot of safety cars unfortunately

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.330 
well a lot of safety cars unfortunately
which<00:02:23.230> it<00:02:23.350> would<00:02:23.440> have<00:02:23.560> been<00:02:23.620> nice<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:24.040> win<00:02:24.070> by

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
which it would have been nice to win by

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.580 
which it would have been nice to win by
a<00:02:24.370> big<00:02:24.580> margin<00:02:24.610> but<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:26.110> not<00:02:26.260> always<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
a big margin but it's not always the

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.040 
a big margin but it's not always the
case<00:02:26.620> nice<00:02:27.190> monster<00:02:27.550> exists<00:02:28.060> but<00:02:28.240> yeah<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
case nice monster exists but yeah so

circuit<00:03:11.560> I<00:03:11.769> think<00:03:12.310> we've<00:03:12.489> had<00:03:12.700> some<00:03:13.660> really

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
circuit I think we've had some really

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.030 
circuit I think we've had some really
good<00:03:13.930> times<00:03:14.200> on<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.440> track<00:03:14.620> actually<00:03:14.950> I<00:03:15.010> think

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
good times on the track actually I think

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.090 
good times on the track actually I think
that<00:03:15.310> said<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.820> racing<00:03:16.239> is<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.500> Jensen

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
that said of the racing is you Jensen

that said of the racing is you Jensen
there's<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.370> few<00:03:18.489> guys<00:03:18.640> obviously<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.180> racing

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
there's a few guys obviously the racing

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.090 
there's a few guys obviously the racing
can<00:03:19.570> be<00:03:19.660> really<00:03:19.900> really<00:03:19.989> hard<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.500> fair<00:03:20.920> and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
can be really really hard and fair and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.470 
can be really really hard and fair and
looking<00:03:21.370> at<00:03:21.489> more<00:03:21.730> a<00:03:21.910> bit<00:03:22.120> more<00:03:22.300> for<00:03:22.450> the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
looking at more a bit more for the

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.800 
looking at more a bit more for the
bigger<00:03:22.690> picture<00:03:22.930> let's<00:03:23.200> say<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:24.390> yeah<00:03:25.390> I<00:03:25.630> think

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
bigger picture let's say so yeah I think

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.680
