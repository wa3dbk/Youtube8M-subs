00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.160 
because um you know we had a great
Russian<00:01:32.340> attack<00:01:32.640> last<00:01:32.909> year<00:01:33.060> our<00:01:33.750> passing

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
Russian attack last year our passing

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.660 
Russian attack last year our passing
game<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.500> coming<00:01:34.770> along<00:01:34.979> towards<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.520> end<00:01:35.610> of

bring<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.130> lot<00:01:38.340> spread<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> field<00:01:39.299> for<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.659> an
