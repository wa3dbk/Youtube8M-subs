like<00:01:59.399> let's<00:01:59.610> see<00:01:59.700> where<00:01:59.850> throw<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.780> hit<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
like let's see where throw that we hit a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240 
like let's see where throw that we hit a
window<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.439> we'd<00:02:01.530> have<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.740> pay<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:02.070> money
