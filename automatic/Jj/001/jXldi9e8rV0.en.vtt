that that's what a bird of prey looks
like<00:01:52.740> when<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.040> swooping<00:01:53.399> down<00:01:53.430> Media<00:01:53.909> Mouse

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
like when it's swooping down Media Mouse

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
like when it's swooping down Media Mouse
so<00:01:56.630> anyway<00:02:04.250> look<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.909> never<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.360> her

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
so anyway look at that I never see her

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
so anyway look at that I never see her
you<00:02:06.750> know<00:02:06.840> pointing<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.259> birds<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.710> prey<00:02:07.979> yeah

yeah I guess you don't get that in

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.180 
yeah I guess you don't get that in
southeastern<00:02:10.229> Michigan<00:02:10.679> but<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.950> would<00:02:11.069> be

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
southeastern Michigan but that would be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.830 
southeastern Michigan but that would be
into<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.790> saw<00:02:11.940> birds<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.390> swooping

into that we saw birds like swooping
down<00:02:12.870> doing<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:14.069> do<00:02:14.129> okay<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:17.069> hms

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
down doing that they do okay the the hms

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.670 
down doing that they do okay the the hms

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
take a look at the pack it's a much

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.820 
take a look at the pack it's a much
thinner<00:02:33.030> box<00:02:33.390> they<00:02:33.840> actually<00:02:34.290> decided<00:02:34.620> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
thinner box they actually decided to

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.490 
thinner box they actually decided to
start<00:02:35.010> packaging<00:02:35.610> it<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:36.480> thicker<00:02:36.750> thicker

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
start packaging it be thicker thicker

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.080 
start packaging it be thicker thicker
box<00:02:37.830> I'm<00:02:38.040> sorry<00:02:38.250> yeah<00:02:38.550> they<00:02:38.790> started

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
box I'm sorry yeah they started

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.750 
box I'm sorry yeah they started
packaging<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.900> with<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.110> wings<00:02:40.319> down<00:02:40.560> so<00:02:41.400> I

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
packaging it with the wings down so I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.309 
packaging it with the wings down so I
think<00:02:41.879> it's<00:02:42.150> because<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.510> lane<00:02:42.660> yeah<00:02:43.170> it

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
think it's because of the lane yeah it

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.600 
think it's because of the lane yeah it
comes<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> don't<00:02:44.069> know<00:02:44.129> I<00:02:44.340> mean<00:02:44.519> you

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
comes to the I don't know I mean you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.430 
comes to the I don't know I mean you
could<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.879> stuck<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.629> you

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
could have stuck it in there because you

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.750 
could have stuck it in there because you
know<00:02:46.560> see<00:02:46.739> it<00:02:46.830> goes<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.160> packaging<00:02:47.610> like

let's<00:03:10.080> take<00:03:10.230> a<00:03:10.290> look<00:03:10.349> because<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.980> reason

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
let's take a look because and the reason

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.890 
let's take a look because and the reason
I<00:03:11.310> say<00:03:11.519> that<00:03:11.550> is<00:03:11.760> because<00:03:12.030> this<00:03:12.300> one<00:03:12.510> has<00:03:12.720> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
I say that is because this one has the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.199 
I say that is because this one has the
landing<00:03:13.230> gears<00:03:13.409> but<00:03:13.590> it's<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.800> old<00:03:13.950> style

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.720 

yeah<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.810> I<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.989> decided<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.069> change<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.580> so

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
yeah so I just decided to change it so

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.790 
yeah so I just decided to change it so
anyway<00:03:21.540> here<00:03:21.810> is<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.050> clear<00:03:22.260> bird<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.590> prey

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800
