finally the extreme close-up
too<00:01:04.379> much<00:01:04.559> credit<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.040> given<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.400> these<00:01:05.580> names

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
too much credit is given to these names

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.370 
too much credit is given to these names
because<00:01:06.300> they<00:01:06.450> aren't<00:01:06.600> exact<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> most

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
because they aren't exact and most

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.690 
because they aren't exact and most
people<00:01:07.680> don't<00:01:07.830> agree<00:01:08.010> on<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.190> they<00:01:08.430> mean<00:01:08.640> or

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
people don't agree on what they mean or

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.660 
people don't agree on what they mean or
even<00:01:09.060> use<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.330> same<00:01:09.570> words<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.550> if<00:01:11.550> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
even use the same words and if the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.040 
even use the same words and if the
character<00:01:12.000> needs<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.390> move<00:01:12.510> which<00:01:12.810> he<00:01:12.930> usually

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
character needs to move which he usually

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.280 
character needs to move which he usually
does<00:01:13.440> the<00:01:13.800> terms<00:01:14.010> become<00:01:14.340> meaningless

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
does the terms become meaningless

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.040 
does the terms become meaningless
so<00:01:16.290> all<00:01:16.440> shot<00:01:16.710> sizes<00:01:17.130> are<00:01:17.250> sort<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.900> here<00:01:18.900> we're

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
so all shot sizes are sort of here we're

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.670 
so all shot sizes are sort of here we're
sort<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.530> medium<00:01:19.830> close<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:21.530> quicker<00:01:22.530> and

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
sort of in a medium close a quicker and

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.380 
sort of in a medium close a quicker and
more<00:01:22.950> precise<00:01:23.310> way<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.580> communicate<00:01:23.910> shot

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
more precise way to communicate shot

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
more precise way to communicate shot
sizes<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.140> simply<00:01:25.440> walk<00:01:25.560> over<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.009> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sizes is to simply walk over to the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.680 
sizes is to simply walk over to the
character<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.700> physically<00:01:27.119> show<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.509> top

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
character and physically show the top

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.880 
character and physically show the top
and<00:01:27.869> bottom<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.500> frame<00:01:28.710> should

when<00:01:31.979> picking<00:01:32.159> shot<00:01:32.490> sizes<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.970> useful

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
when picking shot sizes a useful

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.790 
when picking shot sizes a useful
convention<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.050> avoid<00:01:34.380> cropping

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:34.800 
convention is to avoid cropping

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.850 
convention is to avoid cropping
characters<00:01:35.190> at<00:01:35.340> leg<00:01:35.490> joints<00:01:36.710> here<00:01:37.710> we're

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
characters at leg joints here we're

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.230 
characters at leg joints here we're
cutting<00:01:38.100> them<00:01:38.159> off<00:01:38.340> at<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.580> knees<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:39.060> can

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
cutting them off at the knees which can

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.109 
cutting them off at the knees which can
make<00:01:39.330> them<00:01:39.420> look<00:01:39.570> amputated<00:01:40.260> so<00:01:40.909> let's<00:01:41.909> crop

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
make them look amputated so let's crop

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.930 
make them look amputated so let's crop
them<00:01:42.300> in<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.479> middle<00:01:42.690> of<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> thighs<00:01:43.080> if<00:01:43.940> we

them in the middle of the thighs if we

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.430 
them in the middle of the thighs if we
need<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.300> any<00:01:45.420> wider<00:01:45.690> it's<00:01:45.990> better<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> go

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440
