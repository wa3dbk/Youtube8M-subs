00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
same in the other box but his the

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.130 
same in the other box but his the
referees<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.530> box<00:01:49.740> he's<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> bossy<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.329> his

football<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:54.590> spoke<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.759> Diego<00:01:57.750> Lugano<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
football I spoke with a Diego Lugano and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:04.160

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
so your thought is if one penalty is

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.570 
so your thought is if one penalty is
given<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.259> other<00:02:07.350> penalty<00:02:07.829> should<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.220> given

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
given the other penalty should be given

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.330 
given the other penalty should be given
as<00:02:08.700> well

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340
