is that way your ribbon will not absorb

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:30.009

and<00:00:41.480> I<00:00:42.200> just<00:00:42.440> want<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.680> measure<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.070> height<00:00:43.280> of

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
and I just want to measure the height of

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.050 
and I just want to measure the height of
the<00:00:44.000> cakes<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:45.500> it's<00:00:45.650> roughly<00:00:45.920> about<00:00:46.160> 4<00:00:46.670> inches

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
the cakes so it's roughly about 4 inches

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.200 
the cakes so it's roughly about 4 inches
tall<00:00:48.100> 4<00:00:49.100> inches<00:00:49.340> tall<00:00:49.550> on<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.730> other<00:00:49.910> side<00:00:50.090> as

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
tall 4 inches tall on the other side as

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.420 
tall 4 inches tall on the other side as
well<00:00:50.390> so<00:00:50.600> that's<00:00:51.110> going<00:00:51.260> to<00:00:51.320> be<00:00:51.410> 8<00:00:51.620> plus<00:00:52.220> 8

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
well so that's going to be 8 plus 8

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.030 
well so that's going to be 8 plus 8
that's<00:00:52.700> going<00:00:52.820> to<00:00:52.880> be<00:00:52.970> 16<00:00:53.420> inches<00:00:54.020> in<00:00:54.320> length

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
that's going to be 16 inches in length

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.800 
that's going to be 16 inches in length

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
the ribbon just like that we'll go

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:01.440 
the ribbon just like that we'll go
across<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.539> other<00:01:52.659> side<00:01:52.810> as<00:01:52.929> well<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:01.329> can

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
we've got one solid color but you could

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.820 
we've got one solid color but you could
do<00:02:08.440> many<00:02:08.979> different<00:02:09.489> thicknesses<00:02:10.739> hang<00:02:11.739> it

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
do many different thicknesses hang it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.100 
do many different thicknesses hang it
right<00:02:11.950> there<00:02:12.299> we<00:02:13.299> smooth<00:02:13.540> it<00:02:13.660> right<00:02:13.720> across

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
right there we smooth it right across

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:26.530 
right there we smooth it right across
and<00:02:18.090> down

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:42.110 

we'll<00:02:27.540> add<00:02:27.689> one<00:02:27.959> more<00:02:28.230> strip

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120
