 when he entered navas exciting of merida one of the most exciting of my 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.889
 lifetime 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.949
 my love to him 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.740
 lending to this club is special by itself does not work for every player 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.300
 you can get to play in in this area is 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.650
 really special come back and a club 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.180
 that is as nice as this one because there is not a tournament that keeps the 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.550
 tradition like this one and because it probably becomes more important 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750
 of the world I do not follow very toledo see here and of course whenever I come to me 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.030
 that's a pleasure 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.090
 they have seen again 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.739
 the end of 2008 once yes or no 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 Tena canterano I have not seen 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560
 many times I have said many times 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.600
 points 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.890
 and sometimes I've seen enough quite juicy 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.870
 in the transition 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.040
 intel ground to grass with him as if this year because the cuil was seen playing 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.570
 pretty well the physical feathers are forgotten is moving forward and no longer 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.580
 you know what 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.230
 after a season of land 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.230
 very very good but also hard because I played a lot 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.909
 and after getting something that for me was a dream of o'gara m 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.860
 we have voted in 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.110
 roma madrid well especially after andolan garros then 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.619
 a tad of tension slump you have no iron grass change 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.549
 radio source the voice is aggressive and romance beginning 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.750
 muscularly 3 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 r 112 dunn the delegate decision is difficult 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.810
 Today I'm still trying to adapt every day 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.470
 but I'm working hard to try to get the best prepared 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.450
 winter tournament zone 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.560
 dallas work 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.570
 because you're working hard I think that the worker was in the network 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 in the testimony of it because robredo and there has been a moment 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.119
 a little bit hallucinated about how you are paying the ball, no, they are not either 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.500
 there were two wells with ball 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 The intensity 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.180
 well by the way I tell you 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.829
 voters blanket the line to keep playing aggressive and 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.210
 it's not a tournament in turn idea of ​​you can clue the least to where 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.960
 low the intensity goes up after out because 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.289
 the sag affects too much everything 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.729
 they are very little support to which you have 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.529
 with which I think that 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:16.149
 but good things 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.319
 also pedro anytime you can about Tehran says like the grass 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.159
 although the physical problems rafael ortho the touches removed your fault in the 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.159
 past evan will force me to dosed 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:31.019
 well I do what I can to try 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.189
 as high as possible 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 trying to be as healthy as possible do not know what 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.120
 I believe that it is means of life means and fixing us can not give to all sides 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.559
 I've always tried it but I think 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:49.219
 what citizen bahamonde was not cited to make it effective polished little 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:51.849
 over the years worship or more when this 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.519
 better let's see when you can force and when it does not help us to import not 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.989
 you can be up there can be given where there are 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.140
 not possible to be as good as possible in each tournament times 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:06.859
 that is not my thing is that it is wrong phelan is part of him of the game of 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.790
 part of laporta the statements filmmakers then 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.910
 that home lit from a bit of maybe the mistakes of the past to force it 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.779
 too good moment is fine 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.159
 we felt so competitive it thrills us when many people 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:24.049
 of the things not and but still playing of him 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:29.929
 nor am I this year in Montecarlo de 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.559
 the earthquake you can not hundred 

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:35.559
 what better to improve areas and 

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:39.599
 later and it has been better c but 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.139
 and if you're going to steal babies at first it can happen because you do not know what 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.599
 it would have been better to take out 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.639
 this is not football that does not know more or the pair after playing here 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:50.949
 my calendar approach 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.189
 with a delay for the areas in question 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:57.189
 after all in the tournaments, not the expense of defense in the matches that 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.290
 if you win guaman if you want to play less and this depends 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:05.069
 being here physically well depending on you up to where 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.009
 an interest that can be 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:12.209
 it's not a very complicated dollar tournament a day the cities made here but 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.599
 I do not feel well according to a specialist here 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.599
 according to summary results 

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.009
 he has done very well but I am also aware is the surface costs me 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.289
 adapt 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.090
 and I need to try to pass 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.740
 in reality how it has to be true and is complicated 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.509
 and then p 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.120
 the first week much more 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.060
 to play that the second later he could get to gas o'malley direct now 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.629
 plays a lot haiti time the second track is much more devastated 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:41.639
 and it's easier to run than the hardest to believe in that on this surface 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:47.219
 when they would run you support you come back easier 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:50.819
 of the first days and that the track is complicated and and it's not easy
