00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
so with this rope I can really reach out

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.990 
so with this rope I can really reach out
there<00:01:20.990> get<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.530> hold<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.920> those<00:01:22.010> cattle<00:01:22.490> get

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
there get a hold of those cattle get

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.390 
there get a hold of those cattle get
that<00:01:23.270> knot<00:01:23.540> tight<00:01:23.570> behind<00:01:24.110> the<00:01:24.410> horns<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:25.280> I

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
that knot tight behind the horns and I

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.220 
that knot tight behind the horns and I
can<00:01:25.640> also<00:01:25.820> turn<00:01:26.210> them<00:01:26.390> cattle<00:01:26.780> off<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.930> lot

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
can also turn them cattle off a lot

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.530 
can also turn them cattle off a lot
quicker<00:01:27.500> with<00:01:28.190> this<00:01:28.460> rope<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.880> still<00:01:29.270> have<00:01:29.510> a

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
quicker with this rope and still have a

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.740 
quicker with this rope and still have a
good<00:01:29.780> feel<00:01:30.020> for<00:01:30.050> it<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:31.130> choose<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.090> 3<00:01:32.390> strand

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
good feel for it I choose the 3 strand

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.990 
good feel for it I choose the 3 strand
just<00:01:33.020> for<00:01:33.440> that<00:01:33.590> fact<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.310> know<00:01:34.670> when<00:01:34.880> you're

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
just for that fact you know when you're

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.760 
just for that fact you know when you're
open<00:01:35.360> cattle<00:01:35.750> when<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:35.960> ride<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.440> hip<00:01:36.620> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
open cattle when you ride to the hip and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.940 
open cattle when you ride to the hip and
you're<00:01:36.890> open<00:01:37.220> cattle

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
you're open cattle

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.950 
you're open cattle
you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> ride<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.490> rope<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.300> little<00:01:39.600> older

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
you can ride a rope it's a little older

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.590 
you can ride a rope it's a little older
got<00:01:40.260> some<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.560> fuzz<00:01:40.890> on<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> when<00:01:42.300> you<00:01:42.420> throw

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
got some more fuzz on it when you throw

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.570 
got some more fuzz on it when you throw
a<00:01:42.690> line<00:01:42.930> we<00:01:43.590> need<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.830> be<00:01:43.979> able<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.190> control

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
a line we need to be able to control

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.260 
a line we need to be able to control
that<00:01:44.640> rope

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that rope

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.510 
that rope
so<00:01:45.450> basically<00:01:46.200> when<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.440> break<00:01:46.740> these<00:01:46.979> ropes<00:01:47.220> in

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
