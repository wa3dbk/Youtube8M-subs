00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:36.130 

Big<00:00:00.390> Ed<00:00:00.539> sweet

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.319 

I<00:00:36.260> think<00:00:36.829> the<00:00:37.040> original<00:00:37.399> game<00:00:37.430> was<00:00:37.760> incredibly

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
I think the original game was incredibly

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.270 
I think the original game was incredibly
compelling<00:00:38.660> because<00:00:38.930> you<00:00:39.470> could<00:00:39.770> play<00:00:40.010> all

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
compelling because you could play all

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.680 
compelling because you could play all
three<00:00:40.520> characters<00:00:40.970> so<00:00:41.120> you<00:00:41.180> kind<00:00:41.480> of<00:00:41.540> got<00:00:41.660> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
three characters so you kind of got the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.510 
three characters so you kind of got the
story<00:00:42.079> from<00:00:42.200> different<00:00:42.739> perspectives<00:00:42.829> you've

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
story from different perspectives you've

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.920 
story from different perspectives you've
got<00:00:43.700> your<00:00:44.000> marine<00:00:44.329> story<00:00:44.600> which<00:00:44.900> was

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930 
got your marine story which was

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.869 
got your marine story which was
fantastic<00:00:45.199> but<00:00:45.920> also<00:00:46.100> we<00:00:46.370> allowed<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.760> player

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
fantastic but also we allowed the player

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.850 
fantastic but also we allowed the player
to<00:00:47.000> see<00:00:47.629> the<00:00:47.780> world<00:00:47.960> from<00:00:48.230> the<00:00:48.350> Predators

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
to see the world from the Predators

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.439 
to see the world from the Predators
perspective<00:00:49.430> as<00:00:49.820> well<00:00:49.970> as<00:00:50.090> the<00:00:50.180> aliens

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
perspective as well as the aliens

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.910 
perspective as well as the aliens
perspective<00:00:50.899> and<00:00:51.020> get<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> different<00:00:51.530> part<00:00:51.770> of

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
perspective and get a different part of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.860 
perspective and get a different part of
the<00:00:51.980> same<00:00:52.250> story<00:00:55.449> technologies<00:00:56.449> moved<00:00:56.660> on<00:00:56.839> a

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
the same story technologies moved on a

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.380 
the same story technologies moved on a
long<00:00:57.019> time<00:00:57.379> in<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.100> last<00:00:58.309> 10<00:00:58.519> years<00:00:58.670> visually

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
long time in the last 10 years visually

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.970 
long time in the last 10 years visually
we<00:00:59.690> were<00:00:59.750> able<00:00:59.930> to<00:01:00.170> do<00:01:00.320> the<00:01:00.589> kinds<00:01:00.620> of<00:01:00.890> things

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
we were able to do the kinds of things

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.770 
we were able to do the kinds of things
we<00:01:01.220> only<00:01:01.339> dreamt<00:01:01.670> about<00:01:01.879> being<00:01:02.059> able<00:01:02.390> to<00:01:02.600> do

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
we only dreamt about being able to do

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.190 
we only dreamt about being able to do
back<00:01:03.110> on<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:03.320> original<00:01:03.860> game<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.900> level<00:01:06.170> of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
back on the original game the level of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.960 
back on the original game the level of
detail<00:01:06.259> in<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.800> environments<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.580> lighting

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
detail in the environments the lighting

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.330 
detail in the environments the lighting
effects<00:01:08.270> we<00:01:08.450> can<00:01:08.630> use<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:09.320> facial<00:01:09.770> animation

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
effects we can use the facial animation

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.820 
effects we can use the facial animation
on<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.610> characters<00:01:11.300> it<00:01:11.720> all<00:01:11.899> goes<00:01:12.289> towards

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
on the characters it all goes towards

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.850 
on the characters it all goes towards
creating<00:01:13.039> a<00:01:13.460> more<00:01:13.640> intense<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.200> realistic

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
creating a more intense and realistic

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.389 
creating a more intense and realistic
and<00:01:16.190> compelling<00:01:16.759> experience<00:01:18.399> obviously

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
and compelling experience obviously

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.680 
and compelling experience obviously
having<00:01:19.789> done<00:01:19.910> the<00:01:20.000> original<00:01:20.360> version<00:01:20.450> the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
having done the original version the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.999 
having done the original version the
game<00:01:20.869> we've<00:01:21.020> got<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.170> very<00:01:21.289> solid<00:01:21.800> gameplay

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
game we've got a very solid gameplay

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.919 
game we've got a very solid gameplay
foundation<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.090> what<00:01:23.300> we<00:01:23.420> have<00:01:23.570> to<00:01:23.690> do<00:01:23.810> is

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
foundation but what we have to do is

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.940 
foundation but what we have to do is
improve<00:01:24.289> things<00:01:24.679> and<00:01:25.130> innovate<00:01:25.759> where<00:01:25.940> we<00:01:26.030> can

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
improve things and innovate where we can

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.620 
improve things and innovate where we can
the<00:01:27.950> atmosphere<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.640> original<00:01:28.970> game<00:01:29.000> was

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
the atmosphere of the original game was

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.630 
the atmosphere of the original game was
obviously<00:01:30.140> a<00:01:30.229> really<00:01:30.440> big<00:01:30.679> part<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.100> it<00:01:31.250> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
obviously a really big part of it the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.520 
obviously a really big part of it the
fear<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.119> dark<00:01:32.330> is<00:01:32.479> very<00:01:32.720> primal<00:01:33.350> human

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
fear of the dark is very primal human

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.529 
fear of the dark is very primal human
thing<00:01:34.009> and<00:01:34.310> that<00:01:34.490> continues<00:01:35.000> through<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.420> this

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
thing and that continues through to this

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.180 
thing and that continues through to this
one<00:01:35.780> but<00:01:35.990> we're<00:01:36.140> able<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.619> deliver<00:01:36.979> an

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
one but we're able to deliver an

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.710 
one but we're able to deliver an
entirely<00:01:37.520> new<00:01:37.670> level<00:01:38.060> of<00:01:38.360> sophistication

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
entirely new level of sophistication

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.780 
entirely new level of sophistication
with<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.619> technology<00:01:39.950> we<00:01:40.189> have<00:01:40.490> available

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
with the technology we have available

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.150 
with the technology we have available
now

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
now

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.410 
now
really<00:01:44.160> excited<00:01:44.400> me<00:01:44.610> some<00:01:44.940> people<00:01:45.180> are<00:01:45.240> still

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
really excited me some people are still

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.790 
really excited me some people are still

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
represented in this one people ask how

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.560 
represented in this one people ask how
long<00:02:11.400> as<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.610> game<00:02:11.760> being<00:02:11.970> in<00:02:12.090> development

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:12.570 
long as the game being in development

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.970 
long as the game being in development
and<00:02:12.720> it's<00:02:12.870> been<00:02:13.020> something<00:02:13.350> over<00:02:13.590> two<00:02:13.770> years

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and it's been something over two years

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.620 
and it's been something over two years
