00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.530 
know once I do that first base coat I
try<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.070> lay<00:01:24.250> down<00:01:24.280> the<00:01:24.790> like<00:01:24.970> really<00:01:25.300> quick

and then I do a little heavier in the
inside<00:01:28.690> parts<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.080> the<00:01:29.200> rim<00:01:29.409> or<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.450> inside

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
inside parts of the rim or in the inside

inside parts of the rim or in the inside
yeah<00:01:31.960> it's<00:01:32.200> a<00:01:32.440> good<00:01:33.100> rim<00:01:33.549> no<00:01:34.479> once<00:01:34.840> you<00:01:34.960> do<00:01:35.140> that

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
yeah it's a good rim no once you do that

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.680 
yeah it's a good rim no once you do that
you<00:01:35.650> want<00:01:35.830> to<00:01:35.890> try<00:01:36.040> to<00:01:36.100> put<00:01:36.340> any<00:01:36.580> size<00:01:36.760> I<00:01:37.150> want

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.859 
somewhat heavy but just remember never
to<00:01:44.890> ever<00:01:45.190> pause<00:01:45.580> that's<00:01:46.390> something<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.840> I

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
to ever pause that's something that I

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.270 
to ever pause that's something that I
always<00:01:47.049> noticed<00:01:47.409> that<00:01:47.440> people<00:01:47.619> always<00:01:47.979> do

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
always noticed that people always do

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.620 
always noticed that people always do
they<00:01:48.430> always<00:01:48.610> end<00:01:48.850> up<00:01:48.940> pausing<00:01:49.360> while<00:01:49.510> they're

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
they always end up pausing while they're

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:50.580 
they always end up pausing while they're
spraying<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.110> that's<00:01:50.229> when<00:01:50.350> you<00:01:50.409> get<00:01:50.530> that

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
spraying and that's when you get that

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.859 
spraying and that's when you get that
overspray<00:01:51.310> or<00:01:51.760> you<00:01:51.970> get<00:01:52.119> that<00:01:52.150> little<00:01:52.360> bubbly

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
overspray or you get that little bubbly

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.680 
overspray or you get that little bubbly
or<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.380> don't<00:01:53.530> want<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:54.360> so<00:01:55.360> as<00:01:55.510> always

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
or you don't want that so as always

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.050 
or you don't want that so as always
I<00:01:56.049> recommend<00:01:56.290> just

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
I recommend just

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.660 
I recommend just
always<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.439> know<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.040> spray<00:01:59.310> straight

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
always you know when you spray straight

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.149 
always you know when you spray straight
through<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> make<00:02:00.689> sure<00:02:00.720> if<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.680> will<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.009> to

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
through it make sure if you will have to

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.429 
through it make sure if you will have to
stop<00:02:02.430> because<00:02:03.210> rings<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.930> tire<00:02:04.140> doesn't

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
stop because rings have to tire doesn't

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.539 
stop because rings have to tire doesn't
matter<00:02:04.649> if<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.799> can<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.009> of<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> tire<00:02:05.340> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
matter if you can some of the tire the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.779 
matter if you can some of the tire the
tire<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.970> can<00:02:06.000> actually<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.890> remove<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.160> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
tire you can actually just remove it so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.100 
tire you can actually just remove it so
you<00:02:09.090> know<00:02:09.179> towards<00:02:09.509> after<00:02:09.720> you're<00:02:09.840> done<00:02:09.929> doing

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you know towards after you're done doing

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.050 
you know towards after you're done doing
all<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.380> plastic<00:02:10.739> dip<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.550> know<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:11.940> guys

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
all the plastic dip you know if you guys

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.370 
all the plastic dip you know if you guys
want<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> hit<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.599> like<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.020> looks<00:02:13.170> fine

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to hit it like that it looks fine

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.820 
want to hit it like that it looks fine
right

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
right

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.490 
right
so<00:02:14.190> but<00:02:14.760> what<00:02:14.880> we're<00:02:15.000> doing<00:02:15.030> my<00:02:16.019> friend<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.380> at

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
so but what we're doing my friend one at

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.710 
so but what we're doing my friend one at
the<00:02:16.590> Gloucester<00:02:16.769> fire<00:02:17.160> so<00:02:17.400> make<00:02:17.519> it<00:02:17.580> look

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
the Gloucester fire so make it look

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.940 
the Gloucester fire so make it look
someone<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.870> cloth<00:02:19.200> bag<00:02:19.349> instead<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.769> like

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
someone like a cloth bag instead of like

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.839 
someone like a cloth bag instead of like
a<00:02:19.980> flat<00:02:20.310> black

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
a flat black

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.449 
a flat black
so<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.450> classifier<00:02:21.900> I<00:02:22.200> got<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> got<00:02:22.620> a<00:02:22.650> head

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
so the classifier I got a got a head

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:29.270 
so the classifier I got a got a head
boys<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.880> about<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.360> want<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.870> say<00:02:26.390> $8.99<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:29.220> if

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
boys for about I want to say $8.99 so if

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
boys for about I want to say $8.99 so if
a<00:02:29.370> boys<00:02:29.580> desolate<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.569> why<00:02:30.780> they<00:02:30.900> started

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
a boys desolate to know why they started

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.840 
a boys desolate to know why they started
to<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.650> before<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.069> would<00:02:32.220> get<00:02:32.400> everything<00:02:32.610> from

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
to so before I would get everything from

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.460 
to so before I would get everything from
Home<00:02:33.030> Depot<00:02:33.060> but<00:02:33.510> home<00:02:33.720> dip<00:02:33.840> only<00:02:33.959> has<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
Home Depot but home dip only has the

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.100 
Home Depot but home dip only has the
actual<00:02:34.890> just<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.340> regular<00:02:35.640> flat<00:02:35.880> black<00:02:36.090> one<00:02:36.299> but

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
actual just a regular flat black one but

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.380 
actual just a regular flat black one but
don't<00:02:37.410> get<00:02:37.500> me<00:02:37.590> wrong<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.970> black<00:02:39.150> looks

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
don't get me wrong that black looks

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720 
don't get me wrong that black looks
great<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:40.170> classifier<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.069> just<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.430> make<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
great the classifier is just to make it

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.970 
great the classifier is just to make it
look<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:41.940> much<00:02:42.150> better<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:43.890> know

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
look that much better and you know

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
look that much better and you know
that's<00:02:44.190> practically<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.640> ten<00:02:44.790> on<00:02:44.880> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
that's practically a ten on the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.339 
that's practically a ten on the
classifier<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.599> just<00:02:45.750> have<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.930> put<00:02:46.110> one

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
classifier you just have to put one

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.170 
classifier you just have to put one
really<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:46.860> simple<00:02:47.190> coat<00:02:47.400> you<00:02:47.940> don't<00:02:48.090> have

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
really really simple coat you don't have

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.000 
really really simple coat you don't have
to<00:02:48.299> put<00:02:48.450> many<00:02:48.780> coats<00:02:49.019> on<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.470> one<00:02:49.680> simple

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
to put many coats on it just one simple

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.589 
to put many coats on it just one simple
code<00:02:50.220> will<00:02:50.340> keep<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.700> from<00:02:50.790> fading<00:02:51.120> too<00:02:51.390> much

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
code will keep it from fading too much

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.860 
code will keep it from fading too much
and<00:02:51.840> it<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.620> look<00:02:52.709> good<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:54.060> basically<00:02:54.360> uses

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
and it will look good so basically uses

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.449 
and it will look good so basically uses
this<00:02:54.959> whole<00:02:55.140> process<00:02:55.410> against<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.040> whole<00:02:56.220> car

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
this whole process against the whole car

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.690 
this whole process against the whole car
on<00:02:56.819> every<00:02:57.510> single<00:02:57.690> rim<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.700> that's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
on every single rim and that's

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.880 
on every single rim and that's
practically<00:03:00.360> it<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.290> know<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.739> give

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
practically it and you know just to give

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.610 
practically it and you know just to give
you<00:03:01.950> guys<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.130> quick<00:03:02.340> little<00:03:02.430> thing<00:03:03.079> we<00:03:04.079> get

you guys a quick little thing we get
also<00:03:04.829> the<00:03:05.040> grill<00:03:05.630> so<00:03:06.630> you'll<00:03:07.109> see<00:03:07.320> it<00:03:07.380> right

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
also the grill so you'll see it right

also the grill so you'll see it right
now<00:03:07.560> I'm<00:03:07.920> gonna<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.489> you'll<00:03:08.670> see<00:03:08.700> look<00:03:08.940> at<00:03:09.060> it

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
now I'm gonna do you'll see look at it

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.520 
now I'm gonna do you'll see look at it
is<00:03:09.299> with<00:03:09.570> low<00:03:09.690> light<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.170> this<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.410> with

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
is with low light and this is with

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.990 
is with low light and this is with
bright<00:03:10.829> light<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.609> you<00:03:11.670> can<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
bright light so you can see the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.280 
bright light so you can see the
difference<00:03:12.329> how<00:03:12.450> it<00:03:12.630> looks<00:03:12.810> whether<00:03:13.049> it's

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
difference how it looks whether it's

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.080 
difference how it looks whether it's
right<00:03:13.500> here<00:03:13.680> gonna<00:03:13.829> direct<00:03:14.100> me<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.850> if<00:03:15.000> it's

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
right here gonna direct me or if it's

not it looks good you know here we did
the<00:03:17.609> Chevy<00:03:17.940> emblem<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.390> the<00:03:18.420> center<00:03:18.780> as<00:03:18.930> well

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
the Chevy emblem in the center as well

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.410 
the Chevy emblem in the center as well
so<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.799> can<00:03:20.069> see<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.120> looks<00:03:21.209> pretty

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
so you can see that and it looks pretty

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.420 
so you can see that and it looks pretty
clean<00:03:21.720> but<00:03:21.959> no<00:03:22.380> blah<00:03:22.560> Samaritans<00:03:23.069> off<00:03:23.220> that
