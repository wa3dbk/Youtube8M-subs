complicit in what's happening in Israel

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.319 
complicit in what's happening in Israel
because<00:00:31.920> they're<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.520> standing<00:00:32.940> up<00:00:33.030> against

education<00:00:35.940> establishments<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.440> think<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
education establishments and I think the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.690 
education establishments and I think the
the<00:00:38.280> fact<00:00:38.520> that<00:00:38.610> LSE<00:00:39.059> had<00:00:39.270> investments<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.050> BAE

the fact that LSE had investments in BAE

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.190 
the fact that LSE had investments in BAE
meant<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.300> educating<00:00:42.870> people<00:00:43.140> at

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
meant that it was educating people at

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.470 
meant that it was educating people at
one<00:00:43.379> side<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.800> world<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> fronting<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
one side of the world and fronting the

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.420 
one side of the world and fronting the
blowing<00:00:46.020> of<00:00:46.140> people<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> other<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.340> we

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
blowing of people on the other and we

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.979 
blowing of people on the other and we
wanted<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> point<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.870> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
wanted to make the point that this is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.410 
wanted to make the point that this is
basically<00:00:49.399> hypocritical<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.670> lot<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.149> people

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
basically hypocritical a lot of people

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
basically hypocritical a lot of people
come<00:00:51.570> up<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.960> us<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
come up to us and this is one of the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.130 
come up to us and this is one of the
arguments<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:54.149> are<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.420> many<00:00:54.539> people<00:00:54.809> dying

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
arguments there are so many people dying

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.020 
arguments there are so many people dying
in<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.530> phones<00:00:55.829> involved<00:00:56.399> but<00:00:56.489> why<00:00:56.640> don't<00:00:56.699> you

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
in the phones involved but why don't you

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.369 
in the phones involved but why don't you
why<00:00:57.360> didn't<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.629> complain<00:00:57.780> for<00:00:58.050> them<00:00:58.199> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
why didn't you complain for them and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.900 
why didn't you complain for them and
said<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:59.190> think<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> reason<00:00:59.789> that<00:00:59.850> people

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
said and I think the reason that people

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
said and I think the reason that people
ask<00:01:00.270> them<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.600> question<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.109> not<00:01:01.289> because

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
ask them this question is not because

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.720 
ask them this question is not because
they<00:01:01.710> want<00:01:01.890> me<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> go<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:02.670> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
they want me to go out there and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.399 
they want me to go out there and
campaign<00:01:03.030> for<00:01:03.239> everyone<00:01:03.629> because<00:01:04.110> that's

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
campaign for everyone because that's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.100 
campaign for everyone because that's
what<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:04.860> do<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.309> only<00:01:05.780> they're<00:01:06.780> asking

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
what I would do if I only they're asking

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.870 
what I would do if I only they're asking
this<00:01:07.200> question<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.830> I<00:01:07.860> stop<00:01:08.280> complaining

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
this question so that I stop complaining
