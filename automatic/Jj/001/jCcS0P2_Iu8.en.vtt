really quick mass effect 3 video
basically<00:00:06.390> showing<00:00:06.990> you<00:00:07.290> my<00:00:07.560> mass<00:00:07.799> effect<00:00:08.099> 3

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
basically showing you my mass effect 3

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.000 
basically showing you my mass effect 3
engine<00:00:08.580> which<00:00:08.790> is<00:00:09.030> also<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.809> best<00:00:10.230> possible

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
engine which is also the best possible

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.549 
engine which is also the best possible
ending<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.670> can<00:00:11.820> get<00:00:11.969> out<00:00:12.120> of<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.509> think<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.110> 16

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
ending you can get out of I think the 16

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
possible endings in mass effect 3 and on

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.890 
possible endings in mass effect 3 and on
screen<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.039> like<00:00:17.279> how<00:00:17.490> many<00:00:17.670> war<00:00:17.850> assets<00:00:18.720> i

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
screen now is like how many war assets i

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.050 
screen now is like how many war assets i
had<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.920> like<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.220> effective<00:00:20.640> readiness

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
had and all like the effective readiness

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
had and all like the effective readiness
and<00:00:21.240> stuff<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.660> which<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.289> sort<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and stuff like that which is sort of

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.250 
and stuff like that which is sort of
what<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.519> need<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.300> get<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.869> ended<00:00:25.170> I

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
don't think you need the effective ready

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.939 
don't think you need the effective ready
at<00:00:26.880> readiness<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.810> hundred<00:00:27.869> percent<00:00:28.080> but

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
at readiness at one hundred percent but

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.140 
at readiness at one hundred percent but
