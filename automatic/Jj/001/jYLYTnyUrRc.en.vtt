 Polini official pilots belonging 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 to the open but we are ready to go 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:29.250
 race 1 good part of ram perry queues 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.619
 immediately courses while leaving less 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 brilliant of castellini who loses one 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.930
 position 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.059
 we will then see in favor of which 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.160
 pilot we said during the tour of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.350
 reconnaissance see the coaches arch that not 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 he managed to leave because of 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.530
 break of the risk well of Raffaele 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.100
 neo see number 81 gabellini attacked 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:58.039
 from nicolò castellini number 47 which in 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.600
 acceleration 10 almost to excel 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.960
 beautiful attack on gabellines 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.270
 castellini which maneuver he managed to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.100
 be spared from the attack of 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.260
 gabellini has wisely opened and then has 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.439
 closed immediately and it seems to me what time it is 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.869
 gurrieri in fourth position among other things 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.759
 first of the riders in the mono category 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.610
 then in command of the mono category 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:25.680
 carlo gurrieri we recognize from 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.490
 black livery range then picket always 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:34.110
 motorcycle rider in second position 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:37.380
 In the meantime, let's go back to the head with the tiring machines 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.270
 courses meanwhile we go to see that in 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.310
 sit and evolution world in fourth 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.200
 the attack was very good 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:49.700
 of courses but then extends the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.110
 detached and fails to turn tight 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.979
 he immediately answers tirferri but the two are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.100
 still there a full fight let's see 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.600
 where it is found in castellini meanwhile 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:05.549
 castellini and third force in the field the 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.989

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.690
 Polini official still good his 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.870
 test 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.569
 and meanwhile the attack has occurred 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.590

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.340
 performance in front of carlo gurrieri 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.310
 the curves are ending to attack 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.780
 so watch out of the curve now 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.450
 that chicane 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.930
 all this while you were in charge 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.690
 of the mono we are to the last curve 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.660
 last curve now courses test us 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.849
 maximum gas inside nothing to do 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:58.170
 but excellent proof for both the level 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:59.519
 as always and in the meantime short show and say 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.980
 perry follows 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.769
 and race 2 of the two categories combined 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.739
 70 evolution primavera 70 evolution o 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.920
 hanging in the front row 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:15.120
 matteo tiraferri number 45 filippo courses 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.450
 number 34 nicolò castellini number 47 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.150
 watch the departure look at courses like 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.120
 snaps and immediately goes into command 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:29.459
 Follows tirferri and then castellini these 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.919
 the first three positions we try to 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.290
 understand where gurrieri fourth is 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.560
 position and first of the single-brand trophy 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.700
 and so here it is iron pullers 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.790
 in pursuit of the number 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.180
 thirty-four courses that are courses 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 trying to lengthen starting with col 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:52.470
 right foot also in race 2 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.319
 third place for nicolò castellini col 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.099
 number 47 that is trying to follow i 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.329
 first two 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.090
 we must see in the fourth position 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.190
 carlo gurrieri first in the category 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.410
 single-brand and behind him in the 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.290
 special single-brand and david category 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:13.430
 let's go and see then in fifth 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:19.650
 absolute position angel pilot fountain 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:22.919
 of the 70 with Luciano well situation 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.860
 unchanged for all positions ed 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.360
 also in the special mono ranking 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.780
 always gurrieri to administer the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.969
 advantage and to be the classification leader 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:42.570
 I see however of the good brand Polini 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:48.380
 tirriferri who is driving with his head down 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:51.240
 so maybe it's changing pace and maybe 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:54.150
 courses is starting to relax 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.760
 let's hope not for filippo here it is 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.159
 started the last round so it wasn't 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.550
 just an impression but a reality 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.770
