 squeak super hero quality content 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.620
 by dota 2 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
 review she Gaidash schoolchildren various 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.210
 flyspley and many other interesting 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.750
 video suggest you check out this channel 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.789

 with you dilling is a new release 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.930
 reporting from the bottom however you probably and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.000
 they themselves guessed it once opened 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 this video well, and today we have Christmas 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.560
 so I prepared six for you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.430
 new files but also right now to her 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.740
 I invite you to see them 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.900
 Well, let's start with the next series of creeps 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.150
 killers and this time starring again 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.160
 satyr here kunk was walking with mida gambit on 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.770
 online and eventually run into the cyrus board 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.900
 and while the fisherman bows do not regret skillok 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.460
 pak even puts his ultimate but dunk 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.050
 just like that is not going to give up 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.940
 beats them toss on torrent not 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.220
 dying by satire 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.110
 Well, rather than from the hand of his ball because 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.030
 If I had a dream to you, I did not say that 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.770
 n this file creeps killed bet nothing 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.720
 foreshadowed the fact that the clip and even though 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.540
 somehow will be involved in it just 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.440
 two heroes beat 1 and suddenly out of nowhere 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.420
 satyr ball 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.160
 Well, that is, as a savior, he certainly killed 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.790
 kungur but it's still better than if 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.470
 would kunku killed enemies but in the next filet 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.300
 no one will die but nevertheless it 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.550
 an example of a fantastic combination 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.800
 unsuccessful game and downright crazy 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.780
 luck here the club misses the hook 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.369
 past the crystal key to get on phantom 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.710
 which did not even see who is in it 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.660
 farm time in the forest and then of course immediately 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.880
 two questions first how was it possible 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.220
 miss by crystal key dude yes she 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 same was literally a step away from your well, 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.479
 the second is God as the phantom turned 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.310
 exactly at that moment exactly there 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.990
 Imagine yourself to be complete. 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 the place of the guy who is anton 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:45.170
 dolls from nowhere cloche flies you 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.060
 just leave those who constantly watch 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.070
 this show must have noticed that very 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.900
 lots of files your house and with a pooja because 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.960
 that one of such a few notice 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.610
 dolls 2 dome and more of that and the topic of a friend 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 you can not get epic 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.570
 however this file just happened 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.939
 because that's got a dome and let 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.400
 hit the hook true that's got the way a bug 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.439
 just void and know looking at that 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.030
 what flies up on 1 squirrel to sven 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.979
 it seems that he 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.670
 literally afraid not to have time to get under 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.380
 hook pooja 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.570
 and you just see how much everyone 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.220
 synchronously and you need to create your own theme 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.750
 true heroes are probably better 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.579
 any others choose it by 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.860
 such an article they are unlikely to be much 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.230
 win 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.030
 but here is an example of fatal use 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.370
 one of my favorite abilities in 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.160
 dota karabakha try to be now 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 extremely attentive you have seen if not 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.180
 then let's see slow motion 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.070
 unfortunately the main culprit of this 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.200
 the file is not in the frame right now but now 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.270
 appears eerily time vision and I mortra 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.280
 decides to pick up the last frag in the game 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.720
 here she throws deiner in them sablin 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.030
 repent to him and the very first blow 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.200
 turns critical she vanshot 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.030
 yourself in Karabakh 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.040
 and if it continued to beat the throne then 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.190
 would finish the game with a tone result 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.230
 one less death but here 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.520
 unlucky barathrum and I don't even know 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:20.150
 just comment on this 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:22.790
 look here and so although it already seemed 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.620
 would the shooting come to an end again no this 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.630
 the guy playing for support did not give up 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.400
 until the very end and he is unlikely 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.140
 planned to kill my brother we are likely 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.030
 he just tried his best 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.799
 once again that in general deserve 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.480
 respect because usually in public 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.920
 support in which barantrum runs in 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.940
 just stand and don't even try 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.160
 resist 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.019
 but this guy was lucky and he 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.090
 took advantage of his only chance 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.970
 as a result, barathrum didn't just kill 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.620
 scene but also in mint and hands do not know how 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.420
 felt like there after such a guy 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.190
 who played for barathrum but I would be on 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.910
 his place would definitely be very 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.910
 upset 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.140
 Well, this time he sent us again 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.150
 some bi bi king 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.799
 Here are the guys in Troy running for sucker lush 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.930
 skinner but the one instead 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.790
 die breaks creep like a game of 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.829
 thimbles because there were three creeps and 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.750
 no one noticed that one of these creeps 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.430
 just picked up and gone well that is someone 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.810
 noticed it but it was a dude who 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.639
 sat at this time in the tavern 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.160
 in fact it was he who pinged you only 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:19.139
 look how brazen the escape is 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.669
 pupil will this bird say guy 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.919
 farley but shit is going on here 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.810
 I guess I'll go from here and 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.280
 actually go and honestly 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:29.700
 viewed at the moment on repeat 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.770
 I have no idea how we did not notice 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.880
 Well, that's all for today 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.280
 I hope you enjoyed today 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.810
 release and he recall that we have a new 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.430
 mail because i still come 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.200
 sometimes letters to old 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.420
 Thanks to everyone who sent the file for 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.640
