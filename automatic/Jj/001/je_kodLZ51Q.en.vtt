00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.630
 very well 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:11.190
 games we were very happy early 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.719
 also to know our drinks 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.710
 moisturizing that is the lake by 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.020
 excellence 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 definitely the champion of all this 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.730
 of the war of the waters is still 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.100
 the natural lake of pitchers that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 we take out of the tap and the recommendations 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.400
 going through a filter and leave it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.260
 just about 30 minutes so that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 we can also take the option of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.990
 buy bottled water but it's the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.880
 first most important 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.120
 we have other guests here in the 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.390
 land of the waters in this other here 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.950
 we have that is alkaline water results 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.000
 that now the Mexican government is 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.230
 doing studies because it is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.210
 finding that if there are certain 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.850
 benefits and especially for those who 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.260
 they are not taking their seven rations of 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.989
 fruits and vegetables 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.150
 they have an acid metabolism and 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.129
 alkaline water will help us 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.690
 recover this and it was already shown that 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.460
 when you drink something alkaline water it 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.790
 they are closer to the body than with water 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.440
 and normal 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.900
 and districts that not only in homes are 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.760
 very expensive 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.310
 that 's right, there are other options that will be 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.440
 precisely buy the water and there are others 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.870
 much more economical so if you guys 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.570
 they are interested review the options and 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.680
 there are filters that cost 300 400 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.680
 dollars have the same effect 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.770
 if we can drink mineral water 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.420
 especially again very expensive we are 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.670
 making a good diet that is a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.070
 good choice because the minerals we 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.500
 they are going to help us to maintain a better 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.860
 hydration for the sodium they add 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.860
 because of calcium and potassium 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.700
 but also in general it's good at 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 of mexico are totally different to 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.840
 the waters here are mineralized 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.140
 They have much more calcium than water 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.770
 that we get in the springs here in 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.310
 us if they have the benefits that 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.310
 we have here 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.740
 the other guest that you have thousands of 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.540
 years and it has been seen that this benefit 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.300
 especially for people who are 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.340
 practicing a sport and good if you give us 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.160
 Higher yield when drinking coconut water 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.990
 that if we're not drinking so it's worth 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.180
 worth it if they are making cuts worth 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:30.250
 It's worthwhile to be drinking coconut water with 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.930
 what sports drinks ok 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.550
 you are bound will have benefits of 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.040
 you are doing more than two 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 hours of exercise if they are athletes of 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.570
 high performance if they do not reach that point 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.720
 there is no point in taking these 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.720
 drinks 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.860
 there are many curtains caring for a man 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 years 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:57.660
 this does not have some performance 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.510
 with examples of yerba mate 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.790
 even the coffee that was thought to be 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.340
 garden contents so we are only 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.830
 accelerated they were very ethical but no no 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.990
 counteract the amount that we 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.330
 we take then if they are an attraction 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.330
 be taking tests to hydrate 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.340
 the food continues with a battery 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.340
 movement
