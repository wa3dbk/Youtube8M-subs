00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.410
 friends today I'm going to teach them how to make 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.799
 these pretty little flowers in felt 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.130
 elaborated only with circles or can 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.470
 elaborate on fabric like the one we have here 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.890
 between the right ones and we have placed it 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.060
 an Ace bandage are very beautiful the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.669
 procedure to elaborate them is the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.340
 it is the only thing that circles the 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.259
 they will seal all around the 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.850
 rest the whole procedure to be equal 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.730
 We see here decorated with a 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.220
 a ball or a sphere lined with 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.280
 tape but the procedure is going to be the 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.170
 same for the two and the felt this 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.990
 let's use the van to use me what 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.620
 They have commissioned to decorate some monkeys 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:54.450
 wool hats and then they are very 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.200
 special for this also serve them 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.329
 to decorate bags as you wish 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.930
 do it for a nice bullet here is going to 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:07.030
 work one or ones indicates how is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.820
 Delgadita brown are beautiful 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.890
 then you are going to get felt 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.520
 of the color that you want to elaborate 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.070
 the little flower here we are going to cut only 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.000
 circles this little one that is here 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.430
 It has 4 centimeters of side by side are 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.680
 four centimeters are going to cut five 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.320
 circles here I made a decoration 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.259
 with thread if you want to do it or 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.830
 You can leave it alone as you like this one 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:38.290
 medium four points in 4.5 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.890
 centimeters from side to side cut five 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:44.830
 circles and the big boy has five 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:49.270
 centimeters cut five circles is one 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.750
 flower of five circles are going to use a 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.630
 circle to base the flower and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.090
 they are going to cut three shouts of them 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.430
 all of you not used to 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.070
 make the little flower to make the 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.900
 center like a snail or 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.360
 that's basically what they 're going to 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.970
 need to be flowered after 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
 that you have already cut the five 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.680
 circles by color and if you have 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.680
 wanted to decorate them use the little veins 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.360
 with a thread like you want that already 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.050
 It is comfortable and creativity of you 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.910
 let's start to paste all the 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.160
 circles 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.220
 at one time we 're going to stick here 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.830
 I'm going to apply silicone 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 this is very easy this little flower I know 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.150
 that you will love it because it is very 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.360
 beautiful they can make them in colors 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:44.480
 that you wish so they will stay 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.730
 pegadito at three the three petals not 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.710
 they will be released or nothing because the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.730
 Felt will easily stick with the 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.840
 hot silicone here we already have all 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:59.300
 the five holes of petals and we're going to 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.750
 start to build it easily you 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.300
 they 're just going to take the circles 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.130
 they're going to stick on top of each other in this 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.800
 way 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.080
 first they put it together and then they stick it 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:15.070
 to see that they have been well 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.070
 pretty the little flower 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.099
 already here they go four the fifth they stick it 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.930
 here and raise the first petal what 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.200
 interspersed so they fit 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.800
 pretty interspersed in this way the 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200
 Only one is the one that is going to change 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.390
 the last single petals that will change 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.210
 the process is to place it in the part of 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.310
 back so they are interspersed 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:41.560
 you review it that you have left 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.260
 well armadito the flower and proceed to 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.480
 paste it like you're going to hit it with a lot 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.790
 beware you are going to turn it over here 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:56.010
 turned around with great care 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.010
 they are simply going to use the circle 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.340
 they apply their liquor to very hot what 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.340
 stick 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.560
 we turn the little flower 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.720
 we organize if you want to have 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.730
 much more time 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.850
 before the silicone dries 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.340
 use liquid silicone which is what 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.739
 It gives you time to solve problems 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.690
 here it quickly dries possesses silicone 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:29.400
 hot then there they will stay 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:31.800
 in the part of the flower the center 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.360
 you place the colors as you wish 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.850
 place them to your liking and we will 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.380
 always leave a little eyelash the first 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:45.180
 it's going to be the brown one and there you guys 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.970
 they are going to keep putting it going to leave some 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.610
 eyelashes in such a way that when rolled up 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.280
 It does not work well and they send nice 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.870
 the circles rolled here we're going to 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.870
 start rolling 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:06.120
 roll up so it fits tight 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.120
 what is the circle 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.390
 Roll the size you want 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.790
 if you want they can be holding 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:19.120
 with a pin so you do not go to 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.150
 let go I'm going to leave this size 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.190
 and then start cutting what they are 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:28.610
 the strips 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.590
 and the biggest one is going to be the 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.389
 the first so that I rolled up 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.319
 totally here I will start to apply 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.319
 silicone 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:43.430
 we keep winding again we apply 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:45.950
 silicone to the next band aid have 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.460
 be very careful not to burn and 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.460
 the last 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:54.539
 we keep rolling it up to paste it 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.870
 leave it to dry thoroughly before moving 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:03.629
 so they're not going to let go like that 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.860
 to get the rolls we're going to make 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.860
 apply silicone 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.350
 with that silicone it fits 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.380
 pegadito to all the strips do not go away 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.950
 to let go and they will hit it in the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.950
 little flower 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.150
 these moors are beautiful bonnets 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.460
 they asked me to do the 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:28.980
 florecitas in this way with the PES 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.660
 he taught them so that you can cheer up and 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.820
 make them in the size that you 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:36.060
 want and this is with the measures that the 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:39.000

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.880
