00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
you're just because cutting on getting

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.450 
you're just because cutting on getting
started<00:00:48.290> it's<00:00:48.440> easier<00:00:48.769> to<00:00:48.890> go<00:00:49.040> in<00:00:49.070> a<00:00:49.280> straight

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
started it's easier to go in a straight

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.430 
started it's easier to go in a straight
line<00:00:49.660> don't<00:00:50.660> you<00:00:50.780> kind<00:00:50.989> of<00:00:51.019> have<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.170> groove

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
line don't you kind of have a groove

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.680 
line don't you kind of have a groove
going<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:51.980> can<00:00:52.129> even<00:00:52.820> cut<00:00:53.059> a<00:00:53.089> curve<00:00:53.329> boil<00:00:53.600> it

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
going you can even cut a curve boil it

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:21.240 
going you can even cut a curve boil it
easier<00:00:54.019> okay<00:00:57.100> so<00:00:58.100> I'm<00:00:58.159> just<00:00:58.220> trying<00:00:58.460> to<00:00:58.670> Center

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.350 

you're<00:01:22.250> really<00:01:22.429> shooting<00:01:22.610> for<00:01:22.759> it<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.149> get<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
you're really shooting for it to get the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.240 
you're really shooting for it to get the
blade<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:24.170> as<00:01:24.320> long<00:01:24.500> as<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:27.160> basically<00:01:28.160> you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
blade so as long as that basically you

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.910 
blade so as long as that basically you
just<00:01:28.280> want<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.759> look<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.660> blade<00:01:29.960> uh-huh

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.090 

okay

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
okay

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.990 
okay
I<00:01:34.130> made<00:01:34.369> you<00:01:34.520> want<00:01:34.729> okay

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.750 

get<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:40.690> at<00:01:40.870> an<00:01:40.990> angle<00:01:41.140> right<00:01:41.590> now<00:01:42.190> you're<00:01:42.580> kind

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
get it at an angle right now you're kind

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.910 
get it at an angle right now you're kind
of<00:01:42.910> hit<00:01:43.480> it<00:01:43.570> perpendicular<00:01:43.870> to<00:01:44.530> the<00:01:44.830> surface

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
of hit it perpendicular to the surface

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.770 
of hit it perpendicular to the surface
of<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.400> waters<00:01:45.700> that<00:01:45.880> angle<00:01:46.240> like<00:01:46.360> this

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
of the waters that angle like this

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.350 
of the waters that angle like this
so<00:01:47.110> OSE<00:01:47.890> bring<00:01:48.100> about<00:01:48.280> towards<00:01:48.580> you're<00:01:54.360> so

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
so OSE bring about towards you're so

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.160 
so OSE bring about towards you're so
nervous<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:55.930> head<00:01:56.110> through<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.440> finish<00:01:56.710> boat

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.360 

so<00:02:02.170> at<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.410> point<00:02:02.620> just<00:02:02.800> because<00:02:02.890> of<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.250> way

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
so at this point just because of the way

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.510 
so at this point just because of the way
we've<00:02:03.580> drilled<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.060> looks<00:02:04.330> like<00:02:05.130> we're<00:02:06.130> kind

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
we've drilled it looks like we're kind

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:37.199 
we've drilled it looks like we're kind
of<00:02:06.700> taking<00:02:07.180> out<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.660> side<00:02:07.900> of<00:02:08.050> the<00:02:08.110> line<00:02:36.209> all

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
of taking out the side of the line all

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.430 
of taking out the side of the line all
right<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.630> we're<00:02:37.750> going<00:02:37.840> to<00:02:37.900> show<00:02:38.080> one<00:02:38.320> other

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
right so we're going to show one other

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.699 
right so we're going to show one other
way<00:02:38.680> of<00:02:38.830> cutting<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.490> hatch<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:40.260> jig<00:02:41.260> saw

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.110 

this<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.890> another<00:02:45.100> alternative<00:02:45.580> feel

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
this is another alternative feel

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.360 
this is another alternative feel
comfortable<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.840> this<00:02:47.260> on<00:02:47.530> hand<00:02:47.800> goes<00:02:48.340> a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
comfortable and have this on hand goes a

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.120 
comfortable and have this on hand goes a
little<00:02:48.700> quicker<00:02:49.470> although<00:02:50.470> my<00:02:50.650> hand<00:02:50.950> is

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
little quicker although my hand is

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.670 
little quicker although my hand is
probably<00:02:51.430> more<00:02:51.700> accurate<00:02:55.620> basically<00:02:56.620> you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
probably more accurate basically you

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.920 
probably more accurate basically you
just<00:02:56.830> have<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.010> be<00:02:57.100> really<00:02:57.310> tender<00:02:57.630> just<00:02:58.630> start

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
just have to be really tender just start

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.680 
just have to be really tender just start
off<00:02:59.019> really<00:02:59.290> slow<00:03:00.180> when<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:01.360> pulling<00:03:01.510> a

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
off really slow when you're pulling a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050 
off really slow when you're pulling a
trigger<00:03:02.160> some<00:03:03.160> of<00:03:03.250> them<00:03:03.370> are<00:03:03.489> a<00:03:03.519> variable

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
trigger some of them are a variable

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.280 
trigger some of them are a variable
speed<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:04.600> can<00:03:04.690> set<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.170> speed

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
speed so you can set the speed

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.640 
speed so you can set the speed
there's<00:03:06.739> a<00:03:06.830> clutch<00:03:07.220> so<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:09.379> basically

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
there's a clutch so you basically

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:22.130 
there's a clutch so you basically
control<00:03:09.890> it<00:03:10.159> with<00:03:10.250> your<00:03:10.280> fingers

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:31.840 

I<00:03:22.640> do<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.700> rest<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.000> with<00:03:24.090> your<00:03:24.210> hands<00:03:24.690> sure

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.290 

don't<00:03:32.270> make<00:03:32.450> it<00:03:32.570> easier<00:03:33.670> if<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.910> hanging

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
don't make it easier if it's hanging

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.920 
don't make it easier if it's hanging
down<00:03:35.450> here<00:03:36.020> it<00:03:36.350> will<00:03:36.500> just<00:03:36.650> break<00:03:37.210> well<00:03:38.210> right

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
down here it will just break well right

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.290 
down here it will just break well right
so<00:03:39.140> if<00:03:39.260> you<00:03:39.380> have<00:03:39.560> supported<00:03:40.190> when<00:03:41.180> you're

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
so if you have supported when you're

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.140 
so if you have supported when you're
cutting<00:03:42.130> it'll<00:03:43.130> keep<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.400> clean

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
cutting it'll keep it clean

00:03:44.150 --> 00:04:05.850 
cutting it'll keep it clean
yeah<00:03:44.360> your<00:03:44.540> comfort<00:03:45.230> very<00:03:45.560> last<00:03:45.800> little<00:03:46.010> bit

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.050 

manual<00:04:06.860> doesn't<00:04:07.190> have<00:04:07.310> you<00:04:07.400> tape<00:04:07.640> but<00:04:08.000> we

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060
