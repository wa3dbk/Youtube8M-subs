00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.330
 hello I'm monica gibson and here 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 overview of key events of the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.889
 week presented by dukascopy tv my 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.680
 guest nick stamenkovic from capital ria 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.510
 markets nick landi did not have any 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.859
 important publication on the order of 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.050
 day yet after data 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.310
 disappointing US economic 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.320
 some analysts qualify the force 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.880
 of eurobonds dollar what can you 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.949
 tell about the current feeling 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.420
 I believe the US dollar is 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.369
 found in a phase of correction 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.719
 several investors rely on the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.030
 reinforcement of the greenback against 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.680
 the euro throughout 2015 however 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.180
 analysts find the performance 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
 current US economy 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 quite disappointing while the assessment 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.210
 euro area results improve 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.010
 investors have revised upwards 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.489
 their growth forecasts for the 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.530
 eurozone 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.120
 we see more and more positions 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.219
 long on the dollar which is all to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.140
 makes sense in the given context and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.820
 this trend is supposed to continue 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.559
 in the future 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.170
 yet once the situation clarified 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.760
 and the fundamentals reaffirmed it's up to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.129
 tell if the fed raise rates in 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.260
 september and the bce continues its pace 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.810
 purchase of 60 billion bonds 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.400
 at least until 2016 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.740
 the dollar should strengthen against 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.119
 the euro yet the recent fall of the 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.759
 dollar has made sure that several 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.500
 people go to the wrong side this 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.630
 means that the dollar rally will be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.490
 quite modest on time anyway 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 we have time before parity 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.759
 between the euro and the dollar is not 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 reached 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.060
 this week we will learn several 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.320
 decisions on monetary policy because 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.420
 will not see the publication of the minutes 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.890
 meetings of the fmi and the bank 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.960
 england and the bce 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.409
 do you envision any surprises 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.000
 the markets would he like to hear the 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 question is how did we do it 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.329
 to interpret recent data 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.770
 in general, the leaders of the fed 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.090
 was of the opinion that the slowdown 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.040
 we observed in the first 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 quarter was a temporary phenomenon 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.210
 everyone would like to see the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.710
 confirmation of this hypothesis of course 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.270
 it will be interesting to learn the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.320
 Fed's reaction to data about 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.299
 retail sales production 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.040
 industrial published last week 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.630
 it could reassure the markets 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.369
 yet I would say that weakness 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.210
 Continued Inflation in the United States 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.830
 suggest that 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.750
 rates in September becomes more and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.310
 more unlikely I believe we're going 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.850
 find clues in the report 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.140
 American 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.520
 regarding the bank 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.560
 from England I do not think we 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.209
 see a lot of surprises the report 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.860
 inflation rate last week was 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.510
 showed that Berri had revised its 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 inflation forecast at the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.489
 rise 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.840
 they also lowered their 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.120
 growth forecast for the year 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.770
 spa of 2015 2017 that makes the 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.630
 markets sure that the rate hike 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.920
 is unlikely before the first or 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.630
 the second quarter of the year 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.610
 next 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.840
 so the Greek saga continues at this 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.489
 that it seems the government has 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.590
 intended to pay the salaries and 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.030
 public sector pensions in May but 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.250
 she needs to reach an agreement 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.720
 with creditors by the end of the month 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.489
 however how does this situation 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 can it develop after 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.150
 the implication of the fmi quite the saga 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.530
 keep on going 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.120
 the markets are clearly nervous at 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.739
 because of all these developments we 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.390
 have seen massive sales of 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:58.800
 Greek bonds last week 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.700
 after the suggestions that greece 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.769
 could be lacking 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.200
 in reality there is very little margin of 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.060
 maneuver here obviously without 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.920
 assistance from financial institutions 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.900
 the eurozone the country will be unable 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.980
 to make basic payments is to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.870
 cover your debts 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.299
 even if he manages to resolve the situation 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.060
 with the fmi they have refunds 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.440
 very considerable to do this summer 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.150
 economically speaking greece stands 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.430
 found in an extremely situation 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.920
 difficult their budgetary situation and 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.489
 miserable the country has sunk in the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.079
 recession 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.230
 regarding the prospects 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.540
 the euro zone, particularly the fmi 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.400
 and the ECB want to find a compromise 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 they do not want the Greek left 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.030
 the euro zone and give up the currency 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.650
 unique on time what have been committed will 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.950
 surely beneficial to the economy of the 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.110
 country 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.950
 however as far as the whole 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.530
 of the euro zone 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.970
 we do not expect any tangible impact 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.970
 think it will be the countdown 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.300
 with this remake 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.450
 the performance of the euro was not 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.760
 as good as expected following the crisis 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.440
 what do you expect in terms of exchange rate 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.140
 the euro against the pound sterling 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.910
 example obviously the pound 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.230
 British enjoys in rally 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.390
 relief after the conservatives 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.850
 have secured a majority in 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.500
 elections now the situation is going 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.269
 become a little calmer in all 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.680
 logic the bank of england does not see 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.019
 no urgency to raise rates 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.860
 of interest in addition to the recent report 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.750
 on inflation 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.280
 yet we can deduce that 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.630
 the British economy is wearing when 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.800
 even better than the economy of the area 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.630
 euro 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.640
 this leads us to believe that the book is 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.860
 will maintain a solid rate against the euro 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.540
 especially considering the fact that the bce is going 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.640
 continue its stimulus program 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.290
 for now I expect that the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.000
 British pound remains strong 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.919
 we will observe his ascent 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.540
 medium-term rate and its rate 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.540
 will remain reasonably stable 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.190
 nick thank you very much for your comments 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.600

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.210
