what<00:00:00.240> are<00:00:00.359> the<00:00:00.420> implications<00:00:00.630> of<00:00:01.079> the<00:00:01.199> fact

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
what are the implications of the fact

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.970 
what are the implications of the fact
that<00:00:01.530> Samsung<00:00:02.159> essentially<00:00:02.990> owns<00:00:03.990> Android<00:00:04.680> to

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
that Samsung essentially owns Android to

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.110 
that Samsung essentially owns Android to
a<00:00:05.009> certain<00:00:05.310> well<00:00:05.400> that's<00:00:05.580> potentially<00:00:05.879> a

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
a certain well that's potentially a

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.390 
a certain well that's potentially a
positive<00:00:06.720> right<00:00:06.899> because<00:00:07.259> Samsung<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:08.280> now

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
positive right because Samsung can now

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.549 
positive right because Samsung can now
do<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.730> things<00:00:08.940> I<00:00:09.059> wish<00:00:09.269> Apple<00:00:09.750> would<00:00:09.870> do<00:00:10.019> on

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
do the things I wish Apple would do on

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.049 
do the things I wish Apple would do on
top<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.010> Android<00:00:11.280> because<00:00:11.490> they've<00:00:11.730> got<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
top of Android because they've got the

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.570 
top of Android because they've got the
whole<00:00:12.210> system<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:13.469> hope<00:00:13.710> they<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.309> so

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
whole system and I hope they do that so

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.129 
whole system and I hope they do that so
what<00:00:15.030> should<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.360> next<00:00:15.719> big<00:00:15.839> thing<00:00:16.020> at

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
what should the next big thing at

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you know when it comes to the Smart TV

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.670 
you know when it comes to the Smart TV
for<00:00:42.390> example<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.079> far<00:00:43.290> ahead<00:00:43.440> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
for example is way far ahead of

for example is way far ahead of
everybody<00:00:43.920> else<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.550> well<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.840> know<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> way

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
everybody else and well you know the way

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.319 
everybody else and well you know the way
I<00:00:46.170> look<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:46.890> none<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.000> really

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
I look at it is that none of that really

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
I look at it is that none of that really
matters<00:00:48.989> if<00:00:49.260> there's<00:00:49.590> nothing<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> with

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
matters if there's nothing to do with

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
matters if there's nothing to do with
the<00:00:50.550> Smart<00:00:50.879> TV<00:00:51.140> right<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.469> trick<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> how<00:00:53.100> do

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the Smart TV right the trick is how do

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.189 
the Smart TV right the trick is how do
you<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.430> interesting<00:00:54.239> stuff<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
you get interesting stuff on to it and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.990 
you get interesting stuff on to it and
you<00:00:56.010> know<00:00:56.100> I've<00:00:56.219> got<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.579> investment<00:00:56.879> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
you know I've got a little investment a

TV well until they solve that problem

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.399 
TV well until they solve that problem
right<00:01:08.250> until<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:09.119> having<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.900> Smart<00:01:10.200> TV

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
doesn't mean anything because it's it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.300 
doesn't mean anything because it's it
you<00:01:12.210> can't<00:01:12.479> plug<00:01:12.630> anything<00:01:12.869> into<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.560> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
you can't plug anything into it and to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.649 
you can't plug anything into it and to
me<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.450> a

me that's what the you know that's a

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.359 
me that's what the you know that's a
problem<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> will<00:01:16.320> be<00:01:16.409> resolved<00:01:17.100> fairly

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
problem that will be resolved fairly

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.640 
problem that will be resolved fairly
quickly<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.960> what's<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> stuff

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
quickly but you know what's the stuff

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.410 
quickly but you know what's the stuff
that<00:01:20.040> how<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.759> get<00:01:20.909> stuff<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that how do you get stuff on to it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.969 
that how do you get stuff on to it
that's<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> trick<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> see<00:01:22.860> the

collision course have no idea I mean I
look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.759> this<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.479> year<00:01:33.750> ago<00:01:33.960> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
look at this and I go a year ago it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.830 
look at this and I go a year ago it
never<00:01:34.350> occurred<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.710> me<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:34.860> Apple<00:01:35.159> would<00:01:36.000> be

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
never occurred to me that Apple would be

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.999 
never occurred to me that Apple would be
having<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> problem<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.590> happening

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
having the problem that's happening

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
having the problem that's happening
having<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:39.329> thought<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.810> they

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
having now I really thought that they

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.590 
having now I really thought that they
understood<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.130> they<00:01:41.729> had<00:01:41.759> differentiate

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
understood that they had differentiate

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.359 
understood that they had differentiate
themselves<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:43.079> Android<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:44.100> their

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
themselves from Android and that their

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.399 
themselves from Android and that their
optimal<00:01:45.270> strategy<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:45.899> different<00:01:46.320> than

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
optimal strategy was different than

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.649 
optimal strategy was different than
androids<00:01:46.829> optimal<00:01:47.250> strategy<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.000> yet

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
androids optimal strategy and yet

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.910 
androids optimal strategy and yet
because<00:01:49.200> at<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.500> beginning<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.860> never

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
because at the beginning I never

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.039 
because at the beginning I never
understood<00:01:50.399> why<00:01:50.579> Android<00:01:51.000> went<00:01:51.270> around<00:01:51.720> apps

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
understood why Android went around apps

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.260 
understood why Android went around apps
because<00:01:52.530> apps<00:01:52.770> reinforced<00:01:53.460> apples<00:01:53.850> strengths

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
because apps reinforced apples strengths

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
because apps reinforced apples strengths
right<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.649> you<00:01:56.430> know<00:01:56.640> where<00:01:56.729> androids<00:01:57.180> about

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
right but you know where androids about

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240 
right but you know where androids about
the<00:01:57.479> web<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.869> mean<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.469> me<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> don't<00:01:58.860> understand

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
the web I mean to me I don't understand

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.859 
the web I mean to me I don't understand
why<00:01:59.340> Google<00:01:59.640> isn't<00:01:59.850> all<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.149> html5<00:02:00.750> because

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
why Google isn't all over html5 because

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.429 
why Google isn't all over html5 because
that<00:02:01.079> would<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.590> would<00:02:01.649> really<00:02:01.979> hurt<00:02:02.250> out

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
that would that would really hurt out

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.529 
that would that would really hurt out
and<00:02:03.799> Apple<00:02:04.399> so<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:04.640> look<00:02:05.030> at<00:02:05.119> everybody<00:02:05.420> as

and Apple so I look at everybody as

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.149 
and Apple so I look at everybody as
having<00:02:05.750> more<00:02:05.930> problems<00:02:06.170> than<00:02:06.500> benefits<00:02:06.979> right

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
having more problems than benefits right

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.949 
having more problems than benefits right

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.309 
market that hasn't bought a smartphone
yet<00:02:34.430> what<00:02:34.849> about<00:02:35.000> Apple<00:02:35.180> Google<00:02:35.599> do<00:02:36.170> they

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
yet what about Apple Google do they

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.350 
yet what about Apple Google do they
continue<00:02:36.799> on<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.980> collision<00:02:37.280> course<00:02:37.459> oh<00:02:37.910> for

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
continue on a collision course oh for

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
continue on a collision course oh for
sure<00:02:38.569> because<00:02:39.110> Google's<00:02:39.650> strategy<00:02:39.980> is<00:02:40.430> so

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
sure because Google's strategy is so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.880 
sure because Google's strategy is so
different<00:02:40.940> from<00:02:41.180> apples<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.989> what<00:02:42.739> do<00:02:42.799> you

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
different from apples and what do you

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.699 
different from apples and what do you
think<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.099> Google<00:02:43.190> buying<00:02:43.519> wait<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
think of Google buying wait it's a

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.970 
think of Google buying wait it's a
search<00:02:45.980> engine<00:02:46.190> right<00:02:46.519> I<00:02:46.849> mean<00:02:47.630> Google<00:02:48.410> when

because<00:03:37.910> I<00:03:38.000> think<00:03:38.060> there<00:03:38.359> was<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.510> bigger

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
because I think there was a bigger

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.660 
because I think there was a bigger
opportunity<00:03:39.139> the<00:03:39.500> one<00:03:39.620> they<00:03:39.739> did<00:03:39.950> but<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.549> one

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
opportunity the one they did but the one

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.569 
opportunity the one they did but the one
they<00:03:40.790> did<00:03:40.970> is<00:03:41.120> humongous<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:42.040> you<00:03:43.040> know<00:03:43.190> they

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
they did is humongous and you know they

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.379 
they did is humongous and you know they
will<00:03:43.850> as<00:03:44.590> long<00:03:45.590> as<00:03:45.739> is<00:03:45.920> they<00:03:46.519> can<00:03:46.670> get<00:03:46.819> somebody

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
will as long as is they can get somebody

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.390 
will as long as is they can get somebody
besides<00:03:47.810> Samsung<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.620> be<00:03:48.709> successful<00:03:49.310> in

besides Samsung to be successful in

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.670 
besides Samsung to be successful in
phones<00:03:49.670> then<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.569> think<00:03:50.780> androids<00:03:51.200> future<00:03:51.560> is

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
phones then I think androids future is

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.740 
phones then I think androids future is
really<00:03:51.859> bright<00:03:51.980> if<00:03:52.430> it's<00:03:52.639> just<00:03:52.940> Samsung<00:03:53.450> it's

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
really bright if it's just Samsung it's

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.170 
really bright if it's just Samsung it's
