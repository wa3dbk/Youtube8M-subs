time I've really discovered how this
really<00:00:05.640> works<00:00:05.810> so<00:00:06.810> unlike<00:00:07.589> last<00:00:08.010> time<00:00:08.160> with

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
really works so unlike last time with

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.200 
really works so unlike last time with
the<00:00:08.580> whole<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.719> lot<00:00:10.530> of<00:00:11.120> conditions<00:00:12.120> and

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
the whole like a lot of conditions and

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.970 
the whole like a lot of conditions and
stuff<00:00:12.420> this<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:12.780> really<00:00:12.960> simple<00:00:13.290> conditions

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
stuff this is really simple conditions

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.670 
stuff this is really simple conditions
the<00:00:14.670> only<00:00:14.880> conditions<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.330> need<00:00:15.540> one<00:00:16.260> side<00:00:16.650> of

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
the only conditions you need one side of

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.769 
the only conditions you need one side of
your<00:00:16.859> hero<00:00:17.220> has<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.520> be<00:00:17.760> against<00:00:18.150> terrain<00:00:18.510> or

this<00:01:08.520> bug<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.560> breaking<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.650> early<00:01:10.979> as<00:01:11.130> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this bug is on breaking it early as you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.530 
this bug is on breaking it early as you
can<00:01:11.520> see<00:01:11.729> i'm<00:01:11.909> just<00:01:12.060> going<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> do<00:01:12.330> this

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
can see i'm just going to do this

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.399 
can see i'm just going to do this
argument<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.439> tinker's<00:01:13.950> laser<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.520> rubik<00:01:15.150> and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
argument is tinker's laser on rubik and

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.710 
argument is tinker's laser on rubik and
then<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.650> walks<00:01:16.860> away<00:01:17.009> slang<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.570> will

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
then just walks away slang and we will

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.440 
then just walks away slang and we will
look<00:01:18.869> at<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.229> combat<00:01:19.770> log<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
look at the combat log and see that it

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.700 
look at the combat log and see that it
is<00:01:21.479> actually<00:01:21.960> less<00:01:22.350> than<00:01:22.380> 3.5<00:01:22.770> seconds<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
is actually less than 3.5 seconds so we

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.760 
is actually less than 3.5 seconds so we
see<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.479> tinker<00:01:27.479> gets<00:01:27.689> out<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.080> less<00:01:28.619> than

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
see that tinker gets out in less than

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.210 
see that tinker gets out in less than
two<00:01:28.950> seconds<00:01:29.430> actually<00:01:29.640> um<00:01:30.439> because<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
two seconds actually um because of the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.969 
two seconds actually um because of the
bug<00:01:32.369> where<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.810> use<00:01:33.930> any<00:01:34.140> single<00:01:34.590> target

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
I'm income agreement but it should have

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.949 
I'm income agreement but it should have
broken<00:02:41.890> although<00:02:42.850> this<00:02:43.120> one<00:02:43.330> app<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.780> with

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
broken although this one app like with

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.210 
broken although this one app like with
auto<00:02:44.140> attacks<00:02:44.440> there's<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.890> delay<00:02:45.160> so

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
auto attacks there's actually a delay so

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.350 
auto attacks there's actually a delay so
i'm<00:02:45.489> not<00:02:45.610> sure<00:02:45.880> if<00:02:46.000> actually<00:02:46.300> breaks<00:02:46.660> um<00:02:47.820> oh<00:02:48.820> it

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
i'm not sure if actually breaks um oh it

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.510 
i'm not sure if actually breaks um oh it
actually<00:02:49.450> broke<00:02:49.810> before<00:02:49.989> 3.5<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.040> 12

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
actually broke before 3.5 you can see 12

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.610 
actually broke before 3.5 you can see 12
14<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.120> 15<00:02:52.300> 01<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:53.110> that's<00:02:53.260> when<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.470> around

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
14 to 15 01 so that's when you around

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.699 
14 to 15 01 so that's when you around
three<00:02:53.800> seconds<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.940> auto<00:02:55.120> attacks<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:56.440> can

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
three seconds so auto attacks you can

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.470 
three seconds so auto attacks you can
break<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.160> with<00:02:57.220> auto<00:02:57.400> attacks<00:02:57.760> but<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.239> is

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
break it with auto attacks but it is

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.160 
break it with auto attacks but it is
with<00:02:59.260> a<00:02:59.470> do<00:03:00.190> something<00:03:00.580> longer<00:03:00.790> delay<00:03:01.209> but

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
with a do something longer delay but

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.050 
with a do something longer delay but
it's<00:03:02.350> still<00:03:02.590> consistent<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> always<00:03:03.640> happens

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
it's still consistent it always happens

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.840 
it's still consistent it always happens
so<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.600> can<00:03:04.780> do<00:03:05.320> it<00:03:05.380> again<00:03:05.440> what<00:03:06.100> I'm<00:03:06.400> just<00:03:06.730> going

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
so I can do it again what I'm just going

pounce kinetic field and fortunes end is

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.069 
pounce kinetic field and fortunes end is
that<00:03:48.880> you<00:03:49.000> actually<00:03:49.120> get<00:03:49.450> your<00:03:49.630> movement

speed reduced to zero that's you tried I

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.740 
speed reduced to zero that's you tried I
tried<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.640> with<00:03:54.730> these<00:03:54.880> three<00:03:55.180> heroes<00:03:55.390> who<00:03:55.630> all

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
clicks and I have escapes the kinetic

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.270 
clicks and I have escapes the kinetic
field<00:04:43.330> so<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.630> otha<00:04:44.780> mazes<00:04:45.350> that's<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.070> bug
