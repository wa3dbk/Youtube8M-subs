00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.580
 Flying in 747 from one side of the ground to the opposite side will take about 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.180
 22 hours ... And while I know there is a bit of rock in the way, this is really for 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.780
 Tour a long way. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.099
 So if we did dig a hole along the way through the ground, through the center, jumped 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:14.740
 in a? 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.919
 Well, Michael, maybe you would't make it too far - that's because Coriolis 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.689
 The effect (which is why the ball strangely curves when you toss while riding a fun round trip 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 And why cyclones always spin counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere). At the equator, 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.250
 The Earth (and you are on it) rotates east at 1670 km / h. As you go deeper, bits 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.730
 From the ground around you still revolve around once a day, but they did not have as much to 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.190
 So they travel in slower and slower speeds. If you jump into the vertical aperture, 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.850
 You will soon travel faster than the East Rock around you so that you just fall down 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.950
 A few kilometers away, I was crashing in the east of the wall. It may not be a disaster, but some 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.490
 The miners near Lake Superior tried to test this by dropping cannonballs down a long mile 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.040
 Shaft - The balls did not reach the bottom. 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.860
 Well, what if the tunnel went from pole to pole, so the Coriolis effect does not apply, 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.259
 Let's also assume that there is no air resistance, or friction 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.659
 OK. Since the Earth mass is more concentrated near the center, that gravity will pull you 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.509
 Down with almost the same amount of power for the first 3,000 km, or halfway to the center 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.920
 From the ground - this, constant familiar power will accelerate you until it has fallen 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.479
 8KM every second, a trip to the middle of the road will mid-earth take only 13 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.299
 Accurate. Soon after, you reach the ground pulp outside, this is the point in your life 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.990
 A trip where gravity pull will be stronger - but only slightly stronger than 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.999
 The force that we are used to on the surface. 

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:32.709
 As you continue to fall closer to the center, much of the Earth mass would be over now 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.060
 For you it will start to seriously remove the attraction block below, and 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.619
 The pull weakens until it reaches the center. Here, you encounter no attraction 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.719
 Pull at all - or rather, the earth will be pulling on you the same amount in all directions, 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.029
 So you can float freely around with no sense of "up" or "down". Except, remember, that 

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:53.090
 You want to be speeding past at 22,000 miles per hour or 6 miles per second. 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.749
 Once you have passed the center, the whole process will be reversed and you gradually slow, pulled 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.179
 Down (or is it?) Initially weak then more strongly, even when you got the other one 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:05.319
 Side, you stop moving, you can interfere with the surface, just 37 minutes, or one 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:07.659
 Cycle dryer, later. 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.910
 Of course, the deepest ever we were able to dig a well is the Superdeep Cola in Russia. 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.400
 But it only went down 12km, which is only two-thirds the length of Manhattan. They had 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.840
 To stop it got very hot: 180 Â° C. This is kind of a problem with digging 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.150
 During the hole of the earth - the hot earth, the melting in the middle. You can not just drill through a hole 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.370
 With shovels. But here's a question: it was not mid-earth is not all "liquidy" 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.690
 What if the land is hollow, but its weight for the same? 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.000
 Well, with its entire mass concentrated in a thin shell right under our feet, the ground 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 It will have no magnetic field any more, because it comes from the essence of molten iron. So you can 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.010
 Be completely exposed to radiation from wind and solar storms, this means we were 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.120
 See the Aurora Aurora everywhere. a look! The NorthernSouthernEastern lights! 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.280
 And if you jump into the hollow earth to escape the solar storm? Well, the gravity of the 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.930
 In different parts of the spherical ground shell will completely eliminate them and you float 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.880
 Freely on the inside as if the earth were not there at all! Of course, you bring the best 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.650
 Space suit, because there is not enough air on the ground to fill the entire INSIDE 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.990
 from Earth. But what if inside the entire floor was covered hollow with mirrors? 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.480
 Henry, this is ridiculous ... for now 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.820
 Well, we go back out of the ground and we will not really notice much of the difference from gravity 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.620
 Perspective - things would still drop m acceleration at 9.8 / w ^ 2, the baseball game would follow 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.060
 The same path, the moon will follow in the same orbit around the earth. 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.440
 O Henry, let's go into outer space, right now. Bring your gun - this will make every sense 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.740
 Later. Come on. 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.200
 Oh, you're coming too far. Click this explanation to head over to my channel, in Sous, to find out 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.489
 The rest of our adventures. I see you there.
