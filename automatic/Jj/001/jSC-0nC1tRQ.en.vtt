00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.750
 silently I said today there is mine 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:11.549

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.960
 I have the headset on yes the 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:16.020

 yes but fuck it as said today 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.279
 The living room just does not ask 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.450
 otherwise if that is the next room 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.770
 that probably can come up now 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.090
 next week I have the 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:30.719
 uni stress and that's why this is so here 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.160
 My hammer is cozy without shit 

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:34.980
 really cool 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.100
 So there is room for at least none 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.250
 yes quite normal tv now nothing 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.600
 Something extraordinary is somehow here 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:12.090
 5000 inches or what is the right moment 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.510
 still dragon's dogma and under it is 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.120
 Still tales of graces that my play you 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:22.230
 yes with a controller of the other 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.550
 was not in here please 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.930
 my playstation name is 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.550
 probably I am not so im 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.860
 playstation network access player 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.740
 actually only single player games on 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.470
 the place so I will probably 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.070
 never see it online anyway , as he already did 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.150
 have noticed but there is still one 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.420
 magazine rack but the head is one 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.300
 jacket in it so typical men style 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.620
 there is a frightful window or you 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.750
 maybe I have not seen any pictures 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.670
 the wall yes typical men's flat but 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.350
 of course , here lives no 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.970
 woman and therefore there are no 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.120
 plant or no pictures or something 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.640
 I do not know, I do not know 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.680
 I have no idea that somehow 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.710
 since there are cable charger and 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 So all in all fucking nothing special 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 everything in the area flies around me 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.030
 I wanted her to be normal 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.450
