sticks<00:00:49.770> down<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.870> lid

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
sticks down in and then we have the lid

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.160 
sticks down in and then we have the lid
now<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.739> lid<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.489> much<00:00:53.699> bigger<00:00:53.940> than<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.020> lid

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
now the lid is much bigger than the lid

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.540

that comes with the bottle you'll see
the<00:00:56.670> size<00:00:56.850> difference<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.629> that's<00:00:58.140> because

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
the size difference and that's because

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.020 
the size difference and that's because
this<00:00:58.620> lid<00:00:58.859> has<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.219> fit<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> ball

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
this lid has to fit down over the ball

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.819 
this lid has to fit down over the ball
if<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.629> try<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> use<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.320> lid<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.620> comes

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
what we do is sit it down on then we

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
what we do is sit it down on then we
want<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.060> screw<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> all<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> way<00:01:24.810> down<00:01:24.960> until
