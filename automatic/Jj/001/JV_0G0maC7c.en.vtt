00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
okay now let's take a look at materials

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.440 
okay now let's take a look at materials
and<00:00:06.420> textures<00:00:06.870> here<00:00:07.109> in<00:00:07.229> cinema<00:00:07.559> 4d<00:00:08.150> so<00:00:09.150> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
and textures here in cinema 4d so the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.789 
and textures here in cinema 4d so the
materials<00:00:09.900> are<00:00:09.990> what's<00:00:10.170> actually<00:00:10.410> going<00:00:10.680> to

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:10.799 
materials are what's actually going to

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:13.490 
materials are what's actually going to
really<00:00:11.129> bring<00:00:11.430> your<00:00:11.730> models<00:00:12.090> to<00:00:12.270> life<00:00:12.500> whether

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
really bring your models to life whether

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.629 
really bring your models to life whether
you<00:00:13.680> need<00:00:13.830> something<00:00:14.129> that's<00:00:14.160> shiny

material editor and this is where most
of<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.699> magic<00:00:39.149> happens<00:00:40.070> now<00:00:41.070> in<00:00:41.250> addition<00:00:41.609> to

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
of the magic happens now in addition to

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.000 
of the magic happens now in addition to
the<00:00:41.760> material<00:00:42.180> editor<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.780> also<00:00:43.019> have<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
the material editor you also have the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
the material editor you also have the
material<00:00:44.789> editor<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.359> here<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.019> your

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
material editor down here in your

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.919 
material editor down here in your
attribute<00:00:46.949> manager<00:00:47.399> basically<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:48.780> same

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
attribute manager basically the same

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.209 
attribute manager basically the same
information<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
information that you have in the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.000 
information that you have in the
material<00:00:50.609> editor<00:00:50.699> is<00:00:51.210> down<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.980> you<00:00:52.980> just

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
material editor is down here you just

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.240 
material editor is down here you just
have<00:00:53.129> it<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.429> tabs

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
have it on tabs

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.630 
have it on tabs
so<00:00:55.430> if<00:00:55.670> I<00:00:55.790> come<00:00:56.000> in<00:00:56.120> here<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:56.660> I<00:00:57.350> turn<00:00:57.650> on<00:00:57.860> some

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
so if I come in here and I turn on some

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.670 
so if I come in here and I turn on some
of<00:00:58.760> these<00:00:58.880> parameters<00:00:59.600> like<00:01:00.140> right<00:01:00.440> now<00:01:00.620> we

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
of these parameters like right now we

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.680 
of these parameters like right now we
just<00:01:00.950> have<00:01:01.160> color<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:01.550> specular<00:01:02.240> on<00:01:02.420> if<00:01:02.570> I

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
just have color and specular on if I

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.860 
just have color and specular on if I
turn<00:01:02.900> on<00:01:02.930> luminance

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:04.870 
turn on luminance

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.810 
turn on luminance
reflection<00:01:05.870> fog<00:01:06.500> you're<00:01:07.340> going<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.520> see<00:01:07.670> that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
reflection fog you're going to see that

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.440 
reflection fog you're going to see that
these<00:01:08.000> tabs<00:01:08.330> start<00:01:08.840> increasing<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:10.550> for<00:01:11.120> every

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
these tabs start increasing so for every

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.630 
these tabs start increasing so for every
parameter<00:01:11.840> I<00:01:12.110> turn<00:01:12.620> on<00:01:12.830> here<00:01:13.280> I'm<00:01:13.430> going<00:01:13.580> to

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
parameter I turn on here I'm going to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.880 
parameter I turn on here I'm going to
have<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:13.820> tab<00:01:14.120> where<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.630> can<00:01:14.930> actually<00:01:15.230> go<00:01:15.710> in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
have a tab where I can actually go in

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.400 
have a tab where I can actually go in
and<00:01:15.920> make<00:01:16.430> some<00:01:16.460> changes<00:01:17.060> to<00:01:17.120> that<00:01:17.360> so<00:01:18.230> let's

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
and make some changes to that so let's

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.730 
and make some changes to that so let's
turn<00:01:18.560> these<00:01:18.770> back<00:01:18.980> off<00:01:19.600> leave<00:01:20.600> defaults<00:01:21.110> on

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
turn these back off leave defaults on

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
turn these back off leave defaults on
put<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> cube<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.370> the<00:01:23.490> scene<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.049> I'm<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
put a cube in the scene and I'm going to

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
put a cube in the scene and I'm going to
take<00:01:25.920> my<00:01:26.100> material<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.240> I'm<00:01:27.659> just<00:01:27.810> going<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
take my material and I'm just going to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.320 
take my material and I'm just going to
drag<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.770> onto<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> cube<00:01:29.610> now<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.850> can<00:01:30.060> drag

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
drag it onto the cube now you can drag

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.899 
drag it onto the cube now you can drag
the<00:01:30.600> material<00:01:30.750> onto<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> cube<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:31.950> could

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the material onto the cube or I could

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.899 
the material onto the cube or I could
drag<00:01:33.240> it<00:01:33.479> onto<00:01:33.690> the<00:01:34.200> cube<00:01:35.010> in<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> object

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
drag it onto the cube in the object

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.800 
drag it onto the cube in the object
manager<00:01:36.200> so<00:01:37.200> either<00:01:37.530> way<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:38.009> work<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.810> when

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
manager so either way will work and when

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.290 
manager so either way will work and when
I<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.290> you'll<00:01:40.619> notice<00:01:40.800> that<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.490> also<00:01:41.850> have

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
I do that you'll notice that I also have

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.520 
I do that you'll notice that I also have
a<00:01:42.330> texture<00:01:43.080> tag<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:44.130> cube<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:46.259> want

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
a texture tag on the cube now if I want

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
a texture tag on the cube now if I want
to<00:01:46.740> rename<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.759> material<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.330> can<00:01:48.390> double

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
to rename the material I can double

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.430 
to rename the material I can double
click<00:01:48.990> here<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.470> type<00:01:49.520> it<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.640> there<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.149> I<00:01:51.440> can

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
click here and type it in there or I can

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.910 
click here and type it in there or I can
do<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.250> basic<00:01:53.670> tab<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.920> however

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
do that in the basic tab here so however

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.340 
do that in the basic tab here so however
you<00:01:56.009> want<00:01:56.160> to<00:01:56.190> work<00:01:56.369> that's<00:01:56.580> up<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.910> you<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
you want to work that's up to you I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.990 
you want to work that's up to you I
typically<00:01:58.350> like<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.679> double<00:01:59.340> click<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.550> the

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
typically like to double click on the

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.350 
typically like to double click on the
material<00:02:00.330> and<00:02:01.160> pull<00:02:02.160> up<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.399> material<00:02:03.179> editor

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
your graphics card so this is not really

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.120 
your graphics card so this is not really
what<00:03:01.090> your<00:03:01.210> material<00:03:01.570> is<00:03:01.660> looking<00:03:01.900> like<00:03:02.130> now

go way over the top over a hundred
percent<00:03:53.330> to<00:03:53.960> get<00:03:54.080> really<00:03:54.410> blown<00:03:54.710> out<00:03:54.920> looks

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
percent to get really blown out looks

percent to get really blown out looks
what<00:03:56.360> we<00:03:56.480> wouldn't<00:03:56.690> want<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:56.840> do<00:03:56.990> that<00:03:57.020> but<00:03:57.740> in

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
what we wouldn't want to do that but in

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.340 
what we wouldn't want to do that but in
some<00:03:58.040> cases<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.490> may<00:03:58.670> I<00:03:58.910> can<00:03:59.690> also<00:03:59.960> apply

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
some cases you may I can also apply

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.950 
some cases you may I can also apply
textures<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.400> can<00:04:01.670> apply<00:04:01.910> my<00:04:02.090> own<00:04:02.300> textures

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
textures I can apply my own textures

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.500 
textures I can apply my own textures
which<00:04:03.320> we<00:04:03.530> will<00:04:03.770> go<00:04:04.130> into<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.880> a<00:04:04.970> later<00:04:05.210> movie

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
which we will go into in a later movie

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.699 
which we will go into in a later movie
or<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.740> can<00:04:06.980> add<00:04:07.190> what<00:04:07.430> are<00:04:07.580> called<00:04:08.000> shaders

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
or I can add what are called shaders

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.440 
or I can add what are called shaders
we'll<00:04:09.709> take<00:04:09.890> a<00:04:09.920> look<00:04:10.160> at<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> few<00:04:10.550> of<00:04:10.640> these<00:04:10.790> but

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
we'll take a look at a few of these but

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.150 
we'll take a look at a few of these but
you<00:04:11.750> can<00:04:11.959> see<00:04:12.290> we<00:04:12.440> have<00:04:12.590> just<00:04:12.800> a<00:04:12.890> ton<00:04:13.130> of

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
you can see we have just a ton of

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.790 
you can see we have just a ton of
shaders<00:04:13.720> but<00:04:14.720> let's<00:04:15.080> say<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.320> I<00:04:15.380> wanted<00:04:15.709> to

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
shaders but let's say that I wanted to

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.080 
shaders but let's say that I wanted to
put<00:04:15.980> checkerboard<00:04:16.519> on<00:04:16.640> there<00:04:16.790> that's<00:04:16.970> a

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
put checkerboard on there that's a

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.530 
put checkerboard on there that's a
shader

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
shader

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.530 
shader
you<00:04:18.200> can<00:04:18.350> see<00:04:18.530> that<00:04:18.680> that<00:04:18.799> updates<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.519> can<00:04:20.419> go

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:20.540 
you can see that that updates I can go

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.810 
you can see that that updates I can go
into<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.140> checkerboard<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:22.040> can<00:04:22.190> make<00:04:22.340> changes

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
into the checkerboard I can make changes

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.350 
into the checkerboard I can make changes
we're<00:04:23.780> going<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> see<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.290> there<00:04:24.560> as<00:04:24.650> well<00:04:24.830> if

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
we're going to see that there as well if

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.820 
we're going to see that there as well if
you<00:04:26.360> decide<00:04:26.660> that<00:04:26.690> you<00:04:26.930> don't<00:04:27.169> want<00:04:27.560> this

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
you decide that you don't want this

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.740 
you decide that you don't want this
particular<00:04:28.100> shader<00:04:28.730> anymore<00:04:29.240> you<00:04:29.390> can<00:04:29.540> come

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
particular shader anymore you can come

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.680 
particular shader anymore you can come
here<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.350> click<00:04:30.919> on<00:04:31.100> clear<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.419> you<00:04:32.450> can

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
go choose another one we could come in

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.110 
go choose another one we could come in
here<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.000> choose<00:04:35.390> noise<00:04:35.960> for<00:04:36.290> instance<00:04:36.620> and

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
here and choose noise for instance and

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
in order to edit the noise we click on

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.140 
in order to edit the noise we click on
the<00:04:41.030> noise<00:04:41.660> icon<00:04:42.470> here<00:04:42.740> and<00:04:42.890> we<00:04:43.700> can<00:04:43.880> come<00:04:44.030> in

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
the noise icon here and we can come in

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.390 
the noise icon here and we can come in
here<00:04:44.480> and<00:04:44.690> choose<00:04:45.140> whatever<00:04:45.800> kind<00:04:46.100> of<00:04:46.220> noise

here and choose whatever kind of noise

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.690 
here and choose whatever kind of noise
we<00:04:46.640> want<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.120> make<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.510> appropriate<00:04:48.140> changes

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
we want and make the appropriate changes

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.770 
we want and make the appropriate changes
we<00:04:49.700> click<00:04:49.910> on<00:04:50.030> this<00:04:50.150> little<00:04:50.330> button<00:04:50.510> right

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
we click on this little button right

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.310 
we click on this little button right
here<00:04:51.100> we'll<00:04:52.100> get<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.370> visual<00:04:53.330> preview<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:54.110> what

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
here we'll get a visual preview of what

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.219 
here we'll get a visual preview of what
the<00:04:54.440> different<00:04:54.770> noise<00:04:54.919> types<00:04:55.280> look<00:04:55.700> like<00:04:56.229> so

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
the different noise types look like so

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.659 
the different noise types look like so
let's<00:04:57.470> say<00:04:57.680> that<00:04:57.710> I<00:04:57.860> wanted<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.190> go<00:04:58.340> with<00:04:58.490> this

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
let's say that I wanted to go with this

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.170 
let's say that I wanted to go with this
one<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.479> then<00:05:00.470> I<00:05:00.590> could<00:05:00.800> change<00:05:01.100> my<00:05:01.310> global

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
one and then I could change my global

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.210 
one and then I could change my global
scale<00:05:03.130> say<00:05:04.180> 10<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.470> you<00:05:06.470> have<00:05:06.680> all<00:05:06.800> sorts<00:05:07.100> of

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
scale say 10 and you have all sorts of

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.190 
scale say 10 and you have all sorts of
other<00:05:07.520> options<00:05:07.790> here<00:05:08.270> you<00:05:08.300> could<00:05:08.570> animate

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
other options here you could animate

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.969 
other options here you could animate
this<00:05:09.590> noise<00:05:09.950> loop<00:05:10.910> the<00:05:11.090> animation<00:05:11.770> change<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
this noise loop the animation change the

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.030 
this noise loop the animation change the
colors<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.630> just<00:05:14.810> a<00:05:14.870> lot<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.110> options<00:05:15.380> to<00:05:15.890> you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
colors so just a lot of options to you

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.180 
colors so just a lot of options to you
here<00:05:16.430> in<00:05:16.580> the<00:05:16.850> material<00:05:17.390> editor<00:05:18.130> okay<00:05:19.130> so

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:19.190 
here in the material editor okay so

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.760 
here in the material editor okay so
that's<00:05:19.460> the<00:05:19.640> very<00:05:19.880> basics<00:05:20.510> of<00:05:20.630> materials<00:05:21.440> here

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
that's the very basics of materials here

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.880 
that's the very basics of materials here
in<00:05:21.950> cinema<00:05:22.640> 4d
