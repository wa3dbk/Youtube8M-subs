10 min is that way of course you've got

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.810 
10 min is that way of course you've got
to<00:00:52.289> fly<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> another<00:00:53.070> 10<00:00:53.309> minutes<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.670> come

two of the issues in the vertical turn

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.570 
two of the issues in the vertical turn
are<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.500> weight<00:02:04.650> of<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:04.890> engine<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.370> the

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
are the weight of the engine and the

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.270 
are the weight of the engine and the

engine if you can reduce it means in

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.010 
engine if you can reduce it means in
that<00:02:10.050> initial<00:02:10.440> high<00:02:10.920> g<00:02:11.220> 12<00:02:11.580> g<00:02:11.790> pull<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.150> the

that initial high g 12 g pull up the

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.600 
that initial high g 12 g pull up the
wing<00:02:13.200> has<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> do<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:13.560> little<00:02:13.710> bit<00:02:13.860> less<00:02:13.980> work<00:02:14.250> so

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
wing has to do a little bit less work so

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.190 
wing has to do a little bit less work so
therefore<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.300> creates<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:15.900> bit<00:02:15.990> less

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
therefore it creates a little bit less

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.440 
therefore it creates a little bit less
drag<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.950> that's<00:02:17.100> an<00:02:17.310> advantage<00:02:17.700> for<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
drag so that that's an advantage for the

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.210 
drag so that that's an advantage for the
biggest<00:02:18.780> advantage<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.800> vertical<00:02:20.010> turn

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
biggest advantage in the vertical turn

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.280 
biggest advantage in the vertical turn
is<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.820> power<00:02:21.060> of<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.240> engine<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:22.140> other

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
is the power of the engine with other

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
is the power of the engine with other
teams<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.710> done<00:02:22.860> huge<00:02:23.130> amount<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> work<00:02:23.490> in

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
teams have done huge amount of work in

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.490 
teams have done huge amount of work in
getting<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.570> power<00:02:24.870> from<00:02:24.990> their<00:02:25.200> engines

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
getting more power from their engines

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.740 
getting more power from their engines
power<00:02:26.280> is<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:26.580> biggest<00:02:26.940> advantage<00:02:27.480> when<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
power is the biggest advantage when the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.350 
power is the biggest advantage when the
air<00:02:27.870> speed<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.350> low<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.220> slowest<00:02:29.760> you'll

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
air speed is low and the slowest you'll

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.850 
air speed is low and the slowest you'll
ever<00:02:30.510> see<00:02:30.660> one<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.840> these<00:02:30.960> things<00:02:31.170> flying<00:02:31.560> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
ever see one of these things flying is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.370 
ever see one of these things flying is
at<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.100> top<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:33.030> vertical<00:02:33.180> turn<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:34.260> is

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
at the top of a vertical turn that is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.960 
at the top of a vertical turn that is
when<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.590> advantage<00:02:34.770> comes<00:02:35.340> from<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.580> powerful

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
when the advantage comes from a powerful

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.210 
when the advantage comes from a powerful
engine<00:02:36.209> it<00:02:36.330> helps<00:02:36.570> you<00:02:36.660> accelerate<00:02:37.350> over<00:02:38.100> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
engine it helps you accelerate over the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.520 
engine it helps you accelerate over the
top<00:02:38.430> into<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.060> 45<00:02:39.510> degree<00:02:39.540> inverted<00:02:40.290> dive

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
top into that 45 degree inverted dive

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.680 
top into that 45 degree inverted dive
and<00:02:41.160> then<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.430> need<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.670> do<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> half<00:02:42.120> roll<00:02:42.450> up

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
and then we need to do a half roll up

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.199 
and then we need to do a half roll up
the<00:02:42.840> right<00:02:42.959> way<00:02:42.990> our<00:02:43.740> choice<00:02:44.070> left<00:02:44.400> alright<00:02:44.640> so

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the right way our choice left alright so

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.280 
the right way our choice left alright so
let's<00:02:45.420> say<00:02:45.570> we<00:02:45.630> want<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.810> go<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.050> right<00:02:46.170> we

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
let's say we want to go to the right we

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.020 
let's say we want to go to the right we
move<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> stick<00:02:46.770> over<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> right<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
move the stick over to the right and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.370 
move the stick over to the right and
back<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.360> middle<00:02:48.540> again<00:02:48.630> and<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.200> will

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
back to the middle again and that will

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.490 
back to the middle again and that will
be<00:02:49.620> sufficient<00:02:49.890> to<00:02:50.250> give<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:51.030> quick<00:02:51.959> half

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
be sufficient to give you a quick half

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.040 
be sufficient to give you a quick half
vertical<00:02:53.100> roller<00:02:53.220> up<00:02:53.490> right<00:02:53.690> poor<00:02:54.690> stick<00:02:54.900> back

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
again level through the exit gate it's a

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.560 
again level through the exit gate it's a
vertical<00:02:57.870> turn<00:02:58.790> how<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.850> fly<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.180> vertical

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.760 
turn here in Porto is absolutely
critical<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:03.060> how<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.390> do<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.050> race<00:03:04.230> it's

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
critical to how you do in the race it's

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.820 
critical to how you do in the race it's
skill<00:03:05.580> judgment<00:03:06.390> and<00:03:06.570> practice<00:03:07.200> of<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.410> pilot

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
skill judgment and practice of the pilot

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.710 
skill judgment and practice of the pilot
that's<00:03:07.980> that's<00:03:08.550> going<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> win<00:03:09.239> or<00:03:09.360> lose<00:03:09.540> the
