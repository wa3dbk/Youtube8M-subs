look at it this way so top 16 you have

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.760 
look at it this way so top 16 you have
your<00:02:18.030> very<00:02:18.209> basic<00:02:18.600> breakdown<00:02:18.810> if<00:02:19.200> top<00:02:19.350> 32<00:02:19.740> as

advancing into the finals you can pretty

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
advancing into the finals you can pretty
much<00:02:26.730> take<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:27.360> all<00:02:27.569> those<00:02:27.810> decks<00:02:28.110> are<00:02:28.290> on

for<00:02:32.459> each<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.910> those<00:02:33.000> decks<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.510> go<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.870> in

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
for each of those decks to go up in

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.190

but hey they still a top 16 they rose
and<00:03:03.390> price<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.200> point<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.830> though<00:03:05.130> having<00:03:05.820> a

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
and price the point is though having a

deck that does not clearly go to the
finals<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.080> a<00:03:10.080> tournament<00:03:10.500> really<00:03:10.800> helps

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
finals and a tournament really helps

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.670

those<00:03:11.459> heart<00:03:11.760> prices<00:03:12.209> stay<00:03:12.780> functionally

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
those heart prices stay functionally

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.490 
those heart prices stay functionally
high<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.520> it's<00:03:15.300> hoping<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.870> Rope<00:03:16.050> decks<00:03:16.320> the

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
high and it's hoping the Rope decks the

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.170 
high and it's hoping the Rope decks the
top<00:03:16.709> go<00:03:17.010> up<00:03:17.130> in<00:03:17.280> price<00:03:17.310> do<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.730> know<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.940> lot<00:03:18.120> of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
top go up in price do I know a lot of

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.970 
top go up in price do I know a lot of
you<00:03:18.300> guys<00:03:18.390> really<00:03:18.870> seemed<00:03:19.110> to<00:03:19.140> disregard<00:03:19.560> this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
you guys really seemed to disregard this

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.220 
you guys really seemed to disregard this
you<00:03:20.730> guys<00:03:20.910> really<00:03:21.090> paid<00:03:21.360> no<00:03:21.480> mind<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.870> it<00:03:22.020> but

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
you guys really paid no mind to it but

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.830 
you guys really paid no mind to it but
it<00:03:22.410> is<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.590> thing

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
it is a thing

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.199 
it is a thing
so<00:03:24.379> those<00:03:24.620> are<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:24.830> two<00:03:24.920> really<00:03:25.459> big<00:03:25.640> benefits

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
so those are the two really big benefits

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.809 
so those are the two really big benefits
to<00:03:26.540> having<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:26.930> current<00:03:27.230> system<00:03:27.379> in<00:03:27.620> place<00:03:27.819> I

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
to having the current system in place I

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.880 
to having the current system in place I
do<00:03:29.120> think<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:29.599> if<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.810> abolish<00:03:30.230> a<00:03:30.379> system

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
do think that if you abolish a system

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.940 
do think that if you abolish a system
and<00:03:31.040> you<00:03:31.129> go<00:03:31.280> back<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.730> deck<00:03:31.910> thing<00:03:32.180> I<00:03:32.950> mean

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
and you go back to the deck thing I mean

and you go back to the deck thing I mean
it's<00:03:34.129> to<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.400> but<00:03:35.000> most<00:03:35.330> players<00:03:35.569> like<00:03:35.870> myself

was plain training of this one I can

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.229 
was plain training of this one I can
still<00:03:52.190> come<00:03:52.340> that<00:03:52.489> doesn't<00:03:52.700> win<00:03:52.790> for<00:03:52.970> burning

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
still come that doesn't win for burning

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.420 
still come that doesn't win for burning
abyss<00:03:53.450> absolutely<00:03:54.440> no<00:03:54.560> reason<00:03:54.769> not<00:03:55.099> to<00:03:55.160> do

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
abyss absolutely no reason not to do

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.680 
abyss absolutely no reason not to do
that<00:03:55.640> because<00:03:55.880> you<00:03:56.209> know<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.480> player<00:03:56.660> and

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
that because you know the player and

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.000 
that because you know the player and
actually<00:03:57.140> still<00:03:57.349> took<00:03:57.530> that<00:03:57.709> into<00:03:57.890> the

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
actually still took that into the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.949 
actually still took that into the
tournament<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.269> know<00:03:59.360> that<00:03:59.630> would<00:03:59.780> still

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
tournament and you know that would still

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.050 
tournament and you know that would still
be<00:04:00.049> reflected<00:04:00.560> on<00:04:00.829> card<00:04:01.400> prices<00:04:01.640> and<00:04:01.940> things

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
be reflected on card prices and things

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.110 
be reflected on card prices and things
like<00:04:02.239> that<00:04:02.470> but<00:04:03.470> those<00:04:04.280> are<00:04:04.459> the<00:04:04.519> reasons<00:04:04.700> why

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
like that but those are the reasons why

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.289 
like that but those are the reasons why
I<00:04:05.150> consider<00:04:05.930> it<00:04:05.989> good<00:04:06.319> now<00:04:06.849> on<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.090> flip<00:04:08.209> side

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
I consider it good now on the flip side

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.440 
I consider it good now on the flip side
of<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.629> coin

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
of the coin

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.150 
of the coin
the<00:04:10.810> only<00:04:10.930> real<00:04:11.140> reason<00:04:11.290> that<00:04:11.650> I<00:04:11.739> can<00:04:11.980> see

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
the only real reason that I can see

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.100 
the only real reason that I can see
people<00:04:12.550> complain<00:04:12.790> about<00:04:12.819> this<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.599> be<00:04:13.629> honest

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
people complain about this to be honest

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.839 
people complain about this to be honest
with<00:04:14.200> you<00:04:14.290> it's<00:04:15.099> just<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.400> fact<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:15.670> they

00:04:15.839 --> 00:04:15.849 
with you it's just the fact that they

with you it's just the fact that they
want<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.150> see<00:04:16.269> their<00:04:16.540> one<00:04:16.780> deck<00:04:17.019> can<00:04:17.230> go<00:04:17.350> all

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
Lee because yeah it does get stale and

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.140 
Lee because yeah it does get stale and
I'll<00:04:57.020> agree<00:04:57.200> with<00:04:57.380> you<00:04:57.500> there<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:58.310> you<00:04:59.030> know

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
I'll agree with you there but you know

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.629 
I'll agree with you there but you know
the<00:04:59.450> skill<00:04:59.750> of<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.900> better<00:05:00.260> player<00:05:00.710> and<00:05:01.100> the

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 
the skill of the better player and the

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:04.210 
the skill of the better player and the
market<00:05:02.060> prices<00:05:02.540> i<00:05:02.690> would<00:05:02.840> consider<00:05:03.070> to<00:05:04.070> be

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
market prices i would consider to be

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.760 
market prices i would consider to be
more<00:05:04.460> important<00:05:04.970> than<00:05:05.060> outweighing<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:06.620> know

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
more important than outweighing you know

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.150 
more important than outweighing you know
just<00:05:07.240> great<00:05:08.240> better<00:05:08.660> coverage<00:05:09.230> on<00:05:09.560> you<00:05:10.040> know

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
just great better coverage on you know

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.370 
just great better coverage on you know
the<00:05:10.190> stuff<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.669> does<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.780> I<00:05:11.930> mean<00:05:12.139> we<00:05:12.260> do

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
the stuff that does because I mean we do

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.760 
the stuff that does because I mean we do
have<00:05:12.410> YCS<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:14.030> Europe<00:05:14.419> now<00:05:14.660> that<00:05:15.560> you<00:05:15.620> can

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
have YCS in Europe now that you can

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.340 
have YCS in Europe now that you can
actually<00:05:16.030> watch<00:05:17.030> the<00:05:17.570> stream<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:18.020> coverage

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
actually watch the stream the coverage

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.550 
actually watch the stream the coverage
so<00:05:19.250> much<00:05:19.400> beautifully<00:05:19.900> better<00:05:20.900> than<00:05:21.110> America

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
so much beautifully better than America

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.120 
so much beautifully better than America
and<00:05:22.340> you<00:05:22.580> know<00:05:22.900> I'd<00:05:23.900> rather<00:05:24.169> watch<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.980> know

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
and you know I'd rather watch you know

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.100 
and you know I'd rather watch you know
them<00:05:25.400> actually<00:05:25.610> out<00:05:26.000> there<00:05:26.030> stuff<00:05:26.479> and<00:05:26.870> that

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
them actually out there stuff and that

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.840 
them actually out there stuff and that
we<00:05:27.560> must<00:05:27.650> be<00:05:27.830> honest<00:05:28.160> if<00:05:28.310> we<00:05:28.460> had<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.700> watch

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
we must be honest if we had to watch

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.090 
we must be honest if we had to watch
drafting<00:05:29.570> in<00:05:29.780> America<00:05:30.290> we've<00:05:30.500> probably<00:05:30.770> to

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
drafting in America we've probably to

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.879 
drafting in America we've probably to
shoot<00:05:31.340> ourselves<00:05:31.639> in<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.090> legs<00:05:32.360> I<00:05:32.720> just<00:05:33.530> would

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
shoot ourselves in the legs I just would

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.430 
shoot ourselves in the legs I just would
not<00:05:34.070> be<00:05:34.250> fun<00:05:34.460> what's<00:05:34.669> of<00:05:34.850> it<00:05:34.970> I<00:05:35.510> could<00:05:36.229> see

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
not be fun what's of it I could see

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.260 
not be fun what's of it I could see
potentially<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.190> if<00:05:37.340> we<00:05:37.669> got<00:05:37.700> streaming<00:05:38.180> in

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
potentially that if we got streaming in

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.960 
potentially that if we got streaming in
America<00:05:38.690> for<00:05:38.840> events<00:05:39.229> I<00:05:39.410> would<00:05:40.010> definitely<00:05:40.220> be

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
America for events I would definitely be

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.650 
America for events I would definitely be
for<00:05:41.330> pushing<00:05:41.900> back<00:05:42.200> and<00:05:42.530> bringing<00:05:43.250> back<00:05:43.660> the

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
for pushing back and bringing back the

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.430 
for pushing back and bringing back the
overall<00:05:45.910> play<00:05:46.910> finals<00:05:47.450> with<00:05:48.200> the<00:05:48.320> original

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
overall play finals with the original

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.080 
overall play finals with the original
decks<00:05:48.830> because<00:05:49.310> I'm<00:05:49.550> not<00:05:49.669> going<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:49.880> want<00:05:50.030> to

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
decks because I'm not going to want to

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.879 
decks because I'm not going to want to
watch<00:05:50.240> my<00:05:50.450> draft<00:05:50.870> I'm<00:05:51.200> not<00:05:51.380> gonna<00:05:51.560> lie<00:05:51.650> to<00:05:51.740> you

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
watch my draft I'm not gonna lie to you

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:53.320 
watch my draft I'm not gonna lie to you
about<00:05:51.979> that<00:05:52.130> but<00:05:52.910> the<00:05:53.030> way<00:05:53.120> that<00:05:53.300> things

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
about that but the way that things

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.379 
about that but the way that things
currently<00:05:53.900> stand<00:05:54.139> I<00:05:54.820> think<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:55.880> we<00:05:56.240> can

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
currently stand I think that we can

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.880 
currently stand I think that we can
continue<00:05:56.690> to<00:05:56.960> have<00:05:57.110> things<00:05:57.290> the<00:05:57.500> way<00:05:57.620> they<00:05:57.860> are

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:57.890 
continue to have things the way they are
