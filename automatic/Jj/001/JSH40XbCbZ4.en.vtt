some<00:04:09.829> useless<00:04:10.220> stuff<00:04:10.489> in<00:04:10.669> each<00:04:10.760> video<00:04:11.120> but

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:11.659 
some useless stuff in each video but

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:13.629 
some useless stuff in each video but
it's<00:04:11.810> added<00:04:12.260> for<00:04:12.439> entertainment<00:04:13.099> value<00:04:13.129> I

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.439 
think they should all devote that time
to<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.799> end<00:04:15.950> of<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.130> videos<00:04:16.489> however<00:04:16.729> so<00:04:17.359> if

description to master NZ's video on a
technique<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.580> either<00:06:50.000> he<00:06:50.300> graded<00:06:50.539> or

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750 
technique that either he graded or

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.260 
technique that either he graded or
someone<00:06:51.050> else<00:06:51.199> created<00:06:51.440> on<00:06:51.740> the<00:06:52.430> last<00:06:52.940> four

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
someone else created on the last four

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.320 
someone else created on the last four
edges<00:06:53.479> on<00:06:53.870> a<00:06:53.930> seven<00:06:54.740> by<00:06:54.830> seven<00:06:54.860> cube<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:55.639> believe

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:56.330 
edges on a seven by seven cube I believe

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:57.939 
edges on a seven by seven cube I believe
you<00:06:56.449> can<00:06:56.570> also<00:06:56.720> apply<00:06:57.020> this<00:06:57.110> idea<00:06:57.349> to<00:06:57.650> a<00:06:57.680> five

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:57.949 
you can also apply this idea to a five

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.810 
you can also apply this idea to a five
by<00:06:58.130> five<00:06:58.310> and<00:06:58.639> six<00:06:59.539> by<00:06:59.720> six<00:06:59.780> possibly<00:07:00.590> but<00:07:01.520> 5

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
by five and six by six possibly but 5

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.779 
by five and six by six possibly but 5
and<00:07:02.090> 7<00:07:02.479> i'm<00:07:02.599> almost<00:07:02.840> positive<00:07:02.990> are<00:07:03.500> and<00:07:04.490> so<00:07:04.699> you

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
and 7 i'm almost positive are and so you

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:05.890 
and 7 i'm almost positive are and so you
should<00:07:04.880> check<00:07:05.120> that<00:07:05.240> out<00:07:05.300> i<00:07:05.419> find<00:07:05.780> it<00:07:05.870> really

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
should check that out i find it really

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.659 
should check that out i find it really
useful<00:07:06.110> i'm<00:07:06.500> going<00:07:06.650> to<00:07:06.710> try<00:07:06.800> to<00:07:06.860> use<00:07:07.250> this<00:07:07.460> in
