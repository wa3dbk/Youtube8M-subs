00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello all love now but with 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.759
 big steps on Nicholas and 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.109
 there is a Christmas today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.450
 little gift idea from me 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.070
 I hope I'm bored and so 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.840
 Today we make up a very simple one 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.780
 baking mix that was in the glass bottle 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.080
 and that's what we need 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.230
 because there is no wheat flour dark bacau 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 then we need brown sugar white 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.180
 sugar dark couverture and baking powder 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.650
 Of course we also need it 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.090
 still a pretty glass bottle to the 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.369
 then to give later 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.750
 who see who here and then we can 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.780
 actually start directly 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.930
 First of all, I have the whole day 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.450
 weighed 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.800
 I do that with the cocoa 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.200
 exact quantities I write to you 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.000
 then also the info-box and then 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 we have already started with the 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.170
 empathize and here you see I have 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.449
 me just a normal sheet 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.399
 paper a kind of funnel built around 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.899
 the sugar the sea and the cocoa 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.980
 just a little better in the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.710
 to get a bottle 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.629
 and there is the first layer already 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.789
 finished now the second layer 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.450
 is the brown sugar it really works 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.250
 relatively fix now one after another away then 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.820
 the third shift will come soon 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.830
 is the white who you but important 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.799
 that you really after each shift the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.650
 glass bottle so easily on the table 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.049
 Just really knock on it 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.180
 well-proportioned layers hinzubekommen 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.460
 and so it goes on now 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.770
 with the flour as usual through the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.329
 funnel and then the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.979
 bottle again so easily 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.619
 knocked the table and then are too 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.049
 Almost finished now I cut the 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.000
 Covers always relatively small pieces 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.689
 then they just better in the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 to introduce the bottle and the 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.340
 layer we see the same and as 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.170
 Last but not least, there are also the ones 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420
 chopped 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.759
 I can put both in the bottle 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.860
 they should actually fill up 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.360
 But then I have enough 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.159
 just decided it up again 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.470
 such a small layer with the overture 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.140
 and then we can do that 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.520
 Decorate bottle even that can 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.030
 then really everyone can do as he likes 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.720
 I 'm just here now 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.980
 healthy small puts on the written or 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.580
 written written label 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.260
 decided 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.730
 You can definitely look for prettier 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.110
 also introduce that and 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.849
 You can also tell stories how much 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.680
 It should be really easy to do something prettier 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.350
 just a little inspiration 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.590
 I hope you liked it again 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.590
 and see you soon
