00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
that was a mistake on my part I think I

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.070 
that was a mistake on my part I think I
do<00:03:39.400> end<00:03:39.700> up<00:03:39.790> giving<00:03:40.000> her<00:03:40.239> shoes<00:03:40.540> but<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.810> think

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
do end up giving her shoes but I think

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.660 
do end up giving her shoes but I think
if<00:03:41.230> she<00:03:41.440> was<00:03:41.650> gonna<00:03:41.770> be<00:03:41.860> barefoot<00:03:42.340> like<00:03:42.459> that

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
if she was gonna be barefoot like that

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.320 
if she was gonna be barefoot like that
would<00:03:42.760> be<00:03:42.880> totally<00:03:43.180> acceptable<00:03:43.600> as<00:03:43.870> well<00:03:45.330> but

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
would be totally acceptable as well but

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.979 
would be totally acceptable as well but
um<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.550> don't<00:03:48.550> know<00:03:48.700> I<00:03:48.790> just<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.390> really<00:03:49.420> like<00:03:49.870> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
um I don't know I just I really like the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.570 
um I don't know I just I really like the
way<00:03:50.080> that<00:03:50.260> she<00:03:50.320> came<00:03:50.980> out<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.220> don't<00:03:51.430> really

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
way that she came out I don't really

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.670 
way that she came out I don't really
think<00:03:51.670> I<00:03:51.910> talked<00:03:52.150> enough<00:03:52.810> about<00:03:52.870> her<00:03:53.320> facial

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.550 
think I talked enough about her facial
features<00:03:54.040> either<00:03:54.370> but<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.050> face<00:03:56.200> I<00:03:56.380> feel

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
features either but in the face I feel

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.320 
features either but in the face I feel
like<00:03:56.680> she<00:03:56.860> has<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.070> a<00:03:57.250> really<00:03:57.580> like<00:03:57.850> sweet

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.630 
look to her and I ended up getting her
cosmic<00:04:01.690> eyes<00:04:01.900> which<00:04:02.320> I've<00:04:02.560> used<00:04:02.920> those<00:04:03.370> in<00:04:03.400> a

know those fresh flowers things like

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.750 
know those fresh flowers things like
that<00:05:32.070> so<00:05:32.730> I<00:05:32.760> decided<00:05:33.300> to<00:05:33.450> add<00:05:34.110> in<00:05:34.770> a<00:05:35.070> flute<00:05:35.610> our

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
that so I decided to add in a flute our

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.400 
that so I decided to add in a flute our
crown<00:05:36.210> I<00:05:36.240> think<00:05:36.600> I<00:05:36.690> had<00:05:36.810> kind<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:37.020> a<00:05:37.110> hard<00:05:37.140> time

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
crown I think I had kind of a hard time

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:38.690 
crown I think I had kind of a hard time
deciding<00:05:37.710> on<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.010> color<00:05:38.040> palette<00:05:38.400> though

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
deciding on the color palette though

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.070 
deciding on the color palette though
because<00:05:38.910> there<00:05:39.210> wasn't<00:05:39.390> really<00:05:39.750> one<00:05:39.930> that

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
because there wasn't really one that

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.930 
because there wasn't really one that
matched<00:05:40.530> what<00:05:40.890> she<00:05:41.070> was<00:05:41.220> wearing<00:05:41.550> I<00:05:41.640> kind<00:05:41.850> of

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
matched what she was wearing I kind of

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.390 
matched what she was wearing I kind of
had<00:05:42.150> to<00:05:42.210> go<00:05:42.330> with<00:05:42.450> something<00:05:42.720> random<00:05:43.230> so<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
had to go with something random so I

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.340 
had to go with something random so I
believe<00:05:44.700> I<00:05:44.850> settled<00:05:45.240> on<00:05:45.360> this<00:05:45.870> one<00:05:46.140> which
