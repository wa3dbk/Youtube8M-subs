00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
many laps you want three six or nine you

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.990 
many laps you want three six or nine you
can<00:00:31.739> choose<00:00:31.919> a<00:00:31.949> difficulty<00:00:32.460> level<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.910> then

can choose a difficulty level and then

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.450 
can choose a difficulty level and then
just<00:00:33.210> obviously<00:00:33.540> start<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> risk<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:35.010> then<00:00:35.370> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
just obviously start the risk so then it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.800 
just obviously start the risk so then it
comes<00:00:35.610> up<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> end<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.630> am

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
comes up like you have to end up in am

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.160 
comes up like you have to end up in am
but<00:00:37.440> I'm<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> skip<00:00:38.130> that<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
but I'm just going to skip that and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.690 
but I'm just going to skip that and
anyway<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.710> basically<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.520> an

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
anyway this is basically it it's an

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
anyway this is basically it it's an
arcade<00:00:41.850> style<00:00:42.300> we<00:00:42.540> assert<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.990> just

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
arcade style we assert you just

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
arcade style we assert you just
basically<00:00:43.320> used<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.980> accelerate<00:00:44.460> well<00:00:44.880> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
basically used to accelerate well to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
basically used to accelerate well to
start<00:00:45.600> driving<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.170> then<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.740> have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.040> hold

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
start driving and then you have to hold

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.280 
start driving and then you have to hold
up<00:00:47.490> to<00:00:47.520> keep<00:00:47.850> accelerating<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.690> then

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
up to keep accelerating and then

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.350 
up to keep accelerating and then
obviously<00:00:49.530> left<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.040> right<00:00:50.160> you've<00:00:51.090> got<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
obviously left and right you've got the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.120 
obviously left and right you've got the
map<00:00:51.540> player<00:00:51.810> which<00:00:52.050> basically<00:00:52.530> shows<00:00:52.710> where

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
map player which basically shows where

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.950 
map player which basically shows where
you<00:00:53.220> are<00:00:53.400> you've<00:00:53.760> got<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.180> fuel<00:00:54.690> just

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
you are you've got the fuel just

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.960 
you are you've got the fuel just
underneath<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.830> obviously<00:00:56.670> that

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
underneath them up and obviously that

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.460 
underneath them up and obviously that
will<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.390> keep<00:00:57.540> decreasing<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.320> you've

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
will just keep decreasing so you've

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.800 
will just keep decreasing so you've
gotta<00:00:58.650> make<00:00:58.830> pit<00:00:59.040> stops<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.670> like<00:01:00.120> well<00:01:00.450> fill

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
gotta make pit stops to like well fill

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.450 
gotta make pit stops to like well fill
up<00:01:00.960> again<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.410> also<00:01:01.680> change<00:01:01.980> your<00:01:02.070> tightest

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
up again and also change your tightest

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.980 
up again and also change your tightest
you've<00:01:03.030> then<00:01:03.210> got<00:01:03.270> how<00:01:03.630> long<00:01:03.840> you've<00:01:03.960> been

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
you've then got how long you've been

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.080 
you've then got how long you've been
racing<00:01:04.769> for<00:01:04.799> just<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> left<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.700> art<00:01:05.850> and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
racing for just to the left of art and

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.300 
racing for just to the left of art and
what<00:01:06.299> speed<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> whole<00:01:07.950> point<00:01:08.130> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
what speed you on so the whole point is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.830 
what speed you on so the whole point is
though<00:01:08.460> it's<00:01:08.580> a<00:01:08.640> racing<00:01:08.850> game<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.420> ten<00:01:09.630> races

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
though it's a racing game is ten races

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.290 
though it's a racing game is ten races
and<00:01:10.230> you<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> come<00:01:11.130> first<00:01:11.370> and<00:01:11.730> you<00:01:12.150> get

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
and you have to come first and you get

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.120 
and you have to come first and you get
points<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.170> about<00:01:13.260> Hitler<00:01:13.620> that's

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
points so that's about Hitler that's

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.230 
points so that's about Hitler that's
pretty<00:01:14.430> much<00:01:14.550> everything<00:01:14.700> there<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.210> see

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
pretty much everything there is to see

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
pretty much everything there is to see
it<00:01:15.510> however<00:01:15.750> i<00:01:16.080> will<00:01:16.140> show<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.650> pit<00:01:16.830> stops

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it however i will show you the pit stops

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.130 
it however i will show you the pit stops
so<00:01:17.670> i'm<00:01:17.970> just<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.390> cut<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.870> them<00:01:18.990> now

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
so i'm just going to cut to them now

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.630 
so i'm just going to cut to them now
because<00:01:19.530> i<00:01:19.710> can't<00:01:19.920> even<00:01:20.159> show<00:01:20.340> up<00:01:20.370> and<00:01:20.580> they

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
because i can't even show up and they

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.010 
because i can't even show up and they
listen<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.940> the<00:01:21.060> music<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.690> there<00:01:21.810> isn't

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
listen to the music because there isn't

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
listen to the music because there isn't
any<00:01:22.110> music<00:01:22.500> unfortunately<00:01:23.040> it's<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.490> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
any music unfortunately it's just a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.980 
any music unfortunately it's just a
sound<00:01:23.700> effect

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.990 

so<00:01:31.590> every<00:01:31.799> golden<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> pit<00:01:32.759> crew

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
so every golden this is the pit crew

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490 
so every golden this is the pit crew
basically<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.960> wheel<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
basically you get this wheel and you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.690 
basically you get this wheel and you
