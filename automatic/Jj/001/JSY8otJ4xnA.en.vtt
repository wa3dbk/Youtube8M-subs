00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.399 
connectors your intended uses whether
their<00:01:53.310> BNC<00:01:53.939> or<00:01:54.210> anything<00:01:54.420> else<00:01:54.689> find<00:01:55.290> an

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
their BNC or anything else find an

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.690 
their BNC or anything else find an
extension<00:01:55.680> cable<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.369> way<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.579> can

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
extension cable so that way you can

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
extension cable so that way you can
mount<00:01:56.909> your<00:01:57.030> antennas<00:01:57.509> towards<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.140> back<00:01:58.520> now

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
mount your antennas towards the back now

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.959 
mount your antennas towards the back now
we're<00:01:59.640> gonna<00:01:59.729> start<00:02:00.299> working<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.969> actual

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
we're gonna start working on the actual

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.639 
we're gonna start working on the actual
power<00:02:03.210> strip<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.810> dead<00:02:04.020> on

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
power strip for the dead on

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.380 
power strip for the dead on
now<00:02:06.649> the<00:02:06.770> very<00:02:06.950> first<00:02:07.189> thing<00:02:07.369> that<00:02:07.729> you'll<00:02:08.149> see

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
now the very first thing that you'll see

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.949 
now the very first thing that you'll see
here<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:09.140> for<00:02:09.860> some<00:02:10.099> reason<00:02:10.129> or<00:02:10.610> another

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
here is that for some reason or another

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.140 
here is that for some reason or another
then<00:02:11.959> on<00:02:12.140> in<00:02:12.349> their<00:02:12.470> infinite<00:02:12.709> wisdom<00:02:12.970> use<00:02:13.970> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
then on in their infinite wisdom use the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.020 
then on in their infinite wisdom use the
regular<00:02:14.540> power<00:02:14.860> plug<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.250> versus<00:02:16.640> a<00:02:16.670> 90

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
regular power plug like this versus a 90

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
regular power plug like this versus a 90
degree<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.900> I<00:02:17.930> recommend<00:02:18.410> getting<00:02:18.470> some<00:02:18.860> sort

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
degree so I recommend getting some sort

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.250 
degree so I recommend getting some sort
of<00:02:19.129> 90<00:02:19.459> degree<00:02:19.760> adapter<00:02:20.269> to<00:02:20.690> keep<00:02:20.870> that<00:02:21.019> from

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
of 90 degree adapter to keep that from

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.550 
of 90 degree adapter to keep that from
breaking<00:02:22.040> off<00:02:22.220> but<00:02:22.849> for<00:02:23.030> now<00:02:23.260> I'm<00:02:24.260> gonna<00:02:24.349> go

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
breaking off but for now I'm gonna go

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.650 
breaking off but for now I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.830> switch<00:02:25.190> these<00:02:25.400> out<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:25.940> I'm<00:02:26.540> gonna

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
ahead and switch these out so I'm gonna

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.630 
ahead and switch these out so I'm gonna
put<00:02:26.840> my<00:02:27.019> microphone<00:02:27.260> plug<00:02:28.180> right<00:02:29.180> here

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
put my microphone plug right here

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.339 
put my microphone plug right here
towards<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.790> part<00:02:32.120> I'm<00:02:32.780> gonna<00:02:32.930> plug<00:02:33.170> the

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
towards this part I'm gonna plug the

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.259 
towards this part I'm gonna plug the
dent<00:02:33.560> on<00:02:33.680> in<00:02:35.440> towards<00:02:36.440> the<00:02:36.470> back<00:02:37.060> now<00:02:38.060> one<00:02:38.239> of

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
dent on in towards the back now one of

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.210 
dent on in towards the back now one of
the<00:02:38.390> nice<00:02:38.540> things<00:02:38.569> is<00:02:39.049> that<00:02:39.079> there's<00:02:39.950> enough

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
the nice things is that there's enough

the nice things is that there's enough
room<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.640> then<00:02:40.790> I<00:02:40.819> will<00:02:41.120> sit<00:02:41.420> without<00:02:42.110> having

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
room that then I will sit without having

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.979 
room that then I will sit without having
to<00:02:43.040> be<00:02:43.700> pushed<00:02:44.000> up<00:02:44.180> it's<00:02:44.390> gonna<00:02:44.510> sit<00:02:44.750> nice<00:02:44.959> and

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
to be pushed up it's gonna sit nice and

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.670 
to be pushed up it's gonna sit nice and
flush<00:02:45.500> because<00:02:46.370> of<00:02:46.489> how<00:02:46.610> deep<00:02:46.849> the<00:02:46.880> case<00:02:47.239> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
flush because of how deep the case is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.470 
flush because of how deep the case is
and<00:02:48.680> again<00:02:48.980> I'm<00:02:49.790> gonna<00:02:50.000> use<00:02:50.120> these<00:02:50.269> little

that's what these guys here are for

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.160 
that's what these guys here are for
we're<00:03:16.310> gonna<00:03:16.370> use<00:03:16.609> them<00:03:16.819> just<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.329> kind<00:03:18.139> of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
we're gonna use them just to kind of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.690 
we're gonna use them just to kind of
patch<00:03:18.350> it<00:03:18.560> in<00:03:18.680> and<00:03:18.920> make<00:03:19.190> it<00:03:19.220> a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:19.489> bit

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
patch it in and make it a little bit

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.229 
patch it in and make it a little bit
thicker<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:22.280> means<00:03:22.549> that<00:03:22.790> you<00:03:23.000> know<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
thicker this means that you know the

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.030 
thicker this means that you know the
same<00:03:23.420> time<00:03:23.450> if<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.840> newer<00:03:24.049> version<00:03:24.319> comes<00:03:24.799> out

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
same time if a newer version comes out

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.009 
same time if a newer version comes out
if<00:03:25.849> it's<00:03:25.940> a<00:03:26.000> little<00:03:26.150> bit<00:03:26.299> wider<00:03:26.599> you<00:03:26.930> can

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
if it's a little bit wider you can

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.710 
if it's a little bit wider you can
remove<00:03:27.380> these<00:03:27.560> blocks<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.340> put<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.269> or<00:03:29.420> you

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
remove these blocks and put it or you

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.229 
remove these blocks and put it or you
know<00:03:29.840> a<00:03:30.139> newer<00:03:30.500> unit<00:03:31.010> or<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.280> completely

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
know a newer unit or a completely

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.349 
know a newer unit or a completely
different<00:03:32.359> unit<00:03:32.780> as<00:03:32.900> well<00:03:33.940> another<00:03:34.940> option

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
different unit as well another option

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.089 
different unit as well another option
you<00:03:35.450> can<00:03:35.480> do<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.840> these<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.889> you<00:03:37.069> can

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
you can do with these is you can

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.020 
you can do with these is you can
actually<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.639> put<00:03:37.819> these<00:03:38.000> guys<00:03:38.239> right<00:03:38.540> here

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.090 

going<00:03:43.240> to<00:03:43.300> Lee<00:03:43.390> I'll<00:03:43.510> patch<00:03:43.780> cables<00:03:44.350> so<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
going to Lee I'll patch cables so the

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.699 
going to Lee I'll patch cables so the
USB<00:03:45.520> cables<00:03:45.880> off<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.300> side<00:03:46.540> there<00:03:46.810> so<00:03:47.620> the

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
USB cables off to the side there so the

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.080 
USB cables off to the side there so the
concept<00:03:48.069> of<00:03:48.130> a<00:03:48.220> patch<00:03:48.400> cable<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.880> pretty

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
concept of a patch cable is pretty

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.180 
concept of a patch cable is pretty
obvious<00:03:49.350> basically<00:03:50.350> you're<00:03:50.709> always<00:03:50.740> gonna

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
obvious basically you're always gonna

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.400 
obvious basically you're always gonna
have<00:03:51.459> one<00:03:51.700> end<00:03:51.940> plugged<00:03:52.510> into<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.200> back<00:03:53.380> of

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
have one end plugged into the back of

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.590 
have one end plugged into the back of
your<00:03:53.740> mixer<00:03:54.130> because<00:03:54.819> as<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.060> plug<00:03:55.330> and

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
your mixer because as you plug and

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.660 
your mixer because as you plug and
unplug<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:56.170> plug<00:03:56.200> in<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.620> plug<00:03:56.890> these<00:03:57.430> things

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 
unplug and plug in a plug these things

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.920 
unplug and plug in a plug these things
actually<00:03:58.000> operating<00:03:58.450> is<00:03:58.510> any<00:03:58.630> kind<00:03:58.810> of

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
actually operating is any kind of

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.120 
actually operating is any kind of
connection<00:03:59.140> has<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.410> rating<00:03:59.739> of<00:03:59.800> how<00:03:59.920> many

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
connection has a rating of how many

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.830 
connection has a rating of how many
times<00:04:00.250> you<00:04:00.400> can<00:04:00.489> plug<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.880> plug<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.239> before

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
times you can plug in a plug it before

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.690 
times you can plug in a plug it before
it's<00:04:01.989> going<00:04:02.170> to<00:04:02.350> fail<00:04:02.560> having<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.520> always

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
it's going to fail having it always

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.390 
it's going to fail having it always
plugged<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.450> it's<00:04:05.290> gonna<00:04:05.440> be<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.800> patch<00:04:06.069> and

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
plugged in it's gonna be this patch and

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.610 
plugged in it's gonna be this patch and
it's<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.150> eventually<00:04:07.810> get<00:04:08.200> messed<00:04:08.410> up

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
it's going to eventually get messed up

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.170 
it's going to eventually get messed up
and<00:04:08.860> it's<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.310> lot<00:04:09.459> easier<00:04:09.580> replacing<00:04:10.120> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
and it's a lot easier replacing the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.580 
and it's a lot easier replacing the
cable<00:04:10.450> than<00:04:10.540> replacing<00:04:10.959> the<00:04:11.050> end<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.380> one<00:04:11.500> of

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
cable than replacing the end of one of

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.300 
cable than replacing the end of one of
these<00:04:11.709> guys<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.690> now<00:04:13.750> we<00:04:13.959> have<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.560> mic<00:04:15.070> cable

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
these guys and now we have the mic cable

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.880 
these guys and now we have the mic cable
okay<00:04:16.299> so<00:04:16.359> once<00:04:16.660> we're<00:04:16.870> done<00:04:17.079> I'm<00:04:17.500> gonna<00:04:17.620> push

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
okay so once we're done I'm gonna push

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.319 
okay so once we're done I'm gonna push
this<00:04:18.010> back<00:04:18.250> a<00:04:18.280> little<00:04:18.519> bit<00:04:18.669> I<00:04:18.730> want<00:04:18.880> these<00:04:19.090> to

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
this back a little bit I want these to

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.230 
this back a little bit I want these to
be<00:04:19.450> flush<00:04:19.750> with<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.530> opening<00:04:20.980> that<00:04:21.730> way<00:04:21.940> I<00:04:21.970> can

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
be flush with the opening that way I can

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360 
be flush with the opening that way I can
slide<00:04:22.810> those<00:04:22.990> cables<00:04:23.320> over<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.680> top<00:04:23.890> and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
slide those cables over the top and

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.220 
slide those cables over the top and
we're<00:04:25.240> just<00:04:25.330> gonna<00:04:25.450> put<00:04:25.690> this<00:04:25.780> guy<00:04:25.960> directly

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
have there stop the lid from going all

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.280 
have there stop the lid from going all
the<00:04:46.000> way<00:04:46.120> down<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:46.570> again<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.900> can<00:04:47.050> trim<00:04:47.260> it

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
the way down and again you can trim it

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.510 
the way down and again you can trim it
if<00:04:47.470> you<00:04:47.560> need<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:47.830> you<00:04:48.010> can<00:04:48.130> use<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.370> regular

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
if you need to you can use the regular

if you need to you can use the regular
blocks<00:04:48.970> I<00:04:49.120> showed<00:04:49.450> you<00:04:49.570> both<00:04:49.750> ways<00:04:50.020> but<00:04:50.710> even

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
blocks I showed you both ways but even

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.100 
blocks I showed you both ways but even
if<00:04:51.130> those<00:04:51.490> blocks<00:04:51.820> there<00:04:52.090> also<00:04:52.390> keep<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:52.930> lid

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
if those blocks there also keep the lid

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.080 
if those blocks there also keep the lid
from<00:04:53.380> hitting<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.740> dent<00:04:54.010> on<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.430> rubbing<00:04:55.000> up

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
from hitting the dent on and rubbing up

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.420 
from hitting the dent on and rubbing up
against<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.600> actual<00:04:55.960> knobs<00:04:56.710> for<00:04:56.979> my<00:04:57.160> case

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
against the actual knobs for my case

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.600 
against the actual knobs for my case
because<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:58.390> don't<00:04:58.750> want<00:04:59.020> it<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.490> want<00:05:00.490> to<00:05:00.550> be

because I don't want it I want to be

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.130 
because I don't want it I want to be
able<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.760> close<00:05:00.880> it<00:05:01.060> all<00:05:01.180> the<00:05:01.300> way<00:05:01.390> through<00:05:01.419> I'm

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
able to close it all the way through I'm

anything<00:05:14.200> like<00:05:14.320> that

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:15.270 
anything like that

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.029 
anything like that
so<00:05:16.270> essentially<00:05:16.630> what<00:05:17.200> my<00:05:17.320> DJ<00:05:17.470> is<00:05:17.680> ready<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.950> go

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
so essentially what my DJ is ready to go

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:19.380 
so essentially what my DJ is ready to go
out<00:05:18.070> into<00:05:18.340> his<00:05:18.400> event<00:05:18.700> all<00:05:18.970> you<00:05:19.090> gotta<00:05:19.240> do<00:05:19.360> is

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
out into his event all you gotta do is

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:22.620 
out into his event all you gotta do is
pull<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.750> antennas<00:05:20.260> out<00:05:20.380> there<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:21.330> I'd<00:05:22.330> you

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:22.630 
pull the antennas out there and I'd you

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.670 
pull the antennas out there and I'd you
don't<00:05:22.780> have<00:05:22.870> to<00:05:22.930> lift<00:05:23.050> him<00:05:23.200> all<00:05:23.350> the<00:05:23.470> way<00:05:23.560> up

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
don't have to lift him all the way up

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.680 
don't have to lift him all the way up
like<00:05:23.740> that<00:05:24.039> because<00:05:24.580> he<00:05:24.669> stopped<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.120> hinge<00:05:25.419> to

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
like that because he stopped a hinge to
