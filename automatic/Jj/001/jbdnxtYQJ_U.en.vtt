00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
by however the problem with that is as

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.930 
by however the problem with that is as
your<00:03:11.069> tariffs<00:03:11.430> go<00:03:11.609> up<00:03:12.319> Liberty<00:03:13.319> desire<00:03:14.250> will

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
interesting

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.789 
interesting
well<00:03:22.790> Venice<00:03:23.790> has<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.660> couple<00:03:25.049> friends<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.769> it

well Venice has a couple friends when it

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.699 
well Venice has a couple friends when it
comes<00:03:26.069> to<00:03:26.280> did<00:03:26.579> trying<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:26.940> attack<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.329> strap-on

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
comes to did trying to attack a strap-on

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.430 
comes to did trying to attack a strap-on
when<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.889> AI<00:03:29.069> hasn't<00:03:29.790> yet<00:03:30.329> been<00:03:30.599> adapted<00:03:31.230> to

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
when the AI hasn't yet been adapted to

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.500 
when the AI hasn't yet been adapted to
new<00:03:31.650> mechanics<00:03:32.519> it<00:03:32.730> will<00:03:32.910> do<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.480> most

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
new mechanics it will do the most

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.309 
new mechanics it will do the most
bizarre<00:03:34.190> things<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.849> it's<00:03:36.120> used<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:37.169> make

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
bizarre things because it's used to make

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.280 
bizarre things because it's used to make
sense<00:03:38.750> for<00:03:39.980> example<00:03:41.269> trade<00:03:42.269> will<00:03:42.540> now<00:03:42.720> all<00:03:42.989> go

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
sense for example trade will now all go

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.520 
sense for example trade will now all go
through<00:03:43.700> Western<00:03:44.700> through<00:03:45.630> a<00:03:45.660> node<00:03:46.260> in

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
through Western through a node in

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.129 
through Western through a node in
Western<00:03:46.889> Europe<00:03:46.919> that<00:03:47.519> has<00:03:48.389> no<00:03:48.690> land

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
Western Europe that has no land

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.800 
Western Europe that has no land
provinces<00:03:49.889> connected<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.730> yes<00:03:51.030> which

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
provinces connected to it yes which

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.740 
provinces connected to it yes which
means<00:03:52.169> there<00:03:52.500> was<00:03:52.980> initially<00:03:53.579> no<00:03:53.819> value<00:03:54.419> in<00:03:54.569> it

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
means there was initially no value in it

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.960 
means there was initially no value in it
which<00:03:55.230> meant<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.889> AI<00:03:56.099> wouldn't<00:03:56.639> send

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
which meant that the AI wouldn't send

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.970 
which meant that the AI wouldn't send
any<00:03:57.419> merchants<00:03:57.810> there

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
any merchants there

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.020 
any merchants there
so<00:04:00.280> all<00:04:00.580> the<00:04:01.110> trade<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.770> black<00:04:03.400> hole<00:04:03.670> called

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
so all the trade a black hole called

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.390 
so all the trade a black hole called
Western<00:04:04.540> Europe<00:04:04.900> yeah<00:04:05.379> it<00:04:05.830> took<00:04:05.980> me<00:04:06.160> a<00:04:06.190> few

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
Western Europe yeah it took me a few

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.770 
Western Europe yeah it took me a few
days<00:04:06.489> of<00:04:06.700> work<00:04:06.849> on<00:04:07.030> that<00:04:07.060> one<00:04:07.330> because<00:04:07.629> there

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
days of work on that one because there

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.449 
days of work on that one because there
were<00:04:07.840> just<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.200> many<00:04:08.260> issues<00:04:08.590> related<00:04:08.769> to

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
were just so many issues related to

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.550 
were just so many issues related to
having<00:04:09.640> an<00:04:09.879> old<00:04:10.030> seen<00:04:10.360> old<00:04:10.629> when<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.379> game

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
having an old seen old when the game

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.860 
having an old seen old when the game
just<00:04:11.800> wasn't<00:04:12.280> set<00:04:12.430> up<00:04:12.550> for<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.849> -<00:04:13.209> opium

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
just wasn't set up for it - opium

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180 
province time at the marketing it exact

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.479 
province time at the marketing it exact
same<00:04:19.389> time<00:04:19.720> which<00:04:20.380> would<00:04:20.560> result<00:04:20.709> in<00:04:21.100> whoever

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
same time which would result in whoever

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.750 
same time which would result in whoever
migrated<00:04:22.210> second<00:04:22.660> would<00:04:23.320> just<00:04:23.710> sort<00:04:23.979> of<00:04:24.040> move

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
migrated second would just sort of move

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.700 
migrated second would just sort of move
there<00:04:25.090> and<00:04:25.300> annihilate<00:04:25.900> whoever<00:04:26.320> was<00:04:26.500> there

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
there and annihilate whoever was there

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.400 
there and annihilate whoever was there
first<00:04:27.010> and<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.870> they<00:04:28.990> were<00:04:29.080> still<00:04:29.200> like

first and but they were still like

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.140 
first and but they were still like
exists<00:04:29.950> diplomatically<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.820> all<00:04:30.940> that

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
exists diplomatically in all that

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.760 
exists diplomatically in all that
because<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.540> wasn't<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.810> proper<00:04:31.990> annexation

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
because it wasn't the proper annexation

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.350 
because it wasn't the proper annexation
so<00:04:32.889> they<00:04:32.979> were<00:04:33.130> they<00:04:33.370> were<00:04:33.430> kind<00:04:33.700> of<00:04:33.850> emulating

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
so they were they were kind of emulating

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.270 
so they were they were kind of emulating
conquistadors<00:04:35.350> without<00:04:35.710> really<00:04:36.010> knowing

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280

what<00:04:36.580> conquistadors<00:04:37.270> were<00:04:39.630> coalition<00:04:40.630> okay

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
what conquistadors were coalition okay

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.690 
what conquistadors were coalition okay
another<00:04:41.770> thing<00:04:41.889> is<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.250> colonial<00:04:42.580> trade

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700
