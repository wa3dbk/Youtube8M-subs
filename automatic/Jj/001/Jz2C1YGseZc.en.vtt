00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
damage to it you want to hurt you can

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.499 
damage to it you want to hurt you can
you<00:01:35.369> know<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.790> use<00:01:35.939> in<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.119> striker

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
you know I would use in the striker

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.740 
you know I would use in the striker
which<00:01:37.130> you<00:01:38.130> are<00:01:38.280> able<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.640> buy<00:01:38.880> just<00:01:39.390> before

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
which you are able to buy just before

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.649 
which you are able to buy just before
you<00:01:39.810> start<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.200> fight<00:01:40.970> from<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> merchants

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you start this fight from the merchants

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.270 
you start this fight from the merchants
and<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.490> wasn't<00:01:45.740> powerfully<00:01:46.740> upgraded<00:01:47.220> I

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
and so it wasn't powerfully upgraded I

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.249 
and so it wasn't powerfully upgraded I
think<00:01:47.490> I've<00:01:47.640> graded<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.420> power<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.020> twice

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
think I've graded the power on it twice

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
think I've graded the power on it twice
and<00:01:50.329> upgrade<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.750> reloads<00:01:52.680> anything<00:01:53.369> then

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and upgrade the reloads anything then

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.330 
and upgrade the reloads anything then
that's<00:01:54.030> all<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.180> had<00:01:54.420> done<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.899> it<00:01:54.990> for<00:01:55.680> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
that's all I had done to it for this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.539 
that's all I had done to it for this
five<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.000> use<00:01:57.270> is<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.630> striker<00:01:58.110> and<00:01:58.549> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
five all I use is a striker and the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.090 
five all I use is a striker and the
broken<00:02:00.119> bottle<00:02:00.270> fly<00:02:00.509> which<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.619> didn't<00:02:01.920> buy<00:02:02.070> I

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
broken bottle fly which I didn't buy I

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.350 
broken bottle fly which I didn't buy I
did<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> for<00:02:03.030> free<00:02:04.490> by<00:02:05.490> doing<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.149> little

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
did get it for free by doing a little

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.460 
did get it for free by doing a little
thing<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.719> with<00:02:06.869> actually<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.380> get<00:02:07.500> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
thing to do with actually to get it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
so as you can see I'm fairly organized

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.760 
so as you can see I'm fairly organized

wrong<00:02:14.830> but<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.250> think<00:02:15.660> entirely<00:02:16.660> I<00:02:17.140> use<00:02:17.610> by<00:02:18.610> no<00:02:19.510> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
wrong but I think entirely I use by no I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.500 
wrong but I think entirely I use by no I
have<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.050> kill<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.320> by<00:02:20.530> eight<00:02:21.160> or<00:02:21.520> so<00:02:21.820> Magnum

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
have to kill you by eight or so Magnum

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.920 
have to kill you by eight or so Magnum
shots<00:02:22.810> and<00:02:23.170> then<00:02:24.330> shotgun<00:02:25.330> shells<00:02:25.570> almost

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
shots and then shotgun shells almost

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.810 
shots and then shotgun shells almost
huge<00:02:26.110> about<00:02:26.410> maybe<00:02:26.980> 20<00:02:28.050> 25<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.830> them<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.460> maybe

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
huge about maybe 20 25 of them so maybe

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.120 
huge about maybe 20 25 of them so maybe
a<00:02:30.910> little<00:02:30.970> bit<00:02:31.180> more<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.720> use<00:02:32.710> none<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> my

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
a little bit more I use none of my

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.660 
a little bit more I use none of my
grenades

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
grenades

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.370 
grenades
oh<00:02:33.760> no<00:02:34.450> healing<00:02:34.780> items<00:02:35.910> well<00:02:37.050> I'll<00:02:38.050> keep

oh no healing items well I'll keep
showing<00:02:38.740> you<00:02:38.890> where<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.570> canisters<00:02:40.570> are

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
showing you where all the canisters are

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.830 
showing you where all the canisters are
because<00:02:41.230> I<00:02:41.410> use<00:02:41.590> every<00:02:41.920> single<00:02:41.950> one<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.840> kill

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
because I use every single one to kill

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.390 
because I use every single one to kill
him

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
him

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.310 
him
so<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.850> third<00:02:46.150> one<00:02:46.420> is<00:02:46.690> in<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:46.930> room<00:02:47.080> here

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
so the third one is in this room here

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.290 
so the third one is in this room here
now<00:02:47.890> we're<00:02:48.070> just<00:02:48.190> stood<00:02:48.520> and<00:02:48.700> I<00:02:48.820> will<00:02:49.000> waiting

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
now we're just stood and I will waiting

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.040 
now we're just stood and I will waiting
firm<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.750> get<00:02:50.290> close<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.590> me<00:02:50.890> and<00:02:51.240> I<00:02:52.240> didn't

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
firm to get close to me and I didn't

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.660 
firm to get close to me and I didn't
almost<00:02:53.170> get<00:02:53.470> hit<00:02:53.650> though<00:02:53.830> everything<00:02:54.190> because

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
almost get hit though everything because

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.110 
almost get hit though everything because
I<00:02:55.120> wasn't<00:02:56.020> expected<00:02:56.710> into<00:02:56.920> -<00:02:57.160> at<00:02:57.400> me<00:02:57.490> like<00:02:57.640> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
I wasn't expected into - at me like that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.300 
I wasn't expected into - at me like that
so<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:58.750> will<00:02:58.930> lucky<00:02:59.290> enough<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.590> our<00:02:59.740> money<00:03:00.130> to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
so I will lucky enough on our money to

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.390 
so I will lucky enough on our money to

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.640 
one - cause I quite a bit damage puddin
you'll<00:03:06.130> knock<00:03:06.340> him<00:03:06.550> over<00:03:06.670> onto<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.210> floor

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
you'll knock him over onto the floor

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.260 
you'll knock him over onto the floor
which<00:03:08.650> is<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.340> big<00:03:09.490> help<00:03:09.700> and<00:03:09.940> then<00:03:10.060> I'd<00:03:10.180> like

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
which is the big help and then I'd like

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.240 
which is the big help and then I'd like
to<00:03:10.330> get<00:03:10.570> a<00:03:10.630> few<00:03:10.930> easy<00:03:11.080> sharps<00:03:11.560> into<00:03:11.860> him<00:03:13.200> so

to get a few easy sharps into him so

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.340 
to get a few easy sharps into him so
everything<00:03:15.250> out<00:03:15.760> now<00:03:18.600> here<00:03:19.600> we're<00:03:19.989> kind<00:03:20.200> of

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
everything out now here we're kind of

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.770 
everything out now here we're kind of
computing<00:03:20.800> where<00:03:20.980> he<00:03:21.190> had<00:03:21.280> actually<00:03:21.730> gone<00:03:21.910> but

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
computing where he had actually gone but

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.210 
computing where he had actually gone but
that<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> realize<00:03:23.320> that<00:03:23.350> you<00:03:23.590> come<00:03:23.739> down<00:03:23.980> on<00:03:24.010> me

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
that I realize that you come down on me

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220 
that I realize that you come down on me
and<00:03:24.520> I<00:03:24.640> had<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:24.970> go<00:03:25.090> back<00:03:25.300> in<00:03:25.450> that<00:03:25.600> the<00:03:25.840> TMP

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
and I had to go back in that the TMP

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.970 
and I had to go back in that the TMP
ammo<00:03:26.530> or<00:03:26.950> they<00:03:27.130> have<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.610> both<00:03:28.140> always<00:03:29.140> do<00:03:29.800> with

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
ammo or they have to both always do with

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.070 
ammo or they have to both always do with
extra<00:03:30.430> mile<00:03:30.670> for<00:03:30.700> could<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:31.660> never<00:03:31.810> know<00:03:31.959> when

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
extra mile for could you never know when

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.650 
extra mile for could you never know when
you're<00:03:32.170> gonna<00:03:32.230> need<00:03:32.470> on<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.739> game<00:03:33.420> but<00:03:34.420> you

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
you're gonna need on the game but you

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.590 
you're gonna need on the game but you
see<00:03:34.870> I'm<00:03:35.200> shooting<00:03:35.620> him<00:03:35.739> and<00:03:35.920> he's<00:03:36.459> not<00:03:36.850> he's

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
see I'm shooting him and he's not he's

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.020 
see I'm shooting him and he's not he's
not<00:03:37.630> frozen<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:39.310> can't<00:03:39.489> actually<00:03:39.700> hear

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
not frozen and you can't actually hear

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.490 
not frozen and you can't actually hear
it<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:41.670> if<00:03:42.670> you<00:03:42.820> shoe<00:03:43.030> him<00:03:43.239> when<00:03:43.420> he<00:03:43.480> chosen<00:03:43.959> it

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
it but if you shoe him when he chosen it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.020 
it but if you shoe him when he chosen it
just<00:03:44.709> sounds<00:03:44.950> like<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.100> bullets<00:03:45.519> bouncing

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
just sounds like the bullets bouncing

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.479 
just sounds like the bullets bouncing
off<00:03:46.150> then<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.690> mean<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.290> are<00:03:47.470> hearing<00:03:47.739> him<00:03:48.070> but

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
off then I mean you are hearing him but

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.280 
off then I mean you are hearing him but
not<00:03:48.670> much<00:03:48.970> as<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.209> count<00:03:49.360> monies<00:03:49.720> throw<00:03:50.410> them

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
not much as you count monies throw them

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.680 
not much as you count monies throw them
so<00:03:53.290> this<00:03:53.800> is<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.160> last<00:03:54.340> area<00:03:54.850> how<00:03:55.090> run<00:03:55.269> into

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
so this is the last area how run into

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.259 
so this is the last area how run into
and<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.980> did<00:03:57.160> have<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.459> do<00:03:57.580> quite<00:03:57.760> a<00:03:57.880> fucked

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
and that did have to do quite a fucked

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.870 
and that did have to do quite a fucked
up<00:03:58.480> in<00:03:58.630> sequence<00:03:59.140> left<00:03:59.459> got<00:04:00.459> myself<00:04:00.640> from

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
up in sequence left got myself from

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.550 
up in sequence left got myself from
getting<00:04:01.030> here<00:04:01.300> but<00:04:01.870> yeah<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:02.230> see<00:04:02.530> that

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
getting here but yeah you see that

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.050 
getting here but yeah you see that
elevator<00:04:03.160> right<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.610> she<00:04:03.880> different

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
elevator right there she different

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.360 
elevator right there she different
around<00:04:04.390> long<00:04:04.600> enough<00:04:04.630> they<00:04:04.959> eventually<00:04:05.370> comes

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
around long enough they eventually comes

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.800 
around long enough they eventually comes
all<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.640> way<00:04:06.670> open<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.150> could<00:04:07.269> issues<00:04:07.570> that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
all the way open you could issues that

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.890 
all the way open you could issues that
and<00:04:08.050> skip<00:04:08.440> this<00:04:08.709> fight<00:04:09.040> but<00:04:09.790> here's<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.720> last

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
and skip this fight but here's the last

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.470 
and skip this fight but here's the last
hand<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:11.350> think<00:04:11.470> there<00:04:11.650> might<00:04:11.769> be<00:04:11.830> one<00:04:12.340> more<00:04:12.480> die

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
hand I think there might be one more die

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.370 
hand I think there might be one more die
it's<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.930> last<00:04:14.110> one

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
it's the last one
