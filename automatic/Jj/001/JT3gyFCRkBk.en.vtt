voyager brainstorm now I didn't have any
problems<00:00:09.870> it<00:00:10.019> must<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.380> other<00:00:10.410> people<00:00:10.559> did

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
problems it must the other people did

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.680 
problems it must the other people did
this<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.280> one<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.610> ones<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.000> i<00:00:12.150> found<00:00:12.570> out

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
this is one of the ones that i found out

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.780 
this is one of the ones that i found out
in<00:00:12.840> retail<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.009> is<00:00:14.130> probably<00:00:14.309> more<00:00:14.639> than

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
in retail so this is probably more than

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.890 
in retail so this is probably more than
likely<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.240> version<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.540> you're<00:00:15.750> going<00:00:15.839> to

get where it doesn't have tons of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.550 
get where it doesn't have tons of
problems<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.330> only<00:00:18.510> has<00:00:18.720> maybe<00:00:18.960> like<00:00:19.170> one
