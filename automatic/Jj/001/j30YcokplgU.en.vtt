00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.730

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.730
 This is a professional paint from 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.770
 refectocil I've heard already they are very 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 a lot and the reviews are all positive 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.119
 I think you heard a lot or maybe 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.090
 even enjoyed buying it in the fall 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.099
 2014 and therefore during that time managed 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.320
 thoroughly test me of course 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.820
 a certain impression 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.950
 which I want to share today with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.079
 you just want to do a little test 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.309
 drive in which show you real 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.260
 actions of this paint 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.090
 if this video is interesting then of course 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 stay with me and everything 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.410
 pleasant viewing of the company refectocil 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.910
 engaged in the production of cosmetics for 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.379
 eyebrows and eyelashes and this 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.079
 professional tools that 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 use many makeup artists salons either 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.920
 same just in their schools when 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.500
 evaluated by eyebrow dyeing and only 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.420
 customer eyelashes so I was 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.609
 one hundred percent confident in this makeup and 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 I really wanted her to try it 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
 for myself, I acquired the color and checked 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.820
 oxidizer let's get a couple of words first 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.070
 my ruler is a liquid developer 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 three percent they have more cream 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.659
 developer why it costs more there though 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.729
 the seller assured that the difference in quality 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.500
 between them is absolutely not I acquired 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.780
 the cheaper option is liquid 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.850
 oxidative percentages I have 50 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.680
 milliliters jars that pretty 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.220
 I think a lot because he spends 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.770
 literally 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.110
 but a couple of drops for one staining 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.689
 as for paint the paint looks like this 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 in this way I have a shade of 3 3 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.350
 natural brown is one of the darkest 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.990
 shades in the line 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.759
 the paint itself in such a package 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 there is packaging tightly curled and you 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.180
 you can use it pretty 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.790
 a long time until it comes out on time 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.979
 shelf life is 15 milliliters of packaging 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.829
 during use that is from October 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.020
 months of 2012 to today i 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.890
 used quite a bit despite the fact that 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.540
 I painted how I did it myself 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.670
 staining to other people 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
 so even if it is spent very 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.570
 sparingly paint me really 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.910
 I liked it because the result of this 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.220
 paint keeps 2 weeks this i say 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.050
 accurately used tested on si 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.810
 now you will see the result at all 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 eyebrow dyeing is paint 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.010
 use to this paint is very easy in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.760
 principle, no difficulties she does not 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.100
 causes 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.650
 complete with paint was a stick for 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.310
 paint mixing but i'm successful already 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.590
 sowed 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.750
 so I usually use a cotton swab 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.610
 besides on along with the paint was 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.350
 detailed instructions in which you can 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.630

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.380
 the colors are described in addition 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.920
 what to suit 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.110
 Here, for example, I have 3 natural 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.240
 brown there is still graphite dark 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.890
 black navy chestnut red 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.810
 purple that is suitable here 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.150
 completely different shades that you can 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.140
 use for staining like eyebrows 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.300
 so and eyelashes 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.040

 time they are brighter more well-groomed 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.670
