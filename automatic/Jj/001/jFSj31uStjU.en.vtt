about that if you're playing with no
power<00:01:29.580> it<00:01:29.970> does<00:01:30.360> cost<00:01:30.630> quite<00:01:31.080> a<00:01:31.110> bit<00:01:31.380> also<00:01:31.800> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
power it does cost quite a bit also to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.190 
power it does cost quite a bit also to
get<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> power<00:01:32.910> location<00:01:33.480> because<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.050> is

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
get to the power location because it is

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.890 
get to the power location because it is
on<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:34.770> side<00:01:35.190> but<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.850> are<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.390> lot

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
on the other side but there are a lot

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.560 
on the other side but there are a lot
more<00:01:36.930> worse<00:01:38.000> locations<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.330> power

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
more worse locations for the power

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.630 
more worse locations for the power
switches<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.350> other<00:01:40.740> map<00:01:41.010> so<00:01:41.250> anyways

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
switches on the other map so anyways

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.430 
switches on the other map so anyways
guys<00:01:41.790> let's<00:01:42.120> get<00:01:42.300> straight<00:01:42.660> on<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.050> the<00:01:43.170> number

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
didn't really like this sort of

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.559 
didn't really like this sort of
afterlife<00:02:59.250> thing<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.849> also<00:03:00.209> how<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
afterlife was a quicker vibe especially

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.490 
afterlife was a quicker vibe especially
if<00:03:03.060> you're<00:03:03.209> playing<00:03:03.420> with<00:03:03.569> other<00:03:03.629> people<00:03:04.349> you

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:33.890 
scattered around the map and to turn on
the<00:03:33.090> pack-a-punch

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
the pack-a-punch

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.750 
the pack-a-punch
or<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.169> get<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.650> pack<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.859> bunch<00:03:35.099> working<00:03:35.639> you

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
or to get the pack a bunch working you

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.509 
or to get the pack a bunch working you
have<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.090> turn<00:03:36.299> on<00:03:36.540> all<00:03:36.810> six<00:03:37.380> and<00:03:37.680> what's<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
have to turn on all six and what's the

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.490 
have to turn on all six and what's the
problem<00:03:38.790> with<00:03:38.970> this<00:03:39.269> is<00:03:39.540> that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:39.870> have<00:03:40.169> to

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
problem with this is that you have to

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.039 
problem with this is that you have to
actually<00:03:40.680> pay<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.340> turn<00:03:41.940> them<00:03:42.120> on<00:03:42.329> as<00:03:42.750> well

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
actually pay to turn them on as well

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.530 
actually pay to turn them on as well
there's<00:03:43.829> zombies<00:03:44.099> that<00:03:44.489> spawn<00:03:44.910> when<00:03:45.180> you<00:03:45.269> turn

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
there's zombies that spawn when you turn

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.330 
there's zombies that spawn when you turn
them<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.139> gets<00:03:46.349> very<00:03:46.410> challenging<00:03:47.280> very

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
them on it gets very challenging very

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.690 
them on it gets very challenging very
hectic<00:03:47.849> I<00:03:48.299> do<00:03:48.630> love<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.349> new<00:03:49.560> innovative<00:03:50.069> idea

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
hectic I do love the new innovative idea

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.699 
hectic I do love the new innovative idea
but<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> just<00:03:51.269> think<00:03:51.480> it<00:03:51.660> was<00:03:51.780> too<00:03:52.169> much<00:03:52.200> and

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
but I just think it was too much and

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.220 
but I just think it was too much and
also<00:03:53.190> every<00:03:53.669> couple<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.180> rounds<00:03:54.630> or<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:54.959> those

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
also every couple of rounds or so those

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.409 
also every couple of rounds or so those
zombies<00:03:55.799> will<00:03:56.250> come<00:03:56.519> back<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.120> they<00:03:57.239> will

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
zombies will come back and they will

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.330 
zombies will come back and they will
take<00:03:57.660> over<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.139> generator<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.919> turn<00:03:59.160> them

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
take over the generator and turn them

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.430 
take over the generator and turn them
off<00:03:59.549> which<00:03:59.819> will<00:04:00.030> disable<00:04:00.419> the<00:04:00.630> pack-a-punch

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
off which will disable the pack-a-punch

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.890 
off which will disable the pack-a-punch
if<00:04:01.560> you<00:04:01.680> have<00:04:01.799> all<00:04:02.040> six<00:04:02.370> generators<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.209> so

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
if you have all six generators on so

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.900 
if you have all six generators on so
that<00:04:04.049> is<00:04:04.169> why<00:04:04.319> I<00:04:04.349> don't<00:04:04.620> think<00:04:05.129> the<00:04:05.400> origins

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
that is why I don't think the origins

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.250 
that is why I don't think the origins
power<00:04:06.239> thing<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
power thing is the

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.470 
power thing is the
greatest<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:07.980> my<00:04:08.099> number<00:04:08.459> one<00:04:08.640> spot<00:04:08.939> guys<00:04:09.209> who

spot is right now I absolutely hate this
map<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.870> if<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.049> guys<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.380> seen<00:04:19.530> my<00:04:19.650> other

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
map and if you guys have seen my other

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.979 
map and if you guys have seen my other
videos<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:20.430> will<00:04:20.549> know<00:04:20.609> exactly<00:04:21.329> what<00:04:21.600> map<00:04:21.810> I

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
videos you will know exactly what map I

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.510 
videos you will know exactly what map I
am<00:04:22.079> already<00:04:22.350> talking<00:04:22.800> about<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.190> anyways

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
am already talking about but anyways

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.390 
am already talking about but anyways
let's<00:04:23.729> go<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.270> the<00:04:24.539> honorable<00:04:25.229> mentions<00:04:25.530> so

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
let's go on to the honorable mentions so

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.430 
let's go on to the honorable mentions so
for<00:04:26.580> our<00:04:26.699> first<00:04:26.940> honorable<00:04:27.660> mention<00:04:28.110> this<00:04:28.260> is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
for our first honorable mention this is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.920 
for our first honorable mention this is
actually<00:04:28.860> going<00:04:29.039> to<00:04:29.220> be<00:04:29.370> shangri-la<00:04:30.180> now<00:04:30.750> with

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
actually going to be shangri-la now with

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.810 
actually going to be shangri-la now with
shangri-la<00:04:31.500> it's<00:04:31.800> not<00:04:32.100> that<00:04:32.430> challenging

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
shangri-la it's not that challenging

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.180 
shangri-la it's not that challenging
again<00:04:33.479> it<00:04:33.780> is<00:04:34.050> on<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.380> complete<00:04:34.680> opposite

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
again it is on the complete opposite

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.180 
again it is on the complete opposite
side<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:36.300> map<00:04:36.539> with<00:04:36.840> shangri-la<00:04:37.410> but<00:04:37.949> also

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
side of the map with shangri-la but also

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.129 
side of the map with shangri-la but also
there<00:04:38.580> are<00:04:38.610> two<00:04:39.090> power<00:04:39.389> switches<00:04:39.930> which

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
there are two power switches which

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.570 
there are two power switches which
doesn't<00:04:40.500> really<00:04:40.590> make<00:04:40.680> a<00:04:40.800> difference<00:04:41.460> like

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
doesn't really make a difference like

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.550 
doesn't really make a difference like
it's<00:04:41.940> they're<00:04:42.360> very<00:04:42.600> close<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.199> each<00:04:43.229> other

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
it's they're very close to each other

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.620 
it's they're very close to each other
there's<00:04:44.010> just<00:04:44.310> two<00:04:44.669> I<00:04:44.699> don't<00:04:45.090> know<00:04:45.210> why<00:04:45.419> they

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
there's just two I don't know why they

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.750 
there's just two I don't know why they
decided<00:04:45.810> to<00:04:46.260> add<00:04:46.380> two<00:04:46.740> there's<00:04:47.039> just<00:04:47.310> two<00:04:47.520> for

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
decided to add two there's just two for

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.120 
decided to add two there's just two for
some<00:04:47.970> sort<00:04:48.330> of<00:04:48.419> reason<00:04:48.930> except<00:04:49.590> the<00:04:49.710> problem

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
some sort of reason except the problem

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.040 
some sort of reason except the problem
with<00:04:50.280> shangri-la<00:04:50.820> it's<00:04:51.060> just<00:04:51.270> a<00:04:51.419> very<00:04:51.720> hard

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
with shangri-la it's just a very hard

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.740 
with shangri-la it's just a very hard
map<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.800> get<00:04:53.010> around<00:04:53.490> with<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.060> that<00:04:54.419> is<00:04:54.539> just

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
map to get around with and that is just

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.659 
map to get around with and that is just
I<00:04:54.870> essentially<00:04:55.229> just<00:04:55.380> don't<00:04:55.949> like<00:04:56.220> shangri-la

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
I essentially just don't like shangri-la

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.790 
I essentially just don't like shangri-la
power<00:04:57.150> location<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:58.050> just<00:04:58.500> don't<00:04:58.650> like

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
power location I just don't like

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.400 
power location I just don't like
shangri-la<00:04:59.280> at<00:04:59.669> all<00:04:59.910> but<00:05:00.419> anyways<00:05:00.780> guys<00:05:00.840> going

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
shangri-la at all but anyways guys going

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.500 
shangri-la at all but anyways guys going
down<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.830> our<00:05:01.860> second<00:05:02.699> honorable<00:05:03.150> mention

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
down to our second honorable mention

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.879 
down to our second honorable mention
this<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:03.780> actually<00:05:04.080> going<00:05:04.229> to<00:05:04.380> be<00:05:04.500> five

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
this is actually going to be five

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.400 
this is actually going to be five
because<00:05:05.490> with<00:05:05.760> five<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.389> have<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.720> buy<00:05:06.870> almost

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
because with five you have to buy almost

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.550 
because with five you have to buy almost
every<00:05:07.889> single<00:05:08.460> door<00:05:08.789> on<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.600> map<00:05:09.810> five<00:05:10.169> to

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
every single door on the map five to

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.100 
every single door on the map five to
actually<00:05:11.039> get<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.669> power<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.330> also<00:05:12.840> when

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
actually get to the power and also when

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.170 
actually get to the power and also when
you<00:05:13.229> turn<00:05:13.470> on<00:05:13.710> the<00:05:13.770> power<00:05:13.919> it<00:05:14.430> is<00:05:14.460> very<00:05:14.849> very

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
you turn on the power it is very very

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.650 
you turn on the power it is very very
scary<00:05:15.660> it's<00:05:15.900> an<00:05:16.080> evasive<00:05:16.410> cluded<00:05:17.360> little<00:05:18.360> room

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
scary it's an evasive cluded little room

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.960 
scary it's an evasive cluded little room
in<00:05:18.960> five<00:05:19.289> is<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.830> very<00:05:20.039> basement<00:05:20.669> of<00:05:20.820> the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
in five is in the very basement of the

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:22.460 
in five is in the very basement of the
map<00:05:21.210> and<00:05:21.419> then<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:21.990> got<00:05:22.139> all<00:05:22.320> these

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
map and then you got all these

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.500 
map and then you got all these
teleporters<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.310> which<00:05:23.789> basically<00:05:24.150> means

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
teleporters and which basically means

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.570 
teleporters and which basically means
that<00:05:24.720> zombies<00:05:25.229> can<00:05:25.440> come<00:05:25.650> from<00:05:25.830> any<00:05:26.130> corner

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
that zombies can come from any corner

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.000 
that zombies can come from any corner
it's<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.210> very<00:05:27.479> very<00:05:27.720> hard<00:05:28.050> part<00:05:28.349> of<00:05:28.560> the<00:05:28.770> map

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
it's a very very hard part of the map

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.830 
it's a very very hard part of the map
but<00:05:29.190> I<00:05:29.250> don't<00:05:29.580> think<00:05:29.910> it<00:05:30.090> would<00:05:30.240> have<00:05:30.330> made<00:05:30.660> it

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
but I don't think it would have made it

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.100 
but I don't think it would have made it
onto<00:05:31.080> the<00:05:31.320> list<00:05:31.650> so<00:05:31.919> guys<00:05:32.160> now<00:05:32.479> going<00:05:33.479> on<00:05:33.660> to

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
onto the list so guys now going on to

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.620 
onto the list so guys now going on to
the<00:05:34.349> number<00:05:34.919> one<00:05:35.130> spot<00:05:35.550> and<00:05:35.789> I<00:05:35.940> bet<00:05:36.150> most<00:05:36.419> of

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
the number one spot and I bet most of

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.330 
the number one spot and I bet most of
you<00:05:36.780> guys<00:05:36.870> already<00:05:36.930> know<00:05:37.680> what<00:05:37.949> this<00:05:38.130> one<00:05:38.310> is

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
you guys already know what this one is

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.300 
you guys already know what this one is
this<00:05:39.090> has<00:05:39.360> got<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:39.870> be<00:05:39.900> transit<00:05:40.800> now<00:05:40.979> with

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
this has got to be transit now with

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.300 
this has got to be transit now with
transit<00:05:42.030> number<00:05:42.330> one<00:05:42.599> the<00:05:42.840> power<00:05:43.169> switch<00:05:43.590> will

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
transit number one the power switch will

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.730 
transit number one the power switch will
not<00:05:44.550> actually<00:05:44.880> turn<00:05:45.539> on<00:05:45.570> everything<00:05:46.500> in<00:05:46.710> the

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 
not actually turn on everything in the

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.100 
not actually turn on everything in the
map<00:05:47.130> which<00:05:47.520> is<00:05:47.550> the<00:05:48.000> stupidest<00:05:48.660> thing<00:05:48.750> ever

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
map which is the stupidest thing ever

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.500 
map which is the stupidest thing ever
you<00:05:49.650> have<00:05:49.889> to<00:05:50.039> build<00:05:50.430> the<00:05:50.639> power<00:05:50.880> switch<00:05:51.180> as

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
you have to build the power switch as

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.870 
you have to build the power switch as
well<00:05:51.900> and<00:05:52.169> then<00:05:52.560> they<00:05:52.710> added<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.250> turbine

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
well and then they added the turbine

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.879 
well and then they added the turbine
which<00:05:54.210> the<00:05:54.419> turbine<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:54.840> have<00:05:55.139> to<00:05:55.289> build<00:05:55.590> and

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
which the turbine you have to build and

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.969 
which the turbine you have to build and
it's<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:56.130> portable<00:05:57.000> power<00:05:57.810> source<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.530> isn't

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
it's a portable power source that isn't

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.339 
it's a portable power source that isn't
unlimited<00:05:59.490> you<00:05:59.970> have<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.389> actually<00:06:00.900> bring<00:06:01.169> it

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
unlimited you have to actually bring it

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.529 
unlimited you have to actually bring it
around<00:06:01.530> with<00:06:02.039> you<00:06:02.220> it's<00:06:02.430> just<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.760> very<00:06:03.120> stupid

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
around with you it's just a very stupid

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.360 
around with you it's just a very stupid
idea<00:06:03.720> and<00:06:04.199> once<00:06:04.409> it<00:06:04.560> breaks<00:06:04.770> you<00:06:05.039> have<00:06:05.190> to<00:06:05.280> go

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
idea and once it breaks you have to go

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.270 
idea and once it breaks you have to go
all<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.699> way<00:06:05.849> back<00:06:06.120> to<00:06:06.330> the<00:06:06.449> beginning<00:06:06.780> and

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
all the way back to the beginning and

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.070 
all the way back to the beginning and
it<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:07.820> also<00:06:08.150> with<00:06:08.330> the<00:06:08.450> power<00:06:08.750> switch

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.080

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.340 
it and also with the power switch
location<00:06:09.950> on<00:06:10.160> transit<00:06:10.790> it's<00:06:10.970> literally<00:06:11.660> you

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350 
location on transit it's literally you

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.650 
location on transit it's literally you
have<00:06:12.560> to<00:06:12.740> go<00:06:12.950> on<00:06:13.160> the<00:06:13.340> bus<00:06:13.550> for<00:06:13.880> such<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.389> long

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
have to go on the bus for such a long

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.010 
have to go on the bus for such a long
time<00:06:14.690> it's<00:06:15.440> literally<00:06:15.860> going<00:06:16.400> a<00:06:17.020> 360-degree

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
time it's literally going a 360-degree

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.260 
time it's literally going a 360-degree
circle<00:06:18.350> around<00:06:18.740> transit<00:06:19.580> to<00:06:19.760> get<00:06:20.000> to<00:06:20.150> the

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.270 
circle around transit to get to the

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.570 
circle around transit to get to the
power<00:06:20.450> switch<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:21.350> transit<00:06:21.980> power<00:06:22.160> switch

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:22.580 
power switch the transit power switch

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.820 
power switch the transit power switch
and<00:06:22.790> the<00:06:22.850> transit<00:06:23.450> power<00:06:23.660> in<00:06:23.990> general<00:06:24.230> is<00:06:24.590> just

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
and the transit power in general is just

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.920 
and the transit power in general is just
so<00:06:25.160> stupid<00:06:25.639> because<00:06:26.270> the<00:06:26.510> power<00:06:26.750> switch

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
so stupid because the power switch

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.650 
so stupid because the power switch
itself<00:06:27.560> you<00:06:28.070> can<00:06:28.220> even<00:06:28.430> turn<00:06:28.820> it<00:06:29.030> off<00:06:29.270> as<00:06:29.600> well

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:29.660 
itself you can even turn it off as well

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.750 
itself you can even turn it off as well
and<00:06:30.350> you<00:06:30.410> have<00:06:30.590> to<00:06:30.710> do<00:06:30.830> that<00:06:30.950> for<00:06:31.190> parts<00:06:31.490> of<00:06:31.639> the

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
and you have to do that for parts of the

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.600 
and you have to do that for parts of the
Easter<00:06:32.240> eggs<00:06:32.270> it's<00:06:32.900> just<00:06:33.139> a<00:06:33.260> very<00:06:33.620> bad<00:06:33.950> map<00:06:34.340> for

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
Easter eggs it's just a very bad map for

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.240 
Easter eggs it's just a very bad map for
power<00:06:34.910> distribution<00:06:35.600> in<00:06:36.290> the<00:06:36.440> map<00:06:36.650> and<00:06:36.950> I<00:06:36.980> just

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
power distribution in the map and I just

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.790 
power distribution in the map and I just
do<00:06:37.460> not<00:06:37.490> like<00:06:38.000> it<00:06:38.240> at<00:06:38.419> all<00:06:38.630> but<00:06:39.260> anyways<00:06:39.620> guys

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:39.800 
do not like it at all but anyways guys

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.890 
do not like it at all but anyways guys
that<00:06:40.220> is<00:06:40.400> going<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.760> be<00:06:40.850> it<00:06:41.060> for<00:06:41.090> the<00:06:41.390> top<00:06:41.630> 5
