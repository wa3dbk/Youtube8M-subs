00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
brought the big man on a front but we

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.390 
brought the big man on a front but we
showed<00:00:16.020> what<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.260> good<00:00:16.440> team<00:00:16.619> we<00:00:16.770> are<00:00:16.890> defending

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
showed what a good team we are defending

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.790 
showed what a good team we are defending
hard<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:17.910> break<00:00:18.060> down<00:00:18.270> as<00:00:18.480> well<00:00:18.650> Blackburn<00:00:19.650> had

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
hard to break down as well Blackburn had

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.260 
hard to break down as well Blackburn had
a<00:00:19.830> lot<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.010> possession<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> first<00:00:20.789> off<00:00:21.000> but<00:00:21.240> I

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
a lot of possession the first off but I

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000 
a lot of possession the first off but I
think<00:00:21.510> Blues<00:00:22.080> have<00:00:22.260> more<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> quality

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
think Blues have more of the quality

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.290 
think Blues have more of the quality
possession<00:00:23.490> looks<00:00:23.699> a<00:00:23.760> real<00:00:23.789> threat<00:00:24.119> going

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
possession looks a real threat going
