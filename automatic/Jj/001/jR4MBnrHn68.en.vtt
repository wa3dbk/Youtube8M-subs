00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.880
 heroes a new video today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.679
 theme my favorite source 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.480
 vegetable base 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.690
 There are more and more walking vegans 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.260
 we and myself would never be one 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.500
 become 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.480
 but I still do it a lot 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.880
 food made from vegetable 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.810
 Price range whether it is fat now 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.039
 are or whether it is delicious basil 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.890
 I am a goal and plant 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.070
 so on and firstly 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.800
 or peanuts, yes, simply 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.270
 my favorite source of herbal 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.850
 of course, there are fat too 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.280
 coconuts and so on avocados but 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 this here is simply find the taste 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.610
 me the absolute burner 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.030
 This result must be you get 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.660
 now 42 eur 90 or so im 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.070
 normal kaisers at dm and so there's 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.899
 that of all natures a bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:02.730
 cheaper for two euros and then you 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.199
 really peanuts in it and no 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.729
 other nonsense you can also you have to 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.880
 look again at some of 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.240
 Of the products you still have salt with 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.619
 in it 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.479
 that, of course, not so 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.280
 nice because you are actually in normal 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.439
 enough salt in it anyway 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.560
 have this in this example is 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.400
 I also see 0 75 percent more 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 salt in it 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.900
 now that will cope it is not so 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.119
 perfect but better than nothing and 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.869
 As I said, this peanut must be perfect 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.670
 applicable 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.090
 For example, I often take it easy 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.829
 in a low carb phase of training 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.790
 simply when I'm in between 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:41.070
 hunger has a slightly larger one 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.850
 teaspoon and in a big spoon 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.189
 of it and a really around it like 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:49.500
 such a sick child with cough syrup and it 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.540
 just perfect the hunger for 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.159
 In between tastes incredible 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.190
 delicious and you can even go 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.660
 still combine 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.510
 Other foods you have to 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.430
 For example, try a salad dressing 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.470
 simply normal salad dressing with vinegar 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.080
 oil and so on and then on 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.390
 a little bit of peanut has to be tasty 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.190
 so delicious I tell you yes or to 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.080

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.810

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.570

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.120
