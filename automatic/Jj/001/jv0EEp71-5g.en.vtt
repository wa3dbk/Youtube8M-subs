00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
ahead and try to push it all the air out

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.030 
ahead and try to push it all the air out
as<00:02:19.819> much<00:02:20.030> as<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.299> can<00:02:21.730> you<00:02:23.560> may<00:02:24.560> or<00:02:24.860> may<00:02:25.010> not

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
as much as you can you may or may not

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
have to put more or less water depending

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.410 
have to put more or less water depending
on<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.620> size<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:28.010> your<00:02:28.100> shoe<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.850> shoe

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.600 

I'm<00:02:34.420> just<00:02:34.810> using<00:02:35.050> this<00:02:35.349> much<00:02:35.590> water<00:02:35.890> I<00:02:36.220> didn't

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
I'm just using this much water I didn't

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.119 
I'm just using this much water I didn't
realize<00:02:36.910> how<00:02:37.269> much<00:02:37.510> water<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.930> need<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
realize how much water I need it so it

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:42.449 
realize how much water I need it so it
was<00:02:39.280> just<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.610> trial<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.360> error<00:02:40.629> just<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:42.190> see

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
was just a trial and error just to see

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.880 
was just a trial and error just to see
and<00:02:43.180> it's<00:02:43.420> pretty<00:02:43.599> easier<00:02:44.080> if<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.319> tip<00:02:44.590> it<00:02:44.709> up

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
and it's pretty easier if you tip it up

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.740 
and it's pretty easier if you tip it up
like<00:02:45.129> this<00:02:45.370> kind<00:02:45.640> of<00:02:45.700> like<00:02:45.879> a<00:02:45.910> cup<00:02:46.239> so<00:02:46.599> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
like this kind of like a cup so the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.710 
like this kind of like a cup so the
water<00:02:46.989> will<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.230> fall<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:48.120> there<00:02:49.120> and<00:02:49.420> form

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
water will just fall into there and form

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.089 
water will just fall into there and form
to<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.049> shoe

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.369

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
time it's just a freezing time that

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.900 
time it's just a freezing time that
takes<00:04:12.940> a<00:04:13.060> long<00:04:13.210> time<00:04:13.270> but<00:04:14.230> um<00:04:14.640> magazine<00:04:15.640> it<00:04:15.790> was
