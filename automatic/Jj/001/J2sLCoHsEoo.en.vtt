00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.530 

when<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:17.860> polish<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.250> about<00:01:18.460> 3/4<00:01:19.090> of<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.390> way

when the polish is about 3/4 of the way

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.570 
when the polish is about 3/4 of the way
broken<00:01:19.869> down<00:01:20.049> I<00:01:20.320> decrease<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.890> speed<00:01:21.100> to<00:01:21.310> five

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
broken down I decrease the speed to five

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.370 
broken down I decrease the speed to five
and<00:01:21.880> reduce<00:01:22.240> the<00:01:22.390> pressure<00:01:22.570> using<00:01:23.020> only<00:01:23.170> the

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
and reduce the pressure using only the

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.280 
and reduce the pressure using only the
weight<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.710> Machine<00:01:24.040> I<00:01:25.049> find<00:01:26.049> that<00:01:26.140> doing

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
weight of the Machine I find that doing

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.810 
weight of the Machine I find that doing
this<00:01:26.530> for<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.799> last<00:01:26.979> few<00:01:27.189> passes<00:01:27.580> helps

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
this for the last few passes helps

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.310 
this for the last few passes helps
reduce<00:01:28.119> the<00:01:28.270> amount<00:01:28.509> of<00:01:28.570> hazing<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:29.080> helps

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
reduce the amount of hazing it helps

00:01:29.320 --> 00:02:13.260 
reduce the amount of hazing it helps
bring<00:01:29.530> the<00:01:29.590> gloss<00:01:29.920> back<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:30.460> paint

now the polish is broken down remove the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.640 
now the polish is broken down remove the
