00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
say is it's pick again drop down so that

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.849 
say is it's pick again drop down so that
you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.939> handle<00:02:21.269> another<00:02:21.780> five<00:02:22.140> reps<00:02:22.439> and<00:02:22.590> get

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
you can handle another five reps and get

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.410 
you can handle another five reps and get
through<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.159> five<00:02:23.370> reps<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:24.030> shouldn't<00:02:24.359> be

going to failure on number four or
number<00:02:26.340> five<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.480> should<00:02:27.510> still<00:02:27.840> have<00:02:27.870> one<00:02:28.200> in

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.640 
can see I'm using the neutral grip bar
I'm<00:03:58.970> going<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.209> be<00:03:59.390> leaning<00:03:59.660> back<00:03:59.810> on<00:04:00.230> that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
I'm going to be leaning back on that

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.440 
I'm going to be leaning back on that
machine<00:04:00.860> slightly<00:04:01.670> so<00:04:01.820> I<00:04:01.880> can<00:04:02.030> get<00:04:02.150> as<00:04:02.239> much

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
machine slightly so I can get as much

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.570 
machine slightly so I can get as much
stretch<00:04:02.810> as<00:04:02.989> possible<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:03.830> I'm<00:04:04.400> going<00:04:04.520> to

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
stretch as possible and I'm going to

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.790 
stretch as possible and I'm going to
focus<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:05.090> a<00:04:05.150> two-second<00:04:06.110> hold<00:04:06.380> at<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.770> bottom

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
focus on a two-second hold at the bottom

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.830 
focus on a two-second hold at the bottom
so<00:04:07.640> as<00:04:07.670> you<00:04:08.030> can<00:04:08.150> see<00:04:08.270> in<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.450> video<00:04:08.570> I'm

blades pulling down and squeezing for

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.940 
blades pulling down and squeezing for
two<00:04:13.550> seconds<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.090> it's<00:04:14.330> down<00:04:14.570> one<00:04:15.440> two<00:04:15.739> and

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
two seconds so it's down one two and

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.150 
two seconds so it's down one two and
then<00:04:16.280> up<00:04:16.520> and<00:04:16.730> release<00:04:17.000> down<00:04:17.450> one<00:04:18.320> two<00:04:18.590> up<00:04:18.830> and

matter<00:04:37.610> of<00:04:37.790> fact<00:04:38.030> so<00:04:38.660> we're<00:04:39.410> going<00:04:39.500> to<00:04:39.560> go<00:04:39.710> to

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
matter of fact so we're going to go to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.250 
matter of fact so we're going to go to
just<00:04:40.250> eight<00:04:40.400> reps<00:04:40.790> on<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.210> first<00:04:41.510> one<00:04:41.780> so<00:04:42.110> what

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
just eight reps on the first one so what

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.960 
just eight reps on the first one so what
I<00:04:42.290> want<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.710> do<00:04:42.800> is<00:04:42.950> go<00:04:43.100> up<00:04:43.280> ten<00:04:43.520> to<00:04:43.700> twenty

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
I want you to do is go up ten to twenty

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.909 
I want you to do is go up ten to twenty
percent<00:04:44.330> on<00:04:44.419> your<00:04:44.540> weight<00:04:44.780> but<00:04:45.440> make<00:04:45.590> sure<00:04:45.620> you

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
percent on your weight but make sure you

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.770 
percent on your weight but make sure you
can<00:04:46.100> control<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.760> weight<00:04:47.090> again<00:04:47.480> with<00:04:47.660> the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780 
can control that weight again with the

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.840 
can control that weight again with the
same<00:04:48.050> form<00:04:48.650> that<00:04:48.860> you<00:04:48.980> had<00:04:49.160> before

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
same form that you had before

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.460 
same form that you had before
so<00:04:50.330> again<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.780> should<00:04:50.810> still<00:04:51.169> be<00:04:51.200> able<00:04:51.380> to

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
so again you should still be able to

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.880 
so again you should still be able to
hold<00:04:51.680> one<00:04:52.100> two<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:52.580> then<00:04:52.850> release<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.720> just

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
hold one two and then release and just

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.930 
hold one two and then release and just
like<00:04:54.890> you<00:04:55.010> did<00:04:55.160> before

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
like you did before

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.460 
like you did before
as<00:04:56.000> soon<00:04:56.270> as<00:04:56.420> you're<00:04:56.570> done<00:04:56.720> with<00:04:56.930> your<00:04:57.020> 8<00:04:57.200> reps

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
as soon as you're done with your 8 reps

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.770 
as soon as you're done with your 8 reps
you're<00:04:57.710> going<00:04:57.830> to<00:04:57.890> go<00:04:58.010> down<00:04:58.310> 10<00:04:59.240> to<00:04:59.390> 20<00:04:59.660> percent

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
you're going to go down 10 to 20 percent

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.540 
you're going to go down 10 to 20 percent
so<00:05:00.470> this<00:05:00.620> should<00:05:00.800> bring<00:05:00.890> you<00:05:01.070> back<00:05:01.250> down<00:05:01.280> to

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
so this should bring you back down to

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.240 
so this should bring you back down to
where<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.030> ended<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.480> third<00:05:02.810> set<00:05:03.260> and<00:05:03.440> you're

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
where you ended the third set and you're

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.360 
where you ended the third set and you're
still<00:05:04.520> focusing<00:05:05.120> on<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:05.710> two<00:05:06.710> second<00:05:07.220> pause

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
still focusing on that two second pause

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.230
