was essentially what you're saying is it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.149 
was essentially what you're saying is it
was<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.470> transfer<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.960> LAPD<00:01:58.740> has<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
was a transfer and the the LAPD has to

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.270 
was a transfer and the the LAPD has to
get<00:01:59.310> FAA<00:02:00.240> permission<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.380> operate<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:02.040> but

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
get FAA permission to operate these but

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.219 
get FAA permission to operate these but
tell<00:02:02.460> us<00:02:02.579> about<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.479> drones<00:02:03.750> what<00:02:04.020> are<00:02:04.110> they

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
tell us about the drones what are they

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.709 
tell us about the drones what are they
capable<00:02:04.500> of<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.189> what<00:02:05.250> does<00:02:05.460> LAPD<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
capable of and what does LAPD want to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.800 
capable of and what does LAPD want to
use<00:02:06.869> them<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.970> so<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.390> mentioned<00:02:09.750> these

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
use them for so as I mentioned these

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.200 
use them for so as I mentioned these
drones<00:02:10.200> are<00:02:10.410> about<00:02:10.590> 3.5<00:02:10.860> pounds<00:02:11.730> each

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
drones are about 3.5 pounds each

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.120 
drones are about 3.5 pounds each
are<00:02:12.270> very<00:02:12.510> small<00:02:12.840> they<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.320> a<00:02:13.590> camera<00:02:13.950> on

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
are very small they have a camera on

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.950 
are very small they have a camera on
board<00:02:14.280> that's<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.790> still<00:02:15.060> camera<00:02:15.270> also<00:02:15.720> a

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
board that's a still camera also a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.690 
board that's a still camera also a
camera<00:02:16.350> on<00:02:16.470> board<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.800> is<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.920> video<00:02:17.310> camera

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
camera on board that is a video camera

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.640 
camera on board that is a video camera
that<00:02:17.820> they<00:02:18.090> can<00:02:18.270> use<00:02:18.300> for<00:02:18.960> different<00:02:19.200> kind<00:02:19.530> of

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
that they can use for different kind of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.010 
that they can use for different kind of
search<00:02:19.890> missions<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.700> LAPD<00:02:21.150> says<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.720> if

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
search missions the LAPD says that if

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.780 
search missions the LAPD says that if
they<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.530> approved<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.040> be<00:02:23.190> able<00:02:23.430> to<00:02:23.550> use

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
they get approved to be able to use

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.610 
they get approved to be able to use
these<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.210> that's<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.390> big<00:02:24.630> if<00:02:24.840> at<00:02:25.320> this<00:02:25.500> point

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
these and that's a big if at this point

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.040 
these and that's a big if at this point
because<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.430> Los<00:02:26.610> Angeles<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.660> they<00:02:27.900> will

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
because it is Los Angeles that they will

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.400 
because it is Los Angeles that they will
use<00:02:28.290> them<00:02:28.590> for<00:02:29.550> SWAT<00:02:30.030> missions<00:02:30.480> dealing<00:02:31.170> with

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
use them for SWAT missions dealing with

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.860 
use them for SWAT missions dealing with
a<00:02:31.440> barricaded<00:02:32.220> suspect<00:02:32.520> or<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.090> hostage

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
a barricaded suspect or a hostage

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.040 
a barricaded suspect or a hostage
situation<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.640> all<00:02:35.820> days<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.360> drones

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
situation so the all days these drones

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.470 
situation so the all days these drones
also<00:02:37.290> have<00:02:37.470> thermal<00:02:37.790> camera<00:02:38.790> for<00:02:39.060> kind<00:02:39.420> of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
also have thermal camera for kind of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.960 
also have thermal camera for kind of
night<00:02:39.660> vision<00:02:39.690> but<00:02:40.560> right<00:02:40.860> now<00:02:41.010> i<00:02:41.040> mean<00:02:41.550> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
night vision but right now i mean the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
night vision but right now i mean the
battery<00:02:42.630> power<00:02:42.870> on<00:02:43.080> these<00:02:43.230> things<00:02:43.410> these<00:02:43.560> are

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
battery power on these things these are

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380 
battery power on these things these are
not<00:02:43.830> drones<00:02:44.520> that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.790> would<00:02:44.910> see<00:02:45.120> in<00:02:45.330> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
not drones that you would see in the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.720 
not drones that you would see in the
afghan<00:02:46.200> theater<00:02:46.590> for<00:02:46.830> instance<00:02:47.160> these<00:02:47.340> drones

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
afghan theater for instance these drones

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.900 
afghan theater for instance these drones
have<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> 20<00:02:48.720> minute<00:02:48.990> battery<00:02:49.410> power<00:02:49.680> life<00:02:50.460> span

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
have a 20 minute battery power life span

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.300 
have a 20 minute battery power life span
they<00:02:51.330> also<00:02:51.540> can<00:02:51.840> only<00:02:52.080> operate<00:02:52.350> within<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:53.010> very

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
they also can only operate within a very

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.010 
they also can only operate within a very
limited<00:02:53.700> range<00:02:54.150> meaning<00:02:54.540> they<00:02:54.690> have<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.930> be

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
limited range meaning they have to be

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.510 
limited range meaning they have to be
very<00:02:55.200> close<00:02:55.410> to<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.710> person<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.040> actually

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
very close to the person that's actually

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.870 
very close to the person that's actually
operating<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.600> drone<00:02:57.840> from<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.200> ground<00:02:58.500> and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
operating that drone from the ground and

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.760 
operating that drone from the ground and
right<00:02:59.880> now<00:03:00.030> like<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.540> said<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.870> FAA<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.500> isn't

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
right now like I said the FAA just isn't

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.250 
right now like I said the FAA just isn't
hasn't<00:03:02.220> given<00:03:02.340> any<00:03:02.670> type<00:03:02.880> of<00:03:02.910> approval<00:03:03.900> for

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
hasn't given any type of approval for

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.050 
hasn't given any type of approval for
flying<00:03:04.980> these<00:03:05.250> machines<00:03:05.580> no<00:03:05.730> matter<00:03:05.850> how

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
flying these machines no matter how

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.580 
flying these machines no matter how
small<00:03:06.390> they<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.660> but<00:03:06.990> again<00:03:07.200> they<00:03:07.320> won't<00:03:07.500> be

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
small they are but again they won't be

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.350 
small they are but again they won't be
equipped<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:07.950> any<00:03:08.130> type<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.550> weapon<00:03:08.970> or

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
equipped with any type of a weapon or

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.630 
equipped with any type of a weapon or
air<00:03:09.540> anything<00:03:09.900> like<00:03:10.050> that<00:03:10.160> okay<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.220> they're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
air anything like that okay so they're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.580 
air anything like that okay so they're
essentially<00:03:12.210> just<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.480> little<00:03:12.690> nice<00:03:13.560> little

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
essentially just a little nice little

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.920 
essentially just a little nice little
remote<00:03:14.040> control<00:03:14.460> with<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.790> camera<00:03:15.210> but<00:03:15.690> what

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
remote control with the camera but what

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.200 
remote control with the camera but what
do<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.380> privacy<00:03:16.860> groups<00:03:17.010> in<00:03:17.250> LA<00:03:17.580> have<00:03:17.850> to<00:03:18.030> say

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.210 
do the privacy groups in LA have to say

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.550 
do the privacy groups in LA have to say
about<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.630> because<00:03:18.840> there<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.200> some

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
about that because there is some

possibility for surveillance is one

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.210 
possibility for surveillance is one
really<00:03:56.970> major<00:03:57.270> example<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.080> also<00:03:58.650> as<00:03:58.920> one<00:03:59.190> of

really major example and also as one of

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.040 
really major example and also as one of

talking about the possibility of adding

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.390 
talking about the possibility of adding
something<00:04:03.240> as<00:04:03.810> simple<00:04:04.170> as<00:04:04.560> facial

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
something as simple as facial

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.940 
something as simple as facial
recognition<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:06.090> how<00:04:06.210> that<00:04:06.270> could<00:04:06.570> really

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
recognition and how that could really

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.470 
recognition and how that could really
revolutionize<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.220> landscape<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:08.940> terms<00:04:09.240> of

off so they plan to use it for all of
those<00:05:18.540> this<00:05:19.200> one<00:05:19.500> is<00:05:19.800> much<00:05:20.160> closer<00:05:20.520> to

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
those this one is much closer to

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.420 
those this one is much closer to
becoming<00:05:20.940> a<00:05:21.270> reality<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:22.020> ventura<00:05:22.890> than<00:05:23.130> and
