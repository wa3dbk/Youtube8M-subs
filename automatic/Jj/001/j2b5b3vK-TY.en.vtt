00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
to my battlefield 3 benchmarking guide

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.490 
to my battlefield 3 benchmarking guide
where<00:00:07.680> it<00:00:07.799> will<00:00:07.919> be<00:00:08.040> hosted<00:00:08.429> by<00:00:08.690> not<00:00:09.690> me<00:00:09.840> slick

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
where it will be hosted by not me slick

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.499 
where it will be hosted by not me slick
hosts<00:00:10.889> these<00:00:11.099> so<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> guys<00:00:11.670> will<00:00:11.969> be<00:00:12.179> going

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
hosts these so you guys will be going

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
hosts these so you guys will be going
along<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:13.080> him<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:13.679> run<00:00:13.889> through

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
along with him on a little run through

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.550 
along with him on a little run through
so<00:00:14.460> we're<00:00:15.179> not<00:00:15.360> doing<00:00:15.630> any<00:00:15.900> performance

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
so we're not doing any performance

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.140 
so we're not doing any performance
results<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.100> this<00:00:17.250> one<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> rig<00:00:17.910> he's

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
results in this one so the rig he's

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.029 
results in this one so the rig he's
using<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.750> his<00:00:19.080> personal<00:00:19.529> rig<00:00:19.710> which<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
using is his personal rig which is a

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.000 
using is his personal rig which is a
2600<00:00:20.850> k<00:00:21.029> and<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.270> 660<00:00:21.810> ti<00:00:22.020> actually<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:22.920> not

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
2600 k and a 660 ti actually it's not

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.710 
2600 k and a 660 ti actually it's not
this<00:00:23.189> 660<00:00:23.760> ti<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.150> some<00:00:24.300> completely

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
this 660 ti it's some completely

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.670 
this 660 ti it's some completely
different<00:00:25.019> one<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.230> don't<00:00:25.380> worry<00:00:25.470> too<00:00:25.650> much

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
different one so don't worry too much

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.830 
different one so don't worry too much
about<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.730> whatever<00:00:27.060> frame<00:00:27.480> rates<00:00:27.689> you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
about that but whatever frame rates you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.380 
about that but whatever frame rates you
guys<00:00:28.019> see<00:00:28.320> those<00:00:28.619> are<00:00:28.890> on<00:00:29.490> random<00:00:30.000> settings

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
guys see those are on random settings

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.450 
guys see those are on random settings
we're<00:00:30.599> not<00:00:30.750> really<00:00:31.130> standardizing<00:00:32.130> anything

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
we're not really standardizing anything

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.590 
we're not really standardizing anything
so<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.700> worry<00:00:32.850> too<00:00:33.030> much<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.510> but

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
so don't worry too much about it but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.660 
so don't worry too much about it but
he's<00:00:33.750> also<00:00:33.899> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.200> explain<00:00:34.680> what<00:00:35.010> happened

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
he's also going to explain what happened

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.490 
he's also going to explain what happened
with<00:00:35.850> some<00:00:36.030> frame<00:00:36.300> rate<00:00:36.480> dips<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.899> occur<00:00:37.230> due

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
with some frame rate dips that occur due

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.290 
with some frame rate dips that occur due
to<00:00:37.530> save<00:00:38.070> games<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.730> what<00:00:38.910> we're<00:00:39.030> showing<00:00:39.149> you

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
to save games so what we're showing you

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.000 
to save games so what we're showing you
guys<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.050> two-minute<00:00:40.559> run<00:00:40.739> through<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
guys is the two-minute run through that

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.090 
guys is the two-minute run through that
we<00:00:41.219> use<00:00:41.489> at<00:00:41.850> various<00:00:42.540> settings<00:00:42.899> usually<00:00:43.829> on<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we use at various settings usually on I

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.549 
we use at various settings usually on I
believe<00:00:44.789> its<00:00:45.120> extreme<00:00:45.600> preset<00:00:46.110> or<00:00:46.230> ultra

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
believe its extreme preset or ultra

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.200 
believe its extreme preset or ultra
preset<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.100> whatever<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.520> very<00:00:47.670> highest<00:00:47.910> one

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
preset or whatever the very highest one

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
preset or whatever the very highest one
is<00:00:48.329> because<00:00:48.480> battlefield<00:00:49.050> runs<00:00:49.320> pretty<00:00:49.920> darn

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
is because battlefield runs pretty darn

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.970 
is because battlefield runs pretty darn
well<00:00:50.309> its<00:00:50.610> ultra<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.590> two<00:00:52.800> minute

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
well its ultra and so it's a two minute

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.279 
well its ultra and so it's a two minute
run<00:00:53.250> through<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> conrads<00:00:54.329> level<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
run through the conrads level in a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.319 
run through the conrads level in a
specific<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.100> you'll<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> tips

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
specific way so you'll get all the tips

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.060 
specific way so you'll get all the tips
you<00:00:57.480> need<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:58.140> how<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> run<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> benchmark

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you need for how to run the benchmark

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
you need for how to run the benchmark
exactly<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.670> way<00:00:59.760> we<00:00:59.789> do<00:01:00.180> so<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> can<00:01:00.899> easily

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
exactly the way we do so you can easily

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560 
exactly the way we do so you can easily
compare<00:01:01.829> against<00:01:02.640> all<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.879> graphics<00:01:03.090> cards

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
compare against all the graphics cards

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.780 
compare against all the graphics cards
that<00:01:03.780> we're<00:01:03.960> testing<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.650> well<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.280> comparing

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
that we're testing as well as comparing

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
that we're testing as well as comparing
your<00:01:05.939> rig<00:01:06.240> against<00:01:07.080> what<00:01:07.409> we've<00:01:07.590> got<00:01:07.830> over

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
your rig against what we've got over

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.460 
your rig against what we've got over
here<00:01:08.360> alright<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.570> after<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.290> long

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
here alright so after that really long

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.899 
here alright so after that really long
cinematic<00:01:11.100> what<00:01:11.280> we're<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.880> just

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
cinematic what we're going to do is just

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.820 
cinematic what we're going to do is just
run<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.750> way<00:01:12.930> point<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.650> cut

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
run up to this way point here and cut

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.219 
run up to this way point here and cut
the<00:01:13.950> wires<00:01:14.159> inside<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.670> room<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the wires inside the room you want to

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.570 
the wires inside the room you want to
just<00:01:16.259> start<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.650> benchmark<00:01:17.100> right<00:01:17.340> when<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
just start the benchmark right when you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.060 
just start the benchmark right when you
start<00:01:17.850> running<00:01:18.350> so<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.619> second<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.009> start

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
start running so the second you start

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.350 
start running so the second you start
running<00:01:20.310> away<00:01:20.580> from<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.850> cars<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
running away from the cars when you

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
running away from the cars when you
start<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> benchmark<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.979> cut<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.159> wires

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
start the benchmark just cut the wires

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.649 
start the benchmark just cut the wires
right<00:01:23.670> here<00:01:23.729> you'll<00:01:24.030> notice<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.360> little<00:01:24.479> bit<00:01:24.630> of

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
right here you'll notice a little bit of

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:25.940 
right here you'll notice a little bit of
a<00:01:24.780> frame<00:01:25.020> dip<00:01:25.229> right<00:01:25.409> there<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.799> when<00:01:25.920> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
a frame dip right there right when I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.679 
a frame dip right there right when I
started<00:01:26.280> saving<00:01:26.490> that's<00:01:27.060> mainly<00:01:27.270> because<00:01:27.420> I'm

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
started saving that's mainly because I'm

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.090 
started saving that's mainly because I'm
recording<00:01:27.960> with<00:01:28.200> fraps<00:01:28.409> at<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.710> same<00:01:28.890> time

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
recording with fraps at the same time

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
recording with fraps at the same time
usually<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.640> doesn't<00:01:29.790> really<00:01:29.970> feel<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.329> at

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
usually it doesn't really feel that at

three enemies coming up from the right
side<00:02:39.550> just<00:02:40.550> fit<00:02:40.850> yourself<00:02:40.970> in<00:02:41.270> between<00:02:41.540> these

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
side just fit yourself in between these

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.540 
side just fit yourself in between these
two<00:02:41.870> cars<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.680> take<00:02:42.890> them<00:02:43.040> out<00:02:43.130> if<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.340> lights

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
two cars and take them out if the lights

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.940 
two cars and take them out if the lights
are<00:02:43.670> really<00:02:44.000> annoying<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:45.470> they<00:02:45.590> go<00:02:45.740> in<00:02:45.860> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
are really annoying but they go in the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.310 
are really annoying but they go in the
same<00:02:46.160> three<00:02:46.459> fixed<00:02:46.760> positions<00:02:47.180> every<00:02:47.420> time<00:02:47.630> so

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
same three fixed positions every time so

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.100 
same three fixed positions every time so
we're<00:02:48.470> something<00:02:48.740> that<00:02:48.950> big<00:02:49.130> we<00:02:49.250> do<00:02:50.110> again

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
we're something that big we do again

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.240 
we're something that big we do again
there's<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.350> little<00:02:51.470> bit<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.680> a<00:02:51.800> frame<00:02:52.040> dip

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
there's a little bit of a frame dip

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.290 
there's a little bit of a frame dip
there<00:02:52.430> but<00:02:52.610> that's<00:02:52.700> mainly<00:02:52.940> cuz<00:02:53.209> I'm

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
there but that's mainly cuz I'm

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.910 
there but that's mainly cuz I'm
recording<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.840> fraps<00:02:54.110> at<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.320> same<00:02:54.470> time<00:02:54.650> and

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
recording the fraps at the same time and

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280 
recording the fraps at the same time and
it<00:02:54.980> went<00:02:55.130> for<00:02:55.370> safe<00:02:55.610> just<00:02:56.570> to<00:02:56.630> make<00:02:56.780> timing<00:02:57.200> of

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
it went for safe just to make timing of

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.720 
it went for safe just to make timing of
the<00:02:57.410> benchmarks<00:02:57.830> consistent<00:02:58.340> at<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.519> very

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
the benchmarks consistent at the very

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.370 
the benchmarks consistent at the very
end<00:02:58.850> shoot<00:02:59.120> these<00:02:59.239> windows<00:02:59.600> out<00:02:59.750> you<00:03:00.200> don't

end shoot these windows out you don't
want<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.590> run<00:03:00.709> much<00:03:00.950> further<00:03:01.220> down<00:03:01.519> because

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
want to run much further down because

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.520 
want to run much further down because
there's<00:03:02.450> a<00:03:02.600> rocket<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:02.989> will<00:03:03.110> come<00:03:03.290> out<00:03:03.380> and

there's a rocket that will come out and

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.780 
there's a rocket that will come out and
hit<00:03:03.620> that<00:03:03.739> pillar<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:04.310> will<00:03:04.489> make<00:03:04.670> your

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
hit that pillar and that will make your

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.790 
hit that pillar and that will make your
benchmark<00:03:05.180> inconsistent<00:03:06.140> so<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.380> sit<00:03:06.590> up<00:03:06.680> here

benchmark inconsistent so to sit up here

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.170 
benchmark inconsistent so to sit up here
and<00:03:06.860> shoot<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.160> windows<00:03:07.459> and<00:03:07.910> then<00:03:08.060> you're

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
and shoot the windows and then you're

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.110

where we have a thread where you guys
can<00:03:24.980> actually<00:03:25.310> post<00:03:25.459> your<00:03:25.730> own<00:03:25.760> results<00:03:26.239> since

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
can actually post your own results since

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.000 
can actually post your own results since
you're<00:03:26.570> all<00:03:26.690> running<00:03:26.900> the<00:03:27.170> same<00:03:27.350> standardized

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
you're all running the same standardized

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.220 
you're all running the same standardized
benchmark<00:03:28.519> now<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:29.090> easy<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.570> compare<00:03:29.989> and

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
benchmark now it's easy to compare and

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.960 
benchmark now it's easy to compare and
you<00:03:30.500> don't<00:03:30.680> have<00:03:30.890> to<00:03:31.040> worry<00:03:31.250> about<00:03:31.430> sort<00:03:31.910> of

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
you don't have to worry about sort of

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.360 
you don't have to worry about sort of
optimization<00:03:32.750> here<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.320> can<00:03:33.650> benchmark<00:03:34.010> there

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
optimization here or can benchmark there

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.550 
optimization here or can benchmark there
because<00:03:34.940> everything<00:03:35.510> here<00:03:35.780> is<00:03:36.019> running

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
because everything here is running

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.110 
because everything here is running
pretty<00:03:36.769> much<00:03:37.010> the<00:03:37.340> same<00:03:37.549> thing<00:03:37.610> in<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
pretty much the same thing in a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.840 
pretty much the same thing in a
real-world<00:03:38.510> gaming<00:03:39.230> environment<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.190> see<00:03:40.790> you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
real-world gaming environment so see you

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.610 
real-world gaming environment so see you
guys<00:03:41.000> next<00:03:41.209> time<00:03:41.450> for<00:03:41.720> more<00:03:41.780> benchmarking

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
guys next time for more benchmarking

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.690 
guys next time for more benchmarking
guides<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.070> all<00:03:43.130> that<00:03:43.250> kind<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.489> good<00:03:43.549> stuff

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
guides and all that kind of good stuff

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.610 
guides and all that kind of good stuff
and<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.420> think<00:03:44.720> I'm<00:03:44.870> pretty<00:03:45.200> much<00:03:45.260> done<00:03:45.560> here

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
and I think I'm pretty much done here

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.920 
and I think I'm pretty much done here
now
