00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:18.410
 the sampler people welcome to one 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.529
 another consequence stood up and the 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.660
 last episode has gotten 2506 yet 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.119
 times really many thanks for that I notice 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.730
 simply the format is really good 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.450
 and in today's sequence we will 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.340
 to make a very difficult stand 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.559
 that is, we will be one first 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.520
 quite a very second attempt of 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.949
 go back to here then if 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.070
 we break down there and then somehow 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.730
 try on the building at the very back 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.129
 to land 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.379
 It sounds really hard, it is too 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.910
 extremely heavy and have no idea if 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.899
 I'll do it, but I think so 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.649
 it is possible have it somewhere 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.649
 seen 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.489
 If I'm wondering why I'm not 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.309
 booster somehow use it that way if you can 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.860
 no booster is used faster 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.930
 because the booster has an end effect 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.000
 slower I do not know when 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.990
 someone knows it can be happy in the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.520
 Write comments 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.430
 In any case, it somehow brings more 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.780
 to make a long distance release then 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.979
 and then just stop at the highest 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.360
 speed can come too 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.369
 that I'm just crazy and 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 i am an idiot and no brewster 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.460
 user but I somehow think so 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.460
 was similar to the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:39.020
 oh okay was alright 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:48.990
 you do not get it off either 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.030
 one such buzz others stunt me 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.649
 this one is also possible here 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.649
 that's all clear here 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:07.069
 Perfect 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:22.830
 of course not perfect so kopp bautzen 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:26.420
 so spontaneously everything was perfect 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.420
 the eighth I would have to him 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.600
 Of course not one what is that I have to 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.110
 come on 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.230
 let's go oh oh oh okay pretty much 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.230
 crap 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:52.680
 the trade okay okay so now from the 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.660
 far he was the best so far 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.070
 three again to the right and so on 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.680
 a little better then we would have it 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.830
 managed without joke the start age is 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.830
 the worst one spontaneously arose 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:13.760
 oh oh oh oh is even very good if 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.739
 i am honest i am honest i am 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.620
 even think that I serve this time 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:32.150
 to which I promised but to succeed 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:33.440
 everything is perfect because I have it 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.579
 now in the country after one always 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.019
 not saved yet and mine is now 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.519
 boring again that's why it's on 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.890
 then start everything clear 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.459
 We will manage it with you 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.829
 you want with a little more distance 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.420
 this is going to be a really hot dream for me 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.590
 make everything boring markets 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.590
 release can not pull it at all 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:04:03.890
 we see wind shadow pass 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:09.099
 on grandma but somehow yes 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.019
 no, I will not just look 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.730
 No 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:16.900
 Yes 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.299
 but I am there what someone already takes 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 really much speed over it and go 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.400
 and now you perfect something so good old 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.419
 little asshole are you fast 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.419
 hazards 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.690
 no problem 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:34.139
 no problem for you, you always have 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:34.139
 like to see him again and again 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.860
 by simultaneously locking in 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.180
 which the hole ehrmann the shit still 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.330
 Do not think what hole of that here 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:06:02.290
 hole no i flew by 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:06:05.240
 passed better 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:09.070
 there really no shit your hat me 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.590
 not cut from winter without wc 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:13.360
 one tries to chop was wanted 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.530
 also make you sick 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.340
 Almost ever done the hack 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.300
 reduce 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:42.100
 Of course, I am often even in the hotel 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:44.180
 perfectly splashed boys I believe 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.560
 we can not do it anymore 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.150
 has remained landed on the right hotel 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.670
 but it is not a problem or yes 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.470
 so they we can not really 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.560
 I spoil the stunt 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:57.110
 Unleashed since three hours out since 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.180
 two hours show with daniel yes there was 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.440
 even anja confirms eight minutes here 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.850
 108 minutes 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:07.580
 we'll do this here for a very short time 

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:10.520
 settings display radar annan and here 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:12.020
 You see the chance 108 minutes later 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.170
 already with daniel before only one 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:17.300
 hour alone am so done with me so 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.830
 can she no longer i can i have 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.180
 extra window closed with mine 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.300
 neighbors do not die at my um 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.990
 but I would say we have screamed 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.880
 managed 

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.550
 here you see again the then 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.050
 Nice workmanship in any case 

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.300
 Please rate that since I would be very happy 

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:34.720
 pleased and we see the 

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.720
 next time again 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:41.510
 not the streams each of the 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.410
 he was
