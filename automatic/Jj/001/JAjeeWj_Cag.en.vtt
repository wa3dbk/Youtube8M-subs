00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello viewed today 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:09.090
 the game was released relatively long ago and everything is already 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.759
 managed to lose interest in her but I 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.910
 I think that this game is necessary 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.570
 remind especially in light of recent 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 output 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:24.230
 games like new call of duty or 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.230
 new phone or model so look 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.250
 but 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.129
 oddly enough people still call 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.309
 our comic video reviews 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.740
 I see part of the big problem 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:09.119
 video game review should serve two 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:12.009
 objectives of the analysis and recommendations and 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.380
 He turned without ideological rzhaku 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.600
 we have nothing against funny videos 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.780
 no let's say all the same wednesday 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.820
 flies and cutlets separately with this 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.229
 I decided to review a different game. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.690
 which made me strong 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.920
 be thoughtful then show you what is 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.080
 present review 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.310
 Immediately I warn you that this is funny 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.950
 the video will be small 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.360
 everything will be serious if you are in this 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.360
 moment to go and just laugh 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.280
 see something else so 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.069
 called bobbin shooters in our time 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.440
 gained significant popularity such 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.250
 call of duty monstrous franchise and 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.640
 battlefield 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.039
 sold multi-million copies of these 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.340
 games have become an integral part of our 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.160
 popular cultures like got up 80 such 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.340
 movie action as a rambo team 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.289
 These midi products are one with them 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.230
 main similarity one or more 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:11.920
 the main characters being in the military 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.480
 situations 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.370
 make their way through the ranks of the hostile 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.769
 knapsack national minorities to approximate 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.769
 victory and silent recognition by the audience 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.319
 how field heroes are demonstrated here 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:27.739
 as a sight to which everything is visible and 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.319
 right wins same time man 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.370
 past real war wakes up 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.900
 last night 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.690
 him that he dreamed again 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:40.670
 bloodied civilians that were 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.819
 killed before my eyes maybe i'm a biologist spec ops 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.560
 the line is a third-person shooter 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.299
 developed by eger company published 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.060
 company such games 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:53.150
 this phenomenon is unique and so necessary 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.000
 modern culture this game is a delicate move 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 shooter genre reminder that call 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.510
 of duty 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.120
 his numerous followers have become obsolete 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.730
 myself 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.659
 but first things first 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.010
 plot of the game of such sandstorms 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.470
 apocalyptic scale covered dubai 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.349
 Cutter All communications be from cities 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.959
 Colonel John Connor from Commander 33 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.060
 battalions of us infantry come back 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.700
 up to the place on decides to help evacuate 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.260
 civilians since then from the battalion not 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.989
 no news was heard 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.690
 Let half the year command higher 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.329
 favor a weak distress signal from the city 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.099
 sends happy to force led by 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.549
 young captain martin walker im 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.620
 the main character to their rescue 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.810
 the place of operas and his two companions 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.000
 it turned out that the evacuation failed 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.280
 thirty third battalion stuck in 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.440
 a city with everyone else who 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.030
 cirrus came across a weapon allowed on 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.790
 american soldiers trying 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.079
 establish order in the city 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.480
 specops gameplay is very mediocre 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.250
 shooting from the covered silly foes 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.109
 and allies obvious times are full 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 opponents of the sound of barricades 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.099
 all this gives the impression that the game 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.739
 was made about six or seven years ago 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:08.349
 but you will laugh it was made 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.540
 well the first two hours the game is hard 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.190
 reminds myself and crafts made by 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.530
 the wave of success call of duty 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.079
 but little by little the player understands that something 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.630
 it's not like that here the game hits him in the face and 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.050
 Speak away app lock 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.849
 now look what you did grow 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.729
 prickly so that carries with 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:29.650
 priority flame and plot correctly 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.060
 drama -provocative 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.150
 a look of violence 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.400
 western culture 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.500
 in the game rises a very important topic 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.430
 in addition to direct the horror of war and 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.550
 exactly the use of white phosphorus 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.600
 post-traumatic stress 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.330
 disorder 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.460
 the game will not drill holes in 4 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.070
 wall and very often you will need 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.880
 thinking who says goodbye character 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.610
 walker 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.890
 or directly to you sitting behind 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.080
 keyboard do not want to spoil anything 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.940
 so I will say this play scoops 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.250
 inspiration from joseph conrad's book 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.080
 heart of darkness read good books 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.390
 pretty short even colonel 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.850
 named after the author and the film Francis 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.770
 ford coppola apocalypse today him 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.870
 it's been three fucking hours, but all 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.030
 equal look at good choose 5 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.020
 endings and it is open to interpretation 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.700
 this is what all 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.220
 the main character is voiced by the omnipresent 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.380
 nolan north voiced including 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.450
 the protagonist of the famous interactive 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.530
 movie ancharted movie choice it was 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.570
 made not by chance 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.430
 pain charged protagonist Nathan Drake 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.170
 packs kills us less 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.050
 alien standing in his way to 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.170
 return from hiding from a third party 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.970
 this is all the protagonist is doing 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:40.350
 laughing and letting go of the malicious mockery 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.080
 perceiving the murder of their own kind 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.210
 well be she here walkure about what 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.670
 similar to the troyka exterior so the choice 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.480
 the voice actor quite created they wanted 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:53.670
 show how Nathan Drake goes crazy 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.610
 the graphics in the game helps to create 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:58.110
 the atmosphere of the unreal engine 3 does all that 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.960
 it is expected at this level 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:03.240
 The development of gaming technology is destroyed and 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.220
 abandoned dubai looks very interesting 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.380
 I want to separately note the absence 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.000
 the roof of a gray light filter is worth 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.420
 typical of modern shooters 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.400
 Due to the fact that the game is bright and colorful in 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.240
 In general, it is clear that the developers intentionally 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.099
 saved on 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.039
 gameplay but not stingy on the plot 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:23.759
 graphics and voice acting someone would recommend 

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:26.069
 This game is for everyone or everyone should play 

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.710
 first of all fans of call of duty and 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.599
 battlefield and everyone should be everything 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.630
 you will see for yourself that all this is because 

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:34.789
 that we didn't want to be somebody we didn't 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.789
 are 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:37.789
 heroes 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.980
 blue 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:44.980
 but 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.950
 h 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.790
 kettles
