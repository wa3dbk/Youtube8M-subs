00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
this is some tips on cutting glass I've

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.650 
this is some tips on cutting glass I've
taught<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.529> lot<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:08.069> students<00:00:08.580> on<00:00:08.760> stained

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660

taught a lot of students on stained
glass<00:00:09.900> classes<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:10.800> one<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.280> big

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
glass classes and one of the big

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.570 
glass classes and one of the big
questions<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.679> comes<00:00:13.679> up<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.190> how<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.490> you

questions that comes up is how do you
know<00:00:14.639> that<00:00:15.179> your<00:00:15.599> glass<00:00:16.199> cutter<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.740> sharp<00:00:17.390> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
know that your glass cutter is sharp and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.029 
know that your glass cutter is sharp and
how<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.020> know<00:00:19.170> when<00:00:19.350> enough<00:00:19.619> when<00:00:19.890> you're

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
how do you know when enough when you're

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.439 
how do you know when enough when you're
pressing<00:00:20.279> down<00:00:20.430> too<00:00:20.789> hard<00:00:20.820> or<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:21.300> hard

pressing down too hard or not hard
enough<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:24.150> couple<00:00:24.480> thing<00:00:25.250> we'll<00:00:26.250> bring<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
enough so a couple thing we'll bring to

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.009 
enough so a couple thing we'll bring to
light<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:28.039> first<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.220> all<00:00:29.720> this<00:00:30.720> cutter

little carbide wheel and this little
wheel<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.530> I'll<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:41.250> right<00:00:41.399> back<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:48.780> little

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
wheel here I'll be right back the little

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.150 
wheel here I'll be right back the little
wheel<00:00:49.700> has<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.149> kept<00:00:51.539> in<00:00:51.809> kerosene<00:00:52.770> or<00:00:52.920> oil

wheel has to be kept in kerosene or oil
all<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.430> time

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
all the time

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.350 
all the time
I<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.660> use<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> cans<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.160> I<00:00:56.460> put<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
I just use a cans like this I put a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.020 
I just use a cans like this I put a
sponge<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> bottom<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:59.160> put<00:00:59.399> oil<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.940> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
sponge in the bottom and I put oil in it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.060 
sponge in the bottom and I put oil in it
any<00:01:00.239> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.660> oil<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:01.140> don't<00:01:01.680> care<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:01.949> it's

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
any kind of oil I don't care if it's

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.520 
any kind of oil I don't care if it's
used<00:01:02.430> from<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.910> lawnmower<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:04.110> doesn't<00:01:04.439> much

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
used from your lawnmower it doesn't much

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.260 
used from your lawnmower it doesn't much
make<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:04.830> difference<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.460> that's<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.700> sponge<00:01:06.030> in

make a difference and that's a sponge in

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.149 
make a difference and that's a sponge in
the<00:01:06.360> bottom<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> skin<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.500> always<00:01:07.740> keep

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
the bottom of the skin and I always keep

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.690 
the bottom of the skin and I always keep
my<00:01:08.490> cutters<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.630> there<00:01:09.860> so<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:11.100> every<00:01:11.310> time

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
my cutters in there so about every time

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.929 
my cutters in there so about every time
every<00:01:12.500> second<00:01:13.500> third<00:01:13.710> time<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> cut<00:01:14.670> glass

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
every second third time that I cut glass

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.649 
every second third time that I cut glass
I<00:01:15.270> all<00:01:15.479> dip<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.530> can<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:18.479> then

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I all dip it into the can and then

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.380 
I all dip it into the can and then
approach<00:01:19.110> my<00:01:19.380> glass<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.950> cut<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.520> hold<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
approach my glass to cut it I hold it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
approach my glass to cut it I hold it
like<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.630> would<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.869> pencil<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.920> write

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
to give you that noise see if this one

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.309 
to give you that noise see if this one
does<00:02:20.970> this<00:02:21.970> one<00:02:22.239> does<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.440> all<00:02:23.650> glass<00:02:24.120> is

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
does this one does but not all glass is

does this one does but not all glass is
going<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.410> give<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.860> noise

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
going to give you that noise

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.740 
going to give you that noise
some<00:02:28.780> glass<00:02:29.080> is<00:02:29.470> very<00:02:29.680> silent<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.540> don't

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
some glass is very silent and you don't

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.500 
some glass is very silent and you don't
think<00:02:32.019> you've<00:02:32.170> cut<00:02:32.410> hard<00:02:32.680> enough<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.510> when

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
think you've cut hard enough and when

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.330 
think you've cut hard enough and when
then<00:02:34.930> when<00:02:35.140> you're<00:02:35.290> trying<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.620> retrace<00:02:36.069> your

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
then when you're trying to retrace your

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.640 
then when you're trying to retrace your
cutting<00:02:36.940> line<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.480> doesn't<00:02:37.870> work<00:02:38.080> the<00:02:38.410> glass

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
cutting line it doesn't work the glass

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.620 
cutting line it doesn't work the glass
generally<00:02:39.250> has<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.489> mind<00:02:39.850> of<00:02:39.940> its<00:02:40.030> own<00:02:40.269> and<00:02:40.450> goes

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
generally has a mind of its own and goes

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.949 
generally has a mind of its own and goes
where<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:40.959> wants<00:02:40.989> to<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:41.920> because<00:02:42.310> glass

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
where it wants to that's because glass

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.750 
where it wants to that's because glass
picks<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.230> path<00:02:44.530> of<00:02:44.830> least<00:02:44.950> resistance

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
picks the path of least resistance

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.350 
picks the path of least resistance
you<00:02:46.569> can<00:02:46.720> never<00:02:46.870> cut<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.680> can<00:02:47.860> never<00:02:48.010> Rico<00:02:48.970> go

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
you can never cut you can never Rico go

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.100 
you can never cut you can never Rico go
over<00:02:49.540> your<00:02:49.690> same<00:02:50.019> prior<00:02:50.769> cut<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:52.090> expect<00:02:52.959> it

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
over your same prior cut and expect it

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.820 
over your same prior cut and expect it
to<00:02:53.230> break<00:02:53.470> like<00:02:53.769> this<00:02:56.910> now<00:02:58.230> when<00:02:59.230> I<00:02:59.260> look<00:02:59.530> at<00:02:59.680> my

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
to break like this now when I look at my

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.520 
to break like this now when I look at my
glass<00:03:00.130> on<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.549> side<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.239> can<00:03:01.720> tell<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.200> it's

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
glass on the side I can tell that it's

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530 
glass on the side I can tell that it's
cut<00:03:02.739> really<00:03:02.980> well<00:03:03.310> you<00:03:03.730> can't<00:03:03.970> see<00:03:04.209> this<00:03:04.359> on

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
cut really well you can't see this on

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.020 
cut really well you can't see this on
this<00:03:04.720> video<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.459> look<00:03:06.700> along<00:03:07.000> the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
this video but if you look along the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.770 
this video but if you look along the
edge<00:03:07.329> you'll<00:03:07.780> see<00:03:07.959> tiny<00:03:08.230> little<00:03:08.650> scallops<00:03:09.780> if

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
edge you'll see tiny little scallops if

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.650 
edge you'll see tiny little scallops if
you've<00:03:11.019> got<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> clean<00:03:11.709> edge<00:03:12.359> right<00:03:13.359> pressure

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
you've got a clean edge right pressure

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.490 
you've got a clean edge right pressure
in<00:03:14.049> and<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:15.640> good<00:03:15.819> Kott<00:03:16.090> ahead<00:03:16.480> your<00:03:17.200> glass

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
in and a good Kott ahead your glass

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.740 
in and a good Kott ahead your glass
should<00:03:17.769> be<00:03:17.859> fairly<00:03:18.160> smooth<00:03:18.730> along<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.510> edge

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
should be fairly smooth along that edge

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.059 
should be fairly smooth along that edge
I'm<00:03:20.049> not<00:03:20.170> going<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.410> touch<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.769> with<00:03:20.920> my

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
I'm not going to touch that with my

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.490 
I'm not going to touch that with my
fingers<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.609> cut<00:03:21.790> myself<00:03:22.299> but<00:03:22.600> along<00:03:23.319> this

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
fingers and cut myself but along this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.309 
fingers and cut myself but along this
edge<00:03:23.769> as<00:03:24.100> you<00:03:24.370> look<00:03:24.609> and<00:03:24.790> examine<00:03:25.079> you'll<00:03:26.079> see

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
edge as you look and examine you'll see

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.580 
edge as you look and examine you'll see
if<00:03:26.440> you've<00:03:26.590> got<00:03:26.769> a<00:03:26.799> clean<00:03:27.010> edge<00:03:27.310> or<00:03:27.519> not

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
if you've got a clean edge or not

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.440 
if you've got a clean edge or not
this<00:03:29.590> one's<00:03:29.799> really<00:03:30.160> clean<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.910> can't<00:03:31.150> see

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
this one's really clean you can't see

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.910 
this one's really clean you can't see
any<00:03:31.720> scallops<00:03:33.000> with<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.230> I'll<00:03:35.230> push<00:03:35.709> this

uknow<00:03:55.359> you<00:03:55.420> can<00:03:55.930> really<00:03:56.530> see<00:03:56.769> the<00:03:56.920> scalloped

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
uknow you can really see the scalloped

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.229 
uknow you can really see the scalloped
edge<00:03:57.639> it<00:03:57.970> is<00:03:58.620> absolutely<00:03:59.620> evident<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.970> looks

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
edge it is absolutely evident this looks

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.759 
edge it is absolutely evident this looks
like<00:04:01.359> it<00:04:01.540> was<00:04:01.630> cut<00:04:01.900> out<00:04:01.930> with<00:04:02.319> pinking<00:04:02.709> shears

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
like it was cut out with pinking shears

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.300 
like it was cut out with pinking shears
is<00:04:03.340> just<00:04:03.519> so<00:04:03.730> torn<00:04:04.000> up<00:04:04.239> along<00:04:04.540> these<00:04:04.690> edges

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
is just so torn up along these edges

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.479 
is just so torn up along these edges
many<00:04:06.310> times<00:04:06.730> as<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.120> watch<00:04:07.389> people<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:09.280> too

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.550 
scalloped edges to things either I press
down<00:04:30.740> too<00:04:30.980> hard<00:04:31.120> or<00:04:32.120> my<00:04:32.390> cutter<00:04:32.690> is<00:04:32.990> not<00:04:33.200> very

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
down too hard or my cutter is not very

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.000 
down too hard or my cutter is not very
sharp<00:04:33.620> or<00:04:34.190> both<00:04:34.490> a<00:04:34.790> combination<00:04:35.480> of<00:04:35.540> both

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
sharp or both a combination of both

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:45.480 
sharp or both a combination of both
so<00:04:37.010> I'm<00:04:37.190> going<00:04:37.310> to<00:04:37.400> go<00:04:37.490> back<00:04:40.420> cut<00:04:41.420> very<00:04:41.660> lightly

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.720 

got<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.670> got<00:04:47.360> a<00:04:47.390> clean<00:04:47.660> edge<00:04:48.160> so<00:04:49.160> more<00:04:49.430> likely

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
got it got a clean edge so more likely

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.670 
got it got a clean edge so more likely
was<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.240> pressure<00:04:50.540> that<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.960> was<00:04:51.170> putting<00:04:51.560> up

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
was the pressure that I was putting up

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.220 
was the pressure that I was putting up
because<00:04:52.130> I<00:04:52.250> got<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> clean<00:04:52.760> edge<00:04:53.200> so<00:04:54.200> that

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
because I got a clean edge so that

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.290 
because I got a clean edge so that
suggests<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.100> me<00:04:55.190> that<00:04:55.520> my<00:04:55.640> cutter<00:04:55.910> is<00:04:56.090> not

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
suggests to me that my cutter is not

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:03.460 
suggests to me that my cutter is not
really<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.460> culprit<00:04:58.940> here<00:05:02.200> just<00:05:03.200> a<00:05:03.290> couple

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
really the culprit here just a couple

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.870 
really the culprit here just a couple
things<00:05:03.800> to<00:05:03.980> keep<00:05:04.130> in<00:05:04.310> mind<00:05:04.490> if<00:05:04.730> you're

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
things to keep in mind if you're

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.370 
things to keep in mind if you're
pressing<00:05:05.090> too<00:05:05.420> hard<00:05:05.720> you're<00:05:05.990> going<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.170> know

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
pressing too hard you're going to know

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.280 
pressing too hard you're going to know
it<00:05:06.410> in<00:05:06.710> two<00:05:06.860> cuts<00:05:07.130> of<00:05:07.340> your<00:05:07.520> glass<00:05:07.790> and<00:05:08.150> if<00:05:09.140> your

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
it in two cuts of your glass and if your

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.590 
it in two cuts of your glass and if your
cutter<00:05:09.560> is<00:05:09.890> dull<00:05:10.460> you're<00:05:10.910> also<00:05:11.090> going<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.540> see

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
cutter is dull you're also going to see

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.900 
cutter is dull you're also going to see
that<00:05:11.750> show<00:05:12.500> up<00:05:12.680> in<00:05:12.830> the<00:05:12.950> in<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.310> cuts<00:05:13.550> of<00:05:13.730> your

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
that show up in the in the cuts of your

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:16.150 
that show up in the in the cuts of your
glass<00:05:14.210> so<00:05:14.570> two<00:05:14.840> things<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.170> keep<00:05:15.380> in<00:05:15.590> mind<00:05:15.890> is

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 
glass so two things to keep in mind is

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.160 
glass so two things to keep in mind is
the<00:05:16.850> pressure<00:05:17.090> amount<00:05:17.630> of<00:05:17.720> pressure<00:05:17.930> you're

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
the pressure amount of pressure you're

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:21.060 
the pressure amount of pressure you're
trying<00:05:18.470> to<00:05:18.620> apply<00:05:18.950> to<00:05:19.460> your<00:05:19.610> cutter<00:05:19.850> and

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
trying to apply to your cutter and

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.370 
trying to apply to your cutter and
whether<00:05:22.070> your<00:05:22.310> cutter<00:05:22.520> head<00:05:22.820> is<00:05:23.210> sharp<00:05:23.930> or<00:05:24.170> not

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
whether your cutter head is sharp or not

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.340 
whether your cutter head is sharp or not

moving it around you'll see by

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.280 
moving it around you'll see by
reflection<00:06:07.570> but<00:06:08.570> that's<00:06:08.780> pretty<00:06:09.080> difficult

to<00:06:17.270> break<00:06:17.450> across<00:06:18.250> I'm<00:06:19.250> guilty<00:06:19.700> of<00:06:20.000> that

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
to break across I'm guilty of that

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.050
