00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
I mean come on today a look at this if

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.640 
I mean come on today a look at this if
you<00:03:08.120> if<00:03:08.239> you<00:03:08.630> don't<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.930> muscles<00:03:09.320> this<00:03:09.500> will

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
you if you don't have muscles this will

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.960 
you if you don't have muscles this will
they<00:03:09.890> pretend<00:03:10.190> you're<00:03:10.280> muscles<00:03:10.670> so<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:10.820> guess
