it all the time in the dirt sheets you
hear<00:00:37.820> the<00:00:38.030> term<00:00:38.440> psychology<00:00:39.440> pretty<00:00:40.340> much

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
hear the term psychology pretty much

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.369 
hear the term psychology pretty much
everywhere<00:00:40.940> these<00:00:41.120> days<00:00:41.180> with<00:00:41.629> pro<00:00:41.870> wrestling

00:00:42.369 --> 00:00:42.379 
everywhere these days with pro wrestling

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:44.049 
everywhere these days with pro wrestling
so<00:00:42.860> what<00:00:43.190> does<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.309> mean

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
so what does that mean

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.680 
so what does that mean
and<00:00:44.150> I<00:00:44.809> think<00:00:44.870> psychology<00:00:45.470> and<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.010> ring<00:00:46.250> is

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
and I think psychology and the ring is

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.380 
and I think psychology and the ring is
really<00:00:47.690> means<00:00:47.930> what<00:00:48.920> you<00:00:49.820> know<00:00:49.940> what<00:00:50.180> you're

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
really means what you know what you're

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.960 
really means what you know what you're
doing<00:00:50.809> in<00:00:51.019> that<00:00:51.050> match<00:00:51.530> what<00:00:51.980> story<00:00:52.489> are<00:00:52.850> you

you're getting a barrage of shots you
know<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.050> wouldn't<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.470> sit<00:03:22.620> there<00:03:22.860> and

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
know you wouldn't just sit there and

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.280 
know you wouldn't just sit there and
take<00:03:23.220> them<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.580> sell<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.540> stuff<00:03:25.140> like

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.229 
take them and sell and and stuff like
that<00:03:25.560> you'd<00:03:25.770> get<00:03:26.010> your<00:03:26.250> hands<00:03:26.640> up<00:03:26.850> and<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
that you'd get your hands up and you

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.750 
that you'd get your hands up and you
would<00:03:27.360> try<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.630> defend<00:03:28.110> so<00:03:28.980> always<00:03:29.310> try<00:03:29.730> to

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
would try to defend so always try to

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.640 
would try to defend so always try to
think<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.570> when<00:03:31.200> you're<00:03:31.380> putting

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
think of that when you're putting

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.500 
think of that when you're putting
together<00:03:31.950> a<00:03:32.250> match<00:03:32.520> because<00:03:32.970> that<00:03:33.180> kind<00:03:33.420> of

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
together a match because that kind of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.620 
together a match because that kind of
psychology<00:03:33.959> really<00:03:34.920> differentiates<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.209> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
psychology really differentiates you and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.199 
psychology really differentiates you and
if<00:03:37.350> you're<00:03:37.500> an<00:03:37.590> average<00:03:37.860> wrestler<00:03:38.550> that'll

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
if you're an average wrestler that'll

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.180 
if you're an average wrestler that'll
make<00:03:39.360> you<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> great<00:03:39.870> wrestler<00:03:40.290> and<00:03:40.799> if<00:03:41.010> you're

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
make you a great wrestler and if you're

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.220 
make you a great wrestler and if you're
a<00:03:41.220> great<00:03:41.549> wrestler<00:03:41.910> that'll<00:03:42.570> put<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.900> through

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
a great wrestler that'll put you through

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.830 
a great wrestler that'll put you through
the<00:03:43.739> roof<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.310> that'll<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.820> you<00:03:45.330> know<00:03:45.480> that'll

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
the roof and that'll be you know that'll

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.140 
the roof and that'll be you know that'll
be<00:03:46.019> what<00:03:46.260> it<00:03:46.380> takes<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:47.400> get<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.760> to<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:48.090> next

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
be what it takes to get you to that next

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.320 
be what it takes to get you to that next
level<00:03:48.810> because<00:03:49.280> psychology<00:03:50.280> will<00:03:50.519> take<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:51.060> a

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
level because psychology will take you a

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.380 
level because psychology will take you a
complete<00:03:52.320> other<00:03:52.590> step<00:03:53.130> up<00:03:53.340> because<00:03:53.850> I've<00:03:54.120> seen

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
complete other step up because I've seen

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.509 
complete other step up because I've seen
great<00:03:54.810> wrestlers<00:03:55.350> not<00:03:55.799> make<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.220> because

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
great wrestlers not make it because

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.550 
great wrestlers not make it because
there<00:03:56.700> was<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.820> lack<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.120> psychology<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.170> I've

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
there was a lack of psychology and I've

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.960 
there was a lack of psychology and I've
seen<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:59.820> know<00:03:59.850> mediocre<00:04:00.810> wrestlers<00:04:01.760> make<00:04:02.760> it

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
seen you know mediocre wrestlers make it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.120 
seen you know mediocre wrestlers make it
because<00:04:03.840> they<00:04:03.989> had<00:04:04.230> psychology

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
because they had psychology

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.979 
because they had psychology
I'm<00:04:05.190> just<00:04:05.940> incredible<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.600> that's<00:04:06.690> Pro
