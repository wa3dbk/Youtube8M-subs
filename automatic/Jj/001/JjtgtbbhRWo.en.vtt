00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.910
 the concept of body image we 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.340
 repeat to the representation of one's own 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.949
 body this representation we must 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.590
 differentiate that of the body schema the 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:16.660
 body schema is the relationship of 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.000
 The real body is the body of medicine 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.330
 is that body that has a 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.490
 functionality a movement if we 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.089
 we closed our eyes and we had to 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.699
 trace our body outline 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:32.770
 we could do it without difficulty of not 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.620
 mediate some neurological disease or 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.449
 organic 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.670
 but what is put into play when 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.559
 graphic above all the drawing of the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.019
 human figure comes those tests in 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.480
 where it is represented is the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.790
 body image traversed by the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.120
 self-esteem for the experiences 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.850
 emotional psychological that the person 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
 has gone from birth to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.930
 its current moment 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.930
 this body image can be modified 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.540
 in cases of illness or when there 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.929
 some psychological disturbance or 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.830
 significant symptomatic the idea is 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:13.289
 reflect like this body image 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.880
 When it is stable or solid, it tends to 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.970
 stay through throughout the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.429
 graphic productions particularly in 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 the sequence of fh drawing of the figure 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.150
 and drawing the human person under the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.890
 rain 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.530
 in the drawing that you are seeing 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.600
 we can see several indicators 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 symptomatic there is not an adequate 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.079
 internal proportion 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.689
 we can see the omission of features 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.760
 The head is made in the form 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.100
 fairy spiral 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.460
 we can also see the mission of hands and 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.980
 of feet the figure in movement the 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.880
 rain only falls to the drawing at 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.980
 person who is at this moment 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 Running is interesting to see 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.080
 we told you that the drawing of the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.810
 human figure also the sequence was 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.180
 atypical ie a figure is drawn 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 lying down 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.070
 by the feet after I draw the head 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.710
 then I draw arms after I draw the 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.010
 body being everything quite a whole 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.010
 poorly integrated 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 when you go to the drawing of the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.390
 person under the rain can see this 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.930
 production in the only thing that has changed 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:30.400
 it is in the position to be lying down to be 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.240
 standing however the drawing reveals a 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 important level of anxiety 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.600
 and difficulties as to what is the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.180
 organization in general the umbrella that 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.740
 it resembles a newspaper however it can be seen 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.920
 in the handle of the umbrella is totally 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.590
 reinforced and blackened 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.230
 that umbrella that is like little 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:56.590
 efficient to hold the rain gives us 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.590
 account 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.690
 of a deficit in the self-image and in the 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.560
 ability of coping with the 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.200
 situations of tension and expressing is 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.910
 it is also always important to remember 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.920
 that we never evaluate based on 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.569
 indicators of a single test but that 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.580
 we go construction of inferences to what 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.040
 length of the different tests that 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.140
 they make up the battery notwithstanding every 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.910
 test has its specificity and this that 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.989
 we are commenting on the drawing of the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.940
 human figure in sequence with the drawing 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.630
 of the person in the rain we 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:33.190
 allow to evaluate the body's self-image 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.530
 of the person in situations 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.930
 stressful when there is certain 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.940
 psychological stability is normal that the 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.709
 drawing maintain your stability ie 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.470
 beyond the graphic characteristics 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.319
 what happens to us because it's a nice or a 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.780
 better or lesser drawing with less style 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.510
 graphic but internal proportions 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.420
 I complete the details and that 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.519
 characteristic also be maintained in the 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.440
 person under the rain this is a 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.300
 main indicator that also after 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.340
 we will be able to relate 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.530
 the desiderative questionnaire that is going 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.470
 to account for the logical structure its 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.130
 strength their defense mechanisms well 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.540
 also like stability 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.540
 in that structure
