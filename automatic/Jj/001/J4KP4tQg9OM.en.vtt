excess we'll set that aside and our

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.240 
excess we'll set that aside and our
polystyrene<00:04:10.320> block<00:04:10.530> where<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.040> can

black<00:04:19.380> as<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.160> mentioned<00:04:20.519> it's<00:04:20.670> always<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> great

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
black as I mentioned it's always a great

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.240 
black as I mentioned it's always a great
idea<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.359> give<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.720> nice<00:04:21.959> stir<00:04:22.190> make<00:04:23.190> sure
