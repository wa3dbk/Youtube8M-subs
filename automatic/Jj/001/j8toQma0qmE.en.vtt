corner<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:59.050> is<00:00:59.289> a<00:00:59.320> rigid<00:01:01.020> soft<00:01:02.020> shell<00:01:02.230> case<00:01:03.930> so

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
corner it is a rigid soft shell case so

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.590 
corner it is a rigid soft shell case so
it's<00:01:05.080> somewhere<00:01:05.410> in<00:01:05.470> between<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:06.399> hard<00:01:07.330> plastic

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
it's somewhere in between a hard plastic

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
case and a soft silicone case so it

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.359 
case and a soft silicone case so it
sounds<00:01:13.060> like<00:01:14.790> it's<00:01:16.560> 11.6<00:01:17.560> 4<00:01:17.799> millimeters

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
sounds like it's 11.6 4 millimeters

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.450 
sounds like it's 11.6 4 millimeters
thick<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.659> it's<00:01:19.990> pretty<00:01:20.140> thin<00:01:20.380> case<00:01:20.650> feels

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
thick so it's pretty thin case feels

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.690

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
see here the cutouts again very nice and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.910 
see here the cutouts again very nice and
centered<00:02:26.650> up<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.570> this<00:02:28.570> one<00:02:28.780> isn't<00:02:28.960> centered

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
centered up here this one isn't centered

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.580 
centered up here this one isn't centered
all<00:02:30.130> the<00:02:30.250> way<00:02:30.400> I<00:02:31.140> would<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.320> to<00:02:32.500> be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
all the way I would like it to be

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.640 
all the way I would like it to be
centered<00:02:32.950> more<00:02:33.130> but<00:02:33.430> this<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.350> switch

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
centered more but this the switch

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830 
centered more but this the switch
doesn't<00:02:35.920> come<00:02:36.160> in<00:02:36.280> contact<00:02:36.520> it<00:02:36.970> all<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
doesn't come in contact it all with the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.220 
doesn't come in contact it all with the
case<00:02:38.080> so<00:02:38.590> it<00:02:38.740> really<00:02:38.770> doesn't<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:40.750> anything<00:02:41.110> to

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
case so it really doesn't do anything to

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.020 
case so it really doesn't do anything to
the<00:02:41.320> case<00:02:41.500> or<00:02:41.680> the<00:02:41.860> phone<00:02:42.100> it's<00:02:42.490> just<00:02:42.820> not

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
the case or the phone it's just not

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.500 
the case or the phone it's just not
centered<00:02:43.690> entirely<00:02:44.460> this<00:02:45.460> is<00:02:45.610> very<00:02:45.790> very<00:02:46.150> nice

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
centered entirely this is very very nice

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.030 
centered entirely this is very very nice
cut<00:02:46.750> out<00:02:46.840> down<00:02:46.990> here<00:02:47.230> I<00:02:47.380> like<00:02:47.830> how<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
cut out down here I like how the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.150 
cut out down here I like how the
material<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.350> rigid<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.680> it's<00:02:50.830> not<00:02:50.950> too

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
material here is rigid so it's not too

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.810 
material here is rigid so it's not too
loose<00:02:51.370> at<00:02:51.580> all<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:53.410> sides<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.190> top

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
loose at all and the sides and the top

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.370 
loose at all and the sides and the top
they're<00:02:55.660> very<00:02:55.780> form-fitting<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.870> material

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
they're very form-fitting the material

they're very form-fitting the material
provides<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.340> nice<00:03:00.490> grip<00:03:00.820> on<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.120> phone<00:03:02.160> but

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
provides a nice grip on the phone but

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.220 
provides a nice grip on the phone but
not<00:03:03.370> too<00:03:03.580> much<00:03:03.610> grit<00:03:04.090> so<00:03:04.420> when<00:03:04.750> you<00:03:04.840> slide<00:03:05.080> it

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
not too much grit so when you slide it

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.780 
not too much grit so when you slide it
in<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.530> your<00:03:05.709> pocket<00:03:06.070> it<00:03:06.190> doesn't<00:03:06.459> get<00:03:06.580> stuck

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
in that your pocket it doesn't get stuck

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
in that your pocket it doesn't get stuck
at<00:03:07.030> all<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.860> can<00:03:09.040> see<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.489> apple<00:03:09.910> logo<00:03:09.940> nicely

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
at all you can see the apple logo nicely

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.570 
at all you can see the apple logo nicely
on<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.020> back<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.620> iphone<00:03:11.739> words<00:03:12.280> down

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
on the back and the iphone words down

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.400 
on the back and the iphone words down
here<00:03:13.170> because<00:03:14.170> of<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:15.360> translucent<00:03:16.360> color<00:03:17.170> to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
here because of the translucent color to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.000 
here because of the translucent color to
it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.500 

really<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.130> only<00:03:24.190> thing<00:03:24.550> that<00:03:24.730> I<00:03:24.760> don't<00:03:25.360> like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
really the only thing that I don't like

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.150 
really the only thing that I don't like
about<00:03:25.660> the<00:03:26.050> case<00:03:26.230> is<00:03:26.440> how<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:26.800> isn't

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
about the case is how this isn't

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.790 
about the case is how this isn't
centered<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:27.870> but<00:03:28.870> other<00:03:29.110> than<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.410> I

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
centered here but other than that I

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.000 
centered here but other than that I
think<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.670> is<00:03:30.820> a<00:03:30.850> great<00:03:31.180> case<00:03:31.800> very<00:03:32.800> good

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
think this is a great case very good

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.970 
think this is a great case very good
material<00:03:33.580> not<00:03:34.330> too<00:03:34.600> big<00:03:34.870> on<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> phone<00:03:35.470> it

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
material not too big on the phone it

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.620 
material not too big on the phone it
really<00:03:36.190> feels<00:03:36.370> like<00:03:36.550> there's<00:03:36.880> not<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.150> much

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
really feels like there's not that much

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.730 
really feels like there's not that much
there<00:03:38.020> I<00:03:39.180> would<00:03:40.180> recommend<00:03:40.330> this<00:03:40.810> case<00:03:41.440> very

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
there I would recommend this case very

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.160 
there I would recommend this case very
