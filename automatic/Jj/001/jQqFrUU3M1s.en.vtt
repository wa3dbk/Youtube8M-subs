00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
kind of hoped for a little more when it

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.050

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
natural if it's nice enough it lasts a

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.420 
natural if it's nice enough it lasts a
long<00:04:00.420> time<00:04:00.480> has<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> nice<00:04:01.500> patina<00:04:01.860> to<00:04:02.130> it<00:04:02.160> after

long time has a nice patina to it after

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.650 
long time has a nice patina to it after
a<00:04:02.610> while<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:03.840> will<00:04:04.110> not<00:04:04.320> last<00:04:04.350> a<00:04:04.800> long<00:04:04.950> time

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
a while this will not last a long time

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.420 
a while this will not last a long time
you<00:04:06.660> know<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:07.050> would<00:04:07.350> imagine<00:04:07.620> if<00:04:08.070> I<00:04:08.220> actually

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
you know I would imagine if I actually

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.289 
you know I would imagine if I actually
use<00:04:08.850> this<00:04:09.200> every<00:04:10.200> day<00:04:10.230> on<00:04:10.680> my<00:04:10.709> camera<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.940> would

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
use this every day on my camera it would

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.370 
use this every day on my camera it would
probably<00:04:12.630> last<00:04:12.959> me<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> month<00:04:13.730> maybe<00:04:14.730> two

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
probably last me a month maybe two

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.979 
probably last me a month maybe two
before<00:04:16.380> this<00:04:16.830> thing<00:04:17.100> broke<00:04:17.430> right<00:04:17.640> here<00:04:17.989> just

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
before this thing broke right here just

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.729 
before this thing broke right here just
from<00:04:19.169> jam<00:04:19.470> in<00:04:19.620> my<00:04:19.739> hand<00:04:20.070> in

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
from jam in my hand in

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.540 
from jam in my hand in
to<00:04:20.919> it<00:04:21.479> constantly<00:04:22.479> so<00:04:22.979> the<00:04:23.979> buckle<00:04:24.250> appears

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to it constantly so the buckle appears

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.480 
to it constantly so the buckle appears
not<00:04:24.729> bad<00:04:25.090> but<00:04:25.960> once<00:04:26.169> again<00:04:26.319> I<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:27.160> know<00:04:27.280> I

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
not bad but once again I you know I

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.409 
not bad but once again I you know I
don't<00:04:27.550> really<00:04:27.819> care<00:04:28.210> for<00:04:28.539> stuff<00:04:28.840> like<00:04:28.930> this<00:04:29.050> um

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
don't really care for stuff like this um

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.990 
don't really care for stuff like this um
it's<00:04:31.419> really<00:04:31.509> not<00:04:31.900> safe<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.979> mean<00:04:33.250> yeah<00:04:33.610> you've

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
it's really not safe I mean yeah you've

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759
