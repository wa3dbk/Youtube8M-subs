00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
scenes are created you know the thing is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.249 
scenes are created you know the thing is
with<00:01:33.270> these<00:01:33.450> ones<00:01:33.720> are<00:01:33.869> gonna<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
with these ones are gonna look the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
with these ones are gonna look the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.370 
we crack it open we're gonna have the
ultraviolet<00:02:19.660> code<00:02:19.810> there<00:02:20.020> which<00:02:20.140> I'm<00:02:20.230> gonna

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
ultraviolet code there which I'm gonna

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.170 
ultraviolet code there which I'm gonna
hide<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.830> we'll<00:02:20.950> actually<00:02:21.100> use<00:02:21.250> that<00:02:21.460> one<00:02:21.610> but

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
hide so we'll actually use that one but

desolation of smaug on the back of that
is<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> ultraviolet<00:02:26.980> code<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.520> gonna<00:02:27.640> show

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
is the ultraviolet code not gonna show

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.910 
is the ultraviolet code not gonna show
you<00:02:27.880> I<00:02:28.180> knew<00:02:29.170> there'd<00:02:29.350> be<00:02:29.410> one<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.650> these<00:02:29.709> in
