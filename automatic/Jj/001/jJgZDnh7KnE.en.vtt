think<00:03:56.819> that's<00:03:57.120> just<00:03:57.329> wild<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:58.409> know<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:59.250> don't

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
think that's just wild you know I don't

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.130 
think that's just wild you know I don't
know<00:04:00.060> was<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.329> like<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.599> said<00:04:00.659> you<00:04:00.840> just<00:04:00.870> can't

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
know was it like I said you just can't

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.479
