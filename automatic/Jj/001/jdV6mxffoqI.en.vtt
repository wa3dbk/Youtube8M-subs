with<00:00:57.070> say<00:00:57.280> between<00:00:58.000> 10<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.510> 12<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.680> know<00:00:59.710> some

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
with say between 10 and 12 you know some

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.549 
with say between 10 and 12 you know some
number<00:01:00.309> like<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:00.969> that<00:01:01.660> was<00:01:01.809> as<00:01:01.989> many<00:01:02.200> as<00:01:02.410> I

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
number like that that was as many as I

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.540 
number like that that was as many as I
could<00:01:02.620> handle<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:04.860> then<00:01:05.860> one<00:01:06.160> thing<00:01:06.340> led<00:01:06.490> to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
could handle and I then one thing led to

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.460 
could handle and I then one thing led to
another<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:07.240> never<00:01:07.720> thought<00:01:07.899> I'd<00:01:08.050> end<00:01:08.170> up<00:01:08.320> was

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
another I never thought I'd end up was

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.859 
another I never thought I'd end up was
about<00:01:08.680> 80<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:10.000> car<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.330> guy<00:01:10.479> who<00:01:10.539> is<00:01:10.690> driving

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
there is a fairly new gadget it's not

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.940 
there is a fairly new gadget it's not
been<00:01:13.210> raised<00:01:13.390> by<00:01:13.570> going<00:01:13.840> very<00:01:14.140> long<00:01:14.410> I<00:01:14.649> think

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
been raised by going very long I think

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.380 
been raised by going very long I think
he's<00:01:15.130> still<00:01:15.310> trying<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.610> get<00:01:15.729> it<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.940> measure<00:01:16.060> I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
he's still trying to get it to measure I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.590 
he's still trying to get it to measure I

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
and that by suppose would be because

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.670 
and that by suppose would be because
Pete<00:01:21.970> Geren<00:01:22.420> was<00:01:22.570> such<00:01:22.690> a<00:01:22.720> good<00:01:22.990> mate<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.410> mine

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
Pete Geren was such a good mate of mine

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.059 
Pete Geren was such a good mate of mine
and<00:01:24.009> that<00:01:24.490> car<00:01:24.820> was<00:01:25.119> was<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.440> peak<00:01:26.770> of<00:01:26.920> his

00:01:27.059 --> 00:01:27.069 
and that car was was the peak of his

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:29.669 
and that car was was the peak of his
career<00:01:27.520> when<00:01:27.789> he<00:01:27.910> was<00:01:28.030> at<00:01:28.179> his<00:01:28.300> very<00:01:28.569> best<00:01:28.679> that

00:01:29.669 --> 00:01:29.679 
career when he was at his very best that

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.190 
career when he was at his very best that
was<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.890> handful<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.759> suppose<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.330> feel

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
like I've owned it since 1970 so it's
