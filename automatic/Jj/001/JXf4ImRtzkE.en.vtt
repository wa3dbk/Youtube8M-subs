welcome to medicine balls today I would
a<00:00:08.460> little<00:00:09.059> bit<00:00:09.179> talk<00:00:09.420> about<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:10.280> medulla

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
a little bit talk about the medulla

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.720 
a little bit talk about the medulla
oblongata<00:00:12.080> so<00:00:13.080> what<00:00:13.320> exactly<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.309> medulla

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
oblongata so what exactly is the medulla

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.570 
oblongata so what exactly is the medulla
oblongata<00:00:14.759> and<00:00:15.150> where<00:00:15.389> is<00:00:15.540> it<00:00:15.570> located<00:00:16.580> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
oblongata and where is it located the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.480 
oblongata and where is it located the
medulla<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.449> located<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.289> lower<00:00:19.590> portion

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
medulla is located in the lower portion

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.720 
medulla is located in the lower portion
of<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.820> brain<00:00:21.060> stand<00:00:21.680> it<00:00:22.680> deals<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.279> several

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
of the brain stand it deals with several

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
of the brain stand it deals with several
autonomic<00:00:24.480> functions<00:00:24.960> such<00:00:25.199> as<00:00:25.230> breathing

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
autonomic functions such as breathing

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
autonomic functions such as breathing
and<00:00:26.010> blood<00:00:26.580> pressure
