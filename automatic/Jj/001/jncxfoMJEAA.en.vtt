00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
starting in the last few years our

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.890 
starting in the last few years our
tradition<00:04:47.070> has<00:04:47.220> been<00:04:47.430> you<00:04:47.910> know<00:04:48.090> since<00:04:48.479> Sharif

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.110 
tradition has been you know since Sharif
you<00:04:49.199> know<00:04:49.349> says<00:04:49.620> Doug<00:04:49.860> lipson<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.760> know<00:04:50.910> been

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
you know says Doug lipson you know been

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.180 
you know says Doug lipson you know been
here<00:04:51.360> so<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:51.900> think<00:04:52.080> we<00:04:52.380> have<00:04:52.410> a<00:04:52.590> tradition<00:04:52.800> and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
here so I think we have a tradition and

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.890 
here so I think we have a tradition and
along<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.490> tradition<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:53.940> I<00:04:54.000> think<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.479> we

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
along the tradition so I think that we

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.510 
along the tradition so I think that we
should<00:04:54.930> be<00:04:55.199> more<00:04:55.620> determined<00:04:56.159> than<00:04:56.220> they<00:04:56.370> are

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
should be more determined than they are

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.909 
should be more determined than they are
but<00:04:56.940> we<00:04:57.060> will<00:04:57.150> see<00:04:57.300> tomorrow<00:04:57.500> are<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.650> getting
