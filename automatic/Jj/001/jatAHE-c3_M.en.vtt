much<00:03:34.840> time<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.170> think<00:03:35.320> about<00:03:35.560> it<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:36.010> i

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
much time to think about it and i

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.480 
much time to think about it and i

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:42.240 
probably i might have enjoyed that
process<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.150> little<00:03:40.270> bit<00:03:40.390> more<00:03:40.830> because<00:03:41.830> i<00:03:42.010> just

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
process a little bit more because i just

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.930 
process a little bit more because i just
had<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.460> do<00:03:42.580> it<00:03:42.610> and<00:03:42.970> i<00:03:43.390> was<00:03:43.540> younger<00:03:44.250> and<00:03:45.250> when
