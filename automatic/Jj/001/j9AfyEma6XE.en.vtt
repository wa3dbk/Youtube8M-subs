to either donate to the museum and then
the<00:01:11.250> other<00:01:11.369> thing<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.850> do<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.689> my<00:01:12.720> stuff<00:01:13.080> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
get lost bells because I have a pretty

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.380 
get lost bells because I have a pretty
big<00:01:18.600> Dutch<00:01:18.810> paving<00:01:19.320> raccoon<00:01:19.740> mafia<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.700> that

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
big Dutch paving raccoon mafia and that

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.510 
big Dutch paving raccoon mafia and that
seems<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.960> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.350> be<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.560> main<00:01:23.130> thing<00:01:23.400> if

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
seems to kind of be the main thing if

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.850 
seems to kind of be the main thing if
the<00:01:23.670> game<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.240> paying<00:01:25.080> back<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.560> of<00:01:25.619> your

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the game is just paying back all of your

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.039 
the game is just paying back all of your
debts<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.490> guess<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.090> other<00:01:27.119> big<00:01:27.540> part<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
debts I guess the other big part of the

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.890 
debts I guess the other big part of the
game<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.860> decorate<00:01:29.850> your<00:01:29.970> house<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.600> the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.880 
kind of furniture that you like it's one
of<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> main<00:01:33.299> reasons<00:01:33.750> why<00:01:33.900> turn<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.619> game<00:01:34.740> on

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
of the main reasons why turn the game on

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
of the main reasons why turn the game on
each<00:01:35.070> day<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.970> check<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.750> shops<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
each day is to check out the shops and

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
each day is to check out the shops and
see<00:01:37.380> what<00:01:37.530> new<00:01:37.650> stuff<00:01:37.920> are<00:01:38.220> out<00:01:38.579> there<00:01:38.790> and

see what new stuff are out there and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.390 
see what new stuff are out there and
then<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> also<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:40.590> stuff<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.189> your
