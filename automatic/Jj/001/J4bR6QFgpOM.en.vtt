00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 yes hello youtube i want you today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.250
 explain how to make a flame 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.050
 photographed from a match of the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.300
 Construction is relatively simple 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 For one thing we need our tripod what 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.650
 I've now folded up here at 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.150
 to be able to record in portrait format 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.289
 so we get the flame on 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 best possible on the picture as a background 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 I rather just a small box 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 Taken where I am a black t-shirt 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.360
 slipped over then need one here 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.100
 small increase in the teelicht streichholz 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.980
 with a bracket or something similar to that 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.379
 caress to attach matches 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.120
 of course and for the 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.250
 safety a little bit of water 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.140
 to extinguish 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.410
 I have one on the side 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.270
 The lamp is positioned at height 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.160
 can generally be adjusted by the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.070
 Illumination is very practical 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.109
 because you have some light effects in it 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.579
 smoke can still do if you have 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.140
 can you have an external lightning on the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.489
 page either from the top of 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.019
 diagonally from the side or similar 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.290
 flash that would have to try 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.479
 we charged you with the effects 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.540
 next we will come to the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.330
 camera settings so the 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.770
 Camera settings run as follows 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.030
 take back our mode m 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 I have a worth of the exposure time 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.210
 chosen from a 210 second one 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.630
 Density of f5 6 and an iso value 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.299
 from 400 at the canon we have the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.119
 possibility in which we here on the picture 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.860
 on the plus magnifier press the fields 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.159
 to select individually that is insofar 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.829
 practically the camera uses normally 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 all if we are in large format 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.460
 take pictures of what we want right now 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.740
 have only one option before 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.750
 We want to focus and we want our heads 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.920
 to touch a match as a book 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:01.829
 So let's say if we are the camera 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.840
 have overturned by our point 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.609
 as a focal point 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.119
 We confirm that again by one 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.099
 pressure on that plus now he takes this 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.470
 just this one this one no 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:21.349
 falls that we see down there in the will 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:27.170
 only the left one is selected give me that 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:28.790
 Camera is good with me again 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.319
 problem i have no live view this 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.150
 is it I can only through the viewfinder 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.750
 focus and not over into mobile 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 i focus on service display 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.299
 Now upside down from the match 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.739
 then I choose the camera from 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:50.209
 autofocus also manually with the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.799
 attitude for a persists 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.629
 and second, that he will not be back 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.269
 new tries to focus if we 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.280
 we want to trigger quickly and 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:00.230
 then it does not help us find a camera 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.260
 wants to focus over already because 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.120
 it costs us time and the picture is not 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.359
 how do we want to trigger the whole thing there 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.639
 we have two options for one 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:13.700
 if we go to the three windows with 

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:17.989
 currently only then we come to the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.560
 drive mode and you can go around afar 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.739
 selection then remote control is the 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.380
 Trigger off when we have the remote control 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:30.200
 trigger or in my case has me 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:33.169
 Now here's a shot taken 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.220
 At the time of his difficult the photo too 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:40.190
 get when the flame triggers off 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.870
 therefore we need a lot of photos and also 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.370
 times just once that the right image 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.780
 is 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.250
 and you have to try that for yourself 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.209
 You either like it better 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.450
 remote control or the rhine recording so 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:58.459
 and then get started 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:02.950
 Now finally I can do the position 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.950
 that means we are relatively over it 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:21.289
 Now I have to wait until the flame resp 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:21.289
 the match ignites down 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.240
 this could take a while 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:28.620
 It will also take a few tries 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.539
 and if I think so and one 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.729
 There's little prank then 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:37.280
 to see the head 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:37.280
 then I can easily trigger 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.280
 result we see here 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:54.190
 I will try again 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.910
 will be needed because couple but it's worth it 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.160
 in any case 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.480
 I wish you much fun and I hope 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.060
 could you guys with this video a few 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.740
 give tips if you ask or 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.850
 Just have comments in the 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.660
 Comments 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.660
 You know what I mean
