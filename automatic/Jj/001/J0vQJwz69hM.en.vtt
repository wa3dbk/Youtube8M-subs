00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
your mastery into Dodge and parry to go

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.910 
your mastery into Dodge and parry to go

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
back to more avoidance because those

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.550 
back to more avoidance because those
block<00:03:48.190> all<00:03:48.459> damage<00:03:48.850> and<00:03:49.090> actually<00:03:49.780> blocking<00:03:50.380> I

block all damage and actually blocking I

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.949 
block all damage and actually blocking I
think<00:03:51.310> only<00:03:51.489> reduces<00:03:52.060> damage<00:03:52.300> by<00:03:52.810> 30%<00:03:54.959> now

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
