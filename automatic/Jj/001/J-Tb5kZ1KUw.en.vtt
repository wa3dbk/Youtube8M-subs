00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.030
 hello friends welcome you to

 channel carpenter unclean and yuri primachenko 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.300
 today you will see an extreme series of 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 door video 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.960
 I want to say only one thing I do the door 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.210
 since I showed it to me it does not mean that 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.600
 you should do the same for everyone 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 of joiners my ways and tricks i will 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 glad if you just draw 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.020
 some useful information from these 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.550
 videos for yourself thank you so much for 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.550
 what are you watching my channel 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.840
 setting the door we 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:10.870
 wedging it at the door without a password video 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.800
 here is a vodka line below me above 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:18.630
 right to left and top down wedge and 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.729
 pounding the door 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:27.900
 then this is all for a penny you this foam 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.970
 foam bottom strut 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.880
 worth 2 without thresholds if there is a threshold 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:38.500
 axes hold and and middle strut 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:43.240
 which doesn't give a penny to take out the cereal here 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.320
 how are we working when installing the door 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.960
 nothing complicated here the main one 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.990
 side short put on level 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.509
 Well, there already come with at least this 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:00.069
 according to the place to put depending on the walls as 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:02.679
 the walls are not always smooth but it 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.990
 the doors are already installed on that 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.190
 own seats 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:17.090
 fitted to the opening and so this door 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:21.570
 but this is all but that door is deaf 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:25.830
 leads from room to corridor and also means 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.810
 on this side the frames are fixed on 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.990
 an ear 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:35.400
 here we open this door 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:38.430
 quarter-stripped lock 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.190
 a quarter depth of 24 millimeters 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:47.510
 with an unexpected 24 depth of 10 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:51.330
 millimeters and here's a quarter formed 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.020
 the box itself and these complicated ones 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.760
 such platbands 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.800
 probably repeat but similar 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.760
 door decoration includes something 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:11.700
 about twenty three elements on one 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:15.660
 aside now we will see this door from 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.260
 side of the corridor means these are installed 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.230
 the doors were about a year ago 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.810
 repairs still in this house are not finished but 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.590
 here are no nuances 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.890
 with these doors did not happen but it 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.790
 reverse platbands they are fixed on 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.130
 screws true 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.350
 there will still be installed such 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.360
 plastic rips which 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.120
 in fact , the color will be almost 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.500
 match the background of the door and close and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.440
 totally believe in this apartment we did 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.440
 several such doors and here 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:04:04.549
 these are the doors I told you about 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:09.650
 during all previous videos 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:18.310
 one more door of similar type made they 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:18.310
 larch painted chestnut color 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.530
 such locks are installed on them 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.550
 but the false stained glass made but that 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.990
 engaged directly 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.150
 the customer who made this forged rush 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:49.440
 Well, another option somewhere a little 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:51.830
 forgiven somewhere complicated in general here are 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:55.490
 the doors 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.490
 we did 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:16.500
 so the entrance door is double with a frame 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:21.220
 box about 60 centimeters wide 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:26.410
 this take 8 years Believe 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.830
 no special damage to drying 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.050
 there is nothing in it but if we take into account 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.300
 only scratches that for eight years 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.910
 formed from the keys amount when here 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.410
 open the tree a little see here 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.640
 here because there the light falls badly and I 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:46.500
 show more here on this door 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.960
 canvas on the second looking door leaf 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:55.350
 everything is absolutely 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.350
 regularly for eight years of operation 

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.360
 only a little bit on some part 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.500
 millimeter can be seen here 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:13.090
 slightly shrink the box and made 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:18.240
 shkanty these doors I do for the one 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:25.090
