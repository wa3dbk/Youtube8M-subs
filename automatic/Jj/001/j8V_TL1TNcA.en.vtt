has<00:03:38.320> illuminated<00:03:38.850> aniconism<00:03:39.850> so<00:03:41.310> there

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
has illuminated aniconism so there

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.760 
has illuminated aniconism so there
that's<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.700> simplest<00:03:43.090> way<00:03:43.209> we<00:03:43.540> can<00:03:43.780> go<00:03:44.590> along

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
that's the simplest way we can go along

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.050 
that's the simplest way we can go along
the<00:03:44.830> song<00:03:45.100> and<00:03:45.250> we<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.520> sing<00:03:45.760> it
