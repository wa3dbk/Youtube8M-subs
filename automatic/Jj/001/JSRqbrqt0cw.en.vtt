okay<00:00:22.930> so<00:00:22.989> use<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.220> allen<00:00:24.520> key<00:00:25.000> or<00:00:25.239> in<00:00:25.750> bus<00:00:26.019> key

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
okay so use the allen key or in bus key

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.679 
okay so use the allen key or in bus key
hexagonal<00:00:27.880> key<00:00:28.210> in<00:00:28.710> these<00:00:29.710> holes<00:00:30.250> on<00:00:30.699> the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
hexagonal key in these holes on the

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.759 
hexagonal key in these holes on the
hinges<00:00:32.199> and<00:00:32.879> rotate<00:00:33.879> up<00:00:34.239> or<00:00:34.780> down<00:00:35.110> to<00:00:35.739> the

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
hinges and rotate up or down to the

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.509 
hinges and rotate up or down to the
right<00:00:36.100> or<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.210> left<00:00:37.650> okay<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:38.980> if<00:00:39.339> you

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
right or to the left okay and if you

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.630 
right or to the left okay and if you
rotate<00:00:39.790> to<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.570> right<00:00:40.720> then<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:42.129> hinge<00:00:42.370> will

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
rotate to the right then the hinge will

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.510 
rotate to the right then the hinge will
be<00:00:42.820> pushed<00:00:43.120> away<00:00:43.329> if<00:00:43.989> you<00:00:44.559> rotate<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.370> left

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
be pushed away if you rotate to the left

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.810 
be pushed away if you rotate to the left
then<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.210> hinge<00:00:46.660> will<00:00:47.020> come<00:00:47.379> closer<00:00:47.829> that<00:00:48.579> is

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
then the hinge will come closer that is

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.470 
then the hinge will come closer that is
to<00:00:49.120> the<00:00:49.300> right<00:00:49.539> and<00:00:50.039> in<00:00:51.039> this<00:00:51.219> case<00:00:51.579> since<00:00:52.300> I

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
to the right and in this case since I

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.590 
to the right and in this case since I
needed<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.320> lower<00:00:53.710> right<00:00:54.430> corner<00:00:54.460> to<00:00:55.420> be

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
needed the lower right corner to be

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.459 
needed the lower right corner to be
raised<00:00:55.930> I<00:00:56.460> pushed<00:00:57.460> away<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:58.390> lower<00:00:58.930> left

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
raised I pushed away the lower left

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.150 
raised I pushed away the lower left
corner<00:00:59.739> that<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:01.269> I<00:01:01.510> rotated<00:01:02.050> it<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.920> right

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
corner that is I rotated it to the right

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.740 
corner that is I rotated it to the right
and<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:04.750> pushed<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.619> upper<00:01:06.160> left<00:01:06.820> corner<00:01:07.210> to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
and I pushed the upper left corner to

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.830 
and I pushed the upper left corner to
the<00:01:08.229> inside<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.429> is<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.759> the<00:01:09.880> left<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.539> that

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
the inside that is to the left and that

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.609 
the inside that is to the left and that
is<00:01:11.110> I<00:01:11.700> unscrewed<00:01:12.700> it<00:01:12.910> to<00:01:13.390> the<00:01:13.539> left<00:01:13.780> and<00:01:14.110> see

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
is I unscrewed it to the left and see

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:24.630 
is I unscrewed it to the left and see
the<00:01:14.770> result<00:01:18.300> just<00:01:19.300> a<00:01:19.539> little<00:01:19.899> bit<00:01:23.160> let's<00:01:24.160> just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
the result just a little bit let's just

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.300 
the result just a little bit let's just
it<00:01:24.819> a<00:01:25.149> little<00:01:25.420> bit<00:01:25.720> more<00:01:25.929> so<00:01:26.770> I'm<00:01:26.950> going<00:01:27.250> to

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
it a little bit more so I'm going to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.029 
it a little bit more so I'm going to
push<00:01:27.700> this<00:01:28.030> one<00:01:28.360> away<00:01:28.599> that<00:01:29.349> is<00:01:29.530> I'm<00:01:29.709> going<00:01:29.739> to

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
push this one away that is I'm going to

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:44.790 
push this one away that is I'm going to
rotate<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:31.149> to<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.509> right<00:01:41.670> okay<00:01:42.670> and<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:44.380> one

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
rotate it to the right okay and this one

00:01:44.800 --> 00:02:03.870 
rotate it to the right okay and this one
to<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.310> left<00:01:49.800> let's<00:01:50.800> see<00:01:51.099> now

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.470 

it's<00:02:04.880> not<00:02:05.120> perfect<00:02:05.690> but<00:02:06.020> it's<00:02:06.200> better<00:02:07.480> put

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
it's not perfect but it's better put

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:25.110 
it's not perfect but it's better put
these<00:02:08.690> little<00:02:09.410> caps<00:02:09.890> back

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.600 

and<00:02:26.120> that's<00:02:26.450> it
