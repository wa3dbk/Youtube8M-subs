00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.540
 to everyone and welcome back to 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.940
 my channel you know guys that my oldest 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.530
 I wish for what I most aspire is that I 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.720
 spend as much as possible watching my 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 videos if you think so 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.980
 minimum possible seeing the things I do 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.199
 the things that I show you everything that 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.480
 I expose and for that reason today has decided 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.769
 three I loved special a video in the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.619
 that I'm going to show you a discovery 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.960
 unpublished why and possibly meditate 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640
 for me personally only because 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.710
 surely there were already people who knew 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.390
 but not me how I found out the other day 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.430
 he was looking forward to the new ones and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.630
 make me interesting not but for 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.030
 put us a little first of all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.860
 Let's travel to black ops your old times 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.600
 drago is that game where you still 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.060
 I enjoyed a post a good backup a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.710
 decent game within what fits and a 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.470
 game that I liked a lot and that's why I 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.270
 I said well let's think about the best 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.280
 black ops streak what was good then 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.930
 obviously for me personally the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 blackbird possibly for me one of 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.890
 the best runs of the entire saga call 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.990
 of duty not only white and it's a cycle 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.790
 basically a streak of 87 your beans from 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.439
 hard line like in this case it was like 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.570
 you see on the map that showed in everything 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.150
 moment the position and direction 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.190
 before the enemy and then I say 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 this is a super good run you have to 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.760
 be for balls in modern warfare 3 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.200
 because I say so then I think about 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 bali which is what most resembles this 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.400
 good streak so I thought automatically 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 in the advanced place of modern warfare 3 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.760
 you see that it is a vee towards the function 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.310
 from wow see reveal to us the position 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.720
 but that being advanced, it reveals 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.150
 also the address not but in a way 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.670
 periodical needs 23 seconds to 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.110
 update then I say clear this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.810
 it will not be rather the blackberry was all 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.330
 the time and will reveal the position without 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.070
 need for periodicity then we go 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.990
 to combine a couple of lines that we 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.850
 can help that to take place 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.080
 it's worth it in the first place as you can see 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 another is in the knowledge of the drone 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.979
 what it does is rebellion in everything 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.600
 moment the position of the enemy or 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.399
 once we mark an enemy with the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.369
 drone will appear marked for us 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.710
 always on the clear map but you say but 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.090
 clear to see the drone only us 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.649
 indicates the position will not indicate 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.690
 the direction being taken by the enemy 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.450
 ok then I thought about that too 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.890
 evidently and said for later as 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.149
 why do not we combine two gusts because 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.460
 we combine the drone as you are 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.500
 watching this mini helicopter on screen 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.360
 high-tech because I do not 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.950
 we combine with the advanced what will happen 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.270
 now you are going to see what happens, we mark nothing 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.680
 first to the enemies four enemies 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.390
 frame here to show us what 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.610
 we keep control in two marked 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.410
 what we do now or just launch 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.520
 then home what are you seeing 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.100
 fix and half mom please 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.860
 gentlemen now that I'm going to bring it closer is 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.240
 that the enemies that have been marked 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.620
 previously with the helicopter are 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.820
 automatically leaving all the time in 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 the map is worth can zoom the image 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.410
 so you can see it better as you see 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.090
 see if there are 23 enemies that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.880
 there are marked exclusively with the 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.160
 helicopter are appearing all around 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.540
 the time in the mini map worth let's see 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.580
 another case as you are seeing there are three 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.080
 specifically in which I have combined 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
 has not been marked first with the 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.780
 helicopter and then on about it 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.160
 has advanced then clear you will say vale 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.170
 it works like the black see but it's a 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.880
 streak a little restricted to see is not going to 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.770
 do the same function as Rabbin the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.840
 brandishing did not solve a minute or a half 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.520
 minute 40 seconds I do not remember 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.490
 this streak this combination of gusts 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.260
 just good is going to be useful in the 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.030
 moment when you kill until the in 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.410
 the moment you mothers to the 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.670
 that you have marked worth once you kill 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.110
 those people 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.760
 we have marked the streak 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.800
 will end up recommending using this 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.900
 combination to make it more effective already 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.550
 which lacks efficacy is I recommend 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.930
 about his position in a friend is worth a 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.730
 that is put inside the recognition 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.290
 that you already use it because it gives you 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.420
 many points and the other to be put 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.730
 something advanced, you are going to combine it 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.959
 between the two if those good gusts 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.670
 Well then you go if you are going combining 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.739
 taking out black bird conti our 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.750
 best will last 10 20 seconds 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.340
 continuous and so good here is 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.510
 any place but you liked a 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.510
 greeting to several
