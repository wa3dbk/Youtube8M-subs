00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
ball-joint and can go all the way around

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.540 
ball-joint and can go all the way around
can<00:02:40.880> go<00:02:41.000> up<00:02:41.530> down<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:44.600> waist<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.190> a<00:02:46.220> swivel

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
can go up down the waist is on a swivel

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.750 
can go up down the waist is on a swivel
and<00:02:47.230> also<00:02:48.230> moves<00:02:48.470> down<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.280> up<00:02:51.220> her<00:02:52.220> legs<00:02:52.490> can

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
go up forward back bends two places at

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.730 
go up forward back bends two places at
the<00:02:57.800> knee<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:59.660> swivel<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.590> think<00:03:02.470> yeah<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.530> could

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 
the knee can swivel I think yeah I could

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.460 
the knee can swivel I think yeah I could
sue<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.610> just<00:03:04.940> don't<00:03:05.210> want<00:03:05.330> to<00:03:05.540> force<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
sue but I just don't want to force the

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:13.150 
sue but I just don't want to force the
going<00:03:06.770> the<00:03:08.770> foot<00:03:09.910> has<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.970> pivot<00:03:11.800> or<00:03:12.800> it<00:03:12.980> has<00:03:13.130> a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
going the foot has a pivot or it has a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.199 
going the foot has a pivot or it has a
swivel<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:18.080> could<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:18.440> hold<00:03:18.590> right<00:03:18.860> here

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
swivel and it could to hold right here

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:25.600 
swivel and it could to hold right here
and<00:03:20.650> also<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.190> bends<00:03:22.580> at<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.850> toe<00:03:24.280> so<00:03:25.280> great

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
and also it bends at the toe so great

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.260 
and also it bends at the toe so great
articulation<00:03:26.000> with<00:03:26.630> this<00:03:26.810> figure<00:03:28.150> like<00:03:29.150> I

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
articulation with this figure like I

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.320 
articulation with this figure like I
said<00:03:29.480> before<00:03:29.630> it's<00:03:29.930> kind<00:03:30.170> of<00:03:30.230> fragile<00:03:31.330> it

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
said before it's kind of fragile it

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.630 
said before it's kind of fragile it
comes<00:03:32.690> with<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.930> separate<00:03:33.470> head<00:03:34.270> but<00:03:35.270> my<00:03:36.640> head

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
comes with a separate head but my head

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.390 
comes with a separate head but my head
seems<00:03:38.120> very<00:03:39.110> fragile<00:03:39.680> so<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:40.010> don't<00:03:40.160> want<00:03:40.310> to

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
seems very fragile so you don't want to

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.800 
seems very fragile so you don't want to
move<00:03:40.580> her<00:03:40.730> head<00:03:40.940> too<00:03:41.209> much

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
move her head too much

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.580 
move her head too much
at<00:03:41.990> least<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.440> mine<00:03:43.160> anyway<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:44.350> kind<00:03:45.350> of<00:03:45.410> feel

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
at least on mine anyway I kind of feel

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.550 
at least on mine anyway I kind of feel
like<00:03:45.740> if<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.070> if<00:03:46.580> I<00:03:46.790> pop<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.330> out<00:03:47.540> that<00:03:48.170> I<00:03:48.200> won't
