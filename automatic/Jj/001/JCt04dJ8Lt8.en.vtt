systems out there it doesn't have two

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.259 
systems out there it doesn't have two
different<00:02:05.900> power<00:02:06.049> supplies<00:02:06.290> for<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:07.269> blue

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
different power supplies for the blue

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.080 
different power supplies for the blue
LED<00:02:08.450> and<00:02:08.959> the<00:02:09.080> white<00:02:09.259> LED<00:02:09.739> so<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.459> have<00:02:10.969> to

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
LED and the white LED so you have to

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.929 
LED and the white LED so you have to
manually<00:02:11.450> switch<00:02:11.840> between<00:02:12.079> the<00:02:12.499> two<00:02:12.739> this<00:02:13.579> is

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:13.939 
manually switch between the two this is

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:15.220 
manually switch between the two this is
not<00:02:14.150> really<00:02:14.389> a<00:02:14.420> gripe<00:02:14.689> for<00:02:14.870> this<00:02:14.989> price

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
not really a gripe for this price

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.140 
not really a gripe for this price
strange<00:02:15.530> but<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.400> would<00:02:16.640> have<00:02:16.730> been<00:02:16.849> nice<00:02:17.120> if

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
strange but it would have been nice if

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.850 
strange but it would have been nice if
you<00:02:17.540> could<00:02:17.750> have<00:02:17.840> had<00:02:18.050> two<00:02:18.500> different<00:02:18.739> power

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
you could have had two different power

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.289 
you could have had two different power
supplies<00:02:19.069> and<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.519> could<00:02:19.700> put<00:02:19.909> set<00:02:20.090> them<00:02:20.239> on

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
supplies and you could put set them on

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.940 
supplies and you could put set them on
timer<00:02:20.750> so<00:02:20.989> you<00:02:21.019> wouldn't<00:02:21.319> have<00:02:21.409> to<00:02:21.590> manually

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
timer so you wouldn't have to manually

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.100 
timer so you wouldn't have to manually
turn<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.489> and<00:02:22.670> set<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.120> timer<00:02:23.420> for<00:02:23.720> yourself

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
turn it and set the timer for yourself

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.000 
turn it and set the timer for yourself
so<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:24.580> remembered<00:02:26.200> another<00:02:27.200> gripe<00:02:27.769> is

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
so you remembered another gripe is

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.869 
so you remembered another gripe is
because<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.849> the<00:02:29.000> full<00:02:29.209> glass<00:02:29.569> top<00:02:30.879> when

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
because of the full glass top when

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.660 
because of the full glass top when
you're<00:02:32.000> trying<00:02:32.180> to<00:02:33.040> clean<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.129> gravel<00:02:34.489> siphon

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
you're trying to clean the gravel siphon

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.449 
you're trying to clean the gravel siphon
the<00:02:34.819> gravel<00:02:35.440> it's<00:02:36.440> it's<00:02:37.069> more<00:02:37.250> difficult

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
the gravel it's it's more difficult

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.309 
the gravel it's it's more difficult
because<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.030> it's<00:02:38.599> kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:38.900> hard<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.140> get

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
because you it's kind of hard to get

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.970 
because you it's kind of hard to get
certain<00:02:39.709> angles<00:02:40.099> to<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> gravel<00:02:41.890> also<00:02:42.890> if

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
certain angles to the gravel also if

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.759 
certain angles to the gravel also if
you're<00:02:43.160> trying<00:02:43.610> to<00:02:43.730> catch<00:02:44.420> your<00:02:44.569> fish<00:02:44.810> to

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
you're trying to catch your fish to

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.830 
you're trying to catch your fish to
transplant<00:02:46.610> them<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.940> another<00:02:47.120> tank<00:02:47.510> it's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
transplant them and another tank it's

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.199 
transplant them and another tank it's
it's<00:02:48.530> very<00:02:48.799> difficult<00:02:49.190> especially<00:02:49.430> if<00:02:50.120> you

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
it's very difficult especially if you

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.250 
it's very difficult especially if you
have<00:02:50.390> small<00:02:50.930> danios<00:02:51.560> and/or<00:02:52.599> tetris<00:02:53.599> because

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
have small danios and/or tetris because

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.979 
have small danios and/or tetris because
they're<00:02:54.410> very<00:02:54.590> small<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.129> very<00:02:55.190> fast<00:02:55.459> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
they're very small and very fast and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.509 
they're very small and very fast and
depending<00:02:56.989> on<00:02:57.049> what<00:02:57.230> net<00:02:57.440> you<00:02:57.560> have<00:02:57.739> it<00:02:58.099> they

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
depending on what net you have it they

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.670 
depending on what net you have it they
can<00:02:58.849> actually<00:02:59.209> be<00:02:59.599> up<00:02:59.780> in<00:02:59.930> these<00:03:00.049> areas<00:03:00.500> right

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
can actually be up in these areas right

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.680 
can actually be up in these areas right
here<00:03:00.890> right<00:03:01.069> at<00:03:01.160> the<00:03:01.220> top<00:03:01.489> and<00:03:01.849> make<00:03:02.359> it<00:03:02.480> very

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
here right at the top and make it very

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.199 
here right at the top and make it very
difficult<00:03:02.930> for<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.410> catch<00:03:03.680> them<00:03:04.209> my

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
difficult for you to catch them my

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.150 
difficult for you to catch them my
suggestion<00:03:05.720> for<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:05.989> if<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.319> do<00:03:06.470> do<00:03:06.620> that<00:03:06.799> is

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
suggestion for the if you do do that is

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.759 
suggestion for the if you do do that is
reduce<00:03:07.849> the<00:03:08.000> water<00:03:08.209> as<00:03:08.510> much<00:03:08.540> as<00:03:08.720> much<00:03:09.530> as<00:03:09.560> you

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
reduce the water as much as much as you

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.110 
reduce the water as much as much as you
can<00:03:09.920> before<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.370> actually<00:03:10.579> try<00:03:10.879> catching

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
can before you actually try catching

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.830 
can before you actually try catching
them<00:03:11.420> okay<00:03:12.170> I<00:03:12.200> would<00:03:12.680> give<00:03:12.829> this<00:03:13.099> tank<00:03:13.459> a<00:03:13.790> 4<00:03:14.720> out

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
them okay I would give this tank a 4 out

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.319 
them okay I would give this tank a 4 out
of<00:03:14.900> 5<00:03:15.079> just<00:03:15.470> because<00:03:16.280> once<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:16.819> have<00:03:16.940> it<00:03:17.090> set

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
of 5 just because once you have it set

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.690 
of 5 just because once you have it set
up<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.780> is<00:03:17.840> absolutely<00:03:18.590> beautiful<00:03:18.709> the<00:03:19.220> LED

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
up it is absolutely beautiful the LED

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.449 
up it is absolutely beautiful the LED
system<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.269> you<00:03:20.359> get<00:03:20.569> does<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> good<00:03:21.889> job<00:03:21.950> of

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
system that you get does a good job of

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.000 
system that you get does a good job of
lighting<00:03:23.359> the<00:03:23.569> tank<00:03:23.840> and<00:03:24.109> it<00:03:24.260> comes<00:03:24.709> with<00:03:24.769> the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
lighting the tank and it comes with the

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.250 
lighting the tank and it comes with the
the<00:03:25.519> moonlight<00:03:25.880> Blues<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.810> filtration

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
the moonlight Blues the filtration

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.140 
the moonlight Blues the filtration
system<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.859> good<00:03:28.040> for<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> good<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.790> the<00:03:28.910> tank

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
system is good for the good of the tank

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.059 
system is good for the good of the tank
and<00:03:29.359> it<00:03:29.599> because<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.260> two-piece<00:03:30.620> intake

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
and it because of the two-piece intake

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:35.500 
and it because of the two-piece intake
and<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.669> stack<00:03:33.609> plastic<00:03:34.609> for<00:03:34.760> your<00:03:35.030> media<00:03:35.299> and
