00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:12.589
 In the first part of the course, we will look closely at each type of change: pre-analysis, 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:18.980
 Analysis and biology. 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.480
 The test results are expected to change. Because before and during the test, we can 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.410
 Never know the "true value" of an analyte. 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.000
 Controlling changes is very close to real for ensuring that every result reported is critical 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.410
 Value as much as possible. Too many changes can lead to wrong patient reports 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.410
 The result of the examination leads to misdiagnosis, incorrect prognosis or inappropriate treatment plan 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:57.059
 For the patient. Frequent reporting of error lab results will be severely reduced 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.430
 Its credibility may lead to responsibility. 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.799
 We will start with pre-analytical variation and why. 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.799
 Analyze the sample before analyzing the changes beforehand. 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.950
 The pre-analytical changes in the three major regions are: patient preparation, specimens 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.599
 Collection, specimen transportation. 

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:34.459
 When preparing a patient to collect specimens, instructions to the patient are required 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:40.719
 Be clear and consistent. The patient should be able to demonstrate understanding 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.990
 Description. 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.590
 For example, many tests require patients to be fast. What the patient needs to know 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.520
 How long is fasting, they should be quick before collecting specimens. 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.359
 Here are two more examples: 

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.849
 Aspirin may incorrectly increase bleeding time. The patient needs to know that she must stop 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:11.550
 The bleeding time test was performed a few days before taking aspirin. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.549
 High levels of vitamin C may cause false urine glucose positives. patient 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:24.549
 Taking too much vitamin C may require stopping before the urinalysis test. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.329
 Adherence to the approved specimen collection procedure is an important control pre-analysis 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:38.329
 variation. The following errors can adversely affect integrity during blood collection 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.069
 Specimen: 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.959
 Put the tourniquet in the arm, and the ankle or foot will be too long to cause some elevation. 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.590
 Analyte. 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.530
 The location of the patient, drawn as a blood sample, can also cause changes. for 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:02.859
 For example, blood that is collected when you have your own outpatient sitting can be valuable. 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:09.640
 5% higher than their average inpatients 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.879
 Lying down to collect blood. 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.780
 Testing with an anti-coagulant containing an incorrect collection tube can cause errors 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.780
 result. For example, a light gray top collection tube contains sodium and potassium fluoride 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.010
 Oxalic acid; a substance that preserves glucose. If different anticoagulants are used lower 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.590
 Glucose levels can be reported. 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.659
 Hemolysis, red blood cell damage, can lead to an increase in certain analytes 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:51.359
 As the red blood cell component leaks into the surrounding fluid. This can also cause interference 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:56.989
 In a test using, for example, spectrophotometry. 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.540
 Other changes that may affect the results of the pre-analysis are sample problems 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.139
 transport. 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:12.779
 Cellular metabolism within the sample continues to be collected. If there is an important one 

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:18.930
 Delayed delivery, or for some analytes, samples are shipped at the wrong temperature, 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.949
 May have a significant impact on the results. 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.720
 Using a good quality assurance program can help control pre-analytical changes. When 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.259
 Control, this type of change can be negligible; little contribution to the overall 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:31.650
 The change in results. 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.039
 Using a good quality assurance program can help control pre-analytical changes. When 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.160
 Control, this type of change can be negligible; little contribution to the overall 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.139
 The change in results. 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.550
 Let us review the pre-analytical changes we have learned. 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.550
 The pre-analytical change is any change that occurs before the sample is analyzed. 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 The pre-analytical changes in the three major regions are: patient preparation, specimens 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.419
 Collection, specimen transportation. 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:13.419
 Pre-analytical variation can be and should be controlled.
