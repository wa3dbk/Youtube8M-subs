00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.440
 how are you welcome to your channel 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.960
 cooking homemade style my name is 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.579
 irene this is my first video on the day of 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.949
 Today I will be preparing some delicious 

00:00:18.579 --> 00:00:22.689
 Crispy potato pancakes if you want 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.210
 know how I prepare them I do not miss 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:27.339
 this video we started we were 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.310
 needing more or less we go to the thread of 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:32.379
 range three or four tablespoons of bread 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.940
 ground three tablespoons also of starch 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.350
 of corn in this case I'm using 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.350
 of the cornstarch brand 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.880
 salt to taste 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:46.250
 and enough oil to fry and 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.540
 we have the water in a pot we're going to 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.870
 throw the potatoes to boil that is 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.640
 they are well cooked in this case the 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.650
 potatoes are small, that's why I'm going to 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 throw like that but if they were in a 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.090
 larger size as I would explain it in 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.510
 several pieces to make it more 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.340
 quick cooking ok here we have them 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.270
 let's let them sew well with 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.270
 little chairs and now that he has returned 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.760
 well it has already happened like 40 minutes 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.170
 approximately and my parents are already 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.620
 how do I know they are already because 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.010
 I insert a knife and it enters with 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.010
 a lot of ease 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.700
 if they take a little bit if they wanted 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.980
 speed up the cooking time 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.050
 we could do it in the express way is 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.990
 easier but good I art I did it like that 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.420
 Now what remains to do what you want 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.910
 to make is to strain them and let them cool 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 because so that the potato cakes do not 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.080
 you fall apart you have to leave 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.400
 that the potato cools well from what 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.440
 otherwise if you do it with the potato 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.840
 hot or what you try you're going to 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.159
 disrupt and then we will strain the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.590
 I'm going to let it 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.179
 well my dad is already cold and he is good 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.939
 to start working 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:02.439
 Now we're going to make you mash, I do not 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.450
 I find my marker so I am 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.450
 doing with one with a little step 

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.280
 standing up to chacarita 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.610
 well the puree is ready 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.620
 let's put the oil to heat 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.330
 that we continue to throw the rest 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.890
 ingredients to the mix we already have 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.140
 our frying pan 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:41.540
 let's pour enough oil to 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.799
 frying the cakes 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.799
 they are going to get a good 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.329
 to our mash now we are going to integrate 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:56.069
 the other ingredients we are going to throw 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:59.640
 that's where we're going to salt our 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:02.329
 our pretty mash of this our 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.329
 cornstarch 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.980
 the ground bread 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.440
 and the bus 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.290
 and with our well-cleaned hands 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.330
 let's start kneading let's 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.900
 integrate everything in a mixture well 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.900
 uniform 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.390
 if we see that we have a little left 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:38.070
 aguadita mixture we will add a 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.070
 little more than ground bread 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.490
 good you have to start doing our 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.920
 our pancakes are going to take 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.480
 a little bit of our mix 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.480
 let's go round the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.069
 they realize the mixture no longer sticks in 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.069
 my hands 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.470
 and you have to throw the oil in this and 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.470
 be at an average temperature 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.759
 that are not very thick I will put 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.759
 same 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:36.010
 this is the basic paper recipe of 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.410
 dad and who bonded with tuna with ham 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.450
 with cheese and then the same as it will do 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.260
 rich but now it is the recipe 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.260
 easy 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.740
 as we realize already started 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.000
 Dora the banks this is the moment 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:52.000
 that we have to flip it 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.930
 It is convenient that we do not go to 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.240
 that is not looking radical the little ears 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.220
 that's when we have to look for them and not 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.840
 they are going to undo us is already there 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.620
 to put them to drain very well not the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.620
 take a grid 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.720
 Well, I finished frying my 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.000
 potato pancakes that's how they look 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.070
 I got 15 pieces of a kilo of 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.130
 potatoes to go there more or less 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:31.280
 doing your calculations and that's how I already 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.699
 it is located I am accompanying it 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.120
 with beans cucumber slices 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:39.650
 tomato and blue we have quoted but 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.660
 it's just a suggestion you 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.539
 can accompany with either rice with 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:46.880
 spaghetti lettuce salad to your liking 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:49.130
