00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.930 
that are placed throughout this actual
seed<00:02:02.590> now<00:02:03.190> there's<00:02:03.369> some<00:02:03.520> thing<00:02:03.670> I<00:02:03.760> want<00:02:03.880> to

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
seed now there's some thing I want to

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.640 
seed now there's some thing I want to
show<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.119> guys<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.720> bottom<00:02:04.900> left<00:02:05.440> and

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
show you guys on the bottom left and

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.230 
show you guys on the bottom left and
this<00:02:05.770> is<00:02:05.830> where<00:02:06.130> I<00:02:06.159> could<00:02:06.400> potentially<00:02:06.700> making

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
this is where I could potentially making

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.220 
this is where I could potentially making
the<00:02:07.900> survival<00:02:08.530> island<00:02:09.099> series<00:02:09.840> start<00:02:10.840> now<00:02:11.200> I

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the survival island series start now I

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.800 
the survival island series start now I
would<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.860> introduce<00:02:12.220> maybe<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.239> chest<00:02:13.629> or

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
would have to introduce maybe a chest or

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.619 
would have to introduce maybe a chest or
something<00:02:14.200> like<00:02:14.319> that<00:02:14.379> because<00:02:15.480> there<00:02:16.480> is<00:02:16.510> no

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
something like that because there is no

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:17.970 
something like that because there is no
trees<00:02:17.109> there<00:02:17.139> is

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
trees there is

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.339 
trees there is
no<00:02:18.340> normal<00:02:18.730> trees<00:02:19.000> in<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:19.450> seed<00:02:19.750> apart<00:02:20.200> from

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
no normal trees in this seed apart from

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.780 
no normal trees in this seed apart from
a<00:02:20.530> jungle<00:02:20.980> and<00:02:21.159> I<00:02:21.190> don't<00:02:21.250> really<00:02:21.580> want<00:02:21.760> to

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
a jungle and I don't really want to

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.479 
a jungle and I don't really want to
start<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.409> survival<00:02:23.409> island<00:02:23.530> series<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.400> a

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
start a survival island series on a

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.729 
start a survival island series on a
jungle<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:25.209> want<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.480> start<00:02:25.690> where<00:02:26.290> it's<00:02:26.470> pretty

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
jungle I want to start where it's pretty

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.289 
jungle I want to start where it's pretty
much<00:02:26.950> hard<00:02:27.280> to<00:02:27.459> do<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.790> need<00:02:27.940> to<00:02:27.970> go<00:02:28.120> in<00:02:28.209> this

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
much hard to do we need to go in this

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.539 
much hard to do we need to go in this
direction<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:29.019> little<00:02:29.620> bit<00:02:29.709> more<00:02:29.920> but<00:02:30.040> look<00:02:30.280> at

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
direction a little bit more but look at

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.149 
direction a little bit more but look at
this<00:02:30.730> island<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.500> completely<00:02:32.500> tiny<00:02:32.830> I

00:02:33.149 --> 00:02:33.159 
this island this is completely tiny I

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:35.539 
this island this is completely tiny I
mean<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> would<00:02:33.909> be<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.090> very<00:02:34.480> very<00:02:34.810> hard

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
mean it would be a very very hard

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.890 
mean it would be a very very hard
survival<00:02:36.549> series<00:02:36.849> to<00:02:37.120> do<00:02:37.330> but<00:02:37.540> I'm<00:02:37.629> willing<00:02:37.870> to

show you the islands are available you

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.839 
show you the islands are available you
can<00:02:55.870> see<00:02:56.049> here<00:02:56.349> it's<00:02:56.709> a<00:02:56.859> massive<00:02:57.370> mooshroom

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
can see here it's a massive mooshroom

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.569 
can see here it's a massive mooshroom
island<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.569> is<00:02:58.690> completely<00:02:59.440> huge<00:03:00.040> this<00:03:00.310> one

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:00.579 
island it is completely huge this one

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.580 
island it is completely huge this one
and<00:03:00.819> again<00:03:01.299> over<00:03:01.450> here<00:03:01.629> these<00:03:02.019> are<00:03:02.170> exactly

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
and again over here these are exactly

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.910 
and again over here these are exactly
the<00:03:02.769> same<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:04.000> now<00:03:04.269> I<00:03:04.540> have<00:03:05.230> checked<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:05.769> it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
the same and now I have checked and it

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.400 
the same and now I have checked and it
does<00:03:06.220> have<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:07.000> stronghold<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.989> I<00:03:08.140> did<00:03:08.379> check

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
does have a stronghold and I did check

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.470 
does have a stronghold and I did check
under<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.099> seat<00:03:09.340> as<00:03:09.519> well<00:03:09.700> there's<00:03:09.970> a<00:03:10.030> lot<00:03:10.269> of

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
under the seat as well there's a lot of

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.449 
under the seat as well there's a lot of
cave<00:03:10.720> systems<00:03:11.260> which<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.650> always<00:03:11.890> good<00:03:12.280> in

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
cave systems which is always good in

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.330 
cave systems which is always good in
seas<00:03:13.000> like<00:03:13.209> this<00:03:13.269> mine<00:03:13.780> shafts<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.739> you<00:03:15.190> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
seas like this mine shafts and you can

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.979 
seas like this mine shafts and you can
see<00:03:15.519> here<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.819> other<00:03:16.060> little<00:03:16.510> section<00:03:16.870> of

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
see here this other little section of

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:17.940 
see here this other little section of
the<00:03:17.079> island<00:03:17.200> that<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:17.500> could<00:03:17.709> use<00:03:17.920> for

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
the island that you could use for

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.640 
the island that you could use for
survival<00:03:18.609> island<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.090> would<00:03:19.269> have<00:03:19.450> to<00:03:19.660> maybe

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
survival island so I would have to maybe

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.379 
survival island so I would have to maybe
using<00:03:21.040> creative<00:03:21.670> something<00:03:21.910> very<00:03:22.269> very

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
using creative something very very

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.479 
using creative something very very
simple<00:03:22.870> like<00:03:22.989> a<00:03:23.019> tree<00:03:23.380> or<00:03:23.650> a<00:03:23.680> sapling<00:03:24.069> and<00:03:24.430> you

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
simple like a tree or a sapling and you

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.460 
simple like a tree or a sapling and you
can<00:03:24.639> see<00:03:24.819> here<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.239> is<00:03:25.450> the<00:03:25.599> only<00:03:25.840> jungle

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
can see here this is the only jungle

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.770 
can see here this is the only jungle
biome<00:03:26.980> available<00:03:27.760> on<00:03:27.940> this<00:03:28.180> sea<00:03:28.389> but<00:03:28.569> again

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
biome available on this sea but again

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.390 
biome available on this sea but again
it's<00:03:28.989> not<00:03:29.169> exactly<00:03:29.590> vast<00:03:29.919> though<00:03:30.130> although

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
it's not exactly vast though although

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.400 
it's not exactly vast though although
you<00:03:30.519> do<00:03:30.700> get<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:30.910> lot<00:03:31.000> of<00:03:31.120> trees<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.630> you<00:03:32.260> could

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
you do get a lot of trees and you could

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.930 
you do get a lot of trees and you could
probably<00:03:32.530> start<00:03:32.859> a<00:03:32.980> great<00:03:33.130> survival<00:03:33.459> island

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
probably start a great survival island
