00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.910 

something<00:00:30.929> like<00:00:31.489> 160,000<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.030> UK<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:34.860> was

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
something like 160,000 in the UK it was

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.650

the<00:00:39.960> Sinclair<00:00:40.559> spectrum<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:41.550> got<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.730> 6502

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the Sinclair spectrum it's got a 6502

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500 
the Sinclair spectrum it's got a 6502
processor<00:00:42.860> which<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:43.890> sometimes<00:00:44.700> regarded<00:00:45.210> as

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
processor which is sometimes regarded as

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
processor which is sometimes regarded as
being<00:00:45.719> less<00:00:45.960> powerful<00:00:46.530> than<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> said<00:00:47.010> 80

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
being less powerful than the said 80

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
being less powerful than the said 80
that<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> spectrum<00:00:48.329> but<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.140> also

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
that was in the spectrum but this also

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.990 
that was in the spectrum but this also
had<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.860> custom<00:00:50.780> graphics<00:00:51.780> and<00:00:52.020> sound<00:00:52.350> chip

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
had a custom graphics and sound chip

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.560 
had a custom graphics and sound chip
that<00:00:54.559> supposedly<00:00:55.559> gives<00:00:55.890> superior<00:00:56.570> graphics

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
that supposedly gives superior graphics

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.420 
that supposedly gives superior graphics
and<00:00:57.780> sounds<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> spectrum<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.829> have<00:00:59.250> only

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
and sounds of the spectrum I have only

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.090 
and sounds of the spectrum I have only
played<00:00:59.550> two<00:01:00.120> games<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.719> this<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> don't<00:01:01.859> know

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
played two games on this so I don't know

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
played two games on this so I don't know
if<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.399> true<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.120> experience<00:01:03.600> of

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
if that's true but my experience of

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
if that's true but my experience of
those<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.140> games<00:01:04.350> is<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.650> they<00:01:04.830> were<00:01:05.040> bloody

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
those two games is that they were bloody

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.179 
those two games is that they were bloody
awful<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.420> vastly<00:01:07.260> inferior<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
awful and vastly inferior to the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.740 
awful and vastly inferior to the
spectrum<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.000> may<00:01:09.180> just<00:01:09.210> be<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> they

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
spectrum but there may just be that they

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.190 
spectrum but there may just be that they
were<00:01:09.810> bad<00:01:10.020> games<00:01:10.610> most<00:01:11.610> notable<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.960> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
were bad games most notable on this is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
were bad games most notable on this is
the<00:01:13.500> keyboard<00:01:14.150> listen<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:17.390> it's<00:01:19.430> it<00:01:20.430> was

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the keyboard listen to this it's it was

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
the keyboard listen to this it's it was
supposed<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.659> superior<00:01:22.140> keyboard<00:01:22.740> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
supposed to be a superior keyboard to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.080 
supposed to be a superior keyboard to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
plastic they're fairly hard plastic I

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.580 
plastic they're fairly hard plastic I
guess<00:01:44.840> they're<00:01:45.840> just<00:01:46.020> horrible

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
guess they're just horrible

the<00:01:46.890> only<00:01:47.100> keyboard<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> any<00:01:48.000> computer<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.600> can

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the only keyboard on any computer I can

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.539 
the only keyboard on any computer I can
think<00:01:49.020> of<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.439> less<00:01:49.770> responsive<00:01:50.399> than

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think of that is less responsive than

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.210 
think of that is less responsive than
this<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.970> there's<00:01:51.479> EDX<00:01:51.780> 81<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.100> I'd

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
this is there's EDX 81 and I think I'd

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.980 
this is there's EDX 81 and I think I'd
still<00:01:53.520> rather<00:01:53.729> use<00:01:54.060> one<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.479> than<00:01:54.750> one<00:01:54.869> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
still rather use one of them than one of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.670 
still rather use one of them than one of
these<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.219> back<00:01:56.479> we<00:01:57.479> have<00:01:57.810> got<00:01:57.840> RF<00:01:58.799> out

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
these on the back we have got RF out

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
these on the back we have got RF out
audio<00:02:01.680> lead<00:02:01.890> socket<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.689> monitor<00:02:04.619> out<00:02:05.189> and

I<00:02:05.939> don't<00:02:06.000> know<00:02:06.210> which<00:02:06.390> is<00:02:06.540> which<00:02:06.780> because<00:02:07.590> I

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
I don't know which is which because I

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.589 
I don't know which is which because I
can't<00:02:08.099> remember<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:09.090> haven't<00:02:09.390> got<00:02:09.479> the

appropriate leads on me to check
this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.940> apparently<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.020> sentronics<00:02:13.950> printer

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
this is apparently a sentronics printer

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
system on these it runs basic as most

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.610 
system on these it runs basic as most
computers<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.910> time<00:02:39.000> did<00:02:39.390> but<00:02:39.870> this<00:02:40.050> had<00:02:40.590> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
computers of the time did but this had a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.580 
computers of the time did but this had a
bug<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.700> wrong<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.750> basically<00:02:43.260> man<00:02:43.440> if

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
bug in the wrong that basically man if

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.310 
bug in the wrong that basically man if
you<00:02:43.710> wrote<00:02:43.980> your<00:02:44.160> own<00:02:44.190> program<00:02:44.990> saved<00:02:45.990> it<00:02:46.170> to

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
you wrote your own program saved it to

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.250 
you wrote your own program saved it to
tape<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.950> tried<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> load<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.330> back<00:02:48.510> again<00:02:48.840> it

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
tape I tried to load it back again it

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.060 
tape I tried to load it back again it
very<00:02:49.650> likely<00:02:50.040> wouldn't<00:02:50.520> work<00:02:51.170> I<00:02:52.170> believe<00:02:52.680> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
very likely wouldn't work I believe it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.860 
very likely wouldn't work I believe it
was<00:02:53.160> just<00:02:53.430> really<00:02:53.670> really<00:02:53.850> critical<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
was just really really critical of the

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.580 
was just really really critical of the
volume<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.950> had<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:57.350> may<00:02:58.350> not<00:02:58.530> even

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
volume that you had it that may not even

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.320 
volume that you had it that may not even
be<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.280> yeah<00:02:59.550> they<00:02:59.850> were<00:02:59.910> very<00:03:00.180> very

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
be that but yeah they were very very

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.890 
be that but yeah they were very very
unreliable<00:03:01.110> for<00:03:01.650> saving<00:03:02.400> users<00:03:03.060> data

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
unreliable for saving users data

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.740 
unreliable for saving users data
so<00:03:04.860> when<00:03:05.100> apart<00:03:05.880> from<00:03:05.970> playing<00:03:06.090> commercial

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
so when apart from playing commercial

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
so when apart from playing commercial
games<00:03:07.020> you<00:03:07.590> probably<00:03:08.010> wouldn't<00:03:08.400> want<00:03:08.640> one<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
games you probably wouldn't want one of

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.690 
games you probably wouldn't want one of
these<00:03:11.210> yeah<00:03:12.210> yes<00:03:12.930> that's<00:03:13.470> about<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.430> know
