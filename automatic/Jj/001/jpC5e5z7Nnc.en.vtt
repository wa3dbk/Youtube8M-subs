00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
automatically close on its own and there

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.190 
automatically close on its own and there
is<00:02:00.750> nothing<00:02:01.140> else<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.500> need<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.890> do<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:03.200> the

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
second method that I can use to add

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.520 
second method that I can use to add
moisture<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.700> my<00:02:08.940> hair<00:02:09.270> would<00:02:09.989> be<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.910> use<00:02:12.690> mine

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
moisture to my hair would be to use mine

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.420 
moisture to my hair would be to use mine
shower<00:02:14.100> caps<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.880> do<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.510> greenhouse<00:02:16.050> effect

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
shower caps and do the greenhouse effect

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.400 
shower caps and do the greenhouse effect
so<00:02:17.430> if<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.820> wanted<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.510> that<00:02:18.750> what<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.110> would

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
so if I wanted to do that what I would

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.400

so<00:02:37.380> that<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.680> know<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.980> during<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.820> night<00:02:39.000> I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
so that I know that during the night I

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.650 
so that I know that during the night I
would<00:02:39.360> be<00:02:39.630> getting<00:02:39.990> as<00:02:40.170> much<00:02:40.560> heat<00:02:41.660> collecting

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
would be getting as much heat collecting

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.540 
would be getting as much heat collecting
as<00:02:42.810> much<00:02:43.050> body<00:02:43.380> heat<00:02:43.800> as<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> need<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:46.489> open<00:02:47.489> my

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.580 
as much body heat as I need to open my
cuticles<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.540> my<00:02:48.810> hair<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.230> actually

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
cuticles so that my hair can actually

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.949 
cuticles so that my hair can actually
accept<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.160> moisture<00:02:50.700> then<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:51.540> would<00:02:51.720> follow

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
accept that moisture then I would follow

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.140 
accept that moisture then I would follow
