 to change life on the outside we must 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.910
 change inside at the moment when 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.150
 let's get ready, God will start 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.050
 help us and will allow us what

 we need

 have this television space I tell you 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.440
 that if you have excess weight you are obese 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.930

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:50.350
 that obesity brings with it other 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.020

 the moment you can not detect them 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.730
 because in the blood studies it came out 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.620
 all right there's no kind of 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.739
 alteration and then you shield yourself 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:06.430
 saying you're fine clinically without 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:10.300
 However metabolic obesity mind 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.250
 healthy does not exist for that reason because 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:19.090
 do not decide to start a new path 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.030
 which you can understand that for 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.000
 lose weight as I always tell you is not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.620
 question of counting calories or closing 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.690
 the mouth is simply 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.740
 eat with intelligence and if you're 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.370
 doing a treatment to lose weight 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.460
 with a professional is much better because 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.320
 they will be working all those areas 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 confused 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.240
 food education and it's also going 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.430
 to help you decide in the case 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.350
 that is sedentary to perform the 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.540
 daily physical activity 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.439

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.119
 for one hour has run can you do 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.880
 fractionated for example 15 minutes to the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.430
 morning 15 minutes at noon 15 minutes 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.310
 in the afternoon say that it is not necessary that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.230
 be continuous but it is important that 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.420
 aerobic physical activity do not 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.540
 because it's going to help you activate the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.379
 metabolism 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.329
 make a nutritional plan that brings you 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.159
 all the nutritional principles so that 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:29.510
 you do not have to suffer hardships 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.790
 so you can understand that the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.239
 fried foods do not lead you to anything good and 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.650
 that can be replaced by a good 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:42.349
 plate of food without the need to shout 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.959
 and many times there are dishes that you say 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.629
 that rich however have a low 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.260
 fat content that make you 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.269
 you can include weekly and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.319
 you can vary the preparations 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:03:00.620
 so you can not have routine in your 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.650
 dishes of meals and that variety you 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.860
 help whoever prolongs your motivation 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.240

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.300
 make that click on the head and feel that 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:19.570
 nothing is impossible when one presents in 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:23.590
 your mind the goal and leave it there 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.959
 installed and does not let it get away 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.720
 and much more when it implies an increase in 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.040

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.950
 try to cheat yourself of excess weight 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.900

 objective that maybe today you think it was 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:58.670
