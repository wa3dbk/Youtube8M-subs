00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.189 
know this part let's have a look from
the<00:00:13.259> side<00:00:13.910> at<00:00:14.910> first<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.299> course<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.780> row

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the side at first of course we have row

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.400 
the side at first of course we have row

by<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.980> common<00:00:20.660> redstone<00:00:21.660> ye<00:00:22.230> shape<00:00:22.680> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
by this common redstone ye shape you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.089 
by this common redstone ye shape you
might<00:00:23.460> know<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.730> already<00:00:26.840> and<00:00:27.840> on<00:00:28.740> top<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:28.949> have

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
might know it already and on top we have

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.700 
might know it already and on top we have
upside<00:00:29.670> down<00:00:29.789> half<00:00:30.000> slabs<00:00:30.269> because<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.439> buff

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
upside down half slabs because from buff

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.430 
upside down half slabs because from buff
it<00:00:31.890> looks<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.309> normal<00:00:32.669> blocks<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:34.260> also

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it looks like normal blocks and it also

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
it looks like normal blocks and it also
prevents<00:00:34.890> mob<00:00:35.160> spawning<00:00:35.489> which<00:00:36.480> apparently

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
prevents mob spawning which apparently

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.190 
prevents mob spawning which apparently
gets<00:00:37.260> changed<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.489> 1.3<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.600> might<00:00:39.989> want<00:00:40.170> to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
gets changed in 1.3 so you might want to

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.520 
gets changed in 1.3 so you might want to
use<00:00:40.290> other<00:00:40.530> blocks<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.629> of<00:00:42.629> course<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.379> most

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
use other blocks and of course the most

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.240 
use other blocks and of course the most
interesting<00:00:44.070> part<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.360> bats<00:00:45.690> which

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
interesting part in here this bats which

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
interesting part in here this bats which
completely<00:00:47.250> made<00:00:47.520> by<00:00:47.730> panda<00:00:48.210> only<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:49.050> this

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
completely made by panda only for this

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.600 
completely made by panda only for this
machine<00:00:53.539> those<00:00:54.539> blue<00:00:54.870> blocks<00:00:55.610> indirectly

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
machine those blue blocks indirectly

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.459 
machine those blue blocks indirectly
power<00:00:56.850> those<00:00:57.180> sticky<00:00:57.510> pistons<00:00:57.960> and<00:01:00.469> that's

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
power those sticky pistons and that's

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.700 
power those sticky pistons and that's
where<00:01:01.770> our<00:01:01.920> bad<00:01:02.399> effect<00:01:02.670> comes<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.710> as

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
where our bad effect comes from and as

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850 
where our bad effect comes from and as
soon<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.100> one<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> those<00:01:05.670> Pistons<00:01:06.150> updates<00:01:06.860> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
soon as one of those Pistons updates the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
soon as one of those Pistons updates the
signal<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.340> go<00:01:08.490> down<00:01:08.700> yellow<00:01:09.570> line<00:01:10.110> and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
signal will go down yellow line and

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.380 
signal will go down yellow line and
green<00:01:11.010> line<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:13.610> signal<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> yellow

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
green line and signal from the yellow

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.530 
green line and signal from the yellow
line<00:01:15.720> will<00:01:15.990> activate<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:17.310> old<00:01:17.430> floor<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> at

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
line will activate the old floor and at

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.840 
line will activate the old floor and at
the<00:01:18.630> same<00:01:18.810> time<00:01:18.869> deactivate<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.460> array<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the same time deactivate this array of

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.190 
the same time deactivate this array of
torches<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:23.450> therefore<00:01:24.450> stop<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.990> signal

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
torches and therefore stop the signal

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.910 
torches and therefore stop the signal
from<00:01:25.530> me<00:01:25.770> but<00:01:25.890> again<00:01:26.990> also<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.470> signal<00:01:28.799> from

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
from me but again also the signal from

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.719 
from me but again also the signal from
the<00:01:29.009> bots<00:01:29.479> will<00:01:30.479> reset<00:01:31.140> themselves<00:01:31.579> over<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the bots will reset themselves over this

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.840 
the bots will reset themselves over this
green<00:01:33.000> line<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.110> in<00:01:34.259> combination<00:01:34.439> with<00:01:34.850> an

update<00:01:36.240> from<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.930> platform<00:01:37.350> itself<00:01:38.509> might

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
update from the platform itself might

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.010 
update from the platform itself might
sound<00:01:39.780> complicated<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.470> but<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> isn't<00:01:41.189> if

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
sound complicated now but it isn't if

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.990 
sound complicated now but it isn't if
you<00:01:43.020> want<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> rebuild<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.820> just<00:01:44.820> make<00:01:44.970> sure

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you want to rebuild it just make sure

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.399 
you want to rebuild it just make sure
you<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> time<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.049> football's

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you have the time and right football's

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.100 
you have the time and right football's
ends<00:01:47.090> otherwise<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.299> will<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.600> get<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.869> clock

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
ends otherwise you will just get a clock

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.770 
ends otherwise you will just get a clock
in<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:50.040> case<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.460> on<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.119> repeater<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
in this case I have on this repeater to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.840 
in this case I have on this repeater to
tick<00:01:51.960> delay<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.430> tech<00:01:53.610> delay

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
tick delay on this one for tech delay

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.700 
tick delay on this one for tech delay
and<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.270> rest<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> repeaters<00:01:55.049> is<00:01:55.259> always

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
and the rest of the repeaters is always

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.340 
and the rest of the repeaters is always
set<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.159> one<00:01:56.369> tick<00:01:56.659> except<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:57.930> one<00:01:57.990> I

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
set to one tick except for this one I

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.050 
set to one tick except for this one I
don't<00:01:58.829> whine<00:01:59.659> um<00:02:01.399> yeah<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.880> play

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
don't whine um yeah but you can play

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.969 
don't whine um yeah but you can play
around<00:02:03.149> with<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.899> timing<00:02:04.140> may<00:02:04.409> make<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
around with the timing may make it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.730 
around with the timing may make it
faster<00:02:05.430> or<00:02:05.490> slower<00:02:05.700> whatever<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.299> want<00:02:06.740> let's

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
faster or slower whatever you want let's

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.169 
faster or slower whatever you want let's
make<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> quick<00:02:08.160> test<00:02:08.399> run<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.879> fill<00:02:09.060> it

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
make a quick test run I will fill it

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.730 
make a quick test run I will fill it
with<00:02:09.209> ice<00:02:11.000> blocks

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
with ice blocks

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.610 
with ice blocks
that<00:02:13.400> way<00:02:13.580> and<00:02:13.850> as<00:02:14.690> soon<00:02:14.810> as<00:02:14.960> we<00:02:15.080> update<00:02:15.230> one<00:02:15.530> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
that way and as soon as we update one of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:31.060 
that way and as soon as we update one of
those<00:02:15.860> Pistons<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:19.660> ready<00:02:29.590> simple<00:02:30.590> setup<00:02:30.800> but

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
those Pistons and ready simple setup but

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.020 
those Pistons and ready simple setup but
does<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:31.640> work<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:34.520> basically<00:02:34.790> our

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
does it work and that's basically our
