00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 so you can do acrylic 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.080
 it's different but it's still 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.790
 feasible 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:18.690
 once I did that we see the bottom of 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:25.560
 the canvas here so much better he uses the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:28.710
 light glass and yellow truck 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:37.410
 painting on the top and I have some 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:40.460
 marks and December 6 well in summer the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.460
 summer trees 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:04.630
 with a little bit of hands I hear 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:07.520
 pink red and purplish pink 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:10.940
 when we pose it is pure like that and 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.009
 this in red blue and when we stretch 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:18.520
 last rose and I went there change 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.520
 completely 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:35.409
 defense is even here with a little number 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.829
 age 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.270
 this way now here on the side 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.009
 Left at gunpoint work is what 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.319
 that we want just now but we 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.299
 can give an idea a taste of 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:46.719
 what is going to see it and you as only the 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.340
 movement 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:50.950
 the fact that they have a little bit of 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.429
 magenta through the day does not matter 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.759
 very very well there the painting is on the 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:02:02.729
 above one gives no pressure ever 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.729
 I took perso with a strong flu 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.860
 here turn personal water side for him 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.940
 to make grass and work from 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.940
 the grass there 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:45.700
 I always type it that there would be dark 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.160
 of priests but never made peace and 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:59.640
 after doing the painting simply 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:59.640
 than to type like that I always type 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:21.370
 I wanted to keep me it's cisse 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:24.239
 do it's a now just for 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:28.060
 give an idea even before continuing 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:33.730
 I take glass talks about the glass not 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:39.220
 on one side here I take it as 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.790
 it looks on the d6 never been in 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.850
 underneath below to do a background 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.310
 blabla filled but the finish ap / are 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.180
 on it, I 'm just going to be 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:58.060
 here to prevent one to make a good 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:04:00.239
 disc found without hair towards 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.239
 the top
