00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.500
 the right link to the Spieleschmiede 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.990

 start campaign you will find all 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.480

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.140
 youtube-channel hunter and kroon 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.700
 Board games are around now 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.800
 One and a half years we really do that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.540
 lots of convincing we make board game 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.040
 Reviews We make board games news 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 we do board game let's play us 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.100
 have the boardgame club into life 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.110
 So called a real board game 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.030
 show with changing guests board games 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.649
 from a to z through play we drive 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.210
 course to measure like the game in 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.730
 eat like the toy fair in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.780
 Nuremberg is there for you live on the spot 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 fast as possible about new ones 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.460
 to report board games and and and ya 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.500
 and we would like to do more 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.670
 Yes, because despite everything we come 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.110
 somehow still not after 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.939
 everything you wish for everything 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 what comes out and you know 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.630
 Krohn has also started now 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.119
 First, we have to say that the problem is 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.950
 only we do everything here with one 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.930
 single cut computer so far 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.670
 and yes, that's what's at my house 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.990
 simply means I just do the cut 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.000
 work and that is just ours 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.350
 Bottle neck would just be a lot 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.869
 Doing more can be much faster 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.460
 if we have a second cut computer 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.590
 We would have and we would simply 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.119
 happy to help with your help if 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.979
 you could still do something at home 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.380
 while he changes or so then that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.270
 really frozen work then sits 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.500
 you wait for it until the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.939
 balance can run 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:48.540
 do not wait much longer 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.130
 until that reacts what has now 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.960
 if you support us here except that 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.180
 We may be faster and faster in the future 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.829
 we can have better videos 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.420
 of course a whole lot of thank you 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.009
 We have to think about that and now we have to 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.510
 first make a small announcement 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740
 we have yes 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.750
 a little secret made of it 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.570
 bit is on but now it has to be 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.580
 out because we are organizing our own 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.880
 boardgame convention in berlin the 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.850
 berlin boardgame 2015 by hunter and 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.380
 Kroon on the fifth of July will find her 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.100
 instead of in berlin is the first 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.570
 Julie weekend and yes here's the campaign 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.450
 can you for this convention on 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.240
 get support tickets you can do before 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.390
 all very exclusive four vip tickets 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.880
 there you have wardrobe freedom then 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.070
 especially soft drinks and coffee free 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.420
 So many bolts for the whole day 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.190
 flatrate so to speak 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.320
 Also you can totally exclusive to her 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.110
 reserve a table just for you 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.070
 where he is then all day 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.780
 of course, too 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.660
 decide what is being played 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.480
 and yes, just look at you 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.850
 best of all, because of everything for this 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.890
 Convention for different levels there 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.540
 What is very important is this convention 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.430
 is independent of this campaign that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.260
 No matter how it runs here 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.790
 takes place in any case and if we 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980
 now he says cool sounds interesting 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.320
 but crowdfunding is not for me 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.020
 of course we still look forward to it 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.390
 if you just come to convention it 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.270
 becomes a convention what is all there 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.769
 happens program in future also now 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.700
 many more during the campaign 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.769
 give information 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.330
 also here on the campaign page but it 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.670
 will be on our homepage of your own 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.410
 page to enter so easily hold the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.790
 eyes on there are certainly some under 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.989
 Come to these people board game 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.250
 not at all interested in either 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.690
 can not come because they have too much 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.190
 live far away or it does not feel like 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.330
 because they would rather be at home with you 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.860
 your own little tribe group 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.330
 No problem at all we have 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.500
 we are also lots of thank you 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.900
 occupied people just with this 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.610
 industry can not do anything first 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.690
 once the logo of the bridge started 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.090
 was from the known game 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.640

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.709

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.600
 thanks and it logo falls and so well that 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:53.090
 we turn it into the supporter 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.950

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.030
 he gets from 10 euros 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.069

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.079
 limited edition with this of clement 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:03.579

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.909
 you also acquire here 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.159

 several publishers homos are packed 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.079

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:17.440

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.359
 us together 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.919
 let's play that we play 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.840
 if necessary, of course, too 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.150
 put online and you can 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.320
 even sponsor of trade for a year 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.000
 and live if that happens 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.130
 really interested in everyone 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.870
 category and price as we 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.560
 Hope you need something interesting 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.060
 compiled 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.830
 just look at the list 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.570
 time to read carefully through this we 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.759
 hope you will find it somehow 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.349
 and say many many times already 

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.419
 thanks for the support of 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.470
 Mr. Krohn 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.580
 It would be great if it in any case 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.050
 thanks to your help with the cut 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.229
 computer would fold but shows you 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.509
 We would have supported even more 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.919
 there are a few other construction sites 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:55.120
 So yes, we can do something we can do 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.889
 can improve everything is the 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.110
 history with the sound and there goes 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.169
 that's why we really would like to 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.940
 two rise micros at the same time 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:05.620
 use and synonymous in the synonymous 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.039
 record camera directly goes 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.030
 unfortunately only if we have a guardian 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.330
 buy because our camera had 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.830
 unfortunately only a microphone input and the 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.530
 we would simply purchase anyway 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.930
 the support just more 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.580
 reached level and there is about it 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.530
 course still a level and that would be 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.449
 Just then a new camera directly 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.690
 buy semi-professional camcorders 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.099
 We would then lay down because that 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.210
 problem of our chamber is a bit 

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:32.620
 that makes beautiful pictures 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.009
 but it is not so right for him 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:37.180
 designed continuous use and now we where 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:39.159
 also started really long 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.419
 let's play and michael humans sat 

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:43.090
 There are really two hours and have 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:44.289
 others played as it simply hits 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.330
 your limits because that turns off 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:48.580
 just after a certain time off the 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.759
 I can like more than 30 minutes on 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.729
 want to record piece wisely and from 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:56.949
 In addition, the batteries also like to keep up 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:58.719
 so long and that would just be a new one 

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.779
 solve the camera because then they have big 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:03.819
 The batteries can last 500 minutes 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:06.159
 record and then we are just fine 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.259
 also equipped for very long net 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.289
 place yes then all technical 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:12.729
 Problems solved in any case though 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:14.800
 if we are, of course, more 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:16.449
 then we would have support 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.909
 even small dream small dream 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.219
 Play was the big dream and it is 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:22.930
 Of course only a dream but we 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:24.879
 Of course, they would be crazy 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.279
 happy to reach you for cancom and there 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:29.169
 on-site about the latest board games too 

00:06:27.279 --> 00:06:31.659
 The donation is from America 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.399
 most important and biggest fair convention 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:36.430
 to board games and there of course come 

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:38.379
 this whole amis is allowed out when 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.110
 these flightcases and and and and 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:42.969
 The whole thing takes place two months before eating 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.879
 State Yes, we have never been there ourselves 

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:47.469
 As I said it is a dream if now 

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:49.330
 that support does not find an end 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:51.039
 then we would do that then 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.259
 we would give a gift and there 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.149

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.169

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.999
 reach the level then we do that 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:11.589
 Whole and watch what it has in the end 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:13.749

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:18.759
 to reach 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:20.169
 at the end of the campaign or when we will 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.849
