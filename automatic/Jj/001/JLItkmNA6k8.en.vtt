00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
but sometimes I think it might be too

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.560 
environment I'm so pleased I like this
car<00:03:13.190> because<00:03:14.190> alphas<00:03:14.700> are<00:03:14.820> cars<00:03:15.060> that<00:03:15.180> rule

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
car because alphas are cars that rule

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.199 
car because alphas are cars that rule
your<00:03:15.840> heart<00:03:16.140> not<00:03:16.500> your<00:03:16.530> head<00:03:16.760> but<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.970> have<00:03:18.180> a

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
your heart not your head but I have a

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.530 
your heart not your head but I have a
meter<00:03:18.980> could<00:03:19.980> easily<00:03:20.370> rule<00:03:20.850> go

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.199 

so<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.200> Mito<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.799> better<00:03:26.280> price<00:03:26.700> than<00:03:27.060> the

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
so the Mito is better price than the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.990 
so the Mito is better price than the
mini<00:03:27.450> better<00:03:27.930> SPECT<00:03:28.409> and<00:03:28.769> in<00:03:29.579> my<00:03:29.849> opinion

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
mini better SPECT and in my opinion

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.899 
mini better SPECT and in my opinion
better<00:03:30.689> looking<00:03:31.230> it's<00:03:31.860> not<00:03:32.069> better<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:32.730> going

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
better looking it's not better at going

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:37.489 
better looking it's not better at going
round<00:03:33.150> corners<00:03:33.720> but<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.530> lot<00:03:34.980> more<00:03:35.010> fun
