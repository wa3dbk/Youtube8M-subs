00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.960
 attention warning the video you are 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.200
 to view contains scenes of violence 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.510
 extreme insulting blasphemy and any other 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.430
 kind of horror existing on 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.250
 capobastone assumes none 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.190
 responsibility for any half-saws 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.120
 that could be traumatized by 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.480
 this vision 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.150
 hi to all margoni how is everything hopefully going 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.270
 well I decided to throw myself into one 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.780
 fantastic new and exciting 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.809
 adventure 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.059
 many of you will surely know 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.290
 already this program is called 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.170
 garry's mod 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.269
 the garris mod was originally born as one 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.510
 simple mod of half life 2 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:57.699
 later however it became a true cult e 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.610
 just so much that seen the huge 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.220
 success achieved created a version 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.890
 stand alone ie a version that 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.900
 also worked without half life 2 e 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.250
 a lot of characters were created 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.350
 script maps and much more good of god 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.320
 compatible with it I tell you right away that 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.490
 the program is not intuitive and easy to 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.710
 use 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.460
 you have to look at several tutorials e 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.109
 especially to do so many field tests 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.149
 experimenting with the various options before 

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:30.700
 being able to create something beautiful 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.969

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.829

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.719
 leave the yellow outline around the 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.119
 characters but at the same time I think it is 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.179
