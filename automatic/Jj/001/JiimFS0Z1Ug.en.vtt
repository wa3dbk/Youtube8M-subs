00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.730
 cardiovascular is formed by a heart that is a driving pump 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:14.229
 not a lot of channel and asses that are distributed all along the 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:18.460
 fourth arriving at the different tissues in the different cells where 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.369
 circular 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:24.740
 the blood the blood is basically formed in peru the liquid of 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.029
 yellowish color that are called term 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.079
 pieter cells and pans are red blood cells 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.310
 white blood cells and platelets 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.220
 and each of those cells has different functions 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.340
 sometimes for bad blood 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.920
 all blood cells except lymphocytes are formed 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.560
 in the bone marrow in principle how a single type of cell that is 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.590
 very big 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:52.520
 before the dollar 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.440
 and that cell will then be divided giving rise to the different 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.190
 cell types that we know are the red blood cells the blood cells 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.840
 whites and platelets 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.719
 therefore the opposite of what we thought 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.970
 a matured ilm cell 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 pass large mature cells 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.710
 enough already very small 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.770
 the function that red blood cells have that home 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.400
 oxygen and you do not feel in the different tissues and cells of the room 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.850
 the champion of europe have a life 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.430
 and of death as they are dying the red blood cells go 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.850
 forming new ones from the bone marrow 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.260
 maintaining a balance 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.080
 the white devils 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.590
 they have unlike the red blood cells have a nucleus and on the other hand 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.249
 the great 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:48.870
 function that white devils have 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.859
 schedule the organism 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:54.029
 they think there are different invasive agents when we see 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.160
 in a wound 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.720
 are the large number of white blood cells that have died in that battle 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.740
 trying 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.750
 to defend this organism and platelets 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.780
 in the primordial function 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.539
 to take charge in front of or to a body session 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.959
 are the platelets 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.859
 those that are going to be located in that place to form a stopper 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:17.970
 of fibrin 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.409
 youtube that place so that then they are triggered from population process 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.459
 the increase 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.459
 the best you can do for your dog 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.459
 of entry of neoplasms 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.019
 most common the factual mill especially the dog in the data also 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.239
 they happen but 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:41.909
 Beltrán 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.789
 the most common are leukemia 

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:47.839
 i the lymphoma 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 there are differences between one and another 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.229
 clinical signs of the animal 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.630
 when they do not have any more type 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.060
 in general it does not manifest apparent symptoms 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.870
 but this team has proven to be a bar in most cases 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.819
 ask for it 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.819
 with all the controls of the body are in general 

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:13.429
 one size higher sea 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:17.129
 never has a slight signal 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.209
 has a lot of symptoms that are 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.350
 nor specified that one can attribute to Canada 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.150
 in particular, for example, unemployment may be 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.029
 with lack of appetite 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.650
 may present with vomiting 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.099
 diarrhea 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:36.079
 coon tremors 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.189
 with seizures 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.229
 will get 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:42.859
 Holguín Altozano 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.589
 Rosita hundred more in general 

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:48.489
 tobacco a fever 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.849
 and returns paqui returns and scenes 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.369
 kebede of an indeterminate origin 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:57.639
 when these nonspecific symptoms appear that are repeated to 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:03:58.120
 long 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.479
 or of the days and they do not improve with common treatments 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.550
 it is always necessary 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.839
 but mark a blood sample 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:10.430
 because the blood sample is the one that will really indicate for example 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.039
 that the white blood cells 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:19.489
 very elevated eye which are globules that do not belong to a typical typical way 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.620
 wait 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.830
 and this does not happen 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.669
 and the white blood cells are not so normal 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.839
 In general, a bone marrow puncture is required 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.309
 to heal 

00:04:30.309 --> 00:04:36.830
 archetype of the banner we are referring to if it is a myeloid leukemia 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 or it is an impossible leukemia 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.319
 good for him all his life 

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.309
 for max tablets 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.309
 broad spectrum antiparasitic in one shot 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.310
 solfa of misunderstood and syrup 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:56.880
 effective combination for the treatment of cox and leftist gods 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.280
 laboratories which cobos 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.120
 since 1982 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.600
 working for health 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600
 of your pet 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.090
 sometimes the teaching nasa cuca salts 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.670
 found for example in an Argentine blood test 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.400
 so one receives a blood test and seve i want a wolf the whites are 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.539
 increased 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.159
 disproportionate 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:23.569
 so 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.310
 to the naked eye one tends to think 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.999
 that's an infection and that's where you have to be very careful 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.059
 because it is one thing for all white blood cells to increase 

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:37.409
 and another thing done that some particular type 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.789
 the white blood cell that this in large quantity to the mentioned 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.719
 and also have a form that is not normal 

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:50.050
 When there are problems the level of platelets and platelets were the 

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:52.710
 cells responsible for coagulation 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.450
 the symptoms that we are going to observe 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.240
 the animals that we deserve the most attention 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.680
 only that they appear 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:05.039
 petequias and pt who are little red spots that are given especially 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.280
 in the gums 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.169
 that when we 

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:10.969
 we touch does not go away 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:12.539
 appear 

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.349
 ecchymoses that are 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:15.730
 landis spots 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.010
 on the skin 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:21.800
 as if there were many bruises that is indicating to us that in fact some 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.490
 coagulation problem because that huge amount of bruising should not 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:27.290
 Appear 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.939
 in the room there may be collection 

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.249
 in the abdomen with some by special organ 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:35.779
 where a lot of blood gets together 

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.559
 which is also not normal 

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:42.809
 delighted count many times because he pretends that drawing blood is again 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:43.760
 a concession 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.759
 and we'll see it 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.439
 that drive that is made for the blood sample does not clot 

00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.939
 continue to lose blood or see a large bruise 

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.740
 in the place of application and always when a large bruise appears 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:06:59.849
 that disorients us 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.649
 we should think 

00:07:01.649 --> 00:07:04.649
 that there is a problem of coagulation 

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.919
 if it is a problem of coagulation one always means that the dog has 

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.379
 a leukemia 

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:11.939
 but in reverse 

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:15.339
 there is no problem and whenever there is something that is not 

00:07:15.339 --> 00:07:17.620
 within the expected parameters 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.000
 you have to find what it is about
