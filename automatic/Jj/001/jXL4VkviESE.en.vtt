about<00:00:14.099> some<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.460> basics<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.030> truck

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
about some of the basics on truck

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.880 
about some of the basics on truck
aerodynamics<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.080> their<00:00:16.199> impact<00:00:16.500> on<00:00:16.619> fuel

efficiency<00:00:17.010> in<00:00:17.640> part<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.510> we'll<00:00:18.990> examine<00:00:19.289> how

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
efficiency in part two we'll examine how

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
efficiency in part two we'll examine how

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
items such as bug deflectors and Sun

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.640 
items such as bug deflectors and Sun
visors<00:00:21.539> have<00:00:21.689> been<00:00:21.840> designed<00:00:22.140> to<00:00:22.230> mitigate

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
visors have been designed to mitigate

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.050 
visors have been designed to mitigate
their<00:00:22.800> harmful<00:00:23.160> effects<00:00:23.430> on<00:00:23.580> fuel<00:00:23.850> economy

their harmful effects on fuel economy

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.029 
their harmful effects on fuel economy
well<00:00:24.900> obviously<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.410> can<00:00:25.529> tell<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> glance

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
well obviously you can tell it a glance

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.620 
well obviously you can tell it a glance
whether<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.369> truck<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:26.730> aerodynamic<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.449> not

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
whether a truck is aerodynamic or not

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.790 
whether a truck is aerodynamic or not
but<00:00:27.869> then<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.199> right<00:00:28.320> down<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.560> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but then when you get right down to it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.830 
but then when you get right down to it
there<00:00:29.010> are<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> lot<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.310> subtle<00:00:29.789> changes<00:00:30.689> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
there are a lot of subtle changes that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.999 
there are a lot of subtle changes that
have<00:00:30.929> been<00:00:31.019> engineered<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.619> truck<00:00:31.800> right

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
have been engineered in the truck right

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.979 
have been engineered in the truck right
there<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.700> let<00:00:33.000> me<00:00:33.059> let<00:00:33.270> me<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.600> tilt<00:00:33.840> this

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
there are let me let me just tilt this

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.920 
there are let me let me just tilt this
back<00:00:34.050> over<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.149> talk<00:00:36.149> about<00:00:36.360> some<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
back over and talk about some of the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.810 
back over and talk about some of the
rules<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.500> aerodynamics<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.550> there's<00:00:38.700> only

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
rules of aerodynamics and there's only

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.880 
rules of aerodynamics and there's only
three<00:00:39.230> basic<00:00:40.230> rules

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
three basic rules

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.160 
three basic rules
the<00:00:41.129> first<00:00:41.399> one<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.790> attach<00:00:42.300> air<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.719> close<00:00:42.989> to

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the first one is attach air is close to

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.110 
the first one is attach air is close to
the<00:00:43.290> front<00:00:43.469> of<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.710> truck<00:00:43.890> as<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.160> can<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
the front of the truck as you can the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.660 
the front of the truck as you can the
second<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.750> keep<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.260> attached<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.890> far<00:00:47.340> back

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
second is keep it attached as far back

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
second is keep it attached as far back
or<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:48.059> long<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.780> can<00:00:49.050> along<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> top<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
or as long as you can along the top of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.590 
or as long as you can along the top of
the<00:00:50.340> vehicle<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> side<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.480> vehicle

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the vehicle and the side of the vehicle

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.950 
the vehicle and the side of the vehicle
and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.770> third<00:00:53.219> rule<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.960> transition

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and then the third rule is transition

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.260 
and then the third rule is transition
between<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.559> tractor<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.370> trailer<00:00:56.520> as

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
between the tractor and the trailer as

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.810 
between the tractor and the trailer as
quickly<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> as<00:00:58.590> efficiently<00:00:58.920> as<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.460> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
quickly and as efficiently as you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.910 
quickly and as efficiently as you can
and<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.750> we'll<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.320> maybe<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.800> at

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and what we'll do now is maybe look at

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
and what we'll do now is maybe look at
some<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.309> areas<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.059> vehicle<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.690> can

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
some of the areas of a vehicle that can

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.730 
some of the areas of a vehicle that can
improve<00:01:04.680> or<00:01:05.010> actually<00:01:06.260> remove<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
improve or actually remove some of the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.429 
improve or actually remove some of the
good<00:01:07.950> aerodynamics<00:01:08.820> for<00:01:09.390> example<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:10.140> here

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
good aerodynamics for example down here

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.500 
good aerodynamics for example down here
at<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> bumper<00:01:11.130> when<00:01:11.820> you're<00:01:11.939> looking<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
at the bumper when you're looking at the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.600 
at the bumper when you're looking at the
bumper<00:01:13.020> what<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.590> might<00:01:13.770> notice<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.369> this

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
bumper what you might notice about this

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
bumper what you might notice about this
one<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.970> that<00:01:15.150> as<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.840> air<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.049> attached<00:01:16.650> here

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
one is that as the air is attached here

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.399 
one is that as the air is attached here
it<00:01:17.490> travels<00:01:18.240> in<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> few<00:01:18.630> different<00:01:18.720> directions

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
it travels in a few different directions

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.249 
it travels in a few different directions
one<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.860> up<00:01:20.040> across<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:20.840> one<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.990> around

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
one is up across the top one is around

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.999 
one is up across the top one is around
the<00:01:22.530> side<00:01:23.090> some<00:01:24.090> goes<00:01:24.330> down<00:01:24.689> here<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.409> maybe

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
the side some goes down here and maybe

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.219 
the side some goes down here and maybe
some<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.820> side<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.930> tried

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
some over to this side but what we tried

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.590 
some over to this side but what we tried
to<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.250> avoid<00:01:29.610> air<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.240> in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
to do is to avoid air that's going in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.260 
to do is to avoid air that's going in
front<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> tire<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.670> reason<00:01:33.090> for

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
front of the tire and the reason for

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.030 
front of the tire and the reason for
that<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.659> once<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.140> start<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> throw<00:01:34.829> air

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
that is once you start to throw air

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.069 
that is once you start to throw air
underneath<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.700> tire<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.240> begins<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> create

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
underneath the tire it begins to create

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.810 
underneath the tire it begins to create
additional<00:01:37.320> turbulence<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> has<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.729> be

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
additional turbulence and has to be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.539 
additional turbulence and has to be
controlled<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.570> different<00:01:39.930> way<00:01:40.110> one<00:01:41.009> method<00:01:41.460> of

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
controlled a different way one method of

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.999 
controlled a different way one method of
that<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.939> using<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.899> we<00:01:43.020> refer<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> as<00:01:43.590> ground

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that is using what we refer to as ground

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.280 
that is using what we refer to as ground
effects<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.729> this<00:01:45.270> vehicle<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
effects on this vehicle you can see that

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.679

you<00:02:09.879> have<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.030> bug<00:02:10.420> deflector<00:02:10.569> and<00:02:11.050> then<00:02:11.140> a<00:02:11.170> Sun

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
you have a bug deflector and then a Sun

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.330 
you have a bug deflector and then a Sun
Visor<00:02:11.440> which<00:02:11.860> can't<00:02:12.069> be<00:02:12.190> good<00:02:12.280> for

Visor which can't be good for
aerodynamics<00:02:13.060> well<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.629> know<00:02:13.750> you're

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
aerodynamics well you know you're

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.449 
aerodynamics well you know you're
absolutely<00:02:14.140> right<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.590> know<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:15.099> spend

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
absolutely right you know we spend

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.520 
absolutely right you know we spend
literally<00:02:15.910> millions<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.569> dollars<00:02:16.959> trying<00:02:17.319> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
literally millions of dollars trying to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.339 
literally millions of dollars trying to
reduce<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.340> drag<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.150> vehicle<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.780> then

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
reduce the drag on the vehicle and then

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.290 
reduce the drag on the vehicle and then
a<00:02:20.410> lot<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:20.739> times<00:02:20.920> what's<00:02:21.190> happening<00:02:21.610> is<00:02:21.730> we

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
a lot of times what's happening is we

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.850 
a lot of times what's happening is we
have<00:02:22.450> customers<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:22.959> will<00:02:23.019> put<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.260> bug

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
have customers that will put a bug

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.170 
have customers that will put a bug
deflector<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.550> on<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.790> front<00:02:25.030> of<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
vehicle and throws the air over the top

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.699 
vehicle and throws the air over the top
and<00:02:26.980> starts<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.670> tumbling<00:02:28.120> along<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:29.200> what<00:02:29.590> we

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
and starts a tumbling along now what we

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.280 
and starts a tumbling along now what we
see<00:02:29.950> here<00:02:30.340> is<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.700> little<00:02:30.970> bit<00:02:31.120> more<00:02:31.690> care<00:02:31.989> in<00:02:32.200> a

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
see here is a little bit more care in a

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.559 
see here is a little bit more care in a
design<00:02:32.680> of<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.980> bug<00:02:33.220> deflector<00:02:33.400> in<00:02:33.970> that<00:02:34.180> it

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
design of a bug deflector in that it

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.900 
design of a bug deflector in that it
allows<00:02:34.840> the<00:02:35.050> air<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.380> attach<00:02:35.769> across<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.700> top

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
allows the air to attach across the top

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.100 
allows the air to attach across the top
of<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.120> hood<00:02:37.269> for<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.510> short<00:02:37.780> amount<00:02:37.930> of<00:02:38.049> time

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
of the hood for a short amount of time

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.380 
of the hood for a short amount of time
and<00:02:38.440> then<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.220> bug<00:02:39.489> deflector<00:02:39.640> is<00:02:40.030> designed

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and then this bug deflector is designed

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.690 
and then this bug deflector is designed
specifically<00:02:40.930> for<00:02:41.260> this<00:02:41.349> model<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.160> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
specifically for this model and it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.660 
specifically for this model and it
allows<00:02:42.970> the<00:02:43.330> air<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.810> flow<00:02:44.349> just<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:45.099> top

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
allows the air to flow just to the top

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.180 
allows the air to flow just to the top
of<00:02:45.910> the<00:02:46.090> windshield<00:02:46.540> as<00:02:46.900> opposed<00:02:47.620> to<00:02:47.739> throwing

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
of the windshield as opposed to throwing

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.729 
of the windshield as opposed to throwing
it<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:48.579> high<00:02:48.880> up<00:02:49.239> now<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.170> other<00:02:50.380> point<00:02:50.620> you

also reduce Aero the effect of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.690 
also reduce Aero the effect of
aerodynamics<00:02:58.810> now<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.590> bug<00:02:59.920> deflector<00:03:00.130> can<00:03:00.579> be

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
aerodynamics now a bug deflector can be

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.819 
aerodynamics now a bug deflector can be
about<00:03:00.940> 2%<00:03:01.420> when<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.019> comes<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.590> if<00:03:02.680> it's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
about 2% when it comes to it if it's

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.009 
about 2% when it comes to it if it's
mounted<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:03.280> the<00:03:03.430> front<00:03:03.700> of<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> vehicle<00:03:04.019> but

when you get to that Sun Visor that can

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.680 
when you get to that Sun Visor that can
be<00:03:08.019> about<00:03:08.769> another<00:03:09.160> percent<00:03:09.849> in<00:03:10.030> fuel<00:03:10.540> economy

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
be about another percent in fuel economy

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.229 
be about another percent in fuel economy
lost<00:03:11.440> but<00:03:12.190> you<00:03:12.220> notice<00:03:12.579> something<00:03:12.790> about<00:03:13.090> this

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
lost but you notice something about this

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.610 
lost but you notice something about this
Sun<00:03:13.510> Visor<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.359> it's<00:03:16.359> a<00:03:16.720> stepped

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
Sun Visor and that is it's a stepped

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.280 
Sun Visor and that is it's a stepped
away<00:03:17.829> from<00:03:18.100> the<00:03:18.459> roof<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> vehicle<00:03:19.780> and

away from the roof of the vehicle and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.500 
away from the roof of the vehicle and
what<00:03:20.859> it<00:03:20.980> does<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.370> allows<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:22.000> air<00:03:22.180> to<00:03:22.209> come

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
what it does is allows the air to come

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.990 
what it does is allows the air to come
over<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:22.900> top<00:03:22.930> of<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.410> hood<00:03:23.650> over<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.579> top<00:03:24.819> of

the windshield and underneath there so
that<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.090> mass<00:03:28.329> air<00:03:28.630> that's<00:03:28.840> underneath<00:03:29.319> here

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that the mass air that's underneath here

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.309 
that the mass air that's underneath here
is<00:03:29.739> still<00:03:29.980> attached<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.900> that's<00:03:31.900> stepped

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
is still attached and that's stepped

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.050 
is still attached and that's stepped
away<00:03:32.470> from<00:03:32.680> it<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.760> other<00:03:33.910> thing<00:03:34.030> that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
away from it the other thing that

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.000 
away from it the other thing that
happens<00:03:34.540> at<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:34.780> windshield<00:03:35.139> is<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.769> fact

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
happens at the windshield is the fact

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.800 
happens at the windshield is the fact
that<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.459> air<00:03:36.609> starts<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> flow<00:03:37.359> around<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
that the air starts to flow around the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.870 
that the air starts to flow around the
side<00:03:38.079> of<00:03:38.109> the<00:03:38.290> windshield<00:03:38.859> and<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.579> windshield

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
side of the windshield and a windshield

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.819 
side of the windshield and a windshield
like<00:03:40.150> this<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.600> allows<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.019> air<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.170> fly<00:03:41.560> out

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
like this it allows the air to fly out

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.069 
like this it allows the air to fly out
and<00:03:42.069> then<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.760> starts<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.209> tumble<00:03:43.450> along<00:03:43.900> the

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
and then it starts to tumble along the

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:45.870 
and then it starts to tumble along the
side<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.560> the<00:03:44.650> vehicle<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.100> same<00:03:45.400> effect<00:03:45.790> as

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
side of the vehicle the same effect as

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.280 
side of the vehicle the same effect as
if<00:03:45.940> it's<00:03:46.180> going<00:03:46.420> over<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.750> trailer<00:03:47.139> and

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
if it's going over the trailer and

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.930 
if it's going over the trailer and
tumbly<00:03:47.680> what<00:03:48.340> you<00:03:48.459> see<00:03:48.670> here<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:50.940> pillar

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
tumbly what you see here is a a pillar

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.420 
tumbly what you see here is a a pillar
turning<00:03:52.569> vane<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:53.319> keeps<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.889> air<00:03:54.040> attached

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
turning vane that keeps the air attached

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.400 
turning vane that keeps the air attached
to<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.819> side<00:03:55.090> of<00:03:55.329> the<00:03:55.389> vehicle<00:03:55.810> and<00:03:55.959> then

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
to the side of the vehicle and then

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.250 
to the side of the vehicle and then
allows<00:03:56.680> it<00:03:56.950> to<00:03:56.980> Rhea<00:03:57.609> to<00:03:58.269> stay<00:03:58.510> attached<00:03:58.900> along

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
allows it to Rhea to stay attached along

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.559 
allows it to Rhea to stay attached along
the<00:03:59.470> side<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.040> truck<00:04:00.310> here<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.790> the<00:04:01.420> other
