00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:09.200
 Hello, I wanted you today 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.870
 tell how to cook 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:20.449
 horizontal bitch I used to tell 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.740
 how to weld a vertical side seam but 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:27.349
 create resonator sauce pretty 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.630
 just if fervent i will bring us boiled 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.120
 small details 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 But if a large gap and there is also a 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.719
 life has to be cooked 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 so here is a little more complicated than usual 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:50.600
 welders when such a gap is obtained 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 big take and lay this gap 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:01:01.320
 shelf 7 8 millimeter 6 what kind of gap is it 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:05.729
 to speak already just molten metal 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:11.640
 does not flow down and welding is obtained 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:16.439
 pretty durable and reliable well here 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:22.350
 You can cook such a walk and not even for 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:29.070
 Vine I am in a cork gap although it is them already 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:32.250
 of course cook longer but I can 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.759
 I did not want to show you when you cook 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:39.780
 one part and the second 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:44.340
 we must first do between them well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:49.320
 as if the bridge that is building metal 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.439
 from one side to the other to 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.670
 connect them together that is when 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.079
 electrode zazhirayutsya slightly boiled and 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.899
 tore off 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:07.489
 let the metal cool again boil it and 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:09.500
 take the electrode again, let cool 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:14.120
 boil again 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.790
 and again we remove the electrode when we already have 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.390
 it turns out a small gap we already 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:24.050
 We connect two parts together when 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.860
 already connected two parts 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.830
 to persuade 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.270
 why we do it as we can 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:35.750
 boil the metal will drain down here 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:40.700
 when the dude hit it off on this little 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:44.750
 plot and you can start to create and take 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 from one end and cook to the other 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.500
 with one edge at lease another during 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:57.200
 welding occurs when this passes 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.420
 metal 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.140
 where we started cooking already have time 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:08.060
 cool down and so we can continuously and 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:13.630
 cook here I am and showed how you can 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.630
 I cleaned the top 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.760
 on sandpaper to better see that 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:27.680
 it turns out that pretty and such 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:32.410
 reliable and durable and this method can 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:39.760
 fill large gaps 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:43.269
 Well, that's what I wanted to tell you and everyone 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.269
 goodbye
