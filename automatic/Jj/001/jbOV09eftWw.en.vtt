00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:08.460
 good audi is also betting strong 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.160
 autonomous models and to show the 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:15.960
 you want with this technology 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.029
 chose cda 7 with v6 of 314 horses and 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.010
 made a long trip 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.010
 the result you check now 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.600
 O 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:35.800
 What's the fun of taking the wheel? 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.470
 a v4 of 314 horsepower without 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.590
 can tread on the accelerator 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.629
 but it is undeniable that the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.300
 journalists crossing the state of 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.330
 california and nevada in the united states 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.489
 as mere spectators inside the sedan is 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.710
 at least unusual 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.559
 the four-ring mark promoted a 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.690
 travel of almost 900 kilometers between 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.750
 are francisco and las vegas 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.790
 demonstrate this incredible technology to 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.610
 The idea is to make it possible to 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.070
 rest to drivers in situations of 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.030
 stress as heavy traffic or in a 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 long trip 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.580
 to travel on the road without any 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.159
 incident 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.430
 the standalone a7 was equipped with scanners 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.710
 laser and high resolution 3d cameras 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.560
 which detail the presence of objects 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.470
 standing or moving on lanes 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.780
 the information is then processed by 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.420
 a computer that sends the data to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.190
 direction of the brakes and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.190
 as required 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.229
 in the course of the trip the autonomous a7 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.970
 was set to run up to 112 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.549
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.100
 at this speed the vehicle changes range 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.360
 and does overtaking without any help 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.090
 from the driver 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.670
 the system deco the speed of the sedan 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.700
 other vehicles on the track and if the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.970
 distance for safe the a7 realizes 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.970
 maneuvers 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.570
 despite the cutting -edge technology shown 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.240
 by the autonomous audi 7 does not do everything 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.520
 alone in environments where traffic 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.430
 you need cold blood to direct the 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.890
 vehicle the driver is called through 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.870
 signals emitted by the system so that 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.770
 he takes the steering wheel and ensure 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.770
 security is this
