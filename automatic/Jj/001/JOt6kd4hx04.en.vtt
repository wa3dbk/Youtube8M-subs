nothing<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.769> did<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.859> whole<00:02:53.010> day<00:02:53.780> and<00:02:54.780> I'm

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
nothing I did the whole day and I'm

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.690 
nothing I did the whole day and I'm
still<00:02:55.079> working<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.590> pretty<00:02:55.769> hard<00:02:55.859> and

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
still working out pretty hard and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.539 
still working out pretty hard and
intensely<00:02:57.209> this<00:02:57.989> is<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.409> believe<00:02:58.739> my<00:02:58.920> fifth<00:02:59.250> set

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
intensely this is I believe my fifth set

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.819 
intensely this is I believe my fifth set
so<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> can<00:03:00.780> only<00:03:00.840> get<00:03:01.019> a<00:03:01.049> couple<00:03:01.379> of<00:03:01.470> reps<00:03:01.650> in

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:03.829 
so I can only get a couple of reps in

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.809 
so I can only get a couple of reps in
and<00:03:04.829> that's<00:03:05.010> pretty<00:03:05.069> much<00:03:05.280> different<00:03:05.730> this

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
and that's pretty much different this

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.140 
and that's pretty much different this

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
but it's like my fifth set on this
