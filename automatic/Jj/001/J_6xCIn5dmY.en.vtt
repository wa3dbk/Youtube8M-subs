off<00:01:03.850> so<00:01:04.210> this<00:01:04.360> part<00:01:04.570> here<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:04.750> Ibaka<00:01:05.049> PFT<00:01:05.619> tape

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
off so this part here on Ibaka PFT tape

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.910 
off so this part here on Ibaka PFT tape
and<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.320> going<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.530> go<00:01:08.619> on<00:01:08.770> in<00:01:08.860> a

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
and this is going to go on in a

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.499 
and this is going to go on in a
clockwise<00:01:09.159> position<00:01:09.340> so<00:01:10.090> need<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.270> make<00:01:10.479> sure

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
clockwise position so need to make sure

PFT<00:01:11.320> tape<00:01:11.680> goes<00:01:11.950> around<00:01:12.159> in<00:01:12.310> the<00:01:12.369> same

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
PFT tape goes around in the same

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.399 
PFT tape goes around in the same
position<00:01:12.969> so<00:01:13.600> it<00:01:13.659> doesn't<00:01:13.930> cross<00:01:14.049> back<00:01:14.259> on

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
position so it doesn't cross back on

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:24.030 
position so it doesn't cross back on
itself

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.910 

how<00:01:24.580> many<00:01:24.760> reps<00:01:25.000> of<00:01:25.180> that<00:01:25.210> do<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.480> need<00:01:25.920> wise

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
how many reps of that do you need wise

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.250 
how many reps of that do you need wise
Australian<00:01:27.460> once<00:01:27.640> told<00:01:27.880> me<00:01:28.120> it<00:01:28.240> was<00:01:28.360> 12<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.930> 14
