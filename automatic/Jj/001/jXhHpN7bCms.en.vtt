00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.470
 321 fire 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.470
 ah 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.800
 good people like this I hope that well 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.470
 lately I have found myself working 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.080
 in home automation and 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.790
 which consists mainly of this 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.060
 circuit turning on and off is so 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.910
 little that is there already but not 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:53.480
 turn on any shape as a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:55.870
 common switch and current except the 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.870
 computer 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.470
 so 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:13.090
 through a computer I am capable of 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.369
 turn on and off the 220 ampoule 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.110
 this is first built on a base 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.150
 of control 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.350
 mainly that it is here is already a 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.140
 microcontroller that arrives information 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.150
 from the computer and he receives it 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.030
 through a communication interface 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.500
 dynamic that is called explains this 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.620
 control that I am doing is totally 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:36.310
 wireless already then the computer 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.680
 send the information to the fbi and choose and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.620
 transmits it up high up to 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.030
 towards this other file that arrives and this one 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.010
 they send information to micro control and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.720
 microcontrollers that decides and says that 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.460
 take the information doing it by 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.690
 so much 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.780
 but that's why it goes to the circuit 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.430
 power that is down here 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.950
 it is a watch 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.670
 Then he sends you the information 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.860
 soon live this the 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.540
 ampule if it is not called then step 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.350
 from the control circuit to the circuit 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.610
 power since this is this this is a 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.259
 switch 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.210
 the high electronic switch 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.220
 power 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.530
 that's what I send a pulse and the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.790
 the other side did the contacts 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.330
 then only criteria connected to the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.010
 ampule and this is how it works as well 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.410
 that this is for the new section that 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.480
 will come later from home automation that 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.760
 I plan to teach not only 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.330
 control of light bulbs but 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:34.250
 descended ampoules being able to 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.670
 control the luminosity it delivers 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.200
 this and so that you really notice the 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 wireless success effect because perhaps 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.190
 energy I do not have any cable someone 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.500
 there 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.620
 only amityville is connected and nothing 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.620
 plus 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.870
 Our idea is to show gesture 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.870
 if not 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.840
 Instantly 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:06.120
 finance 50 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.459
 it is a difficult thing to do or is there 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.200
 that to put effort you have to learn and I 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.490
 I'm going to give the job of teaching 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.980
 you to the people who want 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.870
 learn so be it that I hope there will be 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.730
 liked in this video is a video 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.480
 it really is like a review I do not know how 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.880
 it is already said about this new section like this 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.890
 what is to look for 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.890
 see you, take care of yourself and
