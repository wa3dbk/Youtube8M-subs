00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
I block I his energy tablets actually

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.740 
I block I his energy tablets actually
hit<00:01:16.310> me<00:01:16.460> so<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:16.910> well<00:01:17.030> maybe<00:01:17.180> I<00:01:17.270> can<00:01:17.450> charge

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
hit me so for well maybe I can charge

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.460 
hit me so for well maybe I can charge
and<00:01:17.960> restore<00:01:18.380> summer<00:01:18.770> some<00:01:19.580> Epsom<00:01:20.060> HP<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
and restore summer some Epsom HP and

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.170 
and restore summer some Epsom HP and
then<00:01:21.979> he<00:01:22.130> ends<00:01:22.310> up<00:01:22.369> hitting<00:01:22.490> urine<00:01:22.880> energies

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
then he ends up hitting urine energies

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.530 
then he ends up hitting urine energies
at<00:01:23.360> anyway<00:01:24.160> because<00:01:25.160> goku's<00:01:25.880> blocking<00:01:26.270> frame

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
at anyway because goku's blocking frame

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.560 
at anyway because goku's blocking frame
is<00:01:26.780> actually<00:01:27.050> smaller<00:01:27.110> than<00:01:27.500> his<00:01:27.890> um<00:01:28.190> his

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
is actually smaller than his um his

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.609 
is actually smaller than his um his
charge<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:29.750> frame<00:01:29.960> were<00:01:30.050> hit<00:01:30.200> boxes<00:01:30.470> are

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
charge in frame were hit boxes are

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.850 
charge in frame were hit boxes are
different<00:01:30.920> so<00:01:31.160> else<00:01:31.390> fun<00:01:32.770> now<00:01:33.770> you

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
different so else fun now you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.830 
different so else fun now you
continuously<00:01:34.340> spams<00:01:34.789> this<00:01:35.030> attack<00:01:35.539> he<00:01:35.660> does<00:01:35.810> a

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
continuously spams this attack he does a

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.359 
continuously spams this attack he does a
massive<00:01:36.289> combo<00:01:36.619> on<00:01:36.649> me<00:01:36.830> here<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.190> then<00:01:37.310> this

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
massive combo on me here and then this

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.910 
massive combo on me here and then this
point<00:01:37.670> it's<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.180> know<00:01:38.300> what<00:01:38.479> I'm<00:01:38.690> fucked<00:01:39.200> 30
