the device protecting the crown has a

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
little thing that protrudes out there

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.560 
little thing that protrudes out there
where<00:01:15.119> it<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:16.820> it's<00:01:17.820> possible<00:01:18.330> they<00:01:18.509> could

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
where it is it's possible they could

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.149 
where it is it's possible they could
designed<00:01:18.990> it<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.320> bit<00:01:19.439> better<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.890> I

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
designed it a little bit better but I

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.590 
designed it a little bit better but I
mean<00:01:20.460> it's<00:01:20.640> not<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.030> big<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.240> deal<00:01:21.270> I

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
mean it's not that big a deal I

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.969 
mean it's not that big a deal I
personally<00:01:22.110> don't<00:01:22.259> even<00:01:22.439> use<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.950> much

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
personally don't even use it that much

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
personally don't even use it that much
so<00:01:23.540> the<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.610> second<00:01:26.909> hand<00:01:27.119> is<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.689> only<00:01:27.960> hand

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
so the the second hand is the only hand

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.670 
so the the second hand is the only hand
here<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.430> matte<00:01:30.020> color<00:01:31.020> matte

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
here that is not a matte color matte

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.710 
here that is not a matte color matte
black<00:01:31.950> in<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.280> case<00:01:32.520> it's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> sort<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.600> a

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
black in this case it's a sort of a

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.940 
black in this case it's a sort of a
shiny<00:01:33.960> silver<00:01:34.200> which<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.619> thought<00:01:34.770> was<00:01:34.890> a

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
shiny silver which I thought was a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
shiny silver which I thought was a
little<00:01:35.159> bit<00:01:35.250> odd<00:01:35.400> but<00:01:35.700> that's<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:36.900> we<00:01:36.990> want

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
little bit odd but that's what we want

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.210 
little bit odd but that's what we want
to<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> looks<00:01:37.710> fine

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
to do it looks fine

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.300
