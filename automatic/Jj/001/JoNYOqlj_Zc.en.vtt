waiting to make sticky pistons is easy

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.209 
waiting to make sticky pistons is easy
just<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.780> piston<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.800> gonna<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:47.129> to

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
just make a piston you're gonna have to

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.880 
just make a piston you're gonna have to
find<00:00:47.430> slime<00:00:47.760> balls<00:00:48.110> and<00:00:49.110> also<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
find slime balls and also we're going to

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010 
find slime balls and also we're going to
use<00:00:50.039> soon<00:00:50.700> so<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.329> how<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> made<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.780> sticky

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
use soon so that's how you made a sticky

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.709 
use soon so that's how you made a sticky
pistons<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.710> use<00:00:52.890> those<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.449> slime

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
pistons and use those you get slime

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.069 
pistons and use those you get slime
balls<00:00:54.960> from<00:00:55.199> slides<00:00:56.180> as<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.239> quick<00:00:57.570> note<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.870> how

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
balls from slides as a quick note of how

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.689 
balls from slides as a quick note of how
it's<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.440> put<00:00:58.469> together<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.520> we're

your ones that are making a free
high-collared

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
high-collared

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
high-collared
marking<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.939> then<00:01:09.210> we<00:01:09.330> leave<00:01:09.510> two<00:01:09.840> squares

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
marking and then we leave two squares

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.060 
marking and then we leave two squares
and<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.890> make<00:01:11.070> another<00:01:11.310> free<00:01:11.549> hi<00:01:11.729> Cole<00:01:13.070> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
and we make another free hi Cole and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.859 
and we make another free hi Cole and
then<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> nicely<00:01:15.360> alright

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
then we make that into a nicely alright

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.710 
then we make that into a nicely alright
so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.470> gonna<00:01:16.680> be<00:01:16.860> our<00:01:16.979> doorway<00:01:17.540> and<00:01:18.540> then

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
so that's gonna be our doorway and then

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.420 
so that's gonna be our doorway and then
we're<00:01:18.869> gonna<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.590> behind<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.100> gonna<00:01:20.250> miss

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.580 
we're gonna go behind you gonna miss
square<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.210> we're<00:01:21.330> going<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.509> put<00:01:21.659> piston<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
square and we're going to put piston the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
square and we're going to put piston the
piston<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:23.009> top<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.060> same

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
piston on top of that and then the same

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
piston on top of that and then the same
beside<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:25.890> gonna<00:01:25.950> prove

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
beside it and then we're gonna prove

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.999 
beside it and then we're gonna prove
another<00:01:26.880> piston<00:01:27.390> facing<00:01:27.900> towards<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> door

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
another piston facing towards the door

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.370 
another piston facing towards the door
here<00:01:29.220> all<00:01:29.549> right<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.479> gonna<00:01:30.659> repeat<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.079> on

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
here all right I'm gonna repeat that on

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:39.050 
here all right I'm gonna repeat that on
the<00:01:31.439> other<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:32.630> so<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.579> then<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:38.970> we

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the other side so what we do then is we

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.690 
the other side so what we do then is we
will<00:01:40.049> ever<00:01:40.229> find<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.009> material<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.549> want

update you will let you know how to do

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.000 
update you will let you know how to do
it<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.900> we'll<00:03:01.900> try<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.260> incorporate<00:03:02.500> as<00:03:02.859> much

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
it and we'll try and incorporate as much

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.680 
it and we'll try and incorporate as much
of<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.310> stuff<00:03:03.519> into<00:03:03.790> our<00:03:03.850> world<00:03:04.150> as<00:03:04.329> we<00:03:04.450> can't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
of this stuff into our world as we can't

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 
of this stuff into our world as we can't
first<00:03:05.019> don't<00:03:05.709> make<00:03:05.829> a<00:03:05.859> lot<00:03:06.130> more<00:03:06.280> fun<00:03:06.609> as<00:03:07.060> you

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
first don't make a lot more fun as you

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.759 
first don't make a lot more fun as you
can<00:03:07.329> see<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:07.569> it's<00:03:07.690> just<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:08.109> little<00:03:08.139> out<00:03:08.500> there

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
can see if it's just a little out there

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.870 
can see if it's just a little out there
so<00:03:10.319> this<00:03:11.319> needs<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:11.590> be<00:03:11.650> moved<00:03:11.980> over<00:03:12.190> there<00:03:12.790> we

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
so this needs to be moved over there we

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.349 
so this needs to be moved over there we
go<00:03:13.090> fit<00:03:13.389> that<00:03:13.510> bill<00:03:13.690> out<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.819> you<00:03:15.819> go<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.299> it

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
go fit that bill out there you go so it

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:18.090 
go fit that bill out there you go so it
runs<00:03:16.510> like<00:03:16.780> that<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.230> I'm<00:03:17.319> gonna<00:03:17.440> show<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:18.040> on

runs like that and I'm gonna show you on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.900 
runs like that and I'm gonna show you on
this<00:03:18.250> side<00:03:18.489> so<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.970> know<00:03:19.120> how<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:19.329> do<00:03:19.540> it<00:03:20.910> comes

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
this side so you know how to do it comes

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.420 
this side so you know how to do it comes
down

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.569 

yeah<00:03:26.620> did<00:03:27.620> you<00:03:27.650> see<00:03:27.739> a<00:03:28.129> little<00:03:28.370> bit

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:28.579 
yeah did you see a little bit

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:30.850 
yeah did you see a little bit
complicated<00:03:28.909> nor<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.420> confusion<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:30.200> mean

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
complicated nor the confusion I mean

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.250 
complicated nor the confusion I mean
like<00:03:31.280> everything<00:03:31.730> in<00:03:31.909> the<00:03:32.329> Minecraft

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
like everything in the Minecraft

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.390 
like everything in the Minecraft
practice<00:03:33.769> makes<00:03:34.010> perfect<00:03:34.310> so<00:03:34.790> here<00:03:35.780> we<00:03:35.870> go

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
practice makes perfect so here we go

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.160 
practice makes perfect so here we go
that's<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.760> just<00:03:38.390> remove<00:03:38.629> all<00:03:38.780> these<00:03:38.900> down

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
that's it just remove all these down

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:49.020 
that's it just remove all these down
here<00:03:39.439> get<00:03:40.069> out<00:03:40.189> the<00:03:40.280> way<00:03:45.849> that's<00:03:46.849> it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
here get out the way that's it

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.729 
here get out the way that's it
and<00:03:50.030> then<00:03:50.180> we<00:03:50.269> use<00:03:50.390> repeaters<00:03:51.049> repeaters<00:03:51.530> just

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
and then we use repeaters repeaters just

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.069 
and then we use repeaters repeaters just
basically<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.519> Harry<00:03:53.239> the<00:03:53.420> Corrigan

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
basically and Harry the Corrigan

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:55.390 
basically and Harry the Corrigan
so<00:03:54.200> we're<00:03:54.290> let<00:03:54.409> me<00:03:54.470> put<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.739> with<00:03:54.829> me<00:03:55.010> tell<00:03:55.280> me

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
so we're let me put it with me tell me

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.250 
so we're let me put it with me tell me
how<00:03:55.549> four<00:03:55.849> different<00:03:56.239> settings<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:56.989> put

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
how four different settings when you put

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.899 
how four different settings when you put
it<00:03:57.349> down<00:03:57.500> it's<00:03:57.889> all<00:03:58.099> about<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.519> you<00:03:58.609> on<00:03:58.760> its

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.329 

as<00:04:53.330> I<00:04:53.449> said<00:04:53.659> it's<00:04:54.169> still<00:04:54.379> really<00:04:54.650> confusing<00:04:55.219> to

00:04:55.329 --> 00:04:55.339 
as I said it's still really confusing to

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:59.170 
as I said it's still really confusing to
us<00:04:55.460> but<00:04:55.789> we<00:04:56.360> are<00:04:56.389> learning<00:04:56.719> and<00:04:57.999> obviously<00:04:58.999> the

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
us but we are learning and obviously the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.170 
us but we are learning and obviously the
better<00:04:59.569> we<00:04:59.779> get<00:04:59.960> the<00:05:00.110> better<00:05:00.259> you'll<00:05:00.499> get<00:05:00.800> and

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
better we get the better you'll get and

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.719 
better we get the better you'll get and
so<00:05:02.180> on<00:05:02.389> so<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.259> may<00:05:03.439> have<00:05:03.589> six<00:05:03.889> why'd<00:05:04.129> you<00:05:04.520> miss

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
so on so you may have six why'd you miss

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.429 
so on so you may have six why'd you miss
one<00:05:04.999> from<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> top<00:05:05.479> of<00:05:05.539> the<00:05:05.599> archway<00:05:06.050> so<00:05:06.110> that

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:06.439 
one from the top of the archway so that

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.299 
one from the top of the archway so that
it<00:05:06.589> doesn't<00:05:06.889> connect<00:05:07.610> with<00:05:07.789> us<00:05:08.259> and<00:05:09.259> then<00:05:09.559> you

00:05:10.299 --> 00:05:10.309 
it doesn't connect with us and then you

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.159 
it doesn't connect with us and then you
could<00:05:10.520> put<00:05:10.669> it<00:05:10.759> down<00:05:10.939> like<00:05:10.969> this<00:05:11.330> so<00:05:11.870> what<00:05:12.050> we

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
could put it down like this so what we

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.749 
could put it down like this so what we
realized<00:05:12.559> is<00:05:12.710> it's<00:05:12.889> running<00:05:13.309> from<00:05:13.669> the

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
realized is it's running from the
