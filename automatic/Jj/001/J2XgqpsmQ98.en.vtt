00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.010
 what about friends but bryant and we are 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.259
 starting a new autocad tutorial 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.430
 2014 if you know my channel can enter 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:08.990
 and you can see there are many more videos 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.059
 does not usually coach but from other programs 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.190
 more if you have a doubt or query me 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.960
 you can consult this can help them the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 Today I passed this figure 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.400
 here and they asked me to explain how 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.320
 make different angles when it comes to 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.070
 draw or how to draw 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.750
 quick and easy different angles of 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.000
 well there are several ways to do it 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.470
 one of them is putting settings and 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.440
 activating in addition alan woods 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.310
 adding new and putting angles that I want 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 that I fix for example 45 degrees 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.300
 let's read xantar 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.399
 and me when now a line 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.399
 If I look for the 45 degrees 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.850
 if you look now do not see another but if 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.150
 pressed efe dÃ­az that is this incognito 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.610
 here 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.880
 at 45 degrees makes me this dotted line 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.350
 that the same thing marked me was marked 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.350
 the one with 135 degrees 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.390
 and there if we put settings you can see 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.240
 which is marked the one of 45 the one of 135 him 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.180
 is 225 the quiet polar has to 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.939
 be labeled another way of doing it is 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.909
 come to dynamic input put enable 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.799
 pointer input 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.230
 and simply what is done is that 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.440
 when we put a line 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:30.350
 there I blocked it to 35 to 45 let's say that 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.880
 if you notice that they used an angle that did not 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 be blocked 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:41.480
 at 125 degrees is not blocked at 135 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.390
 ca125 I do not fit that I put that tab 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.310
 what you are going to do is more jump to 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.400
 put the measure of the angle I propose 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.040
 percent 120 I put are again and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.250
 in 1820 there I just have to put 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.690
 the distance for example 3 and so power 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.960
 go drawing for example let's show 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.460
 at this point I want to block it 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.670
 15 degrees 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.790
 could come and put it to 15 I have a 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.959
 trade simply portal 15 and for a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.690
 distance that I want for as per 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.850
 example 45 meters 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:21.200
 and so you can draw what I want 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.200
 angle I want it to 225 degrees 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.090
 and he throws it down 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.250
 and so you can just draw 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 and this command is really very useful and 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.200
 very easy to use 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.960
 we have been and yaiza the command we 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.010
 place the angle that we want 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.010
 let's put line again 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.799
 there it throws us if they notice how it goes 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:49.640
 generating this angle for the other side 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.180
 there if they set props 35 degrees 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:57.720
 mining with there I put it wrong I click and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.209
 I go down and put such 35 degrees 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 it also locks me down and I 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.989
 it could be for example like in that 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.310
 armchair that reality has another angle 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.170
 but they could cause something very similar with 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.269
 this procedure one can acquire the 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.120
 angle that one wants and to be able to reach 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.920
 make drawings with angles including a 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.200
 plant of this all with angles it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.419
 block these angles in the event that 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.609
 everything is at an angle and is fixed 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.290
 I recommend you come here and put 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.659
 settings 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.060
 in addition to the angle in the event that 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.620
 we only use one another time as is the 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.969
 case of making an armchair or what 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.670
 We will continually use in 

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.829
 construction we activate it connected a 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.709
 Once and it's already good I hope you have them 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:42.629
 served this is like making angles 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:47.329
 holes if they like they can share the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.329
 link and good that a greeting for all
