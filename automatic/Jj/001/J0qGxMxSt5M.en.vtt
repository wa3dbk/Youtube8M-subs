everybody it's been straighter for an

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.480 
everybody it's been straighter for an

EFI University and here to talk to you
they<00:00:12.639> a<00:00:12.910> little<00:00:13.450> bit<00:00:13.600> about<00:00:13.780> some<00:00:14.049> of<00:00:14.139> the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
they a little bit about some of the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.660 
they a little bit about some of the
preparations<00:00:14.770> we<00:00:14.889> make<00:00:15.099> to<00:00:15.250> our<00:00:15.340> engine

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:15.670 
preparations we make to our engine

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.609 
preparations we make to our engine
blocks<00:00:15.910> for<00:00:16.689> the<00:00:16.720> engine<00:00:17.110> blueprint<00:00:17.500> in

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
blocks for the engine blueprint in

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:18.900 
blocks for the engine blueprint in
course<00:00:17.860> some<00:00:18.040> of<00:00:18.130> these<00:00:18.220> guys<00:00:18.400> have<00:00:18.610> been<00:00:18.640> with

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
course some of these guys have been with

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.760 
course some of these guys have been with
us<00:00:19.029> and<00:00:19.240> been<00:00:19.750> through<00:00:19.960> this<00:00:20.110> course<00:00:20.380> and<00:00:20.590> some

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
us and been through this course and some

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:21.810 
us and been through this course and some
of<00:00:20.860> you<00:00:20.950> are<00:00:21.009> wondering<00:00:21.189> whether<00:00:21.490> or<00:00:21.610> not<00:00:21.700> you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:21.820 
of you are wondering whether or not you

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.470 
of you are wondering whether or not you
should<00:00:21.970> take<00:00:22.180> it

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
should take it

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.240 
should take it
so<00:00:22.869> this<00:00:23.020> is<00:00:23.140> just<00:00:23.259> a<00:00:23.380> little<00:00:23.590> sample<00:00:24.009> of<00:00:24.070> what

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
so this is just a little sample of what

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.499 
so this is just a little sample of what
some<00:00:24.489> of<00:00:24.520> the<00:00:24.669> things<00:00:24.849> that<00:00:25.060> were<00:00:25.180> concerned

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
some of the things that were concerned

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.690 
some of the things that were concerned
about<00:00:25.630> when<00:00:25.930> we<00:00:26.020> do<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.290> course<00:00:26.560> we<00:00:27.310> took<00:00:27.460> this

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
about when we do the course we took this

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.999 
about when we do the course we took this
Honda<00:00:28.239> k-series<00:00:28.779> engine<00:00:29.290> block<00:00:29.470> and<00:00:29.500> we<00:00:29.800> had

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
Honda k-series engine block and we had

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.220 
Honda k-series engine block and we had
ductile<00:00:30.820> iron<00:00:30.970> sleeves<00:00:31.419> put<00:00:31.689> in<00:00:31.840> it<00:00:31.960> which<00:00:32.110> is

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
ductile iron sleeves put in it which is

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.930 
ductile iron sleeves put in it which is
a<00:00:32.259> common<00:00:32.710> modification<00:00:33.399> that<00:00:33.520> you<00:00:33.579> would<00:00:33.790> do

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
a common modification that you would do

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.850 
a common modification that you would do
for<00:00:33.970> high<00:00:34.480> horsepower<00:00:34.840> applications<00:00:35.170> and<00:00:35.829> of

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
for high horsepower applications and of

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.130 
for high horsepower applications and of
course<00:00:36.100> our<00:00:36.730> engine<00:00:37.180> also<00:00:37.420> gets<00:00:37.630> used<00:00:37.870> in<00:00:38.020> our

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
course our engine also gets used in our

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.560 
course our engine also gets used in our
advanced<00:00:38.620> turbo<00:00:38.860> concepts<00:00:39.430> course<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.030> so

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
advanced turbo concepts course and so

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.820 
advanced turbo concepts course and so
because<00:00:40.870> of<00:00:40.990> that<00:00:41.020> we<00:00:41.230> wanted<00:00:41.410> to<00:00:41.470> take<00:00:41.650> the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
because of that we wanted to take the

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.040 
because of that we wanted to take the
precautions<00:00:42.370> of<00:00:42.580> beeping<00:00:43.240> it<00:00:43.360> up<00:00:43.480> now<00:00:43.660> if<00:00:43.900> you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
precautions of beeping it up now if you

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.780 
precautions of beeping it up now if you
will<00:00:44.200> so<00:00:44.800> one<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.010> the<00:00:45.130> things<00:00:45.340> that<00:00:45.460> we<00:00:45.580> look

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
will so one of the things that we look

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.120 
will so one of the things that we look
at<00:00:46.030> in<00:00:46.300> terms<00:00:46.630> of<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.320> viability<00:00:47.710> of<00:00:47.980> a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
at in terms of the viability of a

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.160 
at in terms of the viability of a
cylinder<00:00:48.490> finish<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.270> produce<00:00:49.900> good

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
cylinder finish to produce good

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.350 
cylinder finish to produce good
performance<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.160> by<00:00:51.640> performance<00:00:52.060> I<00:00:52.180> mean

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
performance and by performance I mean

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.240 
performance and by performance I mean
oil<00:00:52.540> consumption<00:00:53.050> cylinder<00:00:53.680> sealing<00:00:54.070> power

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
oil consumption cylinder sealing power

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.730 
oil consumption cylinder sealing power
level<00:00:54.700> stuff<00:00:54.910> like<00:00:55.060> that<00:00:55.300> is<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:56.320> actual

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:56.740 
level stuff like that is the actual

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.620 
level stuff like that is the actual
crosshatch<00:00:57.520> pattern<00:00:57.550> that's<00:00:58.150> put<00:00:58.420> in<00:00:58.510> there

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
crosshatch pattern that's put in there

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.380 
crosshatch pattern that's put in there
by<00:00:58.810> the<00:00:58.870> machine<00:00:59.260> shop<00:00:59.470> when<00:01:00.310> they<00:01:00.550> match<00:01:01.120> the

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
by the machine shop when they match the

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.720 
by the machine shop when they match the
diameter<00:01:02.020> of<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.320> bore<00:01:02.530> to<00:01:02.800> your<00:01:03.160> piston<00:01:03.520> size

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:03.730 
diameter of the bore to your piston size

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.609 
diameter of the bore to your piston size
so<00:01:04.360> obviously<00:01:04.720> lots<00:01:04.960> of<00:01:05.110> people<00:01:05.379> are<00:01:05.470> familiar

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
so obviously lots of people are familiar

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.920 
so obviously lots of people are familiar
with<00:01:05.860> talking<00:01:06.159> about<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.880> clearance<00:01:07.570> how

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
with talking about the clearance how

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.359 
with talking about the clearance how
much<00:01:08.079> the<00:01:08.229> piston<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.619> going<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.829> expand<00:01:09.130> and

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
much the piston is going to expand and

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.030 
much the piston is going to expand and
grow<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.630> not<00:01:10.870> as<00:01:11.200> many<00:01:11.409> people<00:01:11.770> we<00:01:11.920> have

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
grow but not as many people we have

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.830 
grow but not as many people we have
found<00:01:12.310> have<00:01:12.640> been<00:01:12.670> familiar<00:01:13.060> with<00:01:13.360> what<00:01:13.720> the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
found have been familiar with what the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.070 
found have been familiar with what the
surface<00:01:14.050> finish<00:01:14.560> should<00:01:15.250> be<00:01:15.550> to<00:01:16.420> understand

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
surface finish should be to understand

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.070 
surface finish should be to understand
that<00:01:17.260> when<00:01:18.190> we<00:01:18.340> cut<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.790> surface<00:01:19.180> finish<00:01:19.510> will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that when we cut the surface finish will

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.680 
that when we cut the surface finish will
be<00:01:20.260> sort<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.590> peaks<00:01:20.979> and<00:01:21.250> valleys<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:22.510> the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
be sort of peaks and valleys that the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.899 
be sort of peaks and valleys that the
piston<00:01:23.170> rings<00:01:23.409> have<00:01:23.650> to<00:01:23.860> sort<00:01:24.130> of<00:01:24.190> mate<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.700> and

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
piston rings have to sort of mate to and

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.420 
piston rings have to sort of mate to and
during<00:01:25.150> the<00:01:25.240> break-in<00:01:25.479> process<00:01:26.170> how<00:01:26.680> steep<00:01:27.159> or

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
during the break-in process how steep or

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.940 
during the break-in process how steep or
how<00:01:27.580> deep<00:01:28.270> those<00:01:28.510> valleys<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.350> ridges<00:01:29.590> are

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
how deep those valleys and ridges are

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.770 
how deep those valleys and ridges are
make<00:01:30.549> a<00:01:30.580> big<00:01:30.850> difference<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.390> engines

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
make a big difference to the engines

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.500 
make a big difference to the engines
performance<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:33.400> measure<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:34.000> we<00:01:34.270> use<00:01:34.299> a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
performance to measure that we use a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.539 
performance to measure that we use a
machine<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.260> called<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.560> profilometer<00:01:36.100> or

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
machine that's called a profilometer or

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.590 
machine that's called a profilometer or
if<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.700> think<00:01:36.880> about<00:01:36.970> a<00:01:37.090> machine<00:01:37.330> that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
if you think about a machine that

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.080 
if you think about a machine that
measures<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.110> profile<00:01:38.740> of<00:01:39.070> the<00:01:39.640> ridges<00:01:40.060> and

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
measures the profile of the ridges and

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.180 
measures the profile of the ridges and
the<00:01:40.330> peaks<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.600> valleys<00:01:40.690> in<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.080> cylinder<00:01:41.530> so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
the peaks and valleys in the cylinder so

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.770 
the peaks and valleys in the cylinder so
what<00:01:42.790> we're<00:01:42.940> going<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.119> do<00:01:43.360> is<00:01:43.510> we're<00:01:43.630> going<00:01:43.659> to

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.800 
what we're going to do is we're going to
set<00:01:44.110> it<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.350> here<00:01:44.740> very<00:01:45.130> gently<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.510> it<00:01:46.630> has<00:01:46.780> a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
set it in here very gently and it has a

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.980 
set it in here very gently and it has a
little<00:01:47.110> stylus<00:01:47.799> on<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.700> end<00:01:48.850> of<00:01:49.030> it<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.450> will

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
little stylus on the end of it that will

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.800 
little stylus on the end of it that will
basically<00:01:50.860> drag<00:01:51.220> across<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.970> surface<00:01:52.299> and

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
basically drag across that surface and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.810 
basically drag across that surface and
it<00:01:53.350> will<00:01:53.470> measure<00:01:53.830> those<00:01:54.250> peaks<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.760> valleys

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
it will measure those peaks and valleys

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.280 
it will measure those peaks and valleys
and<00:01:55.150> you'll<00:01:55.240> give<00:01:55.420> us<00:01:55.510> a<00:01:55.630> bunch<00:01:55.840> of<00:01:55.930> different

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
and you'll give us a bunch of different

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.160 
and you'll give us a bunch of different
information<00:01:56.470> about<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.600> reduced<00:01:58.930> peak

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
information about the reduced peak

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.840 
information about the reduced peak
height<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.619> reduced<00:01:59.920> valley<00:02:00.159> height<00:02:00.549> the

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
height the reduced valley height the

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.460 
height the reduced valley height the
average<00:02:01.360> roughness<00:02:01.659> the<00:02:02.200> root-mean-square

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
average roughness the root-mean-square

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.560 
average roughness the root-mean-square
and<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:03.850> there's<00:02:04.090> a<00:02:04.119> lot<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.330> different

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and so there's a lot of different

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.880 
and so there's a lot of different
factors<00:02:04.720> there<00:02:05.049> we'll<00:02:05.200> talk<00:02:05.350> about<00:02:05.530> when<00:02:05.799> you

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
factors there we'll talk about when you

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.920 
factors there we'll talk about when you
come<00:02:06.040> see<00:02:06.220> us<00:02:06.250> on<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> class<00:02:06.759> but<00:02:07.000> for<00:02:07.030> now<00:02:07.330> we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
come see us on the class but for now we

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.300 
come see us on the class but for now we
just<00:02:08.110> wanted<00:02:08.289> to<00:02:08.349> give<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.649> little<00:02:08.830> demo

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
just wanted to give you a little demo

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.220 
just wanted to give you a little demo
vision<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.610> how<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.819> profilometer<00:02:10.450> works<00:02:10.959> and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
vision of how a profilometer works and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.750 
vision of how a profilometer works and
how<00:02:11.319> we're<00:02:11.500> going<00:02:11.620> to<00:02:11.680> use<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.099> information

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
how we're going to use that information

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.699 
how we're going to use that information
so<00:02:12.940> now<00:02:13.480> that<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.660> have<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.930> set<00:02:14.230> in<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> bore

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so now that I have it set in the bore

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.100 
so now that I have it set in the bore
ready<00:02:14.950> to<00:02:15.130> draw<00:02:15.370> Graduate<00:02:15.910> cluster<00:02:16.300> I'm<00:02:16.930> just

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
ready to draw Graduate cluster I'm just

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.080 
ready to draw Graduate cluster I'm just
going<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.260> hit<00:02:17.440> start<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:17.800> stop<00:02:18.160> and<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
going to hit start and stop and it's the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.610 
going to hit start and stop and it's the
machine's<00:02:19.420> going<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.690> do<00:02:19.840> its<00:02:20.020> work<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.230> while

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
machine's going to do its work so while

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
machine's going to do its work so while
it's<00:02:20.770> happening<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.220> don't<00:02:21.280> want<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.580> be

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's happening I don't want to be

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.430 
it's happening I don't want to be
touching<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:22.150> table<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.630> rocking<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> block

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
touching the table and rocking the block

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.040 
touching the table and rocking the block
or<00:02:23.680> anything<00:02:23.860> like<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.630> but<00:02:25.630> while<00:02:25.810> it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
or anything like that but while it's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.080 
or anything like that but while it's
taking<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.560> measurement<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:27.970> be

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
taking that measurement it's going to be

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.050 
taking that measurement it's going to be
plotting<00:02:28.569> out<00:02:28.720> those<00:02:29.050> those<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:30.160> picture<00:02:30.910> if

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
plotting out those those a picture if

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.850 
plotting out those those a picture if
you<00:02:31.090> will<00:02:31.330> mathematically<00:02:32.140> if<00:02:32.290> those<00:02:32.530> peaks

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
you will mathematically if those peaks

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.640 
you will mathematically if those peaks
and<00:02:33.069> valleys<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.630> then<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:34.989> use<00:02:35.260> that<00:02:35.440> to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
and valleys and then we use that to

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.680 
and valleys and then we use that to
determine<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.160> acceptability<00:02:36.730> in<00:02:37.180> terms<00:02:37.450> of

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
determine the acceptability in terms of

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.330 
determine the acceptability in terms of
you<00:02:38.080> know<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.349> deeper<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:38.769> grooves<00:02:39.010> are<00:02:39.190> the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
you know the deeper the grooves are the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.009 
you know the deeper the grooves are the
more<00:02:39.519> oil<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.060> will<00:02:40.209> be<00:02:40.360> retained<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.870> so

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
more oil that will be retained and so

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.479 
more oil that will be retained and so
the<00:02:41.110> more<00:02:41.230> lubrication<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.160> engine<00:02:42.370> will

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
the more lubrication the engine will

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.979 
the more lubrication the engine will
have<00:02:42.519> if<00:02:42.910> we<00:02:43.000> don't<00:02:43.150> get<00:02:43.269> them<00:02:43.390> deep<00:02:43.569> and<00:02:43.690> up<00:02:43.840> or

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
have if we don't get them deep and up or

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.860 
have if we don't get them deep and up or
if<00:02:44.049> we<00:02:44.140> get<00:02:44.260> them<00:02:44.350> too<00:02:44.620> deep<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:45.790> affects<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
if we get them too deep it affects the

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.770 
if we get them too deep it affects the
crosshatch<00:02:47.680> angle<00:02:48.220> then<00:02:48.459> affects<00:02:49.390> how<00:02:49.600> much

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
crosshatch angle then affects how much

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.509 
crosshatch angle then affects how much
the<00:02:49.959> Rings<00:02:50.140> want<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.440> turn<00:02:50.650> in<00:02:50.980> there<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.370> so

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the Rings want to turn in there and so

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.670 
the Rings want to turn in there and so
on<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.150> so<00:02:52.299> forth<00:02:52.569> and<00:02:52.720> now<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.500> we've<00:02:53.650> got

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
on and so forth and now that we've got

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.670 
on and so forth and now that we've got
an<00:02:54.069> average<00:02:54.250> here<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:55.599> machine's<00:02:55.930> done<00:02:56.230> we'll

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
an average here the machine's done we'll

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.320 
an average here the machine's done we'll
just<00:02:56.860> hit<00:02:56.950> print<00:02:57.310> on<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.790> thing<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.239> will

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
just hit print on the thing and it will

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.620 
just hit print on the thing and it will
print<00:02:58.540> out<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> little<00:02:59.080> report<00:02:59.500> for<00:02:59.709> us<00:03:00.630> now

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
print out a little report for us now

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.509 
print out a little report for us now
that<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:01.989> printed<00:03:02.349> out<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.769> can<00:03:03.099> tear<00:03:03.280> it<00:03:03.400> off

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
that it's printed out I can tear it off

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.100 
that it's printed out I can tear it off
and<00:03:03.549> I<00:03:03.819> can<00:03:04.030> see<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.660> this<00:03:04.750> particular

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
and I can see that for this particular

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.809 
and I can see that for this particular
cylinder<00:03:05.590> I'm<00:03:05.830> measuring<00:03:06.040> at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> bottom<00:03:06.730> of

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
cylinder I'm measuring at the bottom of

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:07.229 
cylinder I'm measuring at the bottom of
the<00:03:06.910> cylinder

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
the cylinder

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.949 
the cylinder
it<00:03:07.690> gives<00:03:07.930> me<00:03:08.170> an<00:03:09.160> RA<00:03:09.549> an<00:03:10.120> average<00:03:10.660> roughness

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
it gives me an RA an average roughness

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.860 
it gives me an RA an average roughness
of<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.560> surface<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:12.220> eight<00:03:12.849> point<00:03:13.150> two<00:03:13.209> micro

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
of that surface of eight point two micro

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.569 
of that surface of eight point two micro
inches<00:03:14.230> or<00:03:14.380> eight<00:03:14.530> point<00:03:14.799> two<00:03:14.829> millionths<00:03:15.370> of

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
inches or eight point two millionths of

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:17.430 
inches or eight point two millionths of
an<00:03:15.700> inch<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.120> that's<00:03:16.570> pretty<00:03:16.900> acceptable

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
an inch and that's pretty acceptable

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.569 
an inch and that's pretty acceptable
because<00:03:17.650> we're<00:03:17.859> looking<00:03:17.980> for<00:03:18.160> somewhere

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
because we're looking for somewhere

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.599 
because we're looking for somewhere
between<00:03:18.640> oh<00:03:19.090> about<00:03:19.650> 10<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.920> 20<00:03:21.370> would<00:03:21.549> be

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
between oh about 10 and 20 would be

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.569 
between oh about 10 and 20 would be
great<00:03:22.030> as<00:03:22.780> low<00:03:23.079> as<00:03:23.290> 6<00:03:23.560> as<00:03:23.799> high<00:03:23.980> as<00:03:24.130> 25

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
great as low as 6 as high as 25

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.009 
great as low as 6 as high as 25
somewhere<00:03:25.060> in<00:03:25.120> there<00:03:25.209> would<00:03:25.329> be<00:03:25.359> good<00:03:25.630> and

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
somewhere in there would be good and

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.229 
somewhere in there would be good and
remember<00:03:26.980> that's<00:03:27.069> just<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.400> average<00:03:27.489> though

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
remember that's just the average though

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.580 
remember that's just the average though
and<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:28.780> doesn't<00:03:28.959> tell<00:03:29.200> us<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.380> whole

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
and so it doesn't tell us the whole

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:30.900 
and so it doesn't tell us the whole
story<00:03:29.620> we're<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.040> we're<00:03:30.370> also<00:03:30.489> going<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.790> be

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
story we're all we're also going to be

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.330 
story we're all we're also going to be
looking<00:03:31.060> at<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.900> average<00:03:32.500> peak<00:03:32.829> height<00:03:33.100> and

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
looking at the average peak height and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.130 
looking at the average peak height and
the<00:03:33.430> average<00:03:33.700> valley<00:03:34.000> height<00:03:34.269> has<00:03:34.540> two

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the average valley height has two

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.050 
the average valley height has two
cylinders<00:03:35.560> with<00:03:35.859> the<00:03:35.980> exact<00:03:36.280> same<00:03:36.459> average

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
cylinders with the exact same average

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.030 
cylinders with the exact same average
number<00:03:37.390> might<00:03:37.660> perform<00:03:38.049> totally<00:03:38.530> differently

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
number might perform totally differently

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.120 
number might perform totally differently
if<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.700> simply<00:03:40.090> had<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.569> deep<00:03:41.139> groove<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.620> once<00:03:41.829> in

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
if I simply had a deep groove in once in

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.979 
if I simply had a deep groove in once in
a<00:03:42.400> shallow<00:03:42.639> groove<00:03:42.940> in<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.150> other<00:03:43.299> but<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
a shallow groove in the other but the

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.240 
a shallow groove in the other but the
one<00:03:44.109> with<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.350> shallow<00:03:44.590> groove<00:03:44.829> has<00:03:44.980> higher

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
one with the shallow groove has higher

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.590 
one with the shallow groove has higher
Peaks<00:03:45.609> and<00:03:45.850> so<00:03:45.970> we<00:03:46.090> don't<00:03:46.150> want<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.359> look<00:03:46.450> at

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
Peaks and so we don't want to look at

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.050 
Peaks and so we don't want to look at
just<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.139> average<00:03:47.319> but<00:03:48.130> the<00:03:48.280> entire<00:03:48.549> values

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
just the average but the entire values

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.190 
just the average but the entire values
when<00:03:49.269> you<00:03:49.359> come<00:03:49.480> to<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.660> class<00:03:49.840> we'll<00:03:50.049> talk

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.440 
when you come to the class we'll talk
more<00:03:50.380> about<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.859> but<00:03:51.400> for<00:03:51.579> today<00:03:51.880> just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
more about that but for today just

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.699 
more about that but for today just
wanted<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:52.810> show<00:03:52.959> you<00:03:53.019> some<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.560> work<00:03:53.680> that

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
wanted to show you some of the work that

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.410 
wanted to show you some of the work that
we<00:03:53.980> do<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.280> preparing<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.760> put<00:03:54.940> these<00:03:55.060> engines

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
we do in preparing to put these engines

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:07.600 
we do in preparing to put these engines
together<00:03:55.569> thanks<00:03:56.290> for<00:03:56.380> your<00:03:56.440> time
