00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
going to see here just a second it takes

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.140 
going to see here just a second it takes
more<00:02:54.950> than<00:02:55.010> one<00:02:55.190> grenade<00:02:55.610> mob<00:02:55.849> so<00:02:56.030> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
more than one grenade mob so this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.569 
more than one grenade mob so this
renamed<00:02:56.450> mod<00:02:56.629> really<00:02:56.989> isn't<00:02:57.170> that<00:02:57.500> great<00:02:57.860> you

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
renamed mod really isn't that great you

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.100 
renamed mod really isn't that great you
can<00:02:58.760> chuck<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.239> thing<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.599> I<00:02:59.750> can<00:02:59.930> hit<00:03:00.079> a

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
can chuck that thing like I can hit a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.420 
can chuck that thing like I can hit a
dude<00:03:00.260> over<00:03:00.379> there<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.799> mountain<00:03:01.129> right<00:03:01.280> in

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
dude over there in a mountain right in

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.240 
dude over there in a mountain right in
his<00:03:01.489> face<00:03:02.209> with<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:02.900> fastball<00:03:03.590> if<00:03:03.680> I<00:03:03.860> wanted<00:03:04.190> to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
his face with a fastball if I wanted to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.460 
his face with a fastball if I wanted to
so<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.390> pretty<00:03:05.540> cool<00:03:05.750> grenade<00:03:06.079> mob<00:03:06.260> but

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so it's a pretty cool grenade mob but

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:07.960 
so it's a pretty cool grenade mob but
just<00:03:06.620> isn't<00:03:06.920> too<00:03:07.010> powerful<00:03:07.430> right<00:03:07.549> here<00:03:07.730> I'm

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
just isn't too powerful right here I'm

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.220 
just isn't too powerful right here I'm
skipping<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.510> head<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.810> to<00:03:08.900> show<00:03:09.170> you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230
