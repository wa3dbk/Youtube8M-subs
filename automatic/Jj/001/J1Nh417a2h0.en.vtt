00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
up here at the top then you're getting

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.340 
up here at the top then you're getting
all<00:04:13.040> of<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.610> signal<00:04:14.060> so<00:04:14.660> it's<00:04:14.810> got<00:04:15.020> a<00:04:15.050> loud

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
all of the signal so it's got a loud

the bottom or the wiper arm down here at
the<00:04:20.120> bottom<00:04:20.270> it's<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.140> ground<00:04:21.470> you're<00:04:21.739> going<00:04:21.920> to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
the bottom it's a ground you're going to

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.340 
the bottom it's a ground you're going to
have<00:04:22.100> no<00:04:22.280> volume<00:04:22.490> at<00:04:22.820> all<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.510> so<00:04:23.750> we<00:04:23.900> have<00:04:24.110> a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
have no volume at all and so we have a

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.180 
have no volume at all and so we have a
linear<00:04:25.750> volume<00:04:26.750> control<00:04:27.200> that<00:04:27.410> can<00:04:27.560> give<00:04:27.740> us<00:04:27.950> a

on<00:04:31.640> where<00:04:31.820> we<00:04:32.030> place<00:04:32.660> this<00:04:32.900> wiper<00:04:33.230> arm<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:34.190> this

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
on where we place this wiper arm on this

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.520 
on where we place this wiper arm on this
potentiometer<00:04:36.050> here<00:04:36.920> the<00:04:37.760> capacitor<00:04:38.450> is<00:04:38.660> here

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
potentiometer here the capacitor is here

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.810 
potentiometer here the capacitor is here
to<00:04:39.680> decouple<00:04:41.020> DC<00:04:42.020> but<00:04:42.230> pass<00:04:42.470> AC<00:04:42.890> so<00:04:43.460> we<00:04:43.580> still

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
to decouple DC but pass AC so we still

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.320 
to decouple DC but pass AC so we still
have<00:04:44.000> our<00:04:44.230> signal<00:04:45.230> here<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:46.090> we're<00:04:47.090> feeding

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330

put<00:04:55.190> a<00:04:55.220> little<00:04:55.460> capacitor<00:04:56.120> here<00:04:56.450> on<00:04:57.080> this

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
put a little capacitor here on this

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:00.970 
put a little capacitor here on this

the<00:06:16.740> flow<00:06:17.460> of<00:06:17.580> current<00:06:17.970> from<00:06:18.840> ground<00:06:19.280> through

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
the flow of current from ground through

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.730 
the flow of current from ground through
here<00:06:20.760> through<00:06:21.360> there<00:06:21.599> and<00:06:21.990> back<00:06:22.199> up<00:06:22.440> to<00:06:22.470> the

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
here through there and back up to the

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.510 
here through there and back up to the
positive<00:06:23.160> supply<00:06:23.599> that<00:06:24.599> then<00:06:25.139> would<00:06:25.860> amplify

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
positive supply that then would amplify

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.830 
positive supply that then would amplify
this<00:06:26.580> signal<00:06:27.300> a<00:06:27.949> great<00:06:28.949> deal<00:06:29.250> and<00:06:29.690> then<00:06:30.690> it

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
this signal a great deal and then it

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.779 
this signal a great deal and then it
feeds<00:06:31.169> through<00:06:31.349> this<00:06:31.680> capacitor<00:06:31.919> and<00:06:32.430> then

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:32.789 
feeds through this capacitor and then

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.370 
feeds through this capacitor and then
through<00:06:33.150> to<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:34.910> loudspeaker<00:06:35.930> to<00:06:36.930> make

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
through to this loudspeaker to make

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.310 
through to this loudspeaker to make
sound<00:06:37.919> in<00:06:38.880> this<00:06:39.210> case<00:06:39.479> so<00:06:39.750> this<00:06:39.960> is<00:06:40.139> the<00:06:40.260> way

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:40.320 
sound in this case so this is the way

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.409 
sound in this case so this is the way
the<00:06:40.470> amplifier<00:06:40.949> is<00:06:41.099> working<00:06:41.490> a<00:06:41.699> little<00:06:42.120> bitty

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:42.419 
the amplifier is working a little bitty

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.290 
the amplifier is working a little bitty
signal<00:06:42.870> at<00:06:42.990> this<00:06:43.199> point<00:06:43.560> is<00:06:44.090> controlling<00:06:45.090> and

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
signal at this point is controlling and

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.810 
signal at this point is controlling and
making<00:06:46.169> a<00:06:46.289> great<00:06:46.409> big<00:06:46.710> signal<00:06:47.130> at<00:06:47.250> this<00:06:47.460> point

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:47.820 
making a great big signal at this point

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.290 
making a great big signal at this point
I<00:06:48.120> could<00:06:48.690> also<00:06:49.190> put<00:06:50.190> a<00:06:50.220> dropping<00:06:50.760> resistor

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
I could also put a dropping resistor

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.920 
I could also put a dropping resistor
here<00:06:51.630> -<00:06:52.580> you<00:06:53.580> know<00:06:53.610> bias<00:06:54.000> my<00:06:54.270> transistor

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:54.930 
here - you know bias my transistor

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:56.390 
here - you know bias my transistor
further<00:06:55.229> and<00:06:55.380> allow<00:06:55.560> the<00:06:55.620> signal<00:06:56.010> to<00:06:56.070> be<00:06:56.159> fed

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 
further and allow the signal to be fed

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:12.990 
further and allow the signal to be fed
to<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.550> speaker<00:06:57.030> better

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.060
