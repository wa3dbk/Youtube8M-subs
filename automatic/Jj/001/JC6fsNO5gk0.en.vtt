checkpoint so you pause refer to I safe

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.520 
checkpoint so you pause refer to I safe
and<00:01:16.880> you<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.869> repeat<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.500> that

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.030 
Bravo play throw at it it took me a
while<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:21.000> get<00:04:21.299> to<00:04:21.359> it<00:04:21.630> and<00:04:21.780> then<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.889> get<00:04:22.979> a

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
while to get to it and then you get a

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.740 
while to get to it and then you get a
check<00:04:23.280> phone<00:04:23.460> right<00:04:23.700> before<00:04:23.729> here<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.660> you

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
check phone right before here and you

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.629 
check phone right before here and you
just<00:04:25.050> repeatedly<00:04:25.500> triple<00:04:25.860> phantoms<00:04:26.280> you<00:04:26.490> get

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
just repeatedly triple phantoms you get

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.570 
just repeatedly triple phantoms you get
quite<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> few<00:04:27.060> credits<00:04:27.600> for<00:04:27.900> appearances<00:04:28.580> so

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
quite a few credits for appearances so

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.940 
quite a few credits for appearances so
it's<00:04:29.940> fairly<00:04:30.570> good<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.020> then<00:04:31.560> you<00:04:31.770> just

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
it's fairly good and then you just

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.270 
it's fairly good and then you just
revert<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.280> last<00:04:32.580> checkpoint<00:04:33.240> before<00:04:33.810> you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
revert to last checkpoint before you

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:40.430 
revert to last checkpoint before you
shoot<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:36.290> Corvette<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:38.130> from<00:04:39.090> in<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.750> laser

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
shoot the Corvette it from in the laser

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.990 
shoot the Corvette it from in the laser
glasses

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
glasses

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.240 
glasses
so<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:42.720> fairly<00:04:42.870> simple<00:04:43.110> but<00:04:43.530> as<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.860> said<00:04:43.920> I

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
so it's fairly simple but as I said I

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.510 
so it's fairly simple but as I said I
didn't<00:04:44.580> get<00:04:44.670> very<00:04:44.790> good<00:04:44.910> as<00:04:45.120> those<00:04:45.300> for<00:04:45.570> us

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
didn't get very good as those for us

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.430 
didn't get very good as those for us
that<00:04:47.520> you<00:04:47.970> know<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.450> might<00:04:48.630> be<00:04:48.660> different<00:04:49.050> I

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
that you know you might be different I

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.160 
that you know you might be different I
might've<00:04:49.920> been<00:04:50.100> unlucky<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.970> my<00:04:51.630> checkpoint

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:52.170 
might've been unlucky and my checkpoint

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.080 
might've been unlucky and my checkpoint
wasn't<00:04:52.500> the<00:04:52.560> best<00:04:52.740> side<00:04:53.010> took<00:04:53.490> about<00:04:53.790> 30

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
wasn't the best side took about 30

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.270 
wasn't the best side took about 30
seconds<00:04:54.510> every<00:04:54.720> time<00:04:54.930> to<00:04:55.080> get<00:04:55.230> off<00:04:55.350> there<00:04:55.620> but

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
seconds every time to get off there but

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.800 
seconds every time to get off there but
I<00:04:56.400> recommend<00:04:56.880> doing<00:04:57.030> one<00:04:57.300> of<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.450> other<00:04:57.570> ones

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
I recommend doing one of the other ones

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.570 
I recommend doing one of the other ones
instead<00:04:58.110> of<00:04:58.260> it<00:04:58.380> which<00:04:58.710> is<00:04:58.860> why<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.040> left<00:04:59.280> it<00:04:59.460> to

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
instead of it which is why I left it to

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.880 
instead of it which is why I left it to
us<00:05:01.160> alright<00:05:02.160> so<00:05:02.640> and<00:05:03.410> at<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.590> end<00:05:04.710> of<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
us alright so and at the end of the

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.760 
us alright so and at the end of the
video<00:05:05.010> i<00:05:05.160> put<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.550> random<00:05:05.910> promo<00:05:06.410> for<00:05:07.410> the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
video i put a random promo for the

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.450 
video i put a random promo for the
machinima<00:05:08.430> means<00:05:09.210> the<00:05:09.420> front<00:05:09.660> of<00:05:09.780> making<00:05:10.110> and

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
machinima means the front of making and

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.950 
machinima means the front of making and
hopefully<00:05:11.460> that'll<00:05:11.640> be<00:05:11.730> good<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.570> watch<00:05:12.930> that
