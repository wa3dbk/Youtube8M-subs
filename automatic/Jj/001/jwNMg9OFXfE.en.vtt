in<00:00:00.750> this<00:00:01.020> pen<00:00:01.319> making<00:00:01.680> mini<00:00:01.860> I'm<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.190> to

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
in this pen making mini I'm going to

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.670 
in this pen making mini I'm going to
show<00:00:02.370> you<00:00:02.429> why<00:00:02.639> I<00:00:02.669> use<00:00:03.030> a<00:00:03.060> parallel<00:00:03.689> clamp<00:00:04.020> to

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
show you why I use a parallel clamp to

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.290 
show you why I use a parallel clamp to
put<00:00:04.890> together<00:00:04.980> pens<00:00:05.490> go<00:00:06.029> ahead<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.359> use<00:00:06.569> this

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.300 
put together pens go ahead and use this

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.020 
put together pens go ahead and use this
this<00:00:09.300> clamp<00:00:09.750> for<00:00:10.260> putting<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.340> together<00:00:11.519> let

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
this clamp for putting this together let

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.660 
this clamp for putting this together let
me<00:00:12.090> show<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.300> why<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> do<00:00:12.780> this

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
me show you why I do this

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.550 
me show you why I do this
these<00:00:14.670> parallel<00:00:15.269> clamps<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:15.900> happens<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.440> be

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
these parallel clamps this happens to be

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.380 
these parallel clamps this happens to be
a<00:00:16.590> jet<00:00:16.890> but<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.220> could<00:00:17.369> use<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> Bessie<00:00:18.060> or

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
a jet but you could use a Bessie or

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.720 
a jet but you could use a Bessie or
Erlin<00:00:18.990> or<00:00:19.170> whoever<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:20.070> these<00:00:20.220> parallel

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Erlin or whoever but these parallel

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
Erlin or whoever but these parallel
clamps<00:00:21.119> are<00:00:21.240> probably<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.779> greatest<00:00:22.050> thing<00:00:22.380> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
clamps are probably the greatest thing I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.570 
clamps are probably the greatest thing I
use<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.609> regular<00:00:23.670> basis<00:00:24.390> in<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.600> shop<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
use on a regular basis in the shop and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.670 
use on a regular basis in the shop and
I've<00:00:26.580> never<00:00:26.789> been<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.090> fan<00:00:27.359> of<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.720> pen<00:00:27.960> press<00:00:28.320> I

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
I've never been a fan of the pen press I

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.589 
I've never been a fan of the pen press I
don't<00:00:29.310> like<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> Flex<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.300> way<00:00:30.420> they

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
don't like the Flex and the way they

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.770 
don't like the Flex and the way they
work<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.920> recently<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.480> lot<00:00:33.690> of

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
work and I recently I know a lot of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.560 
work and I recently I know a lot of
people<00:00:33.989> use<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:35.430> don't<00:00:36.300> know<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.450> they're

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
people use the I don't know what they're

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.780 
people use the I don't know what they're
called<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.899> hand<00:00:37.170> squeeze<00:00:38.100> clamps<00:00:38.550> pressure

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
called the hand squeeze clamps pressure

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.400 
called the hand squeeze clamps pressure
clamps<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.480> used<00:00:39.660> those<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.050> beginning

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
clamps and I used those in the beginning

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.260 
clamps and I used those in the beginning
and<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.590> always<00:00:40.829> broke<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.489> probably<00:00:41.910> broke

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
and I always broke them I probably broke

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
and I always broke them I probably broke
20<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.930> those<00:00:43.079> things<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> years<00:00:43.980> and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
20 of those things over the years and

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.279 
20 of those things over the years and
one<00:00:44.940> day<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.329> like<00:00:45.510> oh<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:45.960> know<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.110> just

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
one day I was like oh you know I just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.540 
one day I was like oh you know I just
need<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.559> put<00:00:46.860> something<00:00:47.010> together<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.370> quick

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
need to put something together a quick

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
need to put something together a quick
and<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:47.820> grabbed<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.360> these<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.780> I've<00:00:49.230> been

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and I grabbed one of these and I've been

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170 
and I grabbed one of these and I've been
using<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.710> ever<00:00:49.890> since<00:00:49.980> when<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.700> doesn't<00:00:51.000> fit

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
using it ever since when it doesn't fit

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.240 
using it ever since when it doesn't fit
in<00:00:51.270> my<00:00:51.300> arbor<00:00:51.750> press<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.710> reason<00:00:53.070> being

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
in my arbor press and the reason being

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.650 
in my arbor press and the reason being
is<00:00:53.489> these<00:00:53.760> clamps<00:00:54.239> are<00:00:55.129> perfectly<00:00:56.129> square<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
is these clamps are perfectly square you

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.779 
is these clamps are perfectly square you
can<00:00:57.780> adjust<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.620> any<00:00:58.920> length<00:00:59.430> really

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
can adjust them to any length really

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.970 
can adjust them to any length really
quickly<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.420> easily<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.989> you've<00:01:01.620> got<00:01:01.829> an

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
quickly and easily and you've got an

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920 
quickly and easily and you've got an
amazing<00:01:02.579> amount<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.000> pressure<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.780> this

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
amazing amount of pressure here in this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.410 
amazing amount of pressure here in this
handle<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.409> when<00:01:04.619> you're<00:01:04.799> twisting<00:01:05.369> this<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
handle so when you're twisting this it's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.270 
handle so when you're twisting this it's
applying<00:01:06.869> an<00:01:07.320> amazing<00:01:07.770> amount<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.010> pressure

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
applying an amazing amount of pressure

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130 
applying an amazing amount of pressure
and<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.760> square<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.659> i<00:01:09.810> think<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.110> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and it's square which i think is the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
and it's square which i think is the
most<00:01:10.380> important<00:01:10.860> thing<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.010> if<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.970> start

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
most important thing so if you start

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.359 
most important thing so if you start
this<00:01:12.600> square<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.350> put<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.799> in<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.070> it's

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
this square and put it in this it's

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.670 
this square and put it in this it's
gonna<00:01:14.460> stay<00:01:14.760> square<00:01:15.090> now<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:16.020> being<00:01:16.229> said<00:01:16.320> if

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
gonna stay square now that being said if

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.929 
gonna stay square now that being said if
you<00:01:16.710> start<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.430> slightly<00:01:17.670> crooked

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
you start it and it's slightly crooked

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.399 
you start it and it's slightly crooked
this<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.360> going<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.540> exaggerate<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> because

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this is going to exaggerate it because

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.340 
this is going to exaggerate it because
it's<00:01:19.560> gonna<00:01:19.680> press<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.070> square<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:22.200> always

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
it's gonna press it square so you always

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.010 
it's gonna press it square so you always
want<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.740> careful<00:01:23.630> you<00:01:24.630> know<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.900> you're

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
want to be careful you know that you're

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510 
want to be careful you know that you're
starting<00:01:25.259> square<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.950> want<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.159> get<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> lined

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
starting square you want to get it lined

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.280 
starting square you want to get it lined
up<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:27.210> I'll<00:01:27.360> do<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> apply<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.200> little

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
up what I'll do is apply a little

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
up what I'll do is apply a little
pressure<00:01:28.500> take<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> out<00:01:29.189> turn<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> make<00:01:29.700> sure

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pressure take it out turn it make sure

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.120 
pressure take it out turn it make sure
I'm<00:01:29.939> square<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.659> keep<00:01:30.840> going<00:01:30.979> one<00:01:31.979> other

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
I'm square and then keep going one other

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.149 
I'm square and then keep going one other
quick<00:01:32.430> tip<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:32.939> this<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:34.350> using<00:01:34.920> this

clamp<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.920> pen<00:01:37.920> press<00:01:38.250> is<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.880> always<00:01:39.390> put<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
clamp as a pen press is I always put a

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.620 
clamp as a pen press is I always put a
clamp<00:01:40.100> right<00:01:41.100> on<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> end<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.909> here's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
clamp right on the end here and here's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.410 
clamp right on the end here and here's
the<00:01:42.780> reason<00:01:42.990> being<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:44.159> can<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.909> my<00:01:45.090> clamp

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
the reason being is I can put my clamp

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.450 
the reason being is I can put my clamp
up<00:01:45.600> against<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.380> then<00:01:46.470> when<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> go<00:01:47.399> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
up against this and then when I go to

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.060 
up against this and then when I go to
push<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.000> I'm<00:01:48.600> not<00:01:48.840> sliding<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.560> clamp<00:01:49.890> off

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
push this I'm not sliding the clamp off

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
push this I'm not sliding the clamp off
the<00:01:50.100> table<00:01:50.640> so<00:01:51.060> having<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.750> clamp<00:01:52.110> here

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
the table so having this clamp here

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.330 
the table so having this clamp here
allows<00:01:53.070> me<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.810> move<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.259> very<00:01:56.130> easily

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
allows me to move that one very easily

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.719 
allows me to move that one very easily
and<00:01:56.759> then<00:01:57.329> apply<00:01:57.600> pressure<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.799> I<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.670> know

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
and then apply pressure and I don't know

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.999 
and then apply pressure and I don't know
how<00:01:59.939> well<00:02:00.180> that's<00:02:00.329> gonna<00:02:00.540> pick<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.409> mean

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
how well that's gonna pick up but I mean

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.230 
how well that's gonna pick up but I mean
it<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.250> goes<00:02:02.460> together<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.939> perfectly

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.690 

and<00:02:07.240> then<00:02:07.330> I<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.660> loosen<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.680> make<00:02:09.400> sure<00:02:09.430> I'm

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and then I can loosen it make sure I'm

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.520 
and then I can loosen it make sure I'm
pressed<00:02:09.970> all<00:02:10.119> the<00:02:10.150> way<00:02:10.330> around<00:02:10.600> rotate<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.410> if

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
pressed all the way around rotate it if

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.350 
pressed all the way around rotate it if
you'd<00:02:11.680> like<00:02:13.110> and<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:15.520> have<00:02:15.820> one<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.270> these

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
you'd like and I have one of these

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.300 
you'd like and I have one of these
clamps<00:02:16.750> it's<00:02:17.020> not<00:02:17.200> this<00:02:17.410> one<00:02:17.650> but<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:17.980> have<00:02:18.130> one

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
clamps it's not this one but I have one

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.040 
clamps it's not this one but I have one
of<00:02:18.400> these<00:02:18.490> that<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.700> use<00:02:18.940> regularly<00:02:19.390> that<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> put

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
of these that I use regularly that I put

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.740 
of these that I use regularly that I put
felt<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.620> here<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:22.240> way<00:02:22.360> I<00:02:22.390> don't<00:02:22.450> bugger

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
felt in here and that way I don't bugger

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.770 
felt in here and that way I don't bugger
up<00:02:22.960> any<00:02:23.110> parts<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:24.280> it's<00:02:24.730> my<00:02:24.940> choice<00:02:25.360> for

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
up any parts but it's it's my choice for

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.710 
up any parts but it's it's my choice for
putting<00:02:26.470> pens<00:02:26.740> together<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.520> great<00:02:27.720> way

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
putting pens together it's a great way

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.610 
putting pens together it's a great way
to<00:02:28.950> efficiently<00:02:29.950> put<00:02:30.220> a<00:02:30.280> pen<00:02:30.460> together
