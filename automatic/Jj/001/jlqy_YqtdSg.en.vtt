00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
are your redstone all the way around to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.060 
are your redstone all the way around to
the<00:01:06.450> back<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.900> then<00:01:06.990> into<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.590> middle<00:01:07.920> hole

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
the back and then into the middle hole

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.550 
the back and then into the middle hole
that<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.369> knock<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> block<00:01:08.909> out<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.360> first<00:01:10.080> so

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
that you knock the block out of first so

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.550 
that you knock the block out of first so
then<00:01:10.710> when<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> turn<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.310> switch<00:01:12.000> on

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
then when you turn the switch on

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.840 
then when you turn the switch on
actually<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:13.799> lights<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.250> all<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.670> it<00:01:14.790> you

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
actually it lights up all of it you

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.920 
actually it lights up all of it you
don't<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.150> go<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> back<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.780> check

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
don't have to go on the back and check

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
don't have to go on the back and check
because<00:01:16.110> if<00:01:16.350> you're<00:01:16.470> looking<00:01:16.590> towards<00:01:17.220> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
because if you're looking towards the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.120 
because if you're looking towards the
hole<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.640> it's<00:01:17.790> lit<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:17.970> then<00:01:18.799> it's<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:19.950> good

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
hole and it's lit up then it's all good

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.859 
hole and it's lit up then it's all good
because<00:01:20.220> dancing<00:01:20.820> waste<00:01:21.390> time<00:01:21.570> running

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869

just fire all the arrows when all of
them<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.189> loads<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.610> loads<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.850> arrows<00:01:42.380> onto

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
them just loads and loads of arrows onto

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.510 
them just loads and loads of arrows onto
the<00:01:43.770> top<00:01:44.040> block<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.520> TNT<00:01:45.829> this<00:01:46.829> isn't<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.369> glitch

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
the top block of TNT this isn't a glitch

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.670 
the top block of TNT this isn't a glitch
this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> quarter<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.229> something<00:01:49.590> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
this is just a quarter on something to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.609 
this is just a quarter on something to
do<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.549> quite<00:01:50.939> cool<00:01:51.119> once<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.540> does<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.439> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
do it's quite cool once it does in it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
do it's quite cool once it does in it
sometimes<00:01:52.860> kills<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.579> and<00:01:53.610> sometimes<00:01:54.210> does

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
sometimes kills you and sometimes does

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.690 
sometimes kills you and sometimes does
it<00:01:54.600> depends<00:01:55.020> where<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.200> arrows<00:01:55.649> go<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.430> as<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
it depends where the arrows go so as you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.240 
it depends where the arrows go so as you
see<00:01:56.880> I've<00:01:57.000> pretty<00:01:57.240> much<00:01:57.329> filled<00:01:57.960> up<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.890> top

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
don't know to duplicate them just search

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.070 
don't know to duplicate them just search
it<00:02:07.860> search<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.580> youtube<00:02:08.910> then<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.690> can<00:02:09.840> flick

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
the switch and then all the arrows

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.550 
the switch and then all the arrows
should<00:02:12.360> spaz<00:02:12.660> out<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:12.989> want<00:02:13.110> to

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
should spaz out and want to

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.050 
should spaz out and want to
explodes<00:02:13.950> all<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.340> arrows<00:02:14.610> will<00:02:14.760> shoot<00:02:14.940> up

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
explodes all the arrows will shoot up

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.850 
explodes all the arrows will shoot up
into<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.390> air<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.599> quite<00:02:15.780> cool<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.020> do<00:02:16.290> it's

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
into the air it's quite cool to do it's

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.220 
into the air it's quite cool to do it's
not<00:02:17.010> very<00:02:17.250> effective<00:02:17.550> like<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.090> said<00:02:18.330> but<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
not very effective like I said but it's

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.680 
not very effective like I said but it's
quite<00:02:20.069> cool<00:02:20.220> to<00:02:20.370> do<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:20.700> then<00:02:20.790> oh<00:02:20.970> do<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.569> again

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
quite cool to do and then oh do it again

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.270 
quite cool to do and then oh do it again
show<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> as<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.440> see<00:02:22.590> some<00:02:22.830> arrows<00:02:23.130> don't

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
show you as you see some arrows don't

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.630 
show you as you see some arrows don't
actually<00:02:23.660> shoot<00:02:24.660> off<00:02:24.870> but<00:02:25.250> already<00:02:26.250> held<00:02:26.489> back

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
actually shoot off but already held back

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.390
