00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.190
 today four looks have tried to 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.380
 well tried to deal with the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.260
 normally say so because it is 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.580
 very well you know her post but yes 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.430
 After this, other things can be added 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.109
 So we started together at four 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.400
 try out different techniques 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.840
 I'm really curious what you guys do 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.270
 have to feel well so i have with 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.070
 sets to get own made 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.190
 I've done I pick on every time 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.020
 caught and then pulled down and 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 then say twisted in and the bottom 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.660
 inside so he say for 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.280
 from inside out and yes so 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.829
 not normal suppose i even wear it that way 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.320
 and more often some more what the 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.750
 messy hair got a pretty neat say 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.730
 but I think he did well 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.739
 yes but i also really like this one 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.190
 glam look or anyway became from set 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.260
 look 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:10.350
 yes for this and I say yes I think so 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.540
 nice further 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.450
 well i'm kind of hermione it 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.340
 Harry Potter Look I have 4 braids in it 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.960
 but made and if you have thicker hair 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.490
 or more hair then you have to give him something 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.340
 More braids make what our get you 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.610
 it not with stilts and the presents 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.409
 above and below and over it 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.189
 then taken out and then you get one 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.320
 kind of how does it look like 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.079
 it immediately becomes frisee with me 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.909
 because the but naturally curls 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.680
 so maybe it would be with hair spray 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.380
 can do more and then the about one that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.110
 the waves get tighter 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.790
 but you before me this is your curls and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.560
 your style hair or she walks 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.899
 yes maybe from that your control spray 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.759
 helps you can I think personally 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.220
 even though no viewer live harmony 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.200
 but yes i was once i had one 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:10.009
 theme party to wash chance hermie 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:13.069
 when i too i stretched my response 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.330
 well i have i can get started so easily 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.230
 Make like you made 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.160
 but i thought i would try one 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.530
 something else 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.970
 and I tried what I did 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.349
 accidentally encountered on the internet and that 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290
 is that you love your hair 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.600
 dreads running as it were nice and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.430
 some hairspray over it and threw it 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.019
 then several times with the sets about it 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 and that would be a blow to me 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.709
 must give 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.200
 well i don't know if it should blame on 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.040
 the style of how thick my hair is 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.450
 It looks worse than when I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.549
 can't recommend it for people with 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.099
 dick couple her as I've already 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.680
 once yes take that then you really have something 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.160
 more we need more power so 9 in addition 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.830
 it was n't such a success either 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.810
 well i usually have with sets 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.730
 to blood and that is the bottom especially 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.470
 2000 at mid-way through it moves to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.600
 run down the lofts 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.940
 more on the hot just yet 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.329
 and then to the window frame and then you get 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.340
 you can go along a bit more often 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.120
 sick rashford nice so i of course 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.319
 secured but yes I think sets 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.319
 the market must say very honestly 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:21.319
 that now that I have it it wants to be fine 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.150
 but everyone is all this 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:25.459
 I think you see almost everything is 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.980
 that the but for what it is for sweden 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:29.299
 yes yes and otherwise more usual a curl 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.030
 too but yes very easy 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.859
 timon yes it was with you well i am 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.180
 this knows what I am doing this very well 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.950
 nice but maybe it's just too 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.260
 for my hair kind of say but i have one 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.609
 little slaughter in but some firm 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 hair making it easy to curl 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.620
 both it can place and make me feel 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.620
 to do well
