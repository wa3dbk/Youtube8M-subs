00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 hello everyone today I 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.030
 come back for a little hairdressing tutorial 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:12.860
 so we are in the summer it's hot on 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.809
 does not necessarily support having the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.880
 hair finally released any case me that's me 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.009
 inflates very very quickly to be very hot 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.270
 a blow salon here if you're like 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.439
 me and you have no hair 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.789
 very very long it is not always 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:23.960
 obvious to find what hairstyle to do 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.329
 so I'm going to show you how I 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.950
 do this little hairstyle that is neither 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:30.259
 more and no less than a little tail of 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.489
 horse with a bomber over the 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.000
 head to give a little bit more 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.040
 style 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.899
 so you're going to say that's enough 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.270
 go on that it's pretty simple we see 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.950
 everywhere it's not complicated yes but there 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.440
 there is a little tip for the hair 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.449
 long or very thick hair I'm going 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.789
 explain that to you right now 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.620
 and yes there on the ground there is something 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.859
 So do I get my my nalliers 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.629
 Half half boar bristle brush 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.100
 little plastic spikes like that I 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.739
 untangle them and at the same time I make them 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.899
 a little good so I bring everything back to 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.999
 the back of the head at the end because 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.050
 that in fact I want to be able to take my 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:08.990
 wick of the top so I'm getting caught 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.610
 roughly with the brush 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.390
 because that's what will actually 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.740
 the hull of the hairstyle 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.750
 so I check that I took the 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.840
 good quantity hair is good it's 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.860
 party then we go right as 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.690
 I took it all a bit 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.270
 I will try to redo a little more 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.010
 correctly back to the level of 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.120
 stop but good with the finger a nothing 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.300
 very accurate 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.510
 then I restart a shot and that's where 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.270
 that happens the very very glam part of 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.130
 I'm going to tie them up and 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.230
 leave them on the word of my skull for 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.700
 that it does not bother me and yes that's the 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.890
 head 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.570
 then I re mails all the back 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.480
 of the head and I'm going to come make a 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.240
 very very hot tail so I do not hesitate 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.730
 to well pulled the hair so that this 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.530
 be well flat I do not like at all 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.580
 when there are bumps so I try the 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.160
 as much as possible flatten all that 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.650
 and especially to get back up the tail of 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.390
 horse because he had very very high for 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:13.430
 that we actually have before when we 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:17.030
 look from the front then I polish a 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:19.640
 little bit of all this and once that's me 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.230
 not bad I'll catch a 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.069
 giant elastic then you are not 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.659
 obliged to take a 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.829
 so big elastic 1 but with the 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.810
 mop that I have it's true that I like 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.870
 take big elastic that I fold 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.030
 in two it allows to really have in 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.829
 the very very tight elastic es1 that goes 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.139
 really well hold the ponytail 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.549
 in place so it's a little habit 

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:39.290
 personal but you can also take 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.060
 a simple elastic there is no 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.400
 worry then at first I 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.379
 am going to do a kind of little do not that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.269
 I say they do not look like anything but 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.230
 this is me I like to have this little 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.319
 happiness on the head 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.439
 quickly done well and so I'm busy 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:57.379
 then the wick of the levant I'm wearing 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:59.689
 all the way forward and I'm going to take a 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.849
 first section of hair then neither 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.980
 too thin or too thick the goal is 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.299
 not to spend three hours so we 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.189
 do not take too much lashes too thin 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.879
 but big enough anyway for 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.079
 to be able to deal with them with a simple sentence 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.680
 so I take a second 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:17.090
 section and I redo I like pancakes 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.599
 always fast it's not worth it 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.609
 apply 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.219
 the crepe is really to give 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.949
 volume not to have an effect all of 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.049
 ready-to-use loan as we 

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:29.419
 could say that's it's really for 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.519
 give a small very bulky side I 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:33.079
 do not know yet the last nasty of 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:39.819
 moncan wholesale I would have made four 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:39.819
 sections and so I go to the last 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.319
 so of course it's not the 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.810
 final result 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:50.000
 now i'm going to put a little bit 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.819
 lacquer so that's the net of 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.470
 l'oreal simply jean vaporizes a 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:56.689
 little bit everywhere between the wicks 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:04.400
 behind the wicks for the crepe 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:06.530
 who really like and yes lacquer 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.799
 elnett feels very very strong finally in everything 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.139
 case for me and then I bring back the 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.560
 Mass backwards and with the brush 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:17.780
 I'm going to come up just very very 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.840
 delicately is always on the surface the 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.400
 on top for it to be smooth but 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.860
 especially not going very deep for 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.539
 do not undo the crepe so there just 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.740
 a little bit to see how is this 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.160
 that I'm going to do for it to be 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.860
 really 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.530
 an effect that I expect and once 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:36.410
 I found I take another elastic 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.650
 and I'm going to hang the wick in 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.990
 done over my little donuts in the 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.090
 leaving loose so as to have the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.770
 volume and the hull is actually this 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.720
 system will simply allow that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.370
 if as you go 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.860
 the ponytail as she is a 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.360
 little heavier tends to go down 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.000
 at the level of the skull 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.730
 well it's not going to catch the wick 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.920
 with and so that's not going to make it from 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.780
 more and more flat as you go 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.740
 as the hours go by and that's why 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.390
 that I find this trick very 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.800
 interesting so then I'm going 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:08.540
 to take care of the little locks behind 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.910
 which of course since I have a 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.590
 short square tend to fall to not 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.570
 not stay in the little not clear 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:16.480
 than sorry and I just take 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.770
 a small bar to fix everything 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.910
 so I often do my hair like that 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.410
 even if there are small wicks that 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.620
 exceeds buns as you can 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.000
 see 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.770
 personally it's not something 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.970
 something that bugs me too much because 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:27.440
 that I have short hair so 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.150
 after I do not necessarily have the choice or 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.030
 so to put another bar is for 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.650
 bring them all together but if 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.590
 you do not mind you can very 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.300
 well take out all the hair of 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.940
 elastics and at that moment you 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.250
 get a ponytail that is very 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.040
 very nice too with this little hull 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.250
 bulging on the skull and so here is the 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.250
 result 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.099
 I hope this tutorial will have pleased you in 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:56.060
 Waiting I 'm doing a lot of big fat 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.060
 kisses habito
