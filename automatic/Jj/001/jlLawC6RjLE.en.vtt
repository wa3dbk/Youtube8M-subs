00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
that doesn't that is not powered in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.610 
that doesn't that is not powered in
other<00:00:48.539> words<00:00:48.780> there's<00:00:48.930> no<00:00:48.989> wiring<00:00:49.289> up<00:00:49.500> there

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
other words there's no wiring up there

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
other words there's no wiring up there
yeah<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.399> have<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> be<00:00:50.820> able<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> route<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
yeah you have to be able to route the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
yeah you have to be able to route the
wires<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:51.960> there<00:00:52.140> somehow<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.590> good<00:00:52.890> installer

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
wires up there somehow a good installer

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
wires up there somehow a good installer
a<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.760> technician<00:00:54.120> will<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.170> able<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> get

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
a good technician will be able to get

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.350 
a good technician will be able to get
the<00:00:55.860> wires<00:00:56.100> up<00:00:56.430> there<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> positive<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the wires up there the positive and the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.080 
the wires up there the positive and the
negative<00:00:57.390> 12<00:00:57.960> volt<00:00:58.109> DC<00:00:58.170> wires<00:00:58.879> chances<00:00:59.879> are

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
negative 12 volt DC wires chances are

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.330 
negative 12 volt DC wires chances are
he'll<00:01:00.930> have<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> run<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> new<00:01:01.649> circuit<00:01:02.070> which<00:01:02.219> is

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
he'll have to run a new circuit which is

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.210 
he'll have to run a new circuit which is
what<00:01:02.489> I<00:01:02.520> recommend<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.750> power

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
what I recommend because of the power

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.130 
what I recommend because of the power
consumption<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.580> powered<00:01:05.970> vent<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:07.020> would

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
consumption of a powered vent you would

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.840 
consumption of a powered vent you would
want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> tie<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.979> an<00:01:08.100> existing<00:01:08.220> lamp

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
want to tie it into an existing lamp

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.580 
want to tie it into an existing lamp
circuit<00:01:09.299> for<00:01:09.479> instance<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.380> would

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
circuit for instance because that would

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.520 
circuit for instance because that would
overload<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.400> particular<00:01:11.939> circuit<00:01:12.630> but<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
overload that particular circuit but a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.140 
overload that particular circuit but a
good<00:01:13.890> installer<00:01:14.250> will<00:01:14.520> be<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.850> hide<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
good installer will be able to hide the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.190 
good installer will be able to hide the
wire<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:15.509> you'll<00:01:15.600> be<00:01:15.689> able<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.900> route<00:01:16.049> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
wire so you'll be able to route the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.870 
wire so you'll be able to route the
wires<00:01:16.409> up<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.920> ceiling<00:01:17.220> where<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.640> vent

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
wires up to that ceiling where that vent

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
wires up to that ceiling where that vent
fan<00:01:18.090> will<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.390> located<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.710> just<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
fan will be located and it's just a

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.530 
fan will be located and it's just a
matter<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.280> concealing<00:01:21.119> them<00:01:21.240> whether<00:01:21.420> you

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
matter of concealing them whether you

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.420 
matter of concealing them whether you
conceal<00:01:22.290> them<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> ceiling<00:01:23.040> itself

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
conceal them in the ceiling itself

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.490 
conceal them in the ceiling itself
depending<00:01:24.330> on<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.570> type<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.810> coach<00:01:25.170> sometimes

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
depending on the type of coach sometimes

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
depending on the type of coach sometimes
you<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.979> fish<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.250> wire<00:01:26.580> over<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.119> over<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you can fish a wire over to a over to a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.690 
you can fish a wire over to a over to a
cabinet<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.619> overhead<00:01:28.950> cabinet<00:01:29.400> where<00:01:29.579> you

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
cabinet and overhead cabinet where you

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
cabinet and overhead cabinet where you
can<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.030> conceal<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.140> inside<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> cabinet

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
can then conceal it inside the cabinet

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.609 
can then conceal it inside the cabinet
somehow<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.150> doable<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> does<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.409> take

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
somehow it is doable is it does it take

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.020 
somehow it is doable is it does it take
work<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> does<00:01:35.369> take<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> little<00:01:35.880> effort

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
work yeah it does take a little effort

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.910 
work yeah it does take a little effort

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
it takes a little bit of talent to be

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.499 
it takes a little bit of talent to be
able<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> hide<00:01:38.280> those<00:01:38.490> wires<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.270> very

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
able to hide those wires but it is very

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.929 
able to hide those wires but it is very
doable<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.680> Dewayne<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> would<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.640> would
