00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello everyone is steven and today 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.570
 I present you a new cydia tweak 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.920
 which is called experience and who will 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.929
 totally change your way 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.060
 to use multitasking on your ipad 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.500
 there the settings are in full screen but 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 if I slide with 4 fingers down 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.560
 like this you see it darkens 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.080
 and by pressing here I have the opportunity 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.519
 to minimize the window I can then 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.410
 maintain the bar from the top of 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.820
 the application right there and move it where 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.250
 I really want as if it was a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.660
 window on a computer and pressing 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 on the little cross on the top left 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.410
 I leave the application so here we go 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.489
 how does it work and if I support 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.660
 now a little touch this button 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.340
 you see that it shows me 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.440
 all my apps with my background 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.000
 blur like mac's dashboard 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.129
 bones whose tweak is obviously very 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.120
 inspired and obviously from 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.750
 from here you can launch your 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.730
 applications 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 there I can slide again with 4 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.610
 fingers to the lease pressed the button 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.260
 to minimize the window of my 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.210
 application and then to move where 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.160
 I want on my screen I can pass 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.600
 in full screen displays is totally 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.309
 the application in full screen by pressing 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 a new on the button here so he 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.119
 serves both to grow and to decrease 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.500
 the application so you see I know 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.330
 really good you see it's great 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 fluid and I guess it's still 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 more about last generation ipads 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.220
 where it's really excellent and the interest 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.140
 of course it is to launch 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.570
 several applications from both the 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.430
 always minimize with this button here and 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.619
 use them at the same time on the same 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.450
 screen so you see there I can by 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.890
 example read my video walk me on 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.380
 twitter without the reading stops 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 so it's really very practical here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.740
 applications are displayed in mode 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.750
 landscape but if I keep leaning on the corner 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.670
 right hop it automatically switches to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 portrait mode and even better if I 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.189
 take the application that I throw it 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.420
 against the right edge look 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.430
 the application automatically fills 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.509
 space as the functionality we 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.070
 had under windows 7 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.049
 So here you are and it's filled with 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.880
 full of little details all very well 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 embedded in the tweak and I repeat it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.000
 it's super fluid 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.380
 in any case the multi windowing on a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.420
 big ipad screen it's really 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.770
 excellent and I do it on an ipad 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.930
 mini but I think on the screen of 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.250
 ipad r it must be even better the 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.079
 mid day two at the same time I think 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.310
 that I can still climb up to 3 or 4 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.420
 no problem for the display to remain 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.040
 ok on my ipad 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.270
 in any case it's much better than this 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.700
 that we usually have with only one 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.229
 full screen applications 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.610
 then another feature a double 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.770
 tap the home button shows you 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.480
 this screen 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.890
 there you see your office and you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.000
 can easily be added in 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.250
 pressing here you want that I can 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.760
 add two three offices and as much as 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.200
 I want it 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.090
 and then look at this I can take 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.050
 the application lay it on the desk on 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.820
 which I want them to appear 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.230
 so it's really very well done 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.790
 can also switch between offices 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.530
 with really slipping gestures 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.510
 like the misssion control of mac os 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.920
 so we hardly feel like 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.050
 to be on an ipad but really on 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.640
 a mac it's really super well integrated 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.380
 watch I'm showing here with 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.090
 the clock app I minimize 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.740
 the application I post the motion 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.750
 control by pressing twice on the 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.280
 home button and then I take the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.510
 window of the game application the church where 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.370
 I want I can do the same thing 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.690
 with the settings you can also 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.340
 organize your different offices 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.050
 simply by sliding them like that with 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.850
 your finger you place them in order 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.230
 who always pleases you with gestures 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.210
 of landslides you can go from one 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.770
 office to another like that by displaying 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.240
 the mission control will drag you to the 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.380
 right or left and once that 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.610
 you are on a desk you slip 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.470
 down to view content 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.660
 all the apps you can 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.070
 very easily leave also finally 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.390
 little feature that I find 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.620
 nice we saw earlier that we 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.210
 could easily switch from mode 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.280
 portrait in landscape mode but look 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.720
 we can also adjust the size of 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.610
 windows apps you 'll have 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.480
 minimize and it works as well in 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.060
 portrait mode in landscape mode 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.370
 look you can adjust the size 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.900
 so that's how it all works 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.110
 tweak is just excellent really 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.840
 perfect it's called bones experience like 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.010
 it costs $ 10 on the cydia store 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.780
 so it's true it's a tweak 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.140
 relatively expensive but it's worth it 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.580
 trouble 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.260
 it's really a whole that will you 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.820
 have seen it radically changed your 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.020
 how to use multitasking on 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.850
 your ipad by bringing in 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.650
 really innovative features 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.959
 it's simply unheard of on 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.520
 a jailbroken ipad seals so is 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.140
 tell me what you thought about it in 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.610
 the comments and I tell you to 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.540
 very soon for a next video 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.540
 Hi
