00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.060 
that is a little update on what's been
going<00:05:37.150> on<00:05:37.270> I<00:05:37.599> can't<00:05:38.199> think<00:05:38.349> of<00:05:38.620> anything<00:05:38.830> else

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
going on I can't think of anything else

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:41.129 
going on I can't think of anything else
I<00:05:39.370> mean<00:05:39.520> we<00:05:39.669> haven't<00:05:40.180> gotten<00:05:40.419> to<00:05:40.510> like<00:05:40.750> cutting

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
I mean we haven't gotten to like cutting

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.339 
I mean we haven't gotten to like cutting
or<00:05:41.260> coloring<00:05:41.560> yeah<00:05:42.930> that's<00:05:43.930> going<00:05:44.199> to<00:05:44.260> be

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
or coloring yeah that's going to be

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.399 
or coloring yeah that's going to be
scary<00:05:45.419> I've<00:05:46.419> done<00:05:46.599> a<00:05:46.630> little<00:05:46.810> bit<00:05:46.990> of<00:05:47.050> cutting

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
scary I've done a little bit of cutting

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.510 
scary I've done a little bit of cutting
before<00:05:47.770> but<00:05:48.039> and<00:05:48.280> a<00:05:49.349> touch<00:05:50.349> of<00:05:50.380> coloring<00:05:51.280> but

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
before but and a touch of coloring but

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.700 
before but and a touch of coloring but
not<00:05:51.760> loads<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:52.510> I<00:05:53.229> think<00:05:53.409> there's<00:05:53.530> going<00:05:53.620> to

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:53.710 
not loads and I think there's going to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.260 
not loads and I think there's going to
be<00:05:53.770> quite<00:05:53.949> hard<00:05:54.099> to<00:05:54.190> get<00:05:54.340> hair<00:05:54.550> models<00:05:54.909> for<00:05:55.090> for

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
be quite hard to get hair models for for

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.939 
be quite hard to get hair models for for
assessments<00:05:55.750> as<00:05:55.840> well<00:05:56.020> because<00:05:56.259> not<00:05:56.710> everyone

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:56.949 
assessments as well because not everyone

00:05:56.949 --> 00:05:58.350 
assessments as well because not everyone
one<00:05:57.039> certain<00:05:57.250> all<00:05:57.370> over<00:05:57.669> color<00:05:57.849> or<00:05:58.180> highlights

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
one certain all over color or highlights

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.409 
one certain all over color or highlights
or<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.940> think<00:06:00.940> it's<00:06:01.030> going<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.180> be<00:06:01.300> quite

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:01.419 
or I think it's going to be quite

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:03.510 
or I think it's going to be quite
difficult<00:06:01.690> after<00:06:02.020> you<00:06:02.139> like<00:06:02.349> at<00:06:02.530> least<00:06:02.710> three

difficult after you like at least three

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.960 
difficult after you like at least three

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
or four assessments to cover all

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.420
