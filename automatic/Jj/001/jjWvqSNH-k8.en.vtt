probably good for people who have a

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.750 
probably good for people who have a
drive-up<00:00:21.170> station<00:00:22.250> where<00:00:23.250> they<00:00:23.310> want<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.550> sell

time<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.119> mess<00:00:27.960> with<00:00:27.990> itself<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.070> might<00:00:29.340> be<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
time to mess with itself this might be a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.600 
time to mess with itself this might be a
good<00:00:29.699> idea<00:00:29.760> set<00:00:30.449> you<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> bunch<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.960> jars<00:00:31.260> out

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
good idea set you a bunch of jars out

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.450 
good idea set you a bunch of jars out
and<00:00:32.610> set<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.540> container<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.260> here<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.160> let

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.760 
just basically fill up their jar
bring<00:00:41.129> their<00:00:41.280> own<00:00:41.399> jar<00:00:41.700> as<00:00:42.510> you<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.110> this

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
bring their own jar as you can see this

is<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> live<00:00:44.280> high<00:00:44.579> we've<00:00:45.149> got<00:00:45.300> bees<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
is a live high we've got bees in the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:59.029 
is a live high we've got bees in the
hive<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.730> turn<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> turn<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> spigot<00:00:49.230> on

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.569 

I'm<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.850> selling<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.449> take<00:01:01.050> anybody<00:01:01.579> and

I'm not selling this take anybody and
I'm<00:01:02.789> not<00:01:02.940> gonna<00:01:03.120> build<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> for<00:01:03.629> anybody<00:01:03.960> this

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
I'm not gonna build the for anybody this

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'm not gonna build the for anybody this
is<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.189> my<00:01:05.309> own<00:01:05.339> amusement<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.890> just<00:01:07.890> thought

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
is for my own amusement I just thought

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.270 
is for my own amusement I just thought
it<00:01:08.220> might<00:01:08.399> be<00:01:08.580> fun<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> Bea<00:01:10.890> man

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
it might be fun you know that Bea man

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.810 
it might be fun you know that Bea man
sometimes<00:01:11.580> gets<00:01:12.060> bored<00:01:13.100> another<00:01:14.100> brainstorm

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
sometimes gets bored another brainstorm

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.109 
sometimes gets bored another brainstorm
I<00:01:15.000> guess<00:01:15.890> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.039> can<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:17.369> I'm<00:01:17.610> right<00:01:17.909> here

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
I guess that you can see I'm right here

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.029 
I guess that you can see I'm right here
with<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> bees<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.049> bees<00:01:19.229> are<00:01:19.440> flying<00:01:19.560> around

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
with the bees the bees are flying around

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:25.670 
with the bees the bees are flying around
I<00:01:22.490> guess<00:01:23.490> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.970> gonna<00:01:24.259> do<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.440> on<00:01:25.649> a

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
I guess if you was gonna do this on a

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.859 
I guess if you was gonna do this on a
larger<00:01:26.130> scale<00:01:26.399> probably<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.450> better<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.810> have

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
larger scale probably be better to have

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.880 
larger scale probably be better to have
a<00:01:27.960> bigger<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.590> bigger<00:01:29.220> spicket<00:01:30.530> but<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.679> can

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
a bigger a bigger spicket but you can

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.510 
a bigger a bigger spicket but you can
see<00:01:32.130> I'm<00:01:32.399> pouring<00:01:32.940> honey<00:01:33.679> no<00:01:34.679> smoke<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.130> no

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
see I'm pouring honey no smoke and no

00:01:35.520 --> 00:02:02.630 
see I'm pouring honey no smoke and no
mirrors<00:01:59.090> so<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.690> do<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.640> stop

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
mirrors so what you want to do is stop

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.370 
mirrors so what you want to do is stop
dripping<00:02:03.560> put<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.830> liver

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.200 

now<00:02:09.480> you<00:02:10.480> tell<00:02:10.750> me<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:12.130> that<00:02:12.190> been<00:02:12.610> filter<00:02:13.030> or

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
now you tell me is that been filter or

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.190 
now you tell me is that been filter or
wood<00:02:13.420> that's<00:02:13.690> nice<00:02:14.290> good<00:02:15.130> honey

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
wood that's nice good honey

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.650 
wood that's nice good honey
say<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.530> tell<00:02:17.680> them<00:02:18.210> viscosity<00:02:19.210> is<00:02:19.420> real

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
say you can tell them viscosity is real

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.780 
say you can tell them viscosity is real
good<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.500> a<00:02:20.620> little<00:02:20.650> warm<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.340> here<00:02:21.370> we're

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
good it's a little warm out here we're

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.470 
good it's a little warm out here we're
running<00:02:22.390> about<00:02:22.510> 96<00:02:23.320> to<00:02:23.500> 37<00:02:24.070> degrees<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:24.700> it's

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
running about 96 to 37 degrees so it's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.160 
running about 96 to 37 degrees so it's
hot<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.100> can<00:02:27.370> basically<00:02:27.550> filled<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.240> many

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
hot so you can basically filled up many

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.990 
hot so you can basically filled up many
jars<00:02:29.470> as<00:02:29.740> you<00:02:29.830> want<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:33.490> I<00:02:33.580> come<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.850> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
jars as you want it if I come up with

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.630 
jars as you want it if I come up with
some<00:02:34.120> more<00:02:34.240> better<00:02:34.510> ideas<00:02:35.310> right<00:02:36.310> now<00:02:36.460> we've

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
some more better ideas right now we've

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.480 
some more better ideas right now we've
got<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.790> swarm<00:02:37.210> in<00:02:37.390> entry<00:02:38.160> probably<00:02:39.160> look<00:02:39.340> out

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
got a swarm in entry probably look out

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.790 
got a swarm in entry probably look out
yard<00:02:40.050> swarm<00:02:41.050> over<00:02:41.200> here

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
yard swarm over here

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.230 
yard swarm over here
so<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.760> got<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.120> get<00:02:43.210> busy<00:02:43.450> catch<00:02:44.380> more<00:02:44.710> beans

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
so I got to get busy catch more beans

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.930 
so I got to get busy catch more beans
