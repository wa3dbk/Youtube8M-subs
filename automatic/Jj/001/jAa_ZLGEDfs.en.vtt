might miss his presence at the top he's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.119 
might miss his presence at the top he's
not<00:01:00.390> just<00:01:00.719> an<00:01:00.930> attacking<00:01:01.230> batsman<00:01:01.829> but<00:01:01.980> he's

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
not just an attacking batsman but he's

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.280 
not just an attacking batsman but he's
also<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.820> senior<00:01:03.449> player<00:01:03.719> whom<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.080> team

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
also the senior player whom the team

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.500 
also the senior player whom the team
looks<00:01:04.530> up<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.670> be<00:01:05.880> de<00:01:06.030> Villiers<00:01:06.330> will

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
looks up to but a be de Villiers will

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.550 
looks up to but a be de Villiers will
have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> take<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.200> more<00:01:07.380> responsibility

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
have to take on more responsibility

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.270 
have to take on more responsibility
being<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.729> captain<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:10.110> Smith<00:01:10.650> is<00:01:10.860> absent

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
being the captain and as Smith is absent

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.190 
being the captain and as Smith is absent
so<00:01:11.760> de<00:01:11.939> Villiers<00:01:12.270> will<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.659> only<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:13.140> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
so de Villiers will not only have to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.289 
so de Villiers will not only have to
inspire<00:01:13.920> with<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.280> back<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.790> his<00:01:14.909> leadership

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
inspire with the back but his leadership

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.090 
inspire with the back but his leadership
in<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.659> field<00:01:15.960> will<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.500> equally<00:01:16.920> crucial

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
in the field will be equally crucial

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.880 
in the field will be equally crucial
