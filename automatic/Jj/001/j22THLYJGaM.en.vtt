00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.060 
was going to run out of space in my shop
I<00:00:09.240> try<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.540> look<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.170> ways<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.320> consolidate

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
I try to look for ways to consolidate

I try to look for ways to consolidate
and<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.849> googled<00:00:12.599> some<00:00:12.809> images<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.799> came

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
and I googled some images and I came

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
and I googled some images and I came
across<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.610> mobile<00:00:15.030> workbench<00:00:15.450> that<00:00:15.599> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
across this mobile workbench that this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.109 
across this mobile workbench that this
guy<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:16.470> Andrew<00:00:17.220> Barton<00:00:17.550> out<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
guy I think Andrew Barton out of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.890 
guy I think Andrew Barton out of
California<00:00:18.840> made<00:00:19.520> and<00:00:20.570> it<00:00:21.570> was<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.750> really

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
California made and it was a really

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.779 
California made and it was a really
awesome<00:00:22.020> idea<00:00:22.650> he<00:00:22.949> had<00:00:23.130> he<00:00:23.400> had<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.609> great

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
awesome idea he had he had this great

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.230 
awesome idea he had he had this great
idea<00:00:24.000> pretty<00:00:24.359> much<00:00:24.510> set<00:00:24.720> up<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:24.990> like<00:00:25.410> I<00:00:25.650> have

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
idea pretty much set up how like I have

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.910 
idea pretty much set up how like I have
we've<00:00:27.240> had<00:00:27.449> some<00:00:27.660> pictures<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.500> had<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.710> set

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
we've had some pictures and had it set

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.650 
we've had some pictures and had it set
up<00:00:28.949> just<00:00:29.160> slightly<00:00:29.640> slightly<00:00:30.060> different<00:00:30.570> with

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
up just slightly slightly different with

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.709 
up just slightly slightly different with
the<00:00:30.750> router<00:00:30.960> table<00:00:31.940> so<00:00:32.940> here's<00:00:33.300> what<00:00:33.420> we<00:00:33.540> got

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
the router table so here's what we got

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.270 
the router table so here's what we got
we<00:00:33.870> got<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.020> router<00:00:34.260> table<00:00:34.530> here<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.040> end

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
we got a router table here on the end

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.750 
we got a router table here on the end
what<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> did<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.840> guess<00:00:37.800> from<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> beginning<00:00:38.520> is

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
what I did I guess from the beginning is

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.760 
what I did I guess from the beginning is
just<00:00:38.820> welded<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> whole<00:00:39.899> steel<00:00:40.410> frame

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
just welded this whole steel frame

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.420 
just welded this whole steel frame
together<00:00:41.219> it's<00:00:41.460> 1<00:00:41.670> by<00:00:41.850> 3<00:00:42.210> steel<00:00:42.480> tubing<00:00:43.430> going

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
together it's 1 by 3 steel tubing going

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.630 
together it's 1 by 3 steel tubing going
all<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.390> way<00:00:45.420> around<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:46.680> got<00:00:46.829> some<00:00:47.010> braces<00:00:47.489> in

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
all the way around we got some braces in

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.810 
all the way around we got some braces in
the<00:00:47.730> middle<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.350> guess<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.559> across<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.340> then

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
the middle I guess going across and then

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.850 
the middle I guess going across and then
we<00:00:50.879> got<00:00:51.000> some<00:00:51.180> angle<00:00:51.570> iron<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.469> at<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
we got some angle iron down here at the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.680 
we got some angle iron down here at the
bottom<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> could<00:00:54.239> bolt<00:00:54.539> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
bottom so that way I could bolt the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.770 
bottom so that way I could bolt the
router<00:00:54.899> table<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.910> pretty<00:00:56.910> much<00:00:57.030> once<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
router table to that pretty much once I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.180 
router table to that pretty much once I
bolted<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.170> router<00:00:58.379> table<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.010> my

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
bolted the router table that was my

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.360 
bolted the router table that was my
height<00:00:59.430> that<00:01:00.239> I<00:01:00.300> was<00:01:00.420> going<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:01.160> got<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> new

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
height that I was going off of got a new

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.670 
height that I was going off of got a new
table<00:01:02.730> saw<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.449> be<00:01:03.600> able<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.840> put<00:01:04.260> level<00:01:04.559> with

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
table saw to be able to put level with

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.080 
table saw to be able to put level with
that<00:01:04.860> because<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> had<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.880> too

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that because the one that I had was too

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 
that because the one that I had was too
old<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.689> rickety<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:07.799> didn't<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.369> out

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
old and rickety and didn't just work out

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.880 
old and rickety and didn't just work out
very<00:01:08.580> well<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.140> need<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.350> little<00:01:10.470> cabinet

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
very well so I need a little cabinet

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.530 
very well so I need a little cabinet
underneath<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.760> raise<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
underneath that to raise it up to the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.590 
underneath that to raise it up to the
height<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.530> router<00:01:13.950> table<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.640> then

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
height of that router table and then

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.179 
height of that router table and then
make<00:01:15.869> some<00:01:16.049> drawers<00:01:16.320> over<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:16.770> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> right

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
make some drawers over here on the right

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.850 
make some drawers over here on the right
but<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.119> planer<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.600> that<00:01:18.810> make<00:01:19.110> sure<00:01:19.320> give

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
but the planer on that make sure give

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.520 
but the planer on that make sure give
them<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.040> space<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.520> between<00:01:20.780> the<00:01:21.780> table<00:01:22.320> top

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
them a space in between the table top

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.230 
them a space in between the table top
and<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.950> top<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.520> drawers<00:01:23.790> right<00:01:24.000> there

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
and the top of the drawers right there

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630 
and the top of the drawers right there
so<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> fainter<00:01:25.350> could<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
so that way the fainter could go all the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.100 
so that way the fainter could go all the
way<00:01:26.670> up<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.150> six<00:01:27.390> inches<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> it's

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
way up to the six inches that it's

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.280 
way up to the six inches that it's
supposed<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.329> once<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:30.780> did<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:30.960> got

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

connects to the planer and then up at

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.509 
connects to the planer and then up at
the<00:03:45.389> top<00:03:45.479> that<00:03:45.720> connects<00:03:46.290> down<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:47.040> table

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
them all the way out on the edge then

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.920 
them all the way out on the edge then
work<00:04:26.039> out<00:04:26.190> great<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.520> far<00:04:26.940> they're<00:04:27.210> rated<00:04:27.810> up

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
work out great so far they're rated up

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.360 
work out great so far they're rated up
to<00:04:27.960> 300<00:04:28.440> pounds<00:04:28.620> and<00:04:28.919> I<00:04:28.949> know<00:04:29.009> this<00:04:29.220> whole

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
to 300 pounds and I know this whole

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.570 
to 300 pounds and I know this whole
bench<00:04:29.639> is<00:04:29.970> way<00:04:30.870> more<00:04:31.139> than<00:04:31.289> 300<00:04:31.830> but<00:04:31.979> I<00:04:32.220> guess

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
bench is way more than 300 but I guess

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.460 
bench is way more than 300 but I guess
if<00:04:32.729> I've<00:04:32.879> got<00:04:33.060> four<00:04:33.300> casters<00:04:33.690> on<00:04:33.870> here<00:04:34.050> 300

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
if I've got four casters on here 300

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.790 
if I've got four casters on here 300
pounds<00:04:34.710> apiece<00:04:34.949> as<00:04:35.220> should<00:04:36.090> be<00:04:36.120> covered<00:04:36.720> yep

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
