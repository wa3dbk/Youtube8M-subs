nobody really cares own increases range
and<00:01:58.780> accuracy<00:01:59.170> that's<00:01:59.650> what<00:01:59.800> you<00:01:59.950> should

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
and accuracy that's what you should

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.070 
and accuracy that's what you should
probably<00:02:00.430> pick<00:02:00.670> and<00:02:00.940> then<00:02:01.060> picking<00:02:01.270> this<00:02:01.540> the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
probably pick and then picking this the

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.230 
probably pick and then picking this the
combat<00:02:02.590> sites<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.220> then<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.580> pick<00:02:03.790> send<00:02:04.060> it

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
combat sites and then you pick send it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.570

and<00:02:04.840> then<00:02:05.080> of<00:02:05.290> course<00:02:05.410> there<00:02:05.860> is<00:02:05.980> head<00:02:06.190> in<00:02:06.310> hand

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
and then of course there is head in hand

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.389 
and then of course there is head in hand
it<00:02:07.390> just<00:02:07.660> allows<00:02:07.979> there's<00:02:08.979> pretty<00:02:09.190> much<00:02:09.250> a

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it just allows there's pretty much a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
stability will be like perfect as you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
stability will be like perfect as you
guys<00:02:37.300> can<00:02:37.450> tell<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.900> put<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.650> is<00:02:38.890> so

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
guys can tell you put this and it is so

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.790 
guys can tell you put this and it is so
low<00:02:39.880> of<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.330> recoil<00:02:40.810> it<00:02:41.050> is<00:02:41.140> absolutely<00:02:41.590> insane

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
low of a recoil it is absolutely insane

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.320 
low of a recoil it is absolutely insane
and<00:02:42.840> pretty<00:02:43.840> much<00:02:43.930> what<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.680> is<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.070> get

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
and pretty much what you get is you get

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.930 
and pretty much what you get is you get
soft<00:02:46.330> ballistics<00:02:46.810> less<00:02:47.140> recoil<00:02:47.519> and<00:02:48.519> using

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
soft ballistics less recoil and using

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.360 
soft ballistics less recoil and using
potentially<00:02:49.450> you<00:02:49.660> know<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.380> just<00:02:51.010> get

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
potentially you know you can just get

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.640 
potentially you know you can just get
the<00:02:51.459> pad<00:02:51.670> address<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.570> then<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.140> of<00:02:53.470> course

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
the pad address and then you of course

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.259 
the pad address and then you of course
have<00:02:53.800> this<00:02:54.280> cqb<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:56.650> less<00:02:56.920> range<00:02:57.250> but<00:02:57.820> you

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
have this cqb it's less range but you

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.570 
have this cqb it's less range but you
have<00:02:58.390> better<00:02:58.570> stability<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.440> then<00:03:00.160> those<00:03:00.550> are

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
have better stability and then those are

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.400 
have better stability and then those are
aggressive<00:03:01.090> abyss<00:03:01.420> tips<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.959> they're<00:03:02.320> pretty

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
aggressive abyss tips and they're pretty

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.470 
aggressive abyss tips and they're pretty
much<00:03:02.560> just<00:03:02.830> adds

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
a slight more of an impact that's pretty

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.619 
a slight more of an impact that's pretty
much<00:03:08.420> it<00:03:08.769> shorter<00:03:09.769> range<00:03:09.980> for<00:03:10.610> more<00:03:10.819> recoil<00:03:11.299> I

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.380 
much it shorter range for more recoil I
am<00:03:11.900> more<00:03:12.080> recoil<00:03:12.530> but<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.159> an<00:03:13.400> enhanced<00:03:14.000> impact

course you put up hipfire that you do
one<00:04:35.070> on<00:04:35.250> this<00:04:35.490> because<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> is<00:04:35.850> a<00:04:35.970> shotgun<00:04:36.540> it's

a<00:04:36.750> pulse<00:04:36.990> rifle<00:04:37.380> shotgun<00:04:37.620> so<00:04:37.860> whenever<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.250> do

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460

bullion<00:04:40.290> it's<00:04:41.040> I<00:04:41.250> guess<00:04:41.580> it's<00:04:42.480> like<00:04:42.540> fire<00:04:42.840> and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.140 
bullion it's I guess it's like fire and

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.020 
bullion it's I guess it's like fire and
shoots<00:04:43.380> five<00:04:43.680> around<00:04:44.130> you<00:04:44.370> so<00:04:44.430> you<00:04:44.670> guys<00:04:44.850> can

by<00:04:49.680> five<00:04:49.980> more<00:04:50.310> you<00:04:50.790> shoot<00:04:51.000> five<00:04:51.360> rounds<00:04:52.020> so

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
by five more you shoot five rounds so

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.140 
by five more you shoot five rounds so
it's<00:04:52.530> a<00:04:53.160> 30<00:04:53.850> round<00:04:54.630> magazine<00:04:55.290> it<00:04:55.650> is<00:04:56.280> let's<00:04:56.940> see
