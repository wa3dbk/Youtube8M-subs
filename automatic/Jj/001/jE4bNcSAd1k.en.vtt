very small and then install into a

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.109 
very small and then install into a
computer<00:01:07.790> after<00:01:08.790> doing<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.350> launch<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119

you're<00:01:12.119> gonna<00:01:12.240> see<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:13.590> program<00:01:14.250> like<00:01:14.460> here<00:01:15.049> I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
you're gonna see the program like here I

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.450 
you're gonna see the program like here I
think<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:17.460> interface<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:19.340> in<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
think the interface is the same in a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
think the interface is the same in a
different<00:01:20.790> platform<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:22.590> using<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> Mac

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
different platform so I'm using a Mac

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.920 
different platform so I'm using a Mac
here<00:01:23.400> as<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.640> can<00:01:23.670> see<00:01:23.820> so<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.750> mac

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
here as you can see so this is the mac

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.700

it would have it would that's you're

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.460 
it would have it would that's you're
basically<00:02:29.310> indication<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:29.989> it's<00:02:30.989> done<00:02:31.230> and

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
basically indication that it's done and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.800 
basically indication that it's done and
that<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.519> it<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:34.849> this<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.060> what<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.329> meant<00:02:36.629> by

but by backing up it will make it

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.490 
but by backing up it will make it
possible<00:03:41.480> okay<00:03:42.480> and<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:42.780> reason<00:03:43.199> is<00:03:43.319> because

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
possible okay and the reason is because

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.849

Apple has a little security measure in
itunes<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:48.030> checks<00:03:48.329> your<00:03:48.449> firmware<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:49.530> if

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
itunes that checks your firmware so if

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.439 
itunes that checks your firmware so if

you have already upgrade to let's say
four<00:03:51.629> point<00:03:51.840> two<00:03:52.040> you<00:03:53.040> cannot<00:03:53.370> down<00:03:53.609> sit<00:03:53.910> back

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
four point two you cannot down sit back

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.740 
four point two you cannot down sit back
to<00:03:54.949> 4.1<00:03:55.949> it<00:03:56.099> just<00:03:56.639> not<00:03:56.760> is<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.359> just<00:03:57.599> not

to 4.1 it just not is it is just not

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.059 
to 4.1 it just not is it is just not
possible<00:03:58.220> itunes<00:03:59.220> will<00:03:59.430> not<00:03:59.609> allow<00:03:59.910> it<00:04:01.069> so

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
possible itunes will not allow it so

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.699
