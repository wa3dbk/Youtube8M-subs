 also download music if that 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.610

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:11.459
 this lights up here with you 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:13.430
 most likely blue and yes if 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.000
 it does not just click on it here 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.000
 then download 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:27.999
 then it takes a bit yes so me 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:30.249

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:38.099
 me after that when this download again 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:41.349
 the download is finished 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.750
 and here are your downloads 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:48.419
 programs 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.419
 there you put your ios device on 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.680
 So you have to do the itunes you have to 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.310
 break up 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:10.329
 then everything will be displayed here 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:15.930
 So iphone 4.0 32 gb then it goes here 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:24.099
 up and here on this green 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:26.650
 Something then you synchronize that 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:33.880
 program with a mobile so it works 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.900
 pretty fast yes it's important itunes 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.449
 break up 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.849
 that does not work otherwise 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:46.150
 already tried and yes did not go that way 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:48.780
 Now I'm stuck here I can do that 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.780
 open normally 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:05:06.719
 no the photo works so everything 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:12.370
 quite normal app store is the city 

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:14.830
 You can open 269 and updates here 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.770
 make that easy here at the 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.479
 version instead of just something on it 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.889
 click on it and he makes this update 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:30.810
 now you can just a whole 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:35.050
 normal could remove theirs here 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:37.060
 Try free apps for free and then 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.060
 I wish you much much fun 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.599
 thanks for seeing and see you next 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.599
