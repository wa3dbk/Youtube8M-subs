 uy 

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:23.180
 this is not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.490
 and who studied from his 7 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.210
 How are you 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.210
 hello hello 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.510
 is an entity that is responsible for 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.650
 promote leisure time people 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.380
 with different disabilities 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.420
 we have decided to make an action 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.420
 social will help a group of 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.600
 people 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.990
 with our energy our desire to 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 make your life a little more colorful and 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.330
 we have come here to the group of callus for 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.220
 help them paint their premises and bring them 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.350
 Well, that painting and also our 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.920
 ideas about what colors can 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.920
 be okay 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.460
 a very interesting and good proposal 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.430
 also for the users of the center 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.900
 for the monitors you can do together 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 a private company because it seemed to us 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.750
 well a current issue and that they lend 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.750
 very well 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.980
 belinda added is an experience let's go 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.420
 to paint your own local 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.630
 it was one thing 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.700
 and then each department searched for a 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.259
 institution and I proposed bruce kallio 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.509
 because that's where my brother comes from 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.549
 group of intellectual disabled 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.759
 that come here to have fun and spend it 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:06.759
 all right 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.640
 it's also emotion that attitude is not 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.740
 the same to enter a site that is all 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.880
 black or gray here I have vivid color this 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.210
 It also makes the person more 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.920
 lively the center is not a luxurious center 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.720
 but we try to make a group a 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.300
 site that is cozy that is fun 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.950
 that is really comfortable and that the 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.210
 people like in this cut the color 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.210

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.000

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.159

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.290

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.189

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:18.470

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:21.620

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:08.669
 without knowing that they are hardly 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.210
 9 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.869

 and if I really like that we do this 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.270
 also that we have many volunteers 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.129
 almost all departments I want to say 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.759
 that is not just marketing and resources 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.759
 humans here 

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.550
