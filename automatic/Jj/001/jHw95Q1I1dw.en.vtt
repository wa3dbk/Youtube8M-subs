00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.700
 the inns the inns as children are 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.480
 very different than as adults when 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.480
 you were a child 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.140
 when the children eagerly awake 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.090
 seven editions starting with the 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.730
 posadas if you want to know the idealism 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.819

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.910
 clay piÃ±ata way and the pinches 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.600
 front of every mother no no I never went to 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.600
 an inn

 in aragon the portfolios that are going to run 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:00.120
 to the piÃ±ata are the dads that 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:02.400
 the children are dizzy so that the child of 2 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.660
 years let's give him a stick and let's 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.940
 think that this is a good way to 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.730
 celebrate the birth of a person and 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:18.080
 that destroys a piÃ±ata is very dark 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:18.080
