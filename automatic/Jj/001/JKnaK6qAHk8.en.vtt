four and what does this say about
Harvard<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.920> more<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.189> thought<00:01:07.579> about<00:01:07.939> the

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
more I thought about what has supported

me during my time at Harvard as I

reflect on the entirety of my liberal

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.349 
reflect on the entirety of my liberal
arts<00:01:20.450> education<00:01:20.630> I<00:01:21.700> realized<00:01:22.700> that<00:01:23.060> the

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
arts education I realized that the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.209 
arts education I realized that the
foundational<00:01:24.259> knowledge<00:01:24.289> I<00:01:24.979> have<00:01:25.100> acquired

is not exactly what I expected it to be
as<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.939> chemistry<00:01:32.630> concentrator<00:01:33.349> I<00:01:33.649> thought

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:34.459 
as a chemistry concentrator I thought

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.480 
as a chemistry concentrator I thought
that<00:01:34.880> reaction<00:01:35.630> mechanisms<00:01:36.349> or<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:37.009> periodic

that reaction mechanisms or the periodic

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.459 
that reaction mechanisms or the periodic
table<00:01:38.119> might<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:39.079> my<00:01:39.439> foundation<00:01:40.479> but<00:01:41.479> while

table might be my foundation but while

Harvard this single subject is not what
