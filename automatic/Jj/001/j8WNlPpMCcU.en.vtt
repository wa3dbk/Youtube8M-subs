until<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> end<00:01:50.720> one<00:01:51.720> thing<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:51.990> did<00:01:52.170> like<00:01:52.350> about

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
until the end one thing I did like about

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
until the end one thing I did like about
the<00:01:52.740> PlayBook<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.520> they<00:01:53.670> included<00:01:54.210> need

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the PlayBook is that they included need

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.560 
the PlayBook is that they included need
for<00:01:55.350> speed<00:01:55.619> on<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.159> they<00:01:56.880> didn't<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.420> do

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
for speed on here they didn't have to do

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.469 
for speed on here they didn't have to do
that<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.460> kind<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.610> think<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> reason<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.299> did

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
that I kind of think the reason they did

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.929 
that I kind of think the reason they did
is<00:02:00.600> because<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.170> BlackBerry<00:02:02.130> App<00:02:02.340> Store<00:02:02.729> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
is because the BlackBerry App Store is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.600 
is because the BlackBerry App Store is
so<00:02:03.570> weak<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.110> far<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.500> selection<00:02:05.040> is<00:02:05.159> concerned

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so weak as far as selection is concerned

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.429 
so weak as far as selection is concerned
I<00:02:05.820> mean<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.689> that's<00:02:06.750> another<00:02:07.049> big<00:02:07.380> thing

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
I mean and that's another big thing

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.690 
I mean and that's another big thing
they're<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> overcome

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
they're going to have to overcome
