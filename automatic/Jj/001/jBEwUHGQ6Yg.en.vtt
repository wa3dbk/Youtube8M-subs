00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.700
 Hello everyone, today I want to tell you 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.670
 of buying new shoes from 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.860
 run or this this shot in 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.190
 so that I can get up and show you 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.190
 then the shoes all the evidence I did the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.490
 these were always my precedents 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.609
 ravenna 4 brooks that they had replaced 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.380
 the brooks ravenna 3 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.880
 I bought it December and I could 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
 see exactly how many kilometers I have 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.450
 done because stops driven by gps and 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.219
 downloading the data I see exactly the km 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.020
 hands as if I could 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.640
 see how many he has made and how many 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.710
 kilometers have exactly the team 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.600
 they even did a thousand kilometers 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.680
 too much because now you feel that I am 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 just deflated ie the cushioning 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.460
 in the val foot practically does not exist 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.190
 more and more it starts to have a little 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.949
 hurt the knee and the tibia and this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.600
 it is a symptom of shoes there may be 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 also something else but also a symptom 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.710
 of excavation now luvinate mandate 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.120
 buying new shoes there 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.489
 tells the whole story a bit 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.369
 I went to the store as usual 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.850
 trusted store and I went with the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 so old shoes with these here 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.110
 you always have to go with the shoes 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:19.320
 old because the shopkeeper will look 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.110
 how these shoes are not so much 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.619
 ruined but how they bend if they bend 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.210
 because they will be indicative of the type of 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.950
 support that to your foot 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.360
 then I stand up for a moment and you 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.630
 I see what he has done 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.470
 shopkeeper then the shopkeeper has me 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:42.030
 take off your shoes and with your hand 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.030
 touched the arch of the foot to hear 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.890
 that maybe 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.590
 they for example the flat foot or 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.490
 to hear in short how I supported then has 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.100
 looked at my shoes here and here 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.290
 since my shoes are slightly yes 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.259
 they bend inside because me 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.210
 slightly when I probably run 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.450
 that when he walks normally is also 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.880
 from the firm to the feet that throws a little 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.000
 inward and therefore I am 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.390
 slightly shaping a little more with 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.390
 the feet then made me try 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:20.620
 shoes for so-called promoters 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.310
 stable shoes and I tried asics 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.010
 but for me they had the upper that 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.400
 it would be this part here a little too much 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.950
 soft and I like to feel the shoe 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.050
 which I do not say squeezes me because then 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.530
 I would have taken the measures that I think I know 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.239
 just narrow for me but i like that 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.269
 it seems that they support well and that 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.220
 do your foot well asics not me 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.019
 they went a lot because besides they had 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.450
 even the plant is a little too large 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.640
 the upper too soft 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.160
 then I always tried brooks le 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.360
 aggregator, I don't remember which number 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.709
 because even with the now have 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:02.860
 reached resources at 13 and 14 though 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.440
 adrenaline unlike ravenna 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.910
 they have a cushioning band that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.920
 it takes a while everything keeps it 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.500
 this one instead have a band that 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.970
 it only takes this area here is never 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.840
 that band is too big and 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.609
 annoyance gave me a little too much rigidity 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.350
 to the foot because of course I tried 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.170
 shoes on the treadmill 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.970
 I saw how I felt about them 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.440
 I also took them in my opinion 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.540
 had 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.550
 for me the plant is a little too wide and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.740
 so I really felt my shoes 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.660
 too wide at the end shopkeeper has 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.830
 said then let's clarify about the brooks of 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:42.030
 new so I tried the evolution of 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.340
 brooks that is the ravenna evolution 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.240
 of the ravenna I mean the ravenna 5 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:53.420
 which are these here then the ravenna 5 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.210
 in general the ravenna are shoes 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:04:00.030
 intermediate that is for neutral supports o 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:01.140
 therefore slightly promoters for me 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.790
 can be good 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.530
 naturally I took a woman's model 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.540
 because the houses of good running shoes 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.760
 makes models for women that models for men 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.150
 this novel the woman and the model from 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.420
 woman 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.670
 weighs 241 g for men weighs a 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.920
 I don't know how much more, though 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.300
 how much I don't care I know I'm a 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:28.050
 little light and are for fast riders 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.160
 however we say that they are very good for the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.040
 kind of my course 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.320
 then I wanted to say, in my opinion, I mean it 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.580
 I am fast that is more than that I will not go 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.500
 for which my maxim is reached 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.660
 speed so if it is not these go 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.960
 it was great to watch when you did 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:45.720
 slow things do the quick tests 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.210
 to tie the longer runs 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.090
 we will have to have at least three four pairs of 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.800
 shoes of different types what is not 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.520
 possible because in short I mean 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:59.310
 we are so runners a bit of Sunday 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.010
 here is to define so well and then 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:03.710
 in short sincerely even if we have to 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.240
 go and look at our health 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.110
 of our bodies in his back not 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.520
 we can spend 500 euros if not more 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.680
 of shoes every time we have to 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.169
 change shoes but the shopkeeper will 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.290
 he did try on shoes that were 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.380
 gray on the kind of these the section 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.560
 even more ugly than gray 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.850
 pink requirements seemed to be two pantheon 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.830
 at the feet 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.900
 then I told him but by chance he did n't 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.210
 of different colors because sincerely 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.130
 this time I wanted some shoes 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:38.640
 little cute because I always run with these 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:42.030
 sad shoes and told me no 

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:43.950
 so I think about it, so I went home 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.680
 and I looked on the website ho 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.990
 discovered that the brooks made a model 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.970
 from the prettiest woman that was this 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:54.539
 so there are the gray ones and they are there 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.910
 this blue and so I looked in 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.870
 various websites where everything is possible 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.150
 save and this is you pay 103 in 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.880
 the boss seemed to cost me 130 if 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:09.990
 not 135 and precisely a mosquito in the 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.890
 meanwhile and so I found some 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.580
 sites 

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.440
 my number and I bought it from a 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.240
 site that is called all running not 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.370
 I advertise see consolo where 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.380
 I took all running and they were 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:24.660
 punctual corrected within two days 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.900
 I am another thing I want to tell you is the 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.150
 question number of shoes then mine 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.630
 normal shoe size 36 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:36.030
 these are a 38 because I was discovered 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.370
 that over time or shoes have changed 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:41.130
 or my foot changed though as far as 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.020
 concerns the time running shoe 

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.169
 time I have to try and not me 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.470
 take my shoe size and accurate 

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:52.890
 so this was a six e 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:56.039
 half American and these are a 7 that 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.770
 corresponds to a European 38 then to the 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.930
 end the running shoes go 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:03.539
 purchased we say for length of pil 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:07.620
 and then you go to cm and then yes yes yes 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:09.870
 converts into a number and therefore is not said 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:12.389
 as I said before your number 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.069
 than normal shoe then corresponds to the 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.210
 shoe number that includes for the 

00:07:14.069 --> 00:07:17.310
 race that's all 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:20.250
 I can't wait to try it naturally 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:21.870
 both to test if the number a means 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.180
 in short, the biggest inch can go 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.440
 better both naturally to try 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.750
 this new shoe that anyway 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.819
 compared to the even lighter a4 and 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.669
 eventually if I find myself wrong 

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:38.250
 I will make a rectification video but I don't think so 

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:40.680
 the brooks for me have always been alone 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.960
 a great buy and therefore I hope that 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.949
 these too are a confirmation with 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.130
 I said it all 

00:07:43.949 --> 00:07:49.440
 I wish you good races with 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:52.289
 I always wish you new shoes 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.430
 good rides seems like good weather and there 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:56.180
 we come to the next videos 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:56.180
 Hello
