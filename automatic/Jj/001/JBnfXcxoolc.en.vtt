00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.340
 Defender has coach 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.080
 no longer to be afraid 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.080
 bake very good and center concept 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.710
 played at HSV Judaism as against Cologne 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.349
 Minute took the lead 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.269
 of the little man like laptops provide pre-op alternately took care of 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.039
 next to Meier and cordially 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.039
 karl-heinz Rummenigge 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.670
 and overall must be sadder than Bayern are probably on the bench 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.750
 of the Hamburg sports club 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.240
 three amateurs 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.380
 No rarely used so much fun they sent 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.970
 the first chance for HSV 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.090
 which is made 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 1 by Felix Magath 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.190
 this match was the increased entry fee worth no question 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.460
 everyone has to answer for themselves 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.220
 Commentators of a say over long distances very specific 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.250
 we will too 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.250
 enough Dinkhoff 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.820
 Bavaria was already happy 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.970
 when the man with the number 5 Augenthaler on the ball were on duty 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.630
 given well 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.670
 otherwise clearly recognizable 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.520
 the mutual assistance 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.460
 si left to right backward passages 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.460
 Felix Magath was the flush exception 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.990
 can Rummenigge meant 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.769
 he later changed 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:10.909
 was required 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.069
 and certainly not physically the hardships this song yet 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 has grown 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.599
 so was blocked over long distances 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:34.169
 Udo Lattek certainly did not agree with July 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.169
 Example him as you had done for a while 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.069
 in the first half over long distances a flashlight pitiful 0 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.280
 from a top game could be no question at all 

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:50.549
 of these 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.549
 Cuts the Romans tried the best 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:10.409
 seldom so energetic started conducting 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:31.829
 by means of his Michael Schmieder who has become a regular 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.959
 has become HSV 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:36.749
 and again and again 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.669
 40 fighters 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.669
 Rummenigge no longer recognizable 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:54.439
 Michael Rummenigge 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:59.949
 such failures were on both sides on the run 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.739
 The game at this time nobody could heat even serious 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:19.999
 Happel 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:23.759
 With some concern registered that was already 30 minutes had passed 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:26.759
 without remarkable activity 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.199
 although the HSV had at least visually a slight overweight 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.949
 and here makes exactly 34 minutes for the first corner kick 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.939
 won the smelling conductor 

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:47.939
 Rummenigge learned rulers right up there 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.300
 the second big possibility 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.819
 disappointing during the first 45 minutes 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:20.139
 his passes were mostly across and back and when forward 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:22.789
 they reached the trade start 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.479
 Wehmeier on the right and school buildings left side that was such a small one 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.479
 Variant of Hans Appel 

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.889
 beautifully made by Schatzschneider 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.650
 if the ball is not in the game over Steam ISIN Lehmann especially in a hurry 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:51.650
 to continue the action 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.650
 how about the corner kick culture comes 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:59.259
 Referee is the falconer 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:06.789
 Peter Michel Rummenigge 

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.789
 at the last moment 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.080
 all that between the thirtieth 6 0 6 2 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.080
 your whole series of 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.440
 if Felix Magath are their luck they are dangerous
