I think I possibly killed all the nerves

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.430 
I think I possibly killed all the nerves
of<00:03:22.520> my<00:03:22.700> mouth<00:03:23.270> because<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.720> doesn't<00:03:23.930> hurt<00:03:24.080> as

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
much as time I can feel like an ass back

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.780 
much as time I can feel like an ass back
of<00:03:28.520> my<00:03:28.670> mother<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.980> really<00:03:31.160> hurting<00:03:31.430> in<00:03:31.670> my
