00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
parts that are rusted and missing but

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.529 
parts that are rusted and missing but
pretty<00:04:18.810> much<00:04:18.840> complete<00:04:19.349> and<00:04:20.150> it's<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.299> short

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:21.539 
pretty much complete and it's the short

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.790 
pretty much complete and it's the short
bed<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:22.079> it's<00:04:22.199> what<00:04:22.349> I've<00:04:22.440> been<00:04:22.530> looking<00:04:22.650> for
