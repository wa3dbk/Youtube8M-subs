00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.770
 now all welcome to an episode 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
 more here in drawing and creating that you 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.900
 speak milton core and then what 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.539
 what we are going to do is a pyramid of 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.279
 Specifically what would be the hole 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.250
 of concrete that we made in the video 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.840
 previous but this time is to invest 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.020
 because then the result will be a 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.450
 four-level pyramid four 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.430
 levels although well the hole we did 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.210
 It was three levels 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.040
 then we started making the pyramid 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.470
 in perspective I'm with a view 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.780
 inclined then we should do it in 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.250
 perspective correctly and then look 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.320
 through the camera and correct some 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.890
 details because if we do it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.110
 in perfect perspective of I take the lens 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.870
 of the camera tends to deform the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.580
 figure a little pictures then 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.590
 some sides will be very sides 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.180
 then anyway you have to look at 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.480
 through the camera and correct the 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.190
 tips that are deviated like you 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.920
 you can notice me deep down I've already taken 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.290
 some had previously made a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.100
 sketch 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.540
 and I have some brands of what I did to 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.790
 through the camera then mark the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.840
 points between those lines of agreement 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.060
 to the camera and so I managed to make 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.430
 the whole map to make it look 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.810
 correctly because remember that then 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.420
 this is a drawing in love cicu los dibus 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.520
 anamorphic if they are not perfect in the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.890
 but they actually disfigure an 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.350
 little in the top and in the part 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.390
 from below because more or less they go from 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.960
 according to what the camera should 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.960
 show us 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.390
 Once our sketch is finished 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.400
 we started to apply already the shadows and 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.260
 This face is the one that is most supposed to 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.460
 the light then the darkest face the 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.990
 another side of me what is curious is a 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.990
 little but it's going to be a bit milder 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.810
 we continue with the opposite side this 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.369
 side is a little more in front of the light 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.470
 then this side is a bit more 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 illuminated the same we do the same 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.130
 we just apply a little less 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:18.170
 graphite pencil they do we take less 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.170
 and we also spread with a napkin 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 good and now step after we do the 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.390
 shadow remember that the shadow 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.280
 we have to draw it well in 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.989
 perspective depending on where you 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.720
 have the light depending on where 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.890
 you want to project the light in that way the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.470
 the light 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.300
 hit the pyramid and it will be projected from 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.280
 some certain way in this case mine 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.840
 is projected in this way we will take 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.490
 some perspective exercises where 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.490
 I will explain this part for people 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:49.040
 what point do not know this basic part 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.469
 perspective and shadows 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.019
 also darken these sides a bit 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.180
 with the help of black pencil 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.310
 but it will also add a bit of 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.459
 marker 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.130
 he also applied lighter marker in 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.720
 this side that is more front jobs and 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.580
 I do not need to apply the pencil 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.260
 of black color because I equally desire 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.110
 Conserve clarity because this side 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.120
 it is more in front of the light 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.760
 then we start doing the shadow 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.650
 and what I do is that he applied several layers 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.140
 of graphite and I'm growing more part 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.580
 which is closer to the wall of the 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.580
 pyramid unesco feels a little more 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.570
 and we finished adding some details 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.410
 more with the help of the blur and the pencil 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.410
 black 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.500
 and now what I do is add many 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.810
 little black dots with the help of this 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.209
 marker 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.700
 is alive that is very thin and in the 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:55.430
 part where the shadows are also 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.120
 added a bit of white dots with the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.120
 gel pen 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.040
 finally I also wanted to add a 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.890
 cracking to give it a little more 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.470
 that concrete feeling and then with the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.720
 help of this black marker is vilo and 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.080
 with the help of the gel pen 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.080
 White 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.889
 and this is the final result I hope that 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.349
 you liked please get in 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:30.569
 practice thank you very much for watching this 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:33.539
 video thank you for visiting the channel 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:36.180
 please subscribe you also share this 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.349
 video like it good and do not take the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.690
 next leave all the clients that 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.190
 wish and I answer you with pleasure 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.580
