like clip best so you listen take like

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.840 
like clip best so you listen take like
half<00:01:54.969> an<00:01:55.299> hour<00:01:55.390> reload<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.249> is<00:01:57.280> a<00:01:57.549> video

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.170 
trying a killstreak up cuz i got i like
running<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.220> bell<00:04:15.370> like<00:04:15.550> running<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.850> gun<00:04:16.060> in

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
running the bell like running the gun in

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.909 
running the bell like running the gun in
but<00:04:16.419> when<00:04:16.570> i'm<00:04:16.660> not<00:04:16.840> using<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.260> submachine<00:04:17.739> gun

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
but when i'm not using a submachine gun

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.500 
but when i'm not using a submachine gun
i<00:04:18.070> don't<00:04:18.250> have<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.430> confidence<00:04:18.609> to<00:04:19.030> just<00:04:19.180> run

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
i don't have the confidence to just run

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.630 
i don't have the confidence to just run
a<00:04:19.540> boat<00:04:19.720> in<00:04:19.870> going<00:04:20.140> because<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.709> don't<00:04:21.459> feel

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
a boat in going because I don't feel

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.330 
a boat in going because I don't feel
like<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.060> LNG<00:04:22.510> can<00:04:22.720> react<00:04:23.050> as<00:04:23.290> quick

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
like the LNG can react as quick

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.689 
like the LNG can react as quick
and<00:04:24.870> they<00:04:25.870> get<00:04:26.110> firings<00:04:26.680> all<00:04:26.830> right<00:04:27.040> but<00:04:27.370> I

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:27.699 
and they get firings all right but I

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.820 
and they get firings all right but I
ain't<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.180> most<00:04:28.360> accurate<00:04:28.660> person<00:04:29.290> so<00:04:29.560> I

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
ain't the most accurate person so I

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.800 
ain't the most accurate person so I
think<00:04:30.790> when<00:04:30.910> a<00:04:30.940> running<00:04:31.270> gun<00:04:31.419> i'm<00:04:31.570> going<00:04:31.750> to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
think when a running gun i'm going to

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.100 
think when a running gun i'm going to
use<00:04:31.930> an<00:04:32.110> SMG<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:33.570> if<00:04:34.570> i'm<00:04:34.690> using<00:04:34.960> something

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
use an SMG and if i'm using something

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.540 
use an SMG and if i'm using something
that<00:04:35.350> i'm<00:04:35.530> probably<00:04:35.710> gonna<00:04:35.889> second<00:04:36.310> count

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
that i'm probably gonna second count

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.030 
that i'm probably gonna second count
like<00:04:36.820> either<00:04:36.970> the<00:04:37.240> nervous<00:04:37.800> spraying<00:04:38.800> for

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
like either the nervous spraying for

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.469 
like either the nervous spraying for
kills<00:04:40.740> so<00:04:41.740> i<00:04:41.770> think<00:04:41.979> i'm<00:04:42.220> guessing<00:04:43.030> killstreak

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
kills so i think i'm guessing killstreak

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:51.420 
kills so i think i'm guessing killstreak
airing<00:04:46.169> bazinga<00:04:47.169> as<00:04:48.990> Sheldon<00:04:49.990> would<00:04:50.139> say<00:04:50.430> big

fun when you if you know someone sound

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.010 
fun when you if you know someone sound
like<00:06:47.280> a<00:06:47.340> high<00:06:47.430> CO<00:06:47.670> streak<00:06:47.970> and<00:06:48.240> you<00:06:48.330> just<00:06:48.510> take

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
like a high CO streak and you just take

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.110 
like a high CO streak and you just take
them<00:06:49.170> out<00:06:49.320> there<00:06:49.830> camping<00:06:50.220> and<00:06:50.430> then<00:06:50.610> you<00:06:50.970> know

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120

maybe<00:06:57.990> less<00:06:58.110> of<00:06:58.620> this<00:06:59.520> game<00:07:00.210> left<00:07:01.070> because<00:07:02.390> we

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
maybe less of this game left because we

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.540 
maybe less of this game left because we
