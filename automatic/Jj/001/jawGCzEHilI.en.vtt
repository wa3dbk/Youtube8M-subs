00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 damien we will make a great base 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.460
 base of the kitchen we will simplify it 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.569
 we will do it really for us 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.740
 what is called a white background make a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.820
 small broth of poultry broth 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.920
 poultry super sam that we will use 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.320
 for sous to make sauces 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.780
 risotto the risottos finally it's short 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.090
 really it's me in my kitchen i 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.570
 constantly a white background and hair seen 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.699
 all my movements 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.869
 we went on pylons we can 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.920
 take carcasses we want to take 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.720
 wings we only take where 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.920
 the important thing is to have these 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.779
 ingredients that will bring elements 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
 tastings in it then especially of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 not too expensive pieces not pieces 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.859
 Too expensive it takes osce it takes a 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.219
 little bit skinny it's really 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.390
 important 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.989
 so we acquired three super phases 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.320
 important 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.059
 we will start with m carcasses the 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.309
 way to help the poultry piece 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 a little aromatic the poultry base of 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.690
 meat and we'll boil it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.940
 we do not touch it for now 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.170
 damien vegetables then forms there 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.300
 now a very important operation 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.219
 it can be skim these terms with a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.719
 skimmer skimmer so here there is a 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 small 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.329
 a small bowl with water all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.559
 simply for so as and as 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.750
 the corridors to put back the nails 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 in attack after attack with 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.439
 clean skimmer the scum gone now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.150
 add the aromatic garnish returns 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.360
 during matic we will put vegetables of 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.840
 taste have classically but a little bit 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.130
 carrots 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.930
 here are the carrots are beveled 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.220
 so that it brings more taste than that 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.900
 go faster a little bit of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.970
 leek 1 onion cost this is the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.310
 old town and kitchen but that's but 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 it's important to see a little bit of 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.630
 a little bit of laurel soft on the 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.909
 thyme and laurel and ter is when 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.960
 even scents a lot and even more 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.000
 mollo on daniel seasoning 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
 why then are we going to go on salt 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 but light enough for the taste we're going 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.130
 room is very slightly because everything 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.270
 at the time we talked about risotto we have 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.640
 talked about sauce we talked about things 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.049
 like that we would use 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.430
 was going to do with this white background and when 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.869
 we will reduce it if it is already good 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.950
 salty in that amount when we go the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.799
 reduce but it will necessarily become 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.210
 too salty cooking an hour 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.070
 according to the size of your carcass then 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 day after the drumsticks so the car a 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 good morning to shudder and then we'll 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.899
 leave well to the rockets frankly 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.130
 gently gently no lid 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.600
 especially not to cover that she did not 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 forgot to say if you have any 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.789
 carcasses are cut into quarters 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.319
 cut them into pieces 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.430
 we are not the whole carcass and we 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.819
 go and then we'll pass it pass 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.780
 very fine vegetables canned meat ans 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.799
 something else with us what we 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.950
 interested this time it's really the 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.950
 mug
