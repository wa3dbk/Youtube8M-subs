00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
hi Rory a full cycle and this is the

hi Rory a full cycle and this is the
full<00:00:13.170> review<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.799> giant<00:00:14.190> avail<00:00:14.879> composite

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
full review of the giant avail composite

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:23.989 
full review of the giant avail composite
3<00:00:16.289> 2014<00:00:18.859> it's<00:00:19.859> the<00:00:20.100> entry<00:00:20.730> for<00:00:21.270> us<00:00:21.769> of<00:00:22.999> carbon

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:23.999 
3 2014 it's the entry for us of carbon

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:27.140 
3 2014 it's the entry for us of carbon
bikes<00:00:24.179> and<00:00:24.480> at<00:00:25.470> 1649<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.400> think<00:00:26.789> for<00:00:27.029> most

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
bikes and at 1649 I think for most

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.759 
bikes and at 1649 I think for most
companies<00:00:27.419> you're<00:00:28.169> not<00:00:28.289> you're<00:00:28.499> gonna<00:00:28.589> have<00:00:28.740> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
companies you're not you're gonna have a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.950 
companies you're not you're gonna have a
hard<00:00:28.949> time<00:00:29.159> finding<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.820> price<00:00:30.509> point<00:00:30.689> lower

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
hard time finding a price point lower

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.069 
hard time finding a price point lower
than<00:00:31.199> that<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.009> started<00:00:32.340> with<00:00:32.460> carbon

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
than that to get started with carbon

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:34.880 
than that to get started with carbon
that's<00:00:34.079> what's<00:00:34.290> really<00:00:34.440> beautiful<00:00:34.620> about

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
that's what's really beautiful about

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.880 
that's what's really beautiful about
this<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:36.329> really<00:00:36.600> gives<00:00:36.810> somebody<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
this is it it really gives somebody the

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.900 
this is it it really gives somebody the
opportunity<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.329> straight<00:00:39.690> into<00:00:40.910> carbon

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
opportunity to get straight into carbon

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
opportunity to get straight into carbon
as<00:00:42.239> may<00:00:42.449> be<00:00:42.510> their<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.079> road<00:00:43.410> bike<00:00:43.649> or<00:00:43.920> it's

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
as may be their first road bike or it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.910 
as may be their first road bike or it's
an<00:00:45.000> inexpensive<00:00:45.600> way<00:00:46.109> to<00:00:46.140> upgrade<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.890> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
an inexpensive way to upgrade to a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.090 
an inexpensive way to upgrade to a
carbon<00:00:47.340> bike<00:00:48.530> what<00:00:49.530> I've<00:00:49.620> seen<00:00:49.829> in<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.010> past

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
carbon bike what I've seen in the past

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.310 
carbon bike what I've seen in the past
is<00:00:50.489> people<00:00:50.789> coming<00:00:50.820> in<00:00:51.179> may<00:00:51.359> be<00:00:51.420> writing

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is people coming in may be writing

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.139 
is people coming in may be writing
hybrids<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.859> are<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.219> charity<00:00:53.670> events<00:00:54.030> or

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hybrids that are doing charity events or

other things or even group rides with
their<00:00:56.129> friends<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.550> they<00:00:57.449> want<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.750> take<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.919 --> 00:00:57.929 
their friends and they want to take it

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:00.020 
their friends and they want to take it
to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> next<00:00:58.410> level<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.730> course<00:00:59.760> you

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to the next level but of course you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.850 
to the next level but of course you
don't<00:01:00.120> want<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> pull<00:01:00.480> your<00:01:00.570> budget<00:01:03.019> 1649<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.410> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
don't want to pull your budget 1649 is a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.610 
don't want to pull your budget 1649 is a
great<00:01:05.190> price<00:01:05.460> point<00:01:05.900> to<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.260> carbon

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:07.620 
great price point to get it to carbon

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.710 
great price point to get it to carbon
now<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.100> they<00:01:08.310> manage<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.700> do<00:01:08.850> that<00:01:08.910> a<00:01:09.240> giant

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
now how they manage to do that a giant

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.899 
now how they manage to do that a giant
is<00:01:09.870> basically<00:01:10.680> they<00:01:10.860> instead<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> striking<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is basically they instead of striking it

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.330 
is basically they instead of striking it
with<00:01:12.540> one<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.170> your<00:01:13.259> models<00:01:13.409> hiring<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.130> lot<00:01:14.220> of

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
with one of your models hiring a lot of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.520 
with one of your models hiring a lot of
component<00:01:14.759> lines<00:01:14.909> expected<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.479> Jack<00:01:15.720> which

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
component lines expected with Jack which

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.149 
component lines expected with Jack which
is<00:01:16.829> a<00:01:17.790> lot<00:01:18.090> more<00:01:18.350> reliable<00:01:19.350> than<00:01:19.409> most<00:01:19.740> people

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
is a lot more reliable than most people

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
is a lot more reliable than most people
realize<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.299> going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.509> last<00:01:21.740> most

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
realize it's actually going to last most

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.260 
realize it's actually going to last most
people<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> lot<00:01:23.460> longer<00:01:23.729> than<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.210> think

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
people for a lot longer than they think

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
people for a lot longer than they think
yes<00:01:25.079> it's<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.409> quite<00:01:25.710> as<00:01:25.829> light<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.899> Gerace<00:01:27.899> or

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
yes it's not quite as light as Gerace or

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.850 
yes it's not quite as light as Gerace or
I'll<00:01:28.740> Tegra<00:01:29.130> 4<00:01:29.520> 105<00:01:30.119> but<00:01:31.079> you're<00:01:31.619> staying

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'll Tegra 4 105 but you're staying

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.350 
I'll Tegra 4 105 but you're staying
already<00:01:32.189> saving<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.610> lot<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.880> weight<00:01:33.000> on<00:01:33.240> this

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
already saving a lot of weight on this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.209 
already saving a lot of weight on this
carbon<00:01:33.630> frame<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> overall<00:01:34.409> package<00:01:34.860> is

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:35.219 
carbon frame so the overall package is

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:37.940 
carbon frame so the overall package is
still<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.700> light<00:01:36.140> tiagra<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.350> course<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:37.770> is

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
still very light tiagra of course now is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.459 
still very light tiagra of course now is
also<00:01:38.280> 10<00:01:38.759> speed<00:01:39.090> which<00:01:39.659> was<00:01:39.899> one<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> big

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
also 10 speed which was one of the big

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.550 
also 10 speed which was one of the big
differences<00:01:41.219> between<00:01:41.780> tiara<00:01:42.780> and<00:01:42.930> 105<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
differences between tiara and 105 in the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
differences between tiara and 105 in the
past<00:01:43.770> he<00:01:43.979> ever<00:01:44.100> used<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.520> be<00:01:44.610> 9<00:01:44.820> 10<00:01:45.479> 5<00:01:45.750> years<00:01:45.960> we

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
past he ever used to be 9 10 5 years we

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.649 
past he ever used to be 9 10 5 years we
tend<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.469> be<00:01:46.619> now<00:01:47.280> let's<00:01:47.520> ten<00:01:47.790> speed<00:01:48.060> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
tend to be now let's ten speed it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
tend to be now let's ten speed it's
really<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.259> know<00:01:49.380> closing<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.100> gap<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
really you know closing the gap the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.969 
really you know closing the gap the
differences<00:01:51.390> between<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.869> two<00:01:51.899> aren't<00:01:52.469> quite

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
differences between the two aren't quite

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.370 
differences between the two aren't quite
as<00:01:53.009> drastic<00:01:53.670> there's<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.630> one<00:01:54.960> difference

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
as drastic there's still one difference

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.580 
as drastic there's still one difference
if<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.530> need<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.829> take<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> look<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.369> maybe<00:01:57.590> with

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
if you need to take a look at maybe with

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.399 
if you need to take a look at maybe with
the<00:01:58.969> rest<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.149> traumatic<00:02:00.390> group<00:02:00.689> above<00:02:01.079> this

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
the rest of traumatic group above this

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.819 
the rest of traumatic group above this
you<00:02:02.369> do<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.820> into<00:02:02.969> internal<00:02:03.420> routing<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
you do get into internal routing of the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.950 
you do get into internal routing of the
shift<00:02:05.070> cables<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.969> Tiago<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> routing<00:02:06.840> is

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
shift cables with Tiago the routing is

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.060
