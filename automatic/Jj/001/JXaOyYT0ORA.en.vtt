00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
compared with one another we're trying

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
compared with one another we're trying
to<00:00:20.460> find<00:00:20.699> out<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:20.850> benefits<00:00:21.510> features<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
homestyle bins so that we can give some

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
homestyle bins so that we can give some
idea<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> homeowner<00:00:29.849> which<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> these

the advantages of it is that it's that

assemble that also works out to be one
of<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> disadvantages<00:00:58.649> we've<00:00:59.579> we<00:01:00.390> typically

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
of the disadvantages we've we typically

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.529 
of the disadvantages we've we typically
find<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.829> want<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.489> turn<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
find that when we want to turn the

to<00:01:47.369> hold<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> fork<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.299> kind<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.720> fulcrum

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to hold the fork it's kind of a fulcrum

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
to hold the fork it's kind of a fulcrum
in<00:01:49.350> in<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.920> process<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:51.180> need<00:01:51.390> that

in in the process and you need that

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.480 
in in the process and you need that
sometimes<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.619> good<00:01:52.890> sturdy<00:01:53.220> one

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
sometimes and this is a good sturdy one

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.179 
sometimes and this is a good sturdy one
so<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.060> works<00:01:54.270> well<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.259> next<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.710> here<00:01:56.040> is

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
so it works well this next one here is

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.600 
so it works well this next one here is
perhaps<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.509> simplest<00:01:57.869> one<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.460> most

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
perhaps the simplest one and is the most

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.670 
perhaps the simplest one and is the most
elegant<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.450> ways<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:00.930> have<00:02:01.259> three<00:02:01.560> of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
elegant in some ways I have three of

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.620 
elegant in some ways I have three of
these<00:02:01.799> myself<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> use<00:02:02.790> them<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.299> really

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
these myself and I use them and I really

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.560 
these myself and I use them and I really
I<00:02:03.810> really<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.850> can<00:02:06.030> simply<00:02:06.390> just

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I really like them you can simply just

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.380 
I really like them you can simply just
grab<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.899> and<00:02:07.310> slide<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> right<00:02:08.550> off<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
grab it and slide it right off of the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.710 
grab it and slide it right off of the
pile<00:02:09.690> set<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.619> next<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.160> and<00:02:11.390> put<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.480> pile

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
pile set it next to it and put the pile

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.610 
pile set it next to it and put the pile
right<00:02:12.959> back<00:02:13.230> in

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
right back in

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.030 
right back in
this<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.670> vest<00:02:15.000> bro<00:02:15.239> model<00:02:15.870> we<00:02:16.680> found

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
this one is the vest bro model we found

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.490 
this one is the vest bro model we found
it<00:02:17.190> to<00:02:17.340> work<00:02:17.519> pretty<00:02:17.819> well<00:02:17.940> it's<00:02:18.599> very<00:02:19.080> similar

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it to work pretty well it's very similar

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740 
it to work pretty well it's very similar
to<00:02:19.709> these<00:02:20.099> models<00:02:20.610> here<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.180> has<00:02:21.450> enough

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
to these models here it has enough

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509 
to these models here it has enough
tensile<00:02:22.290> strength<00:02:22.590> on<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.920> edge<00:02:23.069> to<00:02:23.370> be<00:02:23.400> able

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
tensile strength on the edge to be able

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.050 
tensile strength on the edge to be able
to<00:02:23.730> use<00:02:23.849> as<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> fulcrum<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:25.409> has<00:02:25.620> enough<00:02:26.060> holes

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
to use as a fulcrum it has enough holes

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.479 
to use as a fulcrum it has enough holes
to<00:02:27.420> allow<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.019> oxygen<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.010> air<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.280> come

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
to allow the the oxygen and air to come

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:32.930 
to allow the the oxygen and air to come
in<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:31.349> one<00:02:31.560> disadvantage<00:02:31.980> I<00:02:32.370> have<00:02:32.519> found<00:02:32.760> so

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
in the one disadvantage I have found so

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.330 
in the one disadvantage I have found so
far<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.329> this<00:02:33.510> is<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.840> really<00:02:34.140> every<00:02:35.099> time

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
far on this is that really every time

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.309 
far on this is that really every time
you<00:02:35.489> try<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.819> move<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.629> does<00:02:36.959> come<00:02:37.200> apart

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
you try and move it it does come apart

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.740 
you try and move it it does come apart
so<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.459> Reese<00:02:38.670> lied<00:02:39.060> all<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.390> pieces

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
so you have to Reese lied all the pieces

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.069 
so you have to Reese lied all the pieces
back<00:02:40.110> together<00:02:40.790> just<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.909> reform<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.629> but<00:02:42.959> it

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
back together just to reform it but it

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.630 
back together just to reform it but it
really<00:02:43.230> it's<00:02:43.799> so<00:02:43.980> far<00:02:44.220> it's<00:02:44.310> worked<00:02:44.549> pretty

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
really it's so far it's worked pretty

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.869 
really it's so far it's worked pretty
well<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> compost<00:02:45.660> looks<00:02:45.930> good<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.879> the

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
well the compost looks good in this the

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.949 
well the compost looks good in this the
next<00:02:48.120> one<00:02:48.299> here<00:02:48.569> is<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.750> dual<00:02:49.340> bin<00:02:50.690> it's<00:02:51.690> called

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
next one here is a dual bin it's called

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.390 
next one here is a dual bin it's called
the<00:02:52.049> earth<00:02:52.200> engine<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.209> I<00:02:55.099> think<00:02:56.099> that<00:02:56.280> the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the earth engine and I think that the

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.990 
the earth engine and I think that the
point<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.849> view<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.120> the<00:02:57.450> manufacturer<00:02:58.319> had

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
point of view that the manufacturer had

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.259 
point of view that the manufacturer had
was<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.299> could<00:03:00.739> turn<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:02.099> bin<00:03:02.400> into<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
was that you could turn one bin into the

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.479 
was that you could turn one bin into the
other<00:03:03.480> without<00:03:03.750> any<00:03:04.560> movement<00:03:05.040> or

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
other without any movement or

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.050 
other without any movement or
disassembling<00:03:06.480> at<00:03:06.629> all<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.739> can<00:03:07.920> put<00:03:08.909> these

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
disassembling at all you can put these

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.930 
disassembling at all you can put these
slats<00:03:09.569> in<00:03:10.049> as<00:03:10.590> high<00:03:10.920> as<00:03:11.129> you<00:03:11.280> need<00:03:11.310> them<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
slats in as high as you need them and

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.390 
slats in as high as you need them and
you<00:03:12.239> can<00:03:12.390> take<00:03:12.569> them<00:03:12.750> out<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.170> change<00:03:13.829> the<00:03:14.159> to

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
you can take them out to change the to

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.759 
you can take them out to change the to
turn<00:03:14.579> the<00:03:14.760> load<00:03:14.940> this<00:03:15.750> is<00:03:15.930> called<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.260> compost

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
turn the load this is called a compost

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.400 
turn the load this is called a compost
tumbler<00:03:17.010> this<00:03:17.400> is<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.730> double<00:03:18.230> model<00:03:19.230> there

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
tumbler this is the double model there

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.979 
tumbler this is the double model there
is<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> single<00:03:20.040> model<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:23.359> as<00:03:24.359> you<00:03:24.599> can<00:03:24.750> see

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
is a single model it has as you can see

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.800 
is a single model it has as you can see
here<00:03:25.250> panels<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.459> remove<00:03:29.480> there's<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.540> wall

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
here panels that remove there's a wall

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.180 
here panels that remove there's a wall
between<00:03:30.840> the<00:03:31.410> two<00:03:33.139> that's<00:03:34.139> the<00:03:34.590> manufacturer

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
between the two that's the manufacturer

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.610 
between the two that's the manufacturer
suggest<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:35.910> that's<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.109> you<00:03:37.260> can<00:03:37.410> have

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
suggest that that's so that you can have

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.190 
suggest that that's so that you can have
it<00:03:37.769> going<00:03:38.069> one<00:03:38.669> that's<00:03:38.910> already<00:03:39.269> going<00:03:39.840> and

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
it going one that's already going and

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.229 
it going one that's already going and
then<00:03:40.560> begin<00:03:40.950> another<00:03:41.280> one<00:03:41.459> as<00:03:41.609> you<00:03:41.730> as<00:03:41.970> you're

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
then begin another one as you as you're

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.960 
then begin another one as you as you're
working<00:03:42.389> along<00:03:42.870> and<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.340> can<00:03:44.549> have<00:03:44.730> them

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
working along and so you can have them

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.930 
working along and so you can have them
at<00:03:45.419> different<00:03:45.870> states<00:03:46.139> of<00:03:46.379> decomposition<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
at different states of decomposition and

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.960 
at different states of decomposition and
then<00:03:48.569> once<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:49.160> everything<00:03:50.160> has<00:03:50.430> been<00:03:50.609> added

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
then once it's everything has been added

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.819 
then once it's everything has been added
into<00:03:51.419> it<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:54.120> close<00:03:54.449> it<00:03:54.629> up<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:54.870> tumble<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.650> by

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
into it you close it up and tumble it by

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:04.170 
into it you close it up and tumble it by
a<00:03:56.540> handle<00:03:57.540> over<00:03:57.750> here<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.019> the<00:03:58.109> side

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.759 

you<00:04:05.180> can<00:04:05.329> hear<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.599> tumbling<00:04:06.049> in<00:04:06.170> there<00:04:06.349> I

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.259 

think<00:04:12.769> when<00:04:12.950> they<00:04:13.099> designed<00:04:13.519> the<00:04:13.819> tumblers

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
think when they designed the tumblers

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.240 
think when they designed the tumblers
what<00:04:14.870> they<00:04:14.989> were<00:04:15.049> looking<00:04:15.230> for<00:04:15.439> is<00:04:15.799> trying<00:04:16.160> to

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
what they were looking for is trying to

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.610 
what they were looking for is trying to
take<00:04:16.459> some<00:04:16.699> of<00:04:16.729> the<00:04:16.880> work<00:04:17.090> of<00:04:17.380> tumbling<00:04:18.380> and

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
take some of the work of tumbling and

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.789 
take some of the work of tumbling and
turning<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.310> compost<00:04:20.229> take<00:04:21.229> that<00:04:21.380> off<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.769> a

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
turning the compost take that off of a

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.400 
turning the compost take that off of a
burden<00:04:22.250> off<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.759> us<00:04:22.940> and<00:04:23.810> it<00:04:23.990> works<00:04:24.199> pretty

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
burden off of us and it works pretty

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.439 
burden off of us and it works pretty
good<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:25.400> one<00:04:25.520> thing<00:04:25.729> I<00:04:25.850> have<00:04:26.000> found<00:04:26.210> with

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:26.449 
good the one thing I have found with

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:28.330 
good the one thing I have found with
this<00:04:26.630> particular<00:04:27.169> one<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.500> that<00:04:27.620> it's<00:04:27.740> tens

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
this particular one is that it's tens

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.749 
this particular one is that it's tens
when<00:04:29.030> it's<00:04:29.389> the<00:04:29.630> material<00:04:30.110> was<00:04:30.259> new<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.770> not

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 
when it's the material was new and not

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.999 
when it's the material was new and not
decomposed<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.600> tends<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:32.990> roll<00:04:33.350> it<00:04:33.560> in<00:04:33.710> a<00:04:33.830> big

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
decomposed it tends to roll it in a big

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:35.800 
decomposed it tends to roll it in a big
ball<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.850> we've<00:04:35.000> had<00:04:35.150> to<00:04:35.270> get<00:04:35.389> in<00:04:35.479> there<00:04:35.660> with<00:04:35.780> a

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
ball so we've had to get in there with a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.620 
ball so we've had to get in there with a
pitchfork<00:04:36.080> and<00:04:36.620> actually<00:04:37.300> separate<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.419> re

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
pitchfork and actually separate it re

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.740 
pitchfork and actually separate it re
wet<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.990> and<00:04:39.259> then<00:04:39.800> it<00:04:39.919> worked<00:04:40.099> pretty<00:04:40.340> well

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
wet it and then it worked pretty well

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.870 
wet it and then it worked pretty well
the<00:04:41.750> other<00:04:41.930> disadvantage<00:04:42.410> is<00:04:42.860> raising<00:04:43.789> the

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
the other disadvantage is raising the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.810 
the other disadvantage is raising the
material<00:04:44.300> up<00:04:44.479> so<00:04:44.780> high<00:04:45.020> into<00:04:45.380> it<00:04:45.770> and<00:04:45.949> I<00:04:46.310> think

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:46.820 
material up so high into it and I think

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.189 
material up so high into it and I think
there's<00:04:47.000> a<00:04:47.060> given<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.660> take<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:48.050> this

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
there's a given a take on this

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.439 
there's a given a take on this
particular<00:04:48.830> one<00:04:49.009> well<00:04:49.759> it<00:04:49.849> works<00:04:50.000> pretty<00:04:50.180> good

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
particular one well it works pretty good

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:50.860 
particular one well it works pretty good
so<00:04:50.599> far

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
so far

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.610 
so far
my<00:04:51.349> co<00:04:51.590> coordinator<00:04:52.190> Laurie<00:04:52.940> Murphy<00:04:53.560> this<00:04:54.560> is

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
my co coordinator Laurie Murphy this is

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.710 
my co coordinator Laurie Murphy this is
her<00:04:54.919> favorite<00:04:55.220> of<00:04:55.520> all<00:04:55.639> the<00:04:55.849> tumbler<00:04:56.240> ones<00:04:56.449> and

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
her favorite of all the tumbler ones and

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.540 
her favorite of all the tumbler ones and
there's<00:04:57.680> one<00:04:58.060> real<00:04:59.060> advantage<00:04:59.599> to<00:04:59.630> it<00:05:00.550> it's

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
there's one real advantage to it it's

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.760 
there's one real advantage to it it's
really<00:05:01.669> easy<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.360> get<00:05:02.840> the<00:05:02.960> material<00:05:03.410> in<00:05:03.590> and

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
really easy to get the material in and

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.650 
really easy to get the material in and
out<00:05:03.889> so<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.400> want<00:05:04.610> to<00:05:04.669> tumble<00:05:05.090> it<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.419> put

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
out so if you want to tumble it and put

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.290 
out so if you want to tumble it and put
it<00:05:05.780> back<00:05:05.810> in<00:05:06.199> you<00:05:06.380> can<00:05:06.530> open<00:05:06.830> one<00:05:07.009> of<00:05:07.130> these

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
it back in you can open one of these

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.570 
it back in you can open one of these
ends<00:05:08.300> and<00:05:08.510> then<00:05:08.960> just<00:05:09.169> pour<00:05:09.409> it<00:05:09.530> right<00:05:09.560> out<00:05:09.949> it

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
ends and then just pour it right out it

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.089 
ends and then just pour it right out it
also<00:05:10.760> has<00:05:11.090> an<00:05:11.210> axle<00:05:11.720> through<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.139> center<00:05:12.500> it

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
also has an axle through the center it

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.980 
also has an axle through the center it
tends<00:05:13.520> to<00:05:13.669> take<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:14.000> material<00:05:14.599> as<00:05:14.750> it's

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:14.990 
tends to take the material as it's

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:17.760 
tends to take the material as it's
falling<00:05:15.710> and<00:05:15.919> separate<00:05:16.909> it<00:05:17.030> so<00:05:17.300> it's<00:05:17.479> actually

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
falling and separate it so it's actually

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.040 
falling and separate it so it's actually
kind<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.830> turning<00:05:19.400> it<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.669> so<00:05:20.479> we<00:05:20.510> found<00:05:20.930> that

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
kind of turning it in so we found that

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.779 
kind of turning it in so we found that
that<00:05:21.110> is<00:05:21.349> an<00:05:21.470> advantage<00:05:21.800> on<00:05:22.070> this<00:05:22.190> particular

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789 
that is an advantage on this particular

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.020 
that is an advantage on this particular
one<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:24.050> compost<00:05:24.470> unit<00:05:24.860> looks<00:05:25.639> really

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
one and the compost unit looks really

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.110 
one and the compost unit looks really
good<00:05:26.240> so<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:27.740> one<00:05:27.949> is<00:05:28.070> this<00:05:28.340> isn't<00:05:28.699> kind<00:05:28.970> of<00:05:29.060> a

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
good so this one is this isn't kind of a

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.120 
good so this one is this isn't kind of a
favorite<00:05:29.570> on<00:05:29.659> the<00:05:29.780> tumbler<00:05:30.169> side<00:05:30.440> of<00:05:30.650> the<00:05:30.889> of

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
favorite on the tumbler side of the of

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.120 
favorite on the tumbler side of the of
the<00:05:32.090> compost<00:05:32.870> bins<00:05:33.610> as<00:05:34.610> you<00:05:34.820> can<00:05:34.970> see<00:05:35.240> very

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
the compost bins as you can see very

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.219 
the compost bins as you can see very
easy<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.340> tumble<00:05:37.870> it's<00:05:38.870> called<00:05:39.080> the

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
easy to tumble it's called the

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.879 
easy to tumble it's called the
tumbleweed<00:05:40.810> and<00:05:41.810> so<00:05:42.050> that's<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.470> one<00:05:42.710> that's

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
tumbleweed and so that's that one that's

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:45.610 
tumbleweed and so that's that one that's
got<00:05:43.099> air<00:05:43.340> vents<00:05:43.699> on<00:05:43.820> the<00:05:43.849> ends<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.360> allows<00:05:44.690> xxs

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
got air vents on the ends and allows xxs

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.589 
got air vents on the ends and allows xxs
moisture<00:05:46.130> to<00:05:46.250> drip<00:05:46.490> out<00:05:46.639> if<00:05:46.940> you've<00:05:47.180> got<00:05:47.210> too

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
moisture to drip out if you've got too

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:50.200 
moisture to drip out if you've got too
much<00:05:47.780> moisture<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.220> this<00:05:49.669> is<00:05:49.880> called<00:05:50.060> the

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
much moisture in it this is called the

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.960 
much moisture in it this is called the
enviro<00:05:50.630> cycle<00:05:52.840> you<00:05:53.840> take<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.729> tumble<00:05:55.729> it

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970 
enviro cycle you take it and tumble it

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:03.760 
enviro cycle you take it and tumble it
right<00:05:56.630> on<00:05:57.039> its<00:05:58.039> stand<00:06:01.389> it<00:06:02.389> has<00:06:02.570> two<00:06:02.840> vents<00:06:03.680> at

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
right on its stand it has two vents at

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.800 
right on its stand it has two vents at
the<00:06:03.800> bottom<00:06:04.280> to<00:06:04.460> allow<00:06:04.520> excess<00:06:05.210> moisture<00:06:05.449> to

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
the bottom to allow excess moisture to

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:12.010 
the bottom to allow excess moisture to
fall<00:06:06.020> out

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.290 

yeah<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.140> looks<00:06:13.320> like<00:06:13.410> I<00:06:13.560> didn't<00:06:13.800> have<00:06:13.980> that

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
yeah it looks like I didn't have that

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.850 
yeah it looks like I didn't have that
lid<00:06:15.300> on<00:06:15.450> quite<00:06:15.750> well<00:06:15.930> enough<00:06:16.320> so<00:06:16.500> that<00:06:16.620> could

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
lid on quite well enough so that could

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.770 
lid on quite well enough so that could
be<00:06:16.980> a<00:06:17.010> disadvantage<00:06:17.820> of<00:06:17.940> this<00:06:18.090> particular<00:06:18.660> one

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:18.780 
be a disadvantage of this particular one

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.210 
be a disadvantage of this particular one
you<00:06:18.930> have<00:06:19.050> to<00:06:19.170> make<00:06:19.320> sure<00:06:19.500> it's<00:06:19.680> shut<00:06:19.950> well

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
you have to make sure it's shut well

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:25.700 
you have to make sure it's shut well
enough<00:06:22.010> but<00:06:23.390> it<00:06:24.390> seems<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.080> be<00:06:25.200> doing<00:06:25.470> a<00:06:25.560> good

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
enough but it seems to be doing a good

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.450 
enough but it seems to be doing a good
job<00:06:25.770> the<00:06:26.610> next<00:06:26.790> one<00:06:27.060> here<00:06:28.100> came<00:06:29.100> in<00:06:29.220> at<00:06:29.340> the

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
job the next one here came in at the

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.240 
job the next one here came in at the
last<00:06:29.640> minute<00:06:30.200> we<00:06:31.200> found<00:06:31.230> that<00:06:31.770> this<00:06:31.980> one

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
last minute we found that this one

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.050 
last minute we found that this one
doesn't<00:06:32.640> give<00:06:32.970> enough<00:06:34.100> oxygen<00:06:35.100> or<00:06:35.250> air<00:06:35.490> so

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.060 
doesn't give enough oxygen or air so

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.690 
doesn't give enough oxygen or air so
initially<00:06:36.870> we<00:06:37.020> were<00:06:37.140> getting<00:06:37.440> some<00:06:37.740> anaerobic

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:38.700 
initially we were getting some anaerobic

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.630 
initially we were getting some anaerobic
situations<00:06:39.630> going<00:06:39.990> on<00:06:40.230> anaerobic<00:06:40.920> microbes

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:41.640 
situations going on anaerobic microbes

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.420 
situations going on anaerobic microbes
will<00:06:41.910> kill<00:06:42.750> the<00:06:43.020> beneficial<00:06:43.380> microbes<00:06:43.860> that

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:44.430 
will kill the beneficial microbes that

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.680 
will kill the beneficial microbes that
are<00:06:44.520> doing<00:06:44.670> the<00:06:44.850> work<00:06:44.880> forest<00:06:45.450> and<00:06:45.630> the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
are doing the work forest and the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.500 
are doing the work forest and the
composting<00:06:46.350> so<00:06:46.980> at<00:06:47.700> first<00:06:48.060> we<00:06:48.240> had<00:06:48.330> some

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:48.510 
composting so at first we had some

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.950 
composting so at first we had some
trouble<00:06:48.810> with<00:06:48.900> it<00:06:48.960> we<00:06:49.500> did<00:06:49.680> discover<00:06:50.100> that<00:06:50.960> if

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
trouble with it we did discover that if

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.710 
trouble with it we did discover that if
we<00:06:52.170> shut<00:06:52.440> this<00:06:55.850> open<00:06:56.850> this<00:06:57.090> and<00:06:57.360> turned<00:06:57.570> it

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
we shut this open this and turned it

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.210 
we shut this open this and turned it
over<00:06:57.810> we<00:06:58.140> could<00:06:58.260> actually<00:06:58.650> drain<00:06:58.890> out<00:06:59.070> the

00:06:59.210 --> 00:06:59.220 
over we could actually drain out the

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.550 
over we could actually drain out the
extra<00:06:59.610> moisture<00:06:59.760> and<00:07:00.360> so<00:07:00.750> that<00:07:00.960> was<00:07:01.110> that<00:07:01.140> kind

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
extra moisture and so that was that kind

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.050 
extra moisture and so that was that kind
of<00:07:01.620> took<00:07:01.800> care<00:07:02.010> of<00:07:02.040> that<00:07:02.190> problem<00:07:02.250> and<00:07:02.850> the

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
of took care of that problem and the

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:05.270 
of took care of that problem and the
last<00:07:03.090> one<00:07:03.510> down<00:07:03.690> here<00:07:04.080> it's<00:07:04.620> really<00:07:04.890> set<00:07:05.250> up

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
last one down here it's really set up

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.600 
last one down here it's really set up
has<00:07:05.940> three<00:07:06.390> chambers<00:07:06.960> the<00:07:07.830> upper<00:07:08.190> chamber

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.610 
has three chambers the upper chamber

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:10.940 
has three chambers the upper chamber
here<00:07:08.940> which<00:07:09.450> has<00:07:09.720> a<00:07:09.750> shelf<00:07:10.169> that<00:07:10.380> you<00:07:10.530> can<00:07:10.710> pull

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
here which has a shelf that you can pull

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.730 
here which has a shelf that you can pull
out<00:07:10.980> and<00:07:11.160> drop<00:07:11.640> below<00:07:12.030> is<00:07:12.330> the<00:07:12.960> upper<00:07:13.320> chamber

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
out and drop below is the upper chamber

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.460 
out and drop below is the upper chamber
and<00:07:13.890> you're<00:07:13.980> doing<00:07:14.100> your<00:07:14.340> main<00:07:15.000> composition

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
and you're doing your main composition

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.440 
and you're doing your main composition
decomposition<00:07:16.470> up<00:07:16.620> here<00:07:17.070> pulling<00:07:18.030> this<00:07:18.270> out

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:18.450 
decomposition up here pulling this out

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.180 
decomposition up here pulling this out
dropping<00:07:19.020> it<00:07:19.140> down<00:07:19.320> then<00:07:19.560> you<00:07:19.650> started<00:07:20.070> again

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
dropping it down then you started again

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.550 
dropping it down then you started again
up<00:07:20.520> here<00:07:20.790> this<00:07:21.450> being<00:07:21.840> down<00:07:22.110> below<00:07:22.410> in<00:07:22.530> the

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:22.560 
up here this being down below in the

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.920 
up here this being down below in the
second<00:07:23.010> section<00:07:23.330> then<00:07:24.330> when<00:07:24.450> it<00:07:24.540> gets<00:07:24.690> to<00:07:24.810> the

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
second section then when it gets to the

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.800 
second section then when it gets to the
third<00:07:25.140> section<00:07:25.940> you<00:07:26.940> can<00:07:27.060> take<00:07:27.270> off<00:07:27.450> the<00:07:27.479> door

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:27.810 
third section you can take off the door

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.800 
third section you can take off the door
and<00:07:28.020> you<00:07:28.590> can<00:07:28.770> pull<00:07:28.979> out<00:07:29.160> of<00:07:29.190> here<00:07:29.520> and<00:07:29.810> just

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810 
and you can pull out of here and just

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.360 
and you can pull out of here and just
use<00:07:31.200> the<00:07:31.380> compost<00:07:31.800> that<00:07:32.010> you've<00:07:32.160> already

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370 
use the compost that you've already

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.330 
use the compost that you've already
formed<00:07:32.790> meanwhile<00:07:33.330> you<00:07:33.479> have<00:07:33.690> the<00:07:33.720> first

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:34.340 
formed meanwhile you have the first

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.710 
formed meanwhile you have the first
initial<00:07:35.340> one<00:07:35.490> going<00:07:35.850> on<00:07:35.970> up<00:07:36.210> here<00:07:36.419> and<00:07:36.479> being

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 
initial one going on up here and being

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.110 
initial one going on up here and being
formed<00:07:37.260> so<00:07:37.830> that's<00:07:38.010> a<00:07:38.130> really<00:07:38.280> that's<00:07:38.729> a<00:07:38.940> great

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 
formed so that's a really that's a great

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.560 
formed so that's a really that's a great
advantage<00:07:39.450> of<00:07:39.690> that<00:07:39.810> particular<00:07:40.410> one
