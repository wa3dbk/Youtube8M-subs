cities the game pretty much follows the

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.230 
cities the game pretty much follows the
same<00:00:16.619> basic<00:00:16.680> formula<00:00:17.430> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> last<00:00:17.789> two<00:00:18.029> games

apart<00:00:18.810> from<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.080> shooting<00:00:19.470> which<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> new

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
apart from the shooting which is a new

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.189 
apart from the shooting which is a new
addition<00:00:20.100> here<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.180> campaign<00:00:21.570> itself<00:00:21.869> isn't

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
addition here the campaign itself isn't

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
addition here the campaign itself isn't
too<00:00:22.320> bad<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:22.920> often<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.250> overly<00:00:23.609> long

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
too bad but can often get overly long

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.700 
too bad but can often get overly long
and<00:00:23.939> repetitive<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> story<00:00:25.410> itself

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
and repetitive with the story itself

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.189 
and repetitive with the story itself
being<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.220> easy<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.640> lose<00:00:26.760> track<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.199> despite

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
being very easy to lose track of despite

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.509 
being very easy to lose track of despite
the<00:00:28.289> previous<00:00:28.439> game<00:00:28.830> including<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.310> ability

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
the previous game including the ability

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.700 
the previous game including the ability
to<00:00:29.849> leave<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.210> car<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:31.080> time<00:00:31.140> they<00:00:31.470> really

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to leave your car this time they really

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.380 
to leave your car this time they really
push<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:31.920> by<00:00:32.189> including<00:00:32.520> levels<00:00:32.940> devoted

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
push it by including levels devoted

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.240 
push it by including levels devoted
entirely<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.930> third-person<00:00:34.469> shooting

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
entirely to third-person shooting

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.069 
entirely to third-person shooting
I<00:00:35.280> think<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> shooting<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> nice<00:00:36.809> addition

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
I think the shooting is a nice addition

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.840 
I think the shooting is a nice addition
but<00:00:37.500> missions<00:00:37.920> shouldn't<00:00:38.250> be<00:00:38.340> totally

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
but missions shouldn't be totally

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.520 
but missions shouldn't be totally
reliant<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.360> this<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:40.200> really<00:00:40.410> ought<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
reliant on this they really ought to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.680 
reliant on this they really ought to
have<00:00:40.680> kept<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.160> minimum<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.760> then

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
have kept it to a minimum here then

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.540 
have kept it to a minimum here then
there's<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.989> controls<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:44.129> never<00:00:44.399> really

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
there's the controls it's never really

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.340 
there's the controls it's never really
bothered<00:00:44.879> me<00:00:44.910> too<00:00:45.180> much<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.719> unlike<00:00:46.170> other

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
bothered me too much but unlike other

this<00:00:51.960> can<00:00:52.140> make<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.530> hard<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> move

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
this can make it very hard to move

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
this can make it very hard to move
around<00:00:53.250> at<00:00:53.640> times<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> avoid<00:00:54.300> being<00:00:54.539> shot<00:00:54.739> but

around at times and avoid being shot but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
around at times and avoid being shot but

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
seriously guys get over yourselves it's

seriously guys get over yourselves it's
a<00:00:57.690> game<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.020> came<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.320> nearly<00:00:58.559> 10<00:00:58.859> years<00:00:59.070> ago

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
a game that came out nearly 10 years ago

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.860 
a game that came out nearly 10 years ago
and<00:00:59.760> for<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> amount<00:01:00.270> you'd<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> buying<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and for the amount you'd be buying it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.380 
and for the amount you'd be buying it
for<00:01:01.050> now<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.559> well<00:01:01.800> worth<00:01:01.980> ago<00:01:02.280> despite<00:01:03.149> the

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
for now it's well worth ago despite the

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.179 
for now it's well worth ago despite the
graphics<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:03.930> aging<00:01:04.290> too<00:01:04.500> well<00:01:04.710> by<00:01:04.860> today's

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.039 
graphics not aging too well by today's
standards<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.939> clear<00:01:06.360> they<00:01:06.630> went<00:01:06.840> through<00:01:06.990> a

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
standards it's clear they went through a

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.270 
standards it's clear they went through a
lot<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.229> effort<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.650> make<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> maps<00:01:08.130> as

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
lot of effort to make the maps as

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.090 
lot of effort to make the maps as
accurate<00:01:08.670> as<00:01:08.729> possible<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> real<00:01:09.479> places

accurate as possible to the real places

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.050 
accurate as possible to the real places
personally<00:01:11.100> I'd<00:01:11.220> say<00:01:11.400> that<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.760> alone

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
personally I'd say that this alone

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
personally I'd say that this alone
denies<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.720> game<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> any<00:01:13.229> rating<00:01:13.710> below<00:01:13.920> 6

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
denies the game of any rating below 6

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.359 
denies the game of any rating below 6
out<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.400> 10<00:01:14.720> so<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.080> driving<00:01:16.320> lend<00:01:16.680> well

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
out of 10 so about the driving lend well

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.620 
out of 10 so about the driving lend well
to<00:01:17.520> be<00:01:17.610> honest<00:01:17.820> I've<00:01:17.970> never<00:01:18.000> had<00:01:18.299> any<00:01:18.479> major

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
to be honest I've never had any major

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
to be honest I've never had any major

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
complaints about it the controls are

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.249 
complaints about it the controls are
pretty<00:01:20.580> basic<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.270> suppose<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> cars<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.229> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pretty basic I suppose and the cars do I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.749 
pretty basic I suppose and the cars do I
have<00:01:22.409> notable<00:01:22.799> differences<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.460> way<00:01:23.580> they

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
have notable differences in the way they

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.760 
have notable differences in the way they
handle<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.330> think<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.020> only<00:01:25.140> problem<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
handle I think the only problem is the

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.609 
handle I think the only problem is the
physics<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> crashes

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.810 

which<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.799> unrealistic<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.610> times

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
which can be unrealistic at times

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.340 
which can be unrealistic at times
