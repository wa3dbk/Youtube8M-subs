00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:26.140
 just keep in the video and to make 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.720
 Can not you crack that door? 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.540

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.820
 milk powder even chocolate 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.610
 tomato sauce and also needs to be 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.250
 plastic bottles 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.920
 glass it is used for where to capture them 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.750
 and there is better patina in the paint material 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.640
 in the colors you want can be 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.040
 several colors or one 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.170
 brush and the details in black I go 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.420
 do with these pens that are pens 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.329
 permanent used to beat on 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.189
 glass but you can use glue relieved 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.590
 glitter glue that will look cool too 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.840
 To start with, just paint tin with the 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 first I always like to spend two 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.570
 layers 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.250
 so I'll let the first one dry 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.250
 well and pass the second 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.709
 after it is very dry it is only 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.400
 to decorate I made lists every one list 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.380
 color 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.750
 but you can paint there is a whole color only 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.709
 to decorate with embossed glue 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.330
 pen 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.770

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.989
