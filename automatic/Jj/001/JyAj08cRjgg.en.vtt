liberal arts education is essentially
broad-based<00:00:22.259> multidisciplinary<00:00:23.259> education

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
broad-based multidisciplinary education

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.700 
broad-based multidisciplinary education
in<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.300> classroom<00:00:25.420> students<00:00:26.349> will<00:00:26.560> have

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
in the classroom students will have

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.740 
in the classroom students will have
exposure<00:00:27.250> to<00:00:27.669> a<00:00:27.700> wide<00:00:27.939> range<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.390> disciplines

exposure to a wide range of disciplines

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.589 
exposure to a wide range of disciplines
and<00:00:29.820> sometimes<00:00:30.820> there<00:00:31.060> is<00:00:31.150> a<00:00:31.180> misconception

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
and sometimes there is a misconception

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.540 
and sometimes there is a misconception
that<00:00:32.079> liberal<00:00:32.590> arts<00:00:32.770> education<00:00:32.860> is<00:00:33.430> about

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
that liberal arts education is about

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.939 
that liberal arts education is about
visual<00:00:34.030> arts<00:00:34.390> education<00:00:35.080> or<00:00:35.230> performing<00:00:35.710> arts
