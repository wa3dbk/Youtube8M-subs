alright<00:00:00.989> next<00:00:01.230> I'm<00:00:01.500> doing<00:00:01.530> some<00:00:02.040> aluminum

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
alright next I'm doing some aluminum

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.360 
alright next I'm doing some aluminum
brazing<00:00:03.240> this<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:03.990> the<00:00:04.170> water<00:00:04.410> intake<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.190> this

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
brazing this is the water intake on this

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.950 
brazing this is the water intake on this
lower<00:00:05.609> unit<00:00:06.060> down<00:00:06.210> here<00:00:06.420> where<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.629> see<00:00:06.779> that

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
lower unit down here where you see that

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.330 
lower unit down here where you see that
slot<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:08.870> stainless<00:00:09.870> steel<00:00:10.320> or<00:00:10.679> aluminum

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
slot and a stainless steel or aluminum

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.829 
slot and a stainless steel or aluminum
sleeve<00:00:11.639> screen<00:00:12.300> goes<00:00:12.599> in<00:00:12.809> there<00:00:13.049> along<00:00:13.830> with<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 
sleeve screen goes in there along with a

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.950 
sleeve screen goes in there along with a
plug<00:00:16.039> aluminum<00:00:17.039> plug<00:00:17.310> will<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.119> welded<00:00:18.570> down

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
plug aluminum plug will get welded down

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.090 
plug aluminum plug will get welded down
in<00:00:19.170> there<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.869> opening<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.439> eaten

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
in there so this opening was all eaten

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.790 
in there so this opening was all eaten
away<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.760> so<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.810> I've<00:00:24.930> done<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.470> stuck<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
away and so what I've done is I stuck a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.620 
away and so what I've done is I stuck a
I<00:00:26.869> had<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.900> nice<00:00:28.289> piece<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.769> steel<00:00:29.099> here<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:30.599> I

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I had a nice piece of steel here that I

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
I had a nice piece of steel here that I
was<00:00:31.019> able<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.320> put<00:00:31.650> into<00:00:31.800> here<00:00:32.040> that's<00:00:32.340> 1/2

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
was able to put into here that's 1/2

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.810 
was able to put into here that's 1/2
inch<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.540> happens<00:00:33.960> hole<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.440> while<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:35.640> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
inch that happens hole and while it's in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.459 
inch that happens hole and while it's in
there<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.149> aluminum<00:00:36.570> brazing<00:00:37.140> does<00:00:37.290> not

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there because aluminum brazing does not

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
there because aluminum brazing does not
stick<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.950> steel<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> makes<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:38.730> form<00:00:39.120> so<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
stick to steel it makes a good form so I

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.389 
stick to steel it makes a good form so I
was<00:00:39.809> able<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.110> build<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.590> up<00:00:40.800> again<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.250> get

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
was able to build that up again and get

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.779 
was able to build that up again and get
a<00:00:41.430> proper<00:00:42.440> Inlet<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.649> water<00:00:43.950> again<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.640> was

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
a proper Inlet for water again that was

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.400 
a proper Inlet for water again that was
all<00:00:44.969> eaten<00:00:45.360> away<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.809> I<00:00:45.840> was<00:00:45.960> able<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.230> build

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
all eaten away and I was able to build

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.069 
all eaten away and I was able to build
that<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.860> back<00:00:47.070> up<00:00:47.100> again<00:00:47.690> using<00:00:48.690> brazing

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
that all back up again using brazing

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.250 
that all back up again using brazing
rods<00:00:49.289> from<00:00:49.620> Harbor<00:00:50.610> Freight<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.750> that's<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
rods from Harbor Freight so that's a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.200 
rods from Harbor Freight so that's a
piece<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> leftover<00:00:53.460> brazing<00:00:53.850> rod<00:00:53.879> right

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
piece of the leftover brazing rod right

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.040 
piece of the leftover brazing rod right
there<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.660> I'm<00:00:55.079> using<00:00:55.320> map<00:00:55.680> gas<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.690> next<00:00:57.690> I'm

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
there and I'm using map gas so next I'm

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.700 
there and I'm using map gas so next I'm
working<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.859> the<00:01:00.199> other<00:01:01.199> side<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
working on the other side of the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.420 
working on the other side of the
cavitation<00:01:02.190> plate<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.960> remember<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
cavitation plate you remember that this

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.340 
cavitation plate you remember that this
only<00:01:05.640> had<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.119> side<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.659> other<00:01:06.689> side<00:01:06.900> had

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
only had one side the other side had

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.580 
only had one side the other side had
broken<00:01:07.619> off<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.119> I've<00:01:09.600> got<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> piece<00:01:10.170> here

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
broken off and so I've got a piece here

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.820 
broken off and so I've got a piece here
in<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.220> vise<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.900> I'm<00:01:13.080> working<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> I've<00:01:13.650> got

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
in the vise that I'm working on I've got

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
in the vise that I'm working on I've got
it<00:01:13.979> basically<00:01:14.400> shaped<00:01:14.820> now<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.450> I'm<00:01:15.540> going

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
it basically shaped now what I'm going

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.590 
it basically shaped now what I'm going
to<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.650> taper<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.670> edges<00:01:17.850> of

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
to do is I'm going to taper the edges of

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.060 
to do is I'm going to taper the edges of
everywhere<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.290> it's<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.770> braised

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
everywhere that it's going to be braised

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.300 
everywhere that it's going to be braised
it<00:01:20.700> gives<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.450> weld<00:01:21.890> so<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.130> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
it gives you a better weld so if you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.120 
it gives you a better weld so if you
look<00:01:23.700> at<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> now<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.600> pretty<00:01:24.990> flat<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
look at this now it's pretty flat and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.030 
look at this now it's pretty flat and
that's<00:01:26.759> not<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> great<00:01:27.479> surface<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
that's not a great surface to to do the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.399 
that's not a great surface to to do the
brazing<00:01:29.460> on<00:01:29.579> so<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:29.820> going<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> taper<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
brazing on so I'm going to taper all the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.789 
brazing on so I'm going to taper all the
edges<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.159> this<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:33.030> I've<00:01:33.090> already<00:01:33.270> tapered

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
edges on this and I've already tapered

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.950 
edges on this and I've already tapered
the<00:01:34.799> edges<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> be<00:01:36.630> attached

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the edges that it's going to be attached

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.219 
the edges that it's going to be attached
to<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.270> ready<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> weld<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> then

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
to here so it's ready to weld and then

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.740 
to here so it's ready to weld and then
I'll<00:01:40.409> put<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.710> couple<00:01:40.860> clamps<00:01:41.369> on<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.720> make<00:01:42.720> sure

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
I'll put a couple clamps on it make sure

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.630 
I'll put a couple clamps on it make sure
it's<00:01:43.049> straight<00:01:43.350> get<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> couple<00:01:44.009> braze<00:01:44.250> spots

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
it's straight get a couple braze spots

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.609 
it's straight get a couple braze spots
on<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.750> take<00:01:45.899> my<00:01:45.960> clamps<00:01:46.470> off

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
on it and then I can take my clamps off

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.889 
on it and then I can take my clamps off
and<00:01:46.829> finish<00:01:47.130> brazing<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.700> on<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.119> we<00:01:48.750> will

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
and finish brazing that on and we will

00:01:48.899 --> 00:02:19.740 
and finish brazing that on and we will
have<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> cavitation<00:01:50.130> plate<00:01:50.369> again

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.390 

so<00:02:20.750> while<00:02:20.930> I'm<00:02:21.050> tapering<00:02:21.470> down<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.890> edges<00:02:22.250> I'm

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
so while I'm tapering down the edges I'm

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.150 
so while I'm tapering down the edges I'm
also<00:02:22.880> feathering<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.810> edges<00:02:24.320> here<00:02:24.590> too<00:02:24.830> so

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
also feathering the edges here too so

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.610 
also feathering the edges here too so
you<00:02:25.820> can<00:02:26.000> see<00:02:26.180> right<00:02:26.360> here<00:02:26.780> I've<00:02:27.110> got<00:02:27.170> a<00:02:27.320> line

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
you can see right here I've got a line

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.190 
you can see right here I've got a line
that<00:02:27.890> I'm<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.430> know<00:02:28.550> getting<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.060> all<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
that I'm you know getting the all the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.800 
that I'm you know getting the all the
curvatures<00:02:30.710> and<00:02:30.920> everything<00:02:31.250> right<00:02:31.460> but<00:02:32.180> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
curvatures and everything right but you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.140 
curvatures and everything right but you
know<00:02:32.990> not<00:02:33.440> only<00:02:33.500> am<00:02:33.890> i<00:02:33.980> tapering<00:02:34.460> these<00:02:34.670> edges

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
know not only am i tapering these edges

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.480 
know not only am i tapering these edges
to<00:02:35.300> get<00:02:35.450> ready<00:02:35.660> for<00:02:35.720> brazing<00:02:36.440> but<00:02:37.100> I'll<00:02:37.250> also

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
to get ready for brazing but I'll also

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.190 
to get ready for brazing but I'll also
be<00:02:37.760> shaping<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> outside<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:38.900> this<00:02:39.050> will

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
be shaping the outside because this will

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.800 
be shaping the outside because this will
be<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.320> lot<00:02:39.500> easier<00:02:39.530> to<00:02:39.950> do<00:02:40.130> now<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:41.300> if<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.660> can

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
be a lot easier to do now so if you can

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.220 
be a lot easier to do now so if you can
see<00:02:42.020> that's<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.380> much<00:02:42.620> more<00:02:42.650> feathered<00:02:43.430> edge<00:02:47.230> by

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
see that's a much more feathered edge by

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.200 
see that's a much more feathered edge by
working<00:02:48.590> with<00:02:48.740> it<00:02:48.920> here<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.370> vise<00:02:49.580> now<00:02:49.910> so

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
working with it here in the vise now so

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.880 
working with it here in the vise now so
that's<00:02:50.810> what<00:02:51.050> I'm<00:02:51.140> working<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.620> right<00:02:51.680> now

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
that's what I'm working on right now

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.790 
that's what I'm working on right now
I'll<00:02:52.460> go<00:02:53.300> ahead<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.570> get<00:02:53.750> this<00:02:53.990> curve<00:02:54.320> shaped

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
I'll go ahead and get this curve shaped

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.130 
I'll go ahead and get this curve shaped
out<00:02:55.040> here<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.520> then<00:02:56.090> start<00:02:56.450> working<00:02:56.870> on<00:02:56.990> the

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
out here and then start working on the

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.230 
out here and then start working on the
taper<00:02:57.590> edge<00:02:57.860> because<00:02:58.340> you<00:02:58.550> don't<00:02:58.970> want<00:02:59.150> a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
taper edge because you don't want a

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.480 
taper edge because you don't want a
blunt<00:02:59.510> edge<00:02:59.780> of<00:03:00.410> the<00:03:00.560> egg<00:03:00.710> dents<00:03:01.010> you<00:03:01.220> want<00:03:01.400> it

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490 
blunt edge of the egg dents you want it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.700 
blunt edge of the egg dents you want it
to<00:03:01.610> taper<00:03:01.850> down<00:03:02.030> like<00:03:02.510> more<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.560> like<00:03:03.740> this

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
to taper down like more so like this

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:56.860 
to taper down like more so like this
glides<00:03:06.710> a<00:03:06.920> little<00:03:07.160> easier<00:03:07.460> through<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.760> water

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.879 

well<00:03:57.870> here<00:03:58.109> it<00:03:58.200> is<00:03:58.760> complete<00:04:00.109> fit<00:04:01.109> ready<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.739> go

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
well here it is complete fit ready to go

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:03.440 
well here it is complete fit ready to go
everything<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.549> tapered<00:04:02.969> I'm<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.269> going<00:04:03.420> to

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
everything is tapered I'm just going to

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.059 
everything is tapered I'm just going to
take<00:04:03.629> a<00:04:03.659> little<00:04:03.870> bit<00:04:03.989> of<00:04:04.109> sandpaper<00:04:04.409> and<00:04:04.859> kind

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
take a little bit of sandpaper and kind

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.699 
take a little bit of sandpaper and kind
of<00:04:05.299> soften<00:04:06.299> the<00:04:06.599> edges<00:04:06.749> just<00:04:07.170> a<00:04:07.319> little<00:04:07.560> bit

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
of soften the edges just a little bit

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.080 
of soften the edges just a little bit
it's<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.859> little<00:04:07.889> bit<00:04:08.159> sharp<00:04:08.459> on<00:04:08.639> the<00:04:08.760> edges<00:04:09.060> but

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
it's a little bit sharp on the edges but

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.530 
it's a little bit sharp on the edges but
oh<00:04:09.569> no<00:04:10.530> that's<00:04:11.099> pretty<00:04:11.489> pretty<00:04:12.120> good<00:04:12.299> piece

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
oh no that's pretty pretty good piece

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.800 
oh no that's pretty pretty good piece
let<00:04:12.959> me<00:04:13.049> show<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.290> where<00:04:13.530> this<00:04:13.680> is<00:04:13.859> gonna<00:04:13.980> fit

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.790 

alright<00:04:19.400> gonna<00:04:20.400> go<00:04:20.669> right<00:04:20.940> in<00:04:21.150> here<00:04:22.190> a<00:04:24.800> little

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
alright gonna go right in here a little

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.860 
alright gonna go right in here a little
bit<00:04:25.949> of<00:04:26.070> brazing<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.789> we'll<00:04:27.509> be<00:04:27.630> back<00:04:27.810> in

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
bit of brazing and we'll be back in

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.060 
bit of brazing and we'll be back in
business<00:04:30.229> if<00:04:31.229> you<00:04:31.410> recall<00:04:31.710> from<00:04:31.919> earlier

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070

videos<00:04:32.759> cement<00:04:33.419> in<00:04:33.599> this<00:04:33.810> water<00:04:34.110> bypass<00:04:34.830> area

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
videos cement in this water bypass area

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.219 
videos cement in this water bypass area
so<00:04:35.940> water<00:04:36.360> enters<00:04:36.960> from<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:39.050> whether<00:04:40.050> you're

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
so water enters from the whether you're

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.480 
so water enters from the whether you're
in<00:04:40.289> the<00:04:40.410> ocean<00:04:40.680> or<00:04:40.800> the<00:04:40.830> light<00:04:41.039> comes<00:04:41.310> in

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
in the ocean or the light comes in

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.129 
in the ocean or the light comes in
through<00:04:41.520> here<00:04:42.000> filters<00:04:42.539> through<00:04:42.750> a<00:04:42.810> screen

through here filters through a screen
comes<00:04:43.440> up<00:04:43.650> through<00:04:44.009> through<00:04:44.849> what<00:04:45.060> we<00:04:45.150> call

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
comes up through through what we call

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.629 
comes up through through what we call
the<00:04:45.419> water<00:04:45.630> bypass<00:04:46.199> when<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.919> got<00:04:47.099> this<00:04:47.220> engine

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
the water bypass when I got this engine

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.490 
the water bypass when I got this engine
it<00:04:47.759> did<00:04:47.940> not<00:04:48.060> have<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.389> cover<00:04:48.690> plate<00:04:49.050> for<00:04:49.320> this

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it did not have the cover plate for this

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.120 
it did not have the cover plate for this
it<00:04:49.710> had<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> mangled<00:04:50.520> screen<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.120> here<00:04:51.479> and

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
it had a mangled screen in here and

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.219 
it had a mangled screen in here and
these<00:04:53.130> holes<00:04:53.520> here<00:04:53.699> have<00:04:54.389> been<00:04:54.599> tapped<00:04:54.990> out<00:04:55.199> a

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
these holes here have been tapped out a

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:57.620 
these holes here have been tapped out a
few<00:04:55.560> times<00:04:55.740> so<00:04:56.430> I'm<00:04:56.520> gonna<00:04:56.669> fill<00:04:57.120> these<00:04:57.389> holes

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
few times so I'm gonna fill these holes

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.770 
few times so I'm gonna fill these holes
with<00:04:57.960> aluminum<00:04:58.590> brazing<00:04:59.430> rod<00:04:59.460> and<00:05:00.000> then<00:05:00.599> I'll

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
with aluminum brazing rod and then I'll

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.040 
with aluminum brazing rod and then I'll
recap<00:05:01.259> we<00:05:01.830> drill<00:05:02.070> and<00:05:02.250> tap<00:05:02.280> those<00:05:02.900> because<00:05:03.900> I

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
recap we drill and tap those because I

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.100 
recap we drill and tap those because I
did<00:05:04.620> get<00:05:04.770> a<00:05:04.830> new<00:05:05.099> water<00:05:05.370> bypass<00:05:05.970> plate<00:05:06.389> and<00:05:06.659> it

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
did get a new water bypass plate and it

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.320 
did get a new water bypass plate and it
came<00:05:07.259> with<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.620> stainless<00:05:08.070> steel<00:05:08.430> screws<00:05:08.909> for

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
came with the stainless steel screws for

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.790 
came with the stainless steel screws for
that<00:05:09.599> so<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.870> want<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.139> make<00:05:10.259> sure<00:05:10.440> everything

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
that so I want to make sure everything

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.460 
that so I want to make sure everything
goes<00:05:10.949> in<00:05:11.130> correctly<00:05:11.550> so<00:05:11.789> my<00:05:12.479> next<00:05:12.659> job<00:05:13.020> is<00:05:13.259> to

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
goes in correctly so my next job is to

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.409 
goes in correctly so my next job is to
actually<00:05:13.650> go<00:05:14.310> ahead<00:05:14.400> and<00:05:14.520> brace<00:05:14.820> these<00:05:15.090> holes

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
actually go ahead and brace these holes

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.339 
actually go ahead and brace these holes
shut<00:05:15.830> before<00:05:16.830> and<00:05:17.250> then<00:05:17.840> then<00:05:18.840> I'll<00:05:19.020> go<00:05:19.289> to

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
shut before and then then I'll go to

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:21.469 
shut before and then then I'll go to
work<00:05:19.560> on<00:05:19.770> putting<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.280> cavitation<00:05:21.000> plate<00:05:21.030> on

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
work on putting the cavitation plate on

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.600 
work on putting the cavitation plate on
figured<00:05:22.349> I<00:05:22.440> might<00:05:22.590> as<00:05:22.650> well<00:05:22.710> do<00:05:22.919> this<00:05:23.070> now<00:05:23.280> well

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
figured I might as well do this now well

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.159 
figured I might as well do this now well
I<00:05:23.909> get<00:05:24.120> a<00:05:24.150> little<00:05:24.300> bit<00:05:24.479> more<00:05:24.630> room<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:24.930> maneuver

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
I get a little bit more room to maneuver

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.460 
I get a little bit more room to maneuver
and<00:05:25.710> then<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.880> last<00:05:27.060> thing<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.539> braze<00:05:27.990> on<00:05:28.259> will

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
and then the last thing to braze on will

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.310 
and then the last thing to braze on will
be<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.680> cavitation<00:05:29.099> plate
