00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
we are here installing a Zenon kit on

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.550 
we are here installing a Zenon kit on
the<00:00:07.650> 2006<00:00:08.650> CBR<00:00:09.190> 600<00:00:09.670> hablar<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:11.139> will<00:00:11.260> take<00:00:11.440> you

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:11.560

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.280 
the 2006 CBR 600 hablar we will take you
step-by-step<00:00:11.800> on<00:00:12.250> installation<00:00:12.790> of<00:00:12.880> this<00:00:12.970> kit

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
step-by-step on installation of this kit

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.179 
step-by-step on installation of this kit
first<00:00:14.290> step<00:00:14.530> is<00:00:14.800> to<00:00:15.100> remove<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.570> clip<00:00:16.570> from

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
first step is to remove the clip from

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.310 
first step is to remove the clip from
the<00:00:18.189> h7<00:00:18.730> bulb<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.689> clip<00:00:19.900> comes<00:00:20.109> right<00:00:20.289> off

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
the h7 bulb and the clip comes right off

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.120 
the h7 bulb and the clip comes right off
by<00:00:20.650> basically<00:00:20.949> removing<00:00:21.400> the<00:00:21.689> side<00:00:22.689> tab

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
by basically removing the side tab

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.019 
by basically removing the side tab
secondly<00:00:24.130> we<00:00:24.189> will<00:00:24.279> remove<00:00:24.489> the<00:00:24.669> rubber

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
secondly we will remove the rubber

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.280 
secondly we will remove the rubber
garment<00:00:30.359> once<00:00:31.359> the<00:00:31.599> rubber<00:00:31.779> garment<00:00:32.230> is

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
garment once the rubber garment is

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.200 
garment once the rubber garment is
removed<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:32.770> actually<00:00:33.160> expose<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.670> h7<00:00:34.090> bulb

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
removed you actually expose the h7 bulb

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.060 
removed you actually expose the h7 bulb
itself<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.910> remove<00:00:37.180> the<00:00:37.329> h7<00:00:37.750> bulb<00:00:37.899> you<00:00:38.829> have<00:00:38.949> to

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
itself to remove the h7 bulb you have to

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.680 
itself to remove the h7 bulb you have to
press<00:00:39.309> on<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.730> clip<00:00:40.180> that's<00:00:40.359> actually

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
press on the clip that's actually

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.560 
press on the clip that's actually
holding<00:00:40.960> it<00:00:41.140> into<00:00:41.289> place<00:00:42.000> you<00:00:43.000> press<00:00:43.269> on<00:00:43.420> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
fairly simple removal as you can see

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.069 
fairly simple removal as you can see
this<00:00:57.039> is<00:00:57.219> a<00:00:57.249> bulb<00:00:57.550> and<00:00:57.760> also<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.690> space<00:00:58.929> that

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
this is a bulb and also the space that

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.829 
this is a bulb and also the space that
is<00:00:59.199> connected<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.710> bulb<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.480> next<00:01:01.690> step

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
is connected to the bulb the next step

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:02.729 
is connected to the bulb the next step
we're<00:01:01.960> going<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> take<00:01:02.289> you<00:01:02.379> through<00:01:02.589> is

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
we're going to take you through is

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.149 
we're going to take you through is
actually<00:01:03.659> modifying<00:01:04.659> this<00:01:04.839> spacer<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.890> allow

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
actually modifying this spacer to allow

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.820 
actually modifying this spacer to allow
you<00:01:06.220> to<00:01:06.340> use<00:01:06.640> it<00:01:06.850> for<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.120> xenon<00:01:07.450> bulb<00:01:07.800> you<00:01:08.800> can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
you to use it for the xenon bulb you can

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.470 
you to use it for the xenon bulb you can
either<00:01:09.160> modify<00:01:09.400> the<00:01:09.640> spacer<00:01:10.090> or<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.360> can

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
either modify the spacer or you can

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.530 
either modify the spacer or you can
purchase<00:01:10.690> online<00:01:12.090> modification<00:01:13.090> usually

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
purchase online modification usually

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.870 
purchase online modification usually
takes<00:01:13.690> about<00:01:13.810> three<00:01:14.290> to<00:01:14.380> five<00:01:14.530> minutes<00:01:14.880> so

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
takes about three to five minutes so

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.900 
takes about three to five minutes so
here<00:01:16.480> we<00:01:16.570> go<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:18.040> you<00:01:18.160> have<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.490> bulb<00:01:18.700> in<00:01:18.820> a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
here we go once you have the bulb in a

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.660 
here we go once you have the bulb in a
spacer<00:01:19.530> basically<00:01:20.530> removed<00:01:21.190> from<00:01:21.310> each<00:01:21.490> other

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
spacer basically removed from each other

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.670 
spacer basically removed from each other
they<00:01:21.880> actually<00:01:22.150> just<00:01:22.300> snap<00:01:22.510> right<00:01:22.540> out<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
they actually just snap right out the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440 
they actually just snap right out the
bulb<00:01:23.860> itself<00:01:24.010> just<00:01:24.460> plugs<00:01:24.700> right<00:01:24.850> on<00:01:25.270> the

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
bulb itself just plugs right on the

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.020 
bulb itself just plugs right on the
inside<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.780> this<00:01:25.960> spacer<00:01:26.260> right<00:01:26.470> here<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
inside of this spacer right here what

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.360 
inside of this spacer right here what
you're<00:01:28.150> gonna<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.480> do<00:01:28.600> is<00:01:28.780> actually

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
you're gonna have to do is actually

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.520 
you're gonna have to do is actually
remove<00:01:30.370> this<00:01:31.210> top<00:01:31.510> piece<00:01:32.790> right<00:01:33.790> here<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
remove this top piece right here of the

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.350 
remove this top piece right here of the
spacer<00:01:35.950> you<00:01:36.190> can<00:01:36.340> actually<00:01:36.610> take<00:01:36.760> a<00:01:36.790> saw<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> it

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
spacer you can actually take a saw to it

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.850 
spacer you can actually take a saw to it
and<00:01:37.510> just<00:01:37.540> saw<00:01:37.900> right<00:01:38.110> along<00:01:38.350> the<00:01:38.500> edges<00:01:38.620> right

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
and just saw right along the edges right

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.860 
and just saw right along the edges right
here<00:01:38.920> and<00:01:39.250> a<00:01:39.730> spacer<00:01:40.090> itself<00:01:40.420> will<00:01:40.540> come<00:01:40.690> off

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
here and a spacer itself will come off

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.870 
here and a spacer itself will come off
the<00:01:41.170> end<00:01:41.710> result<00:01:42.070> will<00:01:42.190> actually<00:01:42.490> look<00:01:42.610> fairly

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
the end result will actually look fairly

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.370 
the end result will actually look fairly
simple<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:46.240> is<00:01:46.300> basically<00:01:46.720> the<00:01:46.870> end<00:01:47.020> result

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
simple this is basically the end result

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.750 
simple this is basically the end result
is<00:01:47.620> the<00:01:48.460> spacer<00:01:48.850> itself<00:01:49.240> separate<00:01:50.670> from<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
is the spacer itself separate from the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.090 
is the spacer itself separate from the
actual<00:01:52.030> plug<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:53.230> actually<00:01:53.560> will<00:01:53.710> not<00:01:53.890> need

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
actual plug you actually will not need

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.440 
actual plug you actually will not need
this<00:01:54.220> plug-in<00:01:54.490> anymore<00:01:54.850> so<00:01:55.000> you<00:01:55.060> can<00:01:55.180> just<00:01:55.330> put

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
this plug-in anymore so you can just put

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.750 
this plug-in anymore so you can just put
it<00:01:55.540> aside<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:56.920> you<00:01:56.980> can<00:01:57.220> actually<00:01:57.370> use<00:01:57.730> a

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
it aside and now you can actually use a

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.190 
it aside and now you can actually use a
spacer<00:01:58.440> with<00:01:59.440> your<00:01:59.710> new<00:02:00.400> xenon<00:02:00.760> bulb<00:02:01.200> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
spacer with your new xenon bulb to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.350 
spacer with your new xenon bulb to
complete<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.650> installation<00:02:03.120> now<00:02:04.120> that<00:02:04.270> we

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
complete the installation now that we

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.870 
complete the installation now that we
have<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.720> spacer<00:02:05.200> made<00:02:05.380> we'll<00:02:06.340> teach<00:02:06.730> you<00:02:06.760> how

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
have the spacer made we'll teach you how

now<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:27.010> we<00:02:27.100> have<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.250> spacer<00:02:27.670> made<00:02:27.850> we're

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
now that we have a spacer made we're

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.970 
now that we have a spacer made we're
going<00:02:28.780> to<00:02:28.840> go<00:02:28.930> ahead<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.350> continue<00:02:29.860> the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
going to go ahead and continue the

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.880 
going to go ahead and continue the
installation<00:02:30.100> on<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.150> CV<00:02:31.450> our<00:02:31.750> first<00:02:32.680> thing<00:02:32.800> we

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
installation on a CV our first thing we

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.320 
installation on a CV our first thing we
have<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.040> do<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.340> actually<00:02:33.520> remove<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:34.030> input

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
have to do is actually remove the input

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.680 
have to do is actually remove the input
wire<00:02:35.220> from<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:36.280> rubber<00:02:36.550> garment<00:02:36.970> by<00:02:37.360> pulling

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
wire from the rubber garment by pulling

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:44.430 
wire from the rubber garment by pulling
the<00:02:37.780> input<00:02:38.020> wire<00:02:38.170> right<00:02:38.410> through<00:02:38.560> there<00:02:43.440> next

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
the input wire right through there next

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.090 
the input wire right through there next
we'll<00:02:44.590> actually<00:02:44.760> run<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.720> ball<00:02:47.410> plugs<00:02:47.800> right

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
we'll actually run the ball plugs right

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.640 
we'll actually run the ball plugs right
through<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> actual<00:02:48.730> spacer<00:02:49.720> now<00:02:50.260> remember

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
through the actual spacer now remember

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.520 
through the actual spacer now remember
you<00:02:51.010> do<00:02:51.190> want<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.640> spacer<00:02:52.000> facing<00:02:52.450> this<00:02:53.290> way

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
you do want the spacer facing this way

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.760 
you do want the spacer facing this way
so<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.340> way<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:55.120> clip<00:02:55.959> will<00:02:56.320> actually<00:02:56.620> have

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
so that way the clip will actually have

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
so that way the clip will actually have
somewhere<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.360> to<00:02:58.360> hold<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.690> bulb

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.509 

once<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.870> do<00:03:15.989> that<00:03:16.019> you<00:03:16.349> can<00:03:16.500> run<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:17.310> rubber

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
once you do that you can run the rubber

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:28.910 
once you do that you can run the rubber
garment<00:03:17.939> through<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.330> hole<00:03:18.780> itself<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.920> now

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
garment through the hole itself and now

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.550 
garment through the hole itself and now
you<00:03:28.980> have<00:03:29.370> your<00:03:29.400> own<00:03:29.730> homemade<00:03:30.120> spacer<00:03:30.569> this

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you have your own homemade spacer this

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.300 
you have your own homemade spacer this
will<00:03:31.769> keep<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.970> bulb<00:03:33.530> snug<00:03:34.530> in<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.920> housing

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
will keep the bulb snug in the housing

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.030 
will keep the bulb snug in the housing
itself<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:36.510> basically<00:03:36.930> mimics<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.680> OEM

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
itself it basically mimics the OEM

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.789 
itself it basically mimics the OEM
spaces<00:03:38.489> that<00:03:38.549> you<00:03:38.610> had<00:03:38.819> in<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:40.620> what

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
spaces that you had in there now what

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.490 
spaces that you had in there now what
we'll<00:03:40.950> do<00:03:41.099> is<00:03:41.129> actually<00:03:41.549> install<00:03:41.849> the<00:03:41.940> ball

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
we'll do is actually install the ball

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.250 
we'll do is actually install the ball
inside<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.560> housing<00:03:44.900> now<00:03:45.900> we'll<00:03:46.109> go<00:03:46.230> ahead

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
inside the housing now we'll go ahead

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.740 
inside the housing now we'll go ahead
and<00:03:46.590> install<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:47.670> xenon<00:03:48.030> bulb<00:03:48.299> and<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
and install the xenon bulb and the

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.270 
and install the xenon bulb and the
spacer<00:03:49.170> right<00:03:49.379> in<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.650> housing<00:03:49.980> itself

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
spacer right in the housing itself

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.940 
spacer right in the housing itself
remember<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.359> actually<00:03:51.480> align<00:03:51.900> both<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.590> clip

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
remember to actually align both the clip

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.879 
remember to actually align both the clip
both<00:03:53.250> tabs<00:03:53.609> on<00:03:53.879> the<00:03:54.120> bulb<00:03:54.329> and<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.569> spacer<00:03:54.989> so

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
both tabs on the bulb and a spacer so

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.800 
both tabs on the bulb and a spacer so
that<00:03:56.040> way<00:03:56.190> they<00:03:56.340> slide<00:03:56.519> right<00:03:56.849> into<00:03:56.970> the

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
that way they slide right into the

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.009 
that way they slide right into the
housing<00:03:58.519> once<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.639> do<00:03:59.760> that<00:03:59.790> go<00:04:00.180> ahead<00:04:00.720> and

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
housing once you do that go ahead and

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.449 
housing once you do that go ahead and
put<00:04:01.349> the<00:04:01.440> clip<00:04:01.680> on<00:04:01.799> there<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.819> into<00:04:03.180> place

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
put the clip on there just into place

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.580 
put the clip on there just into place
and<00:04:05.459> that<00:04:06.209> holds<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.569> in<00:04:06.840> there<00:04:07.200> fairly

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
and that holds it in there fairly

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.009 
and that holds it in there fairly
friendly<00:04:09.620> next<00:04:10.620> step<00:04:10.799> is<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.599> go<00:04:12.599> ahead<00:04:12.629> and

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
friendly next step is to go ahead and

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.370 
friendly next step is to go ahead and
connect<00:04:13.379> to<00:04:14.250> your<00:04:14.370> original<00:04:14.519> plug<00:04:15.229> where<00:04:16.229> the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
connect to your original plug where the

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.689 
connect to your original plug where the
original<00:04:16.739> bulb<00:04:16.949> actually<00:04:17.130> plugged<00:04:17.549> into

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
original bulb actually plugged into

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.789 
original bulb actually plugged into
you'll<00:04:18.329> go<00:04:18.510> ahead<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.900> plug<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.260> input<00:04:19.620> wire

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
you'll go ahead and plug the input wire

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.150 
you'll go ahead and plug the input wire
that<00:04:20.729> came<00:04:20.940> with<00:04:21.060> the<00:04:21.150> ballast<00:04:21.889> you'll<00:04:22.889> have<00:04:23.130> a

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
that came with the ballast you'll have a

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.860 
that came with the ballast you'll have a
positive<00:04:23.699> and<00:04:23.789> negative<00:04:24.680> you<00:04:25.680> line<00:04:25.889> them<00:04:26.010> up

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
positive and negative you line them up

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:35.330 
positive and negative you line them up
positive<00:04:27.870> negative<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:34.349> next<00:04:34.650> step<00:04:34.860> now<00:04:35.070> is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
positive negative the next step now is

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.600 
positive negative the next step now is
actually<00:04:35.580> plug<00:04:36.000> in<00:04:36.139> the<00:04:37.139> ball<00:04:37.919> plugs<00:04:38.250> directly

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
actually plug in the ball plugs directly

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.629 
actually plug in the ball plugs directly
into<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.120> ballast<00:04:39.830> what<00:04:40.830> we<00:04:40.979> have<00:04:41.130> here<00:04:41.460> is

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
into the ballast what we have here is

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:45.980 
into the ballast what we have here is
the<00:04:41.970> slim<00:04:42.840> design<00:04:43.020> ballast<00:04:44.630> this<00:04:45.630> is<00:04:45.810> digital

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
ballast just about anywhere the ballast

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.240 
ballast just about anywhere the ballast
itself<00:04:54.000> will<00:04:54.479> come<00:04:54.720> with<00:04:55.169> two<00:04:55.380> plugs<00:04:55.680> mashing

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
itself will come with two plugs mashing

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.690 
itself will come with two plugs mashing
to<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.490> bulb<00:04:56.669> plugs<00:04:56.910> it's<00:04:57.599> a<00:04:57.750> female<00:04:58.050> Emile

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.610 

once<00:05:05.700> those<00:05:05.940> are<00:05:06.000> installed<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:07.530> will

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
once those are installed it will

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.070 
once those are installed it will
actually<00:05:07.830> take<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:09.139> male<00:05:10.139> plug<00:05:10.380> end<00:05:10.850> of<00:05:12.080> the

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
actually take the male plug end of the

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.510 
actually take the male plug end of the
Spade<00:05:13.380> plugs<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.740> went<00:05:14.010> in<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.220> original

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
Spade plugs that went in the original

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.310 
Spade plugs that went in the original
harness<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.450> they<00:05:15.660> will<00:05:15.810> go<00:05:15.960> right<00:05:16.169> directly

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
harness and they will go right directly

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:24.050 
harness and they will go right directly
into<00:05:16.710> the<00:05:16.800> ballast<00:05:17.130> itself<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.400> plug<00:05:23.669> will

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
into the ballast itself the plug will

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.420 
into the ballast itself the plug will
have<00:05:24.240> a<00:05:24.270> positive<00:05:24.690> and<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.350> negative<00:05:25.380> on<00:05:26.010> the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
have a positive and a negative on the

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.640 
have a positive and a negative on the
ballast<00:05:26.730> side<00:05:27.020> you'll<00:05:28.020> want<00:05:28.350> to<00:05:28.470> match<00:05:28.620> that

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
ballast side you'll want to match that

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.700 
ballast side you'll want to match that
directly<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.910> red<00:05:30.540> and<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.780> black<00:05:30.990> wire<00:05:31.200> red

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
directly to the red and a black wire red

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.810 
directly to the red and a black wire red
obviously<00:05:32.220> is<00:05:32.280> positive<00:05:32.730> black<00:05:33.419> is<00:05:33.660> negative

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
obviously is positive black is negative

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.330 
obviously is positive black is negative
and<00:05:35.820> now<00:05:36.090> we'll<00:05:36.300> go<00:05:36.540> ahead<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:37.070> light<00:05:38.070> up<00:05:38.190> the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
and now we'll go ahead and light up the

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.440 
and now we'll go ahead and light up the
is<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.820> xenon<00:05:39.450> kit<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.810> see<00:05:40.580> our<00:05:41.580> final<00:05:42.000> result

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:47.810 

now<00:05:45.450> that<00:05:45.750> we<00:05:45.870> have<00:05:46.050> the<00:05:46.260> xenon<00:05:47.250> kit<00:05:47.460> installed

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
now that we have the xenon kit installed

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.820 
now that we have the xenon kit installed
on<00:05:48.000> the<00:05:48.180> CBR<00:05:48.540> 600<00:05:49.020> we<00:05:49.139> will<00:05:49.229> go<00:05:49.380> ahead<00:05:49.500> and<00:05:49.680> see

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
on the CBR 600 we will go ahead and see

00:05:49.830 --> 00:06:06.390 
on the CBR 600 we will go ahead and see
the<00:05:49.919> final<00:05:50.220> result

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.450 

and<00:06:06.910> as<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.240> have<00:06:07.419> it<00:06:07.600> there<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.080> go<00:06:08.500> this<00:06:09.310> is
