turned out really really nice and I'm
shooting<00:01:20.759> this<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.150> old<00:01:21.360> camera<00:01:21.950> for<00:01:22.950> two

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
shooting this with my old camera for two

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.920 
shooting this with my old camera for two
reasons<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.090> seems<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.509> handle<00:01:24.840> the

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
reasons one that it seems to handle the

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
reasons one that it seems to handle the
light<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:26.130> better<00:01:26.430> than<00:01:26.729> my<00:01:26.850> other<00:01:26.880> camera

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
light a lot better than my other camera

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.319 
light a lot better than my other camera
does<00:01:27.509> when<00:01:27.750> I<00:01:27.780> change<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.650> lighting<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.329> also

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
does when I change the lighting and also

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.990 
does when I change the lighting and also
it<00:01:30.420> won't<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.780> four<00:01:31.020> hours<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.350> upload<00:01:31.590> it

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
it won't take four hours to upload it

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.219 
it won't take four hours to upload it
I'll<00:01:33.000> go<00:01:33.240> back<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> other<00:01:33.689> camera<00:01:34.079> when<00:01:34.200> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
I'll go back to the other camera when I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
I'll go back to the other camera when I
get<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> final<00:01:34.710> work<00:01:34.950> done<00:01:35.159> on<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.700> I'm

let's push a button you'll see the

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.430 
let's push a button you'll see the
deflector<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.450> crystal<00:02:16.840> bowl<00:02:16.989> turn<00:02:17.260> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
deflector and the crystal bowl turn to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.370 
deflector and the crystal bowl turn to
blue<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:19.440> that<00:02:21.270> came<00:02:22.270> out<00:02:22.420> really<00:02:22.690> nice<00:02:22.959> and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
then of course our when we do that our

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.570 
then of course our when we do that our
impulse<00:02:26.440> engines<00:02:26.770> here<00:02:26.920> fade<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.310> at<00:02:27.459> the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
impulse engines here fade out at the

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.160 
impulse engines here fade out at the
back<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.790> really<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.660> happy<00:02:31.930> with

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
back and just really really happy with

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.070 
back and just really really happy with
it<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.680> see<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:33.690> raytheon<00:02:34.690> effect

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
it here you can see the raytheon effect

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.380 
it here you can see the raytheon effect
if<00:02:35.560> you<00:02:35.680> look<00:02:35.830> really<00:02:36.010> closely<00:02:36.310> at<00:02:36.550> that<00:02:36.670> it

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
if you look really closely at that it

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.090 
if you look really closely at that it
turned<00:02:37.750> out<00:02:37.840> really<00:02:37.900> nice<00:02:38.230> i'm<00:02:38.560> happy<00:02:38.830> with<00:02:38.950> it

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
turned out really nice i'm happy with it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.410 
turned out really nice i'm happy with it
because<00:02:39.220> I<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.550> kind<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.790> worried<00:02:40.120> that<00:02:40.269> with

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
because I was kind of worried that with

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.400 
because I was kind of worried that with
all<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.600> paint<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.170> I'm<00:02:41.260> projecting

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
all the paint you know I'm projecting

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.589 
all the paint you know I'm projecting
that<00:02:41.769> from<00:02:41.950> behind<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.730> if<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.209> look<00:02:43.360> closely

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
that from behind and if you look closely

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.390 
that from behind and if you look closely
at<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.870> you<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.140> still<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.650> Aztecs<00:02:45.250> and

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
at it you can still see the Aztecs and

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.680 
at it you can still see the Aztecs and
everything<00:02:45.670> on<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:45.910> surface<00:02:46.269> there<00:02:46.390> so<00:02:46.600> it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
everything on the surface there so it

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.229 
everything on the surface there so it
really<00:02:46.840> gives<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.140> illusion<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:49.030> light

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
really gives the illusion of the light

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.390 
really gives the illusion of the light
being<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.810> know<00:02:49.900> Shinedown<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.830> outside

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
being you know Shinedown to the outside

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.470 
being you know Shinedown to the outside
of<00:02:51.549> this<00:02:51.610> thing<00:02:51.819> instead<00:02:52.060> of<00:02:52.120> coming<00:02:52.390> through

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of this thing instead of coming through

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.530 
of this thing instead of coming through
the<00:02:52.630> inside<00:02:53.019> and<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:54.430> just<00:02:54.970> had<00:02:55.269> to<00:02:55.390> do<00:02:55.510> that

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the inside and I just had to do that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.720 
the inside and I just had to do that
it's<00:02:55.959> just<00:02:56.140> part<00:02:56.560> of<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.709> way<00:02:56.830> that

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
it's just part of the way that

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.479 
it's just part of the way that
looked<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:58.890> wanted<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.010> try<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.220> capture

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
looked and I wanted to try to capture

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.000 
looked and I wanted to try to capture
that<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.060> you<00:03:01.420> can<00:03:01.540> see<00:03:01.830> everything's<00:03:02.830> just

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
that but you can see everything's just

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.620 
that but you can see everything's just
looking<00:03:03.280> really<00:03:03.610> cool<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:04.060> this<00:03:04.209> thing<00:03:04.420> now

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
looking really cool on this thing now

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.280 
looking really cool on this thing now
and<00:03:06.030> here's<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.120> shot<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.690> shuttlebay<00:03:07.989> the

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
and here's a shot of the shuttlebay the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.080 
and here's a shot of the shuttlebay the
obligatory<00:03:08.530> shot<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.220> guys<00:03:09.400> always<00:03:09.670> seem<00:03:09.940> to

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
obligatory shot you guys always seem to

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.690 
obligatory shot you guys always seem to
ask<00:03:10.209> for<00:03:10.480> this<00:03:10.600> so<00:03:11.190> there's<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.400> shuttlebay

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
ask for this so there's the shuttlebay

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.110 
ask for this so there's the shuttlebay
again<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:14.670> everything's<00:03:15.670> working<00:03:16.000> really

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
again and everything's working really

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.599 
again and everything's working really
good<00:03:16.239> on<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:16.720> you<00:03:17.079> can<00:03:17.230> see<00:03:17.380> our<00:03:17.410> grills<00:03:18.400> are

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
good on that you can see our grills are

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.640 
good on that you can see our grills are
looking<00:03:18.850> nice<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.030> sharp<00:03:19.450> they<00:03:19.660> liked<00:03:19.840> what<00:03:20.620> I

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
looking nice and sharp they liked what I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.530 
looking nice and sharp they liked what I
did<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.040> that<00:03:21.160> too<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.579> I<00:03:21.700> put<00:03:21.880> some<00:03:22.060> resistors

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
did to that too is I put some resistors

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.930 
did to that too is I put some resistors
in<00:03:22.720> there<00:03:22.900> I'm<00:03:23.739> running<00:03:23.980> this<00:03:24.250> at<00:03:24.430> nine<00:03:24.609> volts

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
in there I'm running this at nine volts

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.890 
in there I'm running this at nine volts
and<00:03:25.000> they<00:03:25.090> were<00:03:25.150> just<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.540> bit<00:03:25.750> too

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
and they were just a little bit too

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.430 
and they were just a little bit too
bright<00:03:27.209> the<00:03:28.209> strip<00:03:28.450> lighting<00:03:28.660> in<00:03:28.840> there<00:03:28.959> so<00:03:29.230> I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
bright the strip lighting in there so I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.870 
bright the strip lighting in there so I
put<00:03:29.709> some<00:03:29.829> resistors<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.459> that<00:03:30.640> and<00:03:30.790> that

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
put some resistors in that and that

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.170 
put some resistors in that and that
brought<00:03:31.090> those<00:03:31.239> right<00:03:31.510> down<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:33.060> so<00:03:34.060> they

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
brought those right down and so they

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.520 
brought those right down and so they
weren't<00:03:34.329> glaring<00:03:34.750> too<00:03:34.900> much<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.230> they<00:03:35.290> blend

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
weren't glaring too much and they blend

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:36.690 
weren't glaring too much and they blend
in<00:03:35.650> really<00:03:35.829> nicely<00:03:36.100> with<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.370> rest<00:03:36.549> of<00:03:36.609> the

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
in really nicely with the rest of the
