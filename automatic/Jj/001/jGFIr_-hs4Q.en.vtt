metal it's pretty it's like it's pretty
um<00:01:15.929> instructions<00:01:20.039> power<00:01:21.039> locks<00:01:21.399> itself<00:01:23.520> and

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
um instructions power locks itself and

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.899 
um instructions power locks itself and
here<00:01:24.789> is<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.299> bad<00:01:25.479> boy<00:01:25.509> oh<00:01:26.579> my<00:01:27.579> god<00:01:27.700> it's

here is the bad boy oh my god it's
actually<00:01:28.149> pretty<00:01:28.270> light<00:01:28.479> so<00:01:28.889> a<00:01:29.889> little<00:01:30.729> bit

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
actually pretty light so a little bit

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:41.699 
actually pretty light so a little bit
slide<00:01:35.670> yeah<00:01:38.579> it's<00:01:39.579> nice<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:40.060> guys<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.749> feel

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
slide yeah it's nice you guys I feel

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.300 
slide yeah it's nice you guys I feel
static<00:01:42.130> everywhere<00:01:42.520> but<00:01:42.789> um<00:01:43.479> it's<00:01:44.170> pretty

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
static everywhere but um it's pretty

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.999 
static everywhere but um it's pretty
anyway<00:01:45.310> that's<00:01:45.459> unboxing<00:01:46.060> and<00:01:46.770> that's<00:01:47.770> that<00:01:47.979> I

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
anyway that's unboxing and that's that I

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.519 
anyway that's unboxing and that's that I
guess<00:01:48.130> this<00:01:48.520> goes<00:01:48.670> into<00:01:48.850> here<00:01:49.029> somehow<00:01:49.529> figure

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:50.529 
guess this goes into here somehow figure

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.889 
guess this goes into here somehow figure
this<00:01:50.649> out<00:01:50.819> so<00:01:51.819> this<00:01:51.969> just<00:01:52.119> flops<00:01:52.479> into<00:01:52.719> here<00:01:52.869> I

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
this out so this just flops into here I

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.830 
this out so this just flops into here I
guess<00:01:53.139> and<00:01:56.249> yeah<00:01:57.249> then<00:01:57.939> you<00:01:58.149> twist<00:01:58.389> this<00:01:58.599> thing

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
guess and yeah then you twist this thing

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.370 
guess and yeah then you twist this thing
in<00:01:58.959> with<00:01:59.889> the<00:02:00.249> little<00:02:00.490> hook<00:02:01.020> once<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.109> get<00:02:02.259> it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
in with the little hook once you get it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.410 
in with the little hook once you get it
you<00:02:02.529> get<00:02:02.799> it<00:02:02.859> you'll<00:02:03.069> see<00:02:03.219> it<00:02:03.399> where<00:02:04.889> ya<00:02:06.420> don't

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
you get it you'll see it where ya don't

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.000 
you get it you'll see it where ya don't
mind<00:02:07.479> Harry<00:02:07.869> are<00:02:08.050> good<00:02:08.289> but<00:02:08.649> whatever
