00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.480
 man- eaters followed by water 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.360
 were 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.739
 when the island arrived in the middle 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 a huge volcano 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.270
 I had to follow him on the mountain around 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.270
 Find out if there are our ships 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.800

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.830
 the 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.549

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.500

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.550
 works that died in humans, however 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.580

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.890
 ship's crew is not me anyway 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.330
 all still look the same thought 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.320
 Me too, but I have noticed 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:56.120
 that you are pretty much without people 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:58.760

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.210

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.260
 we have to help them 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.650
 what can not we humans do there 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.110
 above 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 you do not know how to do it and 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.250
 besides, what you stopped earlier 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.590
 to have 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.500
 How do you want to know how I used to be? 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.660
 was yes you believe so I know nothing 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:23.260
 noticed about you before 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:26.270
 i am a ghost yes but how 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.580
 yes there is something extraordinary about it 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.740
 I can only show myself to people 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:35.000
 their souls are destroyed and bad 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.640
 I do not know why you are like this but that 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.630
 I'm not really interested either 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.740
 besides i come in has a head 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.740

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.730
 james 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:58.410
 haha you never get me 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:05.029
 on 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.350
 more present than scarce ok grammel we 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.240
 have to do something 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.550
 I want to know exactly what you know 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.750
 and how do you know it c'mon I 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.220
 hate this moment 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.820
 For that we give the whole joy 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:57.440
 your fear is not it will be you 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.440
 People are the same every time 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.020
 Hardly they say you are angry already 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:05.390
 do you want to change what should that be 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.490
 should that mean now yes I have to too 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.590
 somehow killing my time and 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:15.950
 That's why I'm lost 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:18.410
 Nice model for being around now 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.930
 So that's to blame for the whole thing 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:26.350
 until I'm stranded here too 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:30.080
 just a little I changed in the weather 

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:33.070
 But if you have so many people only 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.070
 to torture me 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:41.659
 why not okay okay 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.389
 no matter how cruel I am you are around 

00:06:41.659 --> 00:06:45.520
 no better better kill innocent 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:49.310
 People 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.860
 Well, strictly speaking, I take care of it 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:52.849
 food on this island 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.310
 what should the man-eaters because 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.259
 Otherwise, shut up you shut up 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.069
 know exactly what I mean with lust 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.930
 discuss me 

00:06:58.069 --> 00:07:01.780
 or do you finally want the gray there 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:07.250
 put an end to the top 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:09.229
 ok i'll give you a little tip here 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.050
 on the island there is the so-called 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:15.379
 at least the black hole call that 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.849
 resident so I think they are there 

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:22.099
 keep your crew trapped 

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:24.500
 and you know where it is very slow 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:26.449
 I 'm only out here by his crew 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.569
 and then you can leave again 

00:07:26.449 --> 00:07:31.630
 or to do business 

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:36.100
 okay let's go 

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:37.930
 so that was now underwood numero two and one 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.420
 Next week we go a black 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.670
 hole and find out there in there 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.620
 the roof of our ship that would be you 

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:47.620
 all love driving around Friday 19:00 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:48.820
 But now I 'm on 1 of the years this 

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.590
 video year has fallen or 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:51.220
 not down to the top you have to 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.260
 decide you 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:55.030
 and something else will be rejecting this video 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:56.230

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:59.460
