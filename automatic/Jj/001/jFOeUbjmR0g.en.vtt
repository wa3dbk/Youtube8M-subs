00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.330
 hi my name is Vladimir stir and you 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.699
 see the practice video tutorial 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.529
 electrician 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.470
 today we will talk with you about kline 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.169
 I will tell and explain how environmentalists do 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.760
 how to do them correctly so that 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:36.190
 the movement turned out beautiful illusory 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:40.720
 generally glide themselves consist of 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:43.090
 two main such components 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.080
 that is, there are imaginations that you 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.300
 can learn to do and connecting them from 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.270
 you will get beautiful dresses 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.670
 first movement is walking heel sock 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 though rich sock looks like this 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.490
 as performed by the sock memo and 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.400
 heel of us that means you move in 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.460
 the side 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.060
 at this time you say you are right 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.950
 you have the right leg 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.590
 almost either you change your right leg 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.470
 marigolds left foot then on the wall too 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.939
 the other way 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.539
 the next important movement is walking on 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:41.280
 the place she takes Vata 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:45.600
 walking on the spot is done like this 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:54.530
 here's the way we put high on the nose or 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.530
 will i made 2 at last casino for 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:04.080
 above the ground pull the sock itself 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.679
 then we put this leg like a brute 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.679
 for another 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.700
 note that when doing 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.019
 walk on the spot your pack is high 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.740
 lift leg 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.820
 Agatha 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.900
 stand on the nose that is, I stand on the nose 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.110
 I move if 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.200
 and the second leg parallel to the floor is 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.350
 important parallel to the floor is worth the noise back 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.040
 but my leg is about 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.829
 and then does not stop 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.590
 I move the sock back into place 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.650
 I made food back by the second leg 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.200
 parallel to the floor 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.290
 connecting these two movements we get 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:04.299
 With you, the glide is actually made from 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.390
 4 main parts the first part is 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.750
 spread but one heel reward another 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.379
 point so as we did in fasten to 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.930
 high the second part is directly 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:21.730
 gliding soon 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.720
 the third part is when and deploy them 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.139
 heels sochi 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.000
 and the fourth part is again gliding in 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:33.689
 I have a side to do this 4 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.239
 parts you will receive styling 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:39.629
 does it look here are four basic 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.669
 movements first movement 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.060
 we put the leg high carry weight 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.580
 body on it and slide like a cauldron 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.130
 us 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.710
 let's say pop when we slide the fight 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.520
 we transfer body weight here we get up here 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:01.520
 high-to-toe and on the heel here staom 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:24.130
 ie see the leg standing on the toe is 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:24.130
 probably 5 second movement at the same time 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.230
 string 2 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.230
 grieve 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:01.569
 at least these corners and finally the third 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.110
 motion 

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:06.149
 or the fourth is a reversal as though 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.499
 heel sock 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:14.139
 we spread our front foot on our toes 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:17.580
 back cockpit and once again the first movement 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:21.279
 step from socks to heel from heel to toe 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:27.300
 second movement turn heel us very 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:27.300
 third movement step 4 motion reversal 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.159
 the main thing it looks like 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.300
 and a similar other side in general I would 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:44.199
 recommended immediately learning to do 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:46.240
 slides and right and left and based on these 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:48.759
 movement already worked out you can 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.490
 create different variations move 

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:56.680
 as it is there and then try 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:59.259
 the excitement that is everything is built on it 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.869
 small such small chips that 

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:04.680
 let you make elite more some 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:07.520
 nuances to make it beautiful 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:13.819
 they are oils rated 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:16.840
 you should always understand 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.840
 like this 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.570
 further grade 2 to raise 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.839
 twist the heels like that 

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:33.360
 like this way that way 

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:36.360
 so we had this and 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.360
 respectively 

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:43.960
 and the third leg leg must go over 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.180
 floor that is, no need to transfer before 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.480
 time body weight on that leg which 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.570
 pushes the foot must these slightly over 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.990
 see how I look at the surface 

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.990
 doing 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.860
 that is, once again 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:16.840
 summarize 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:19.509
 first glide row consists of 4 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:22.539
 basic steps and a combination of both would 

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:24.599
 heel noses in place to 

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:27.460
 beautiful fruit to do at the same time 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:31.590
 turn the legs high set foot 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:33.939
 do not move a little above the floor 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:35.919
 Well , perhaps all that is to learn 

00:07:33.939 --> 00:07:38.680
 you can already make base glides 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:42.060
 develop it add all sorts 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:45.060
 moving different directions to 

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.060
 dance
