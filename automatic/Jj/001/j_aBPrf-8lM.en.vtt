scorpion evo submachine gun we do have

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.020 
scorpion evo submachine gun we do have
the<00:01:04.830> ChiCom<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.339> well<00:01:05.519> which<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.000> a

the ChiCom as well which does have a
fast<00:01:06.360> fire<00:01:06.689> rate<00:01:06.720> but<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.619> scorpion<00:01:08.010> evo

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
fast fire rate but the scorpion evo

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
fast fire rate but the scorpion evo
being<00:01:08.520> followed<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> take<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.479> opposed<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
being followed to my take as opposed to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
being followed to my take as opposed to
that<00:01:09.990> she<00:01:10.229> comes<00:01:10.500> three<00:01:10.770> round<00:01:10.979> burst<00:01:11.280> is<00:01:11.850> this

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that she comes three round burst is this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
that she comes three round burst is this
gonna<00:01:12.180> live<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.510> spray<00:01:12.840> out<00:01:12.990> more<00:01:13.229> bullets

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
gonna live to spray out more bullets

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.890 
gonna live to spray out more bullets
because<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.790> loadout<00:01:15.119> is<00:01:15.180> all<00:01:15.330> about<00:01:15.540> weapon

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
because this loadout is all about weapon

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.060 
because this loadout is all about weapon
performance<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.590> put<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.920> many

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
performance we're gonna put as many

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.190 
performance we're gonna put as many
fights<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:17.640> possible<00:01:18.150> into<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> weapons

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
fights as possible into the weapons

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.109 
fights as possible into the weapons
section<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.369> gonna<00:01:20.460> use<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.850> primary

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
section so we're gonna use the primary

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.300 
section so we're gonna use the primary
gunfighter<00:01:21.509> wildcard<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.830> enable<00:01:23.159> us<00:01:23.250> to

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
gunfighter wildcard to enable us to

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.880 
gunfighter wildcard to enable us to
equip<00:01:23.759> three<00:01:23.970> different<00:01:24.509> attachments<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
equip three different attachments the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.499 
equip three different attachments the
obvious<00:01:26.189> attachment<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:26.759> up<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.180> rapid

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
obvious attachment first up is rapid

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.539 
obvious attachment first up is rapid
fire<00:01:27.720> which<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.439> crucial<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.979> increase<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
fire which is crucial to increase the

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.819 
fire which is crucial to increase the
fire<00:01:29.820> rate<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.270> Scorpion<00:01:30.750> Evo<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.530> turn<00:01:31.710> it

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
fire rate of the Scorpion Evo to turn it

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
fire rate of the Scorpion Evo to turn it

because<00:03:51.100> we're<00:03:51.220> using<00:03:51.340> rapid<00:03:51.790> fire<00:03:52.000> it's

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
because we're using rapid fire it's

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.760 
because we're using rapid fire it's
insanely<00:03:52.630> easy<00:03:52.870> to<00:03:53.110> run<00:03:53.230> our<00:03:53.380> scorpion

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
insanely easy to run our scorpion

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.860 
insanely easy to run our scorpion
completely<00:03:54.430> Drive<00:03:54.640> ammunition<00:03:55.240> so<00:03:55.720> we'll

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
completely Drive ammunition so we'll

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.450 
completely Drive ammunition so we'll
need<00:03:56.050> the<00:03:56.230> scavenger<00:03:56.680> perks<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.310> help

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
need the scavenger perks to help

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.820 
need the scavenger perks to help
resupply<00:03:58.000> from<00:03:58.600> those<00:03:58.750> little<00:03:59.020> blue<00:03:59.200> satchels

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.260 
resupply from those little blue satchels
this<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.460> also<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.000> give<00:04:01.150> us

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
this is also going to give us

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.090 
this is also going to give us
never-ending<00:04:01.780> firepower<00:04:02.350> from<00:04:02.590> our<00:04:02.800> bullet

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
never-ending firepower from our bullet

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.070 
never-ending firepower from our bullet
holes<00:04:03.340> so<00:04:03.970> we<00:04:04.000> don't<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.390> swap<00:04:04.630> out<00:04:04.840> for<00:04:05.050> a

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
holes so we don't have to swap out for a

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.230 
holes so we don't have to swap out for a
slower<00:04:05.350> fire<00:04:05.650> rate<00:04:05.680> weapon<00:04:06.280> also<00:04:06.790> completely

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
slower fire rate weapon also completely

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.660

exhausted<00:04:07.870> all<00:04:07.990> on<00:04:08.140> legs<00:04:08.400> even<00:04:09.400> with<00:04:09.520> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
extended clip that firepower from the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.780 
extended clip that firepower from the
Scorpion<00:04:11.980> is<00:04:12.070> going<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> be<00:04:12.400> gone<00:04:12.580> within

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
Scorpion is going to be gone within

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.460 
Scorpion is going to be gone within
seconds<00:04:13.360> with<00:04:13.510> that<00:04:13.540> rapid<00:04:13.959> fire<00:04:14.170> attachment

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
seconds with that rapid fire attachment

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.830 
seconds with that rapid fire attachment
so<00:04:15.459> we'll<00:04:15.610> need<00:04:15.730> fast<00:04:16.060> hands<00:04:16.359> in<00:04:16.570> order<00:04:16.750> to

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
so we'll need fast hands in order to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.570 
so we'll need fast hands in order to
switch<00:04:17.049> out<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.440> those<00:04:17.560> kap-40<00:04:18.160> machine

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:18.580 
switch out to those kap-40 machine

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:20.880 
switch out to those kap-40 machine
pistols<00:04:19.030> as<00:04:19.150> fast<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.570> possible<00:04:20.020> and<00:04:20.260> continue

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
pistols as fast as possible and continue

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.500 
pistols as fast as possible and continue
the<00:04:21.040> offensive<00:04:21.310> winning<00:04:21.790> those<00:04:21.940> close-range

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510

so<00:04:24.430> that's<00:04:24.759> it<00:04:24.939> for<00:04:25.060> the<00:04:25.150> main<00:04:25.330> class<00:04:25.629> setup

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
so that's it for the main class setup

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.409 
so that's it for the main class setup
but<00:04:26.199> we<00:04:26.289> can<00:04:26.500> continue<00:04:27.219> this<00:04:27.580> eat<00:04:27.849> led<00:04:28.120> theme
