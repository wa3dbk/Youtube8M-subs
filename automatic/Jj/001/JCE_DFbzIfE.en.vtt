 the mind thank you so much later 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.309
 until after 11 and 24 came Dr. 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.309
 claudio santamarÃ­a we present ourselves 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.579
 sponsors the Higher Institute of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.790
 health sciences the best 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:38.120

 11 4 6 3 3 7 5 6 4 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.710
 It is clear that it is going very good day 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.810
 really last week a 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.370
 article in a morning newspaper that revolutionized 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.090
 a little the Argentine science that there 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.710
 people that do not match at all I 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.000
 I study retweets today because that 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.370
 controversial language what we did 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.940
 us from the eduardo institute 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.610
 We write whatever the doctor who made 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.920
 the investigation and he sent us the 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.380
 article from france the original yes 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.170
 because we did that because as we had 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.119
 seen only a summary he told us and we 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.950
 answered the department of 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.690
 research that Fernando conducts annually 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.729
 doctor noel de bazÃ¡n communicated 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.550
 and he told us that this study that lasted 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:24.250
 14 years was done in 100 thousand teachers to 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.740
 see if they want to see they wanted to see cancer 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.990
 and nutrition this was a finding of 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.940
 it's because it's more females because they had 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.130
 to answer a questionnaire and what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.250
 they wanted was that the injury in fact of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.710
 one hundred thousand teachers were only 66 thousand 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.090
 because 24,000 was answered by some 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.330
 there were the rules and they wanted to see during 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.860
 14 years is a very important study of 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.780
 a very important amount 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.180
 and what is striking is important 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.420
 on sodas and drinks 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.970
 in general sweetened if one takes a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.520
 drink with sugar soda sign but 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.710
 it can be artificial juices you have to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.950
 keep in mind that they have more or less 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.680
 between 20 and 22 grams of sugar every 200 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.690
 milliliters have almost 4 sachets of 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.450
 sugar male then we know that the 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.270
 drinks with sugar fatten produces the 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.580
 obesity and diabetes produce the finding 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.130
 of this study eduardo is that the 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:21.190
 drinks that have sweetener 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.410
 Sweeteners produce them 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.050
 found in this teacher that with little 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.340
 amount of sweetener do not taste good 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.770
 why are there two theories that now you 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.930
 tale they produce in the long term also 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.209
 type 2 diabetes that is not the drink 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.730
 but the sweetener is the subject 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.489
 sweetener in one case is the sugar and 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.410
 another because it would seem that a 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.750
 second the sweetener placed in the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.480
 good coffee a tecito if the same as in 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.550
 this drink with the same obligation 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.620
 leave as is, that's why they talk about 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.230
 other than other drinks that serve 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.510
 sweeteners whatever things in the 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.129
 mate in the coffee train because 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.110
 it would seem this mechanism although it is 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.709
 controversial and that is what is the hypothesis 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.069
 of how the body does not receive sugar if 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.349
 then what does the body says segregate 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.360
 amounts of hormones so that the 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:13.629
 body then consume what is not 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:16.690
 consume with drinks is stimulated that 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.120
 have a desire to eat something sweet and that 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.310
 sweet food bounce what produces you 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.620
 finally the diaries and I advise anal 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.840
 water directly good I transport not 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.180
 I've seen some fruit very well he's going to 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.540
 tell that we take what is best for 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.359
 the bad this study of soft drinks with 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.150
 Soda sugar with sweeteners is 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.670
 He compared with natural juices juice 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.750
 natural in no case produced diabetes 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.310
 in is there sweet naturally sweet natural 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.140
 it's also important you can not take 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.879
 neither two or three liters of juice because 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.980
 I would also have a lot of sugar is fine 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.120
 the idea is to take one or two measures of 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.739
 juice per day 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.540
 which is the liquid that best makes the 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.510
 body 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.040
 certainly the water we need to take there 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.040
 people who get intoxicated with water 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.140
 there is a custom water poisoning but 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.260
 that's when the person takes 5 to 10 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.299
 liters of water does not consume anything and as the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.000
 water is eliminated by the kidney the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.979
 you come out and that's the problem but it's like 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.169
 crazy is like this woman who took 7 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.750
 liters of coca cola for several years 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.789
 and died and took by day 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.669
 and he died of a cardiac arrhythmia from the 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:29.910
 caffeine and then what is the best 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.639
 drink grau water second drink more 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.440
 important the letter milk all 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.690
 we should drink milk the boys milk 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 whole adults from 1 to 2 glasses of 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.449
 skim milk sugar or with 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:44.729
 sweeteners or the waves are rich with a 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:47.430
 little bit of coffee with a little tea what 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.440
 they can also make sugar and salt 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.720
 it's valve issues to get used to 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.070
 palate if I was not used 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.620
 in the camps at least it's going to 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.900
 take bitter mate and it's important because 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.529
 if you add a teaspoon to the 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.229
 quantity 1 should consume for example 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:05.779
 6 teaspoons of tea per day of sugar and 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.579
 nothing else the food has the 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:09.319
 preservatives has and one ends 

00:05:07.579 --> 00:05:11.959
 fattening due to lack of activity 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:13.819
 physical and by excess sugar and 

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:16.249
 sweetener in drinks that's why 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.319
 We recommend water milk and juices 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:22.959
 natural fruits one or two servings per 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:25.249
 day thanks professional claudio 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.549
 the issue is that you will have to 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:30.169
 news has been in the USA if I have the 

00:05:28.549 --> 00:05:33.460
 Beach hair person takes a 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:37.449
 medicine and her breasts grew 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:40.500
 hip and his shoulders fell and 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.500
 went to the other side 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.509
 same as I take 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.520
 the pill is the same in it 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.680
 a single case that unless we know 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.590
 so far if there is a trial 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.940
 this gentleman is claiming the company 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.740
 what produces it 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:02.050
 for these changes that you have had because 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.759
 he said that before he was a normal person and 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.849
 for taking this medicine, you will have to 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.370
 corroborate whether it was the person 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:12.070
 it is but it grew now it changed 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.120
 totally changed everything is why it's just 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.860
 because 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.419
 I should see it fat I can 80 the 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.729
 data and on Wednesday I can tell you by 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.949
 what do I say this for 

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.589
 trust even more in those that we 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.589
 we did the surgical intervention and that 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.629
 we are taking that medication beyond 

00:06:27.589 --> 00:06:32.210
 of every joke because I say look what 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:34.909
 was and in that he was transformed he grew up the 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:37.159
 hair undoubtedly being but you saw 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:40.009
 Also hip moms to talk 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.689
 granted I'll look for the training I'll 

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:43.759
 to see the contraindications and the 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:45.229
 interaction if it was a specific case not 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.939
 it could be that it was one more thing 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.229
 widespread on Wednesday if you want to 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:51.559
 all tastes fight the perfect good 

00:06:48.229 --> 00:06:54.309
 thank you claudio many thanks thousand 631 

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:54.309
