back and or the front or whatever ones

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.910 
back and or the front or whatever ones
easiest<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:42.479> just<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:43.380> know<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.710> do

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
easiest for you it's just you know I do

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.999 
easiest for you it's just you know I do
a<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.070> time<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.799> edit<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
a different time so and then edit and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:47.870 
a different time so and then edit and
you're<00:01:47.130> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.310> duplicate<00:01:47.549> this<00:01:47.640> one<00:01:47.790> as

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
you're going to duplicate this one as

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.469 
you're going to duplicate this one as
well<00:01:48.890> now<00:01:49.890> there's<00:01:50.820> many<00:01:50.970> ways<00:01:51.090> of<00:01:51.270> doing<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
well now there's many ways of doing this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.910 
well now there's many ways of doing this
but<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.290> has<00:01:52.380> been<00:01:52.590> most

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
but I think this one has been most

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.760 
but I think this one has been most
successful<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:53.460> far<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:54.500> instead<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.560> doing

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
successful so far so instead of doing

successful so far so instead of doing

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
14 let's say 14 so we're going to click

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.729 
14 let's say 14 so we're going to click
on<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.239> one<00:03:09.389> where<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.599> say<00:03:09.750> good<00:03:10.019> 14<00:03:10.410> for<00:03:10.620> that

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
on that one where I say good 14 for that

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.390 
on that one where I say good 14 for that
bottom<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:12.420> for<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.230> top<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:14.040> never<00:03:14.280> do

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
bottom and for the top you never do

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.080 
bottom and for the top you never do
anything

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
anything

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.210 
anything
I<00:03:15.120> learned<00:03:16.079> how<00:03:16.170> that's<00:03:16.470> actually<00:03:16.829> kind<00:03:17.160> of

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
I learned how that's actually kind of

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.740 
I learned how that's actually kind of
the<00:03:17.280> best<00:03:17.489> way<00:03:17.639> is<00:03:17.880> to<00:03:17.940> leave<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.329> middle<00:03:18.599> is

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
the best way is to leave the middle is

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.599 
the best way is to leave the middle is
your<00:03:18.780> normal<00:03:19.019> voice<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:22.160> that's<00:03:23.160> it<00:03:23.519> you're

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
your normal voice so that's it you're

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.159 
your normal voice so that's it you're
going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.819> take<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> top<00:03:24.299> one<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:24.870> you're

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
going to take the top one and you're

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:31.720 
going to take the top one and you're
going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.349> change<00:03:25.680> this<00:03:26.010> one<00:03:26.310> anywhere<00:03:28.760> to<00:03:30.470> 12

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
going to change this one anywhere to 12

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.409 
going to change this one anywhere to 12
20<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> once<00:03:34.739> again<00:03:34.889> positive<00:03:35.459> 14<00:03:35.760> positive<00:03:36.120> 15

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
20 so once again positive 14 positive 15

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:41.479 
20 so once again positive 14 positive 15
positive<00:03:37.220> 16<00:03:38.220> 20<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.799> you<00:03:40.799> really<00:03:41.040> shouldn't

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
positive 16 20 and you really shouldn't

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.759 
positive 16 20 and you really shouldn't
go<00:03:41.609> over<00:03:41.639> 23<00:03:42.419> for<00:03:43.109> your<00:03:43.200> voice<00:03:43.319> because

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
go over 23 for your voice because

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.370 
go over 23 for your voice because
everybody's<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.130> voice<00:03:44.430> once<00:03:44.639> again<00:03:44.849> so<00:03:45.380> mine

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
everybody's in voice once again so mine

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.759 
everybody's in voice once again so mine
is<00:03:46.410> usually<00:03:47.040> round<00:03:47.299> 16<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.419> 20<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.230> I'm<00:03:49.500> going

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
is usually round 16 to 20 so I'm going

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.339 
is usually round 16 to 20 so I'm going
to<00:03:49.859> put<00:03:50.010> mine<00:03:50.190> up<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> twenty<00:03:50.849> point<00:03:51.030> one<00:03:51.349> but

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
to put mine up as a twenty point one but

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.349 
to put mine up as a twenty point one but
usually<00:03:53.190> point<00:03:53.400> ones<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:53.819> when<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.030> use<00:03:54.150> that

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
usually point ones but when you use that

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.879 
usually point ones but when you use that
you<00:03:54.419> always<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.109> point<00:03:55.349> most<00:03:55.530> of<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.709> time

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
you always get a point most of the time

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.250 
you always get a point most of the time
but<00:03:56.280> you<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.489> always<00:03:56.609> just<00:03:57.019> actually<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.109> it's

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
but you can always just actually if it's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.629 
but you can always just actually if it's
easier<00:03:58.590> for<00:03:58.650> you<00:03:58.799> can<00:03:58.980> always<00:03:59.220> just<00:03:59.519> like

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
easier for you can always just like

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.150 
easier for you can always just like
highlight<00:04:00.299> it<00:04:00.450> and<00:04:00.599> literally<00:04:01.319> just<00:04:01.739> type<00:04:01.919> in

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
highlight it and literally just type in

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.110 
highlight it and literally just type in
20<00:04:02.669> and<00:04:02.940> it<00:04:03.690> will<00:04:03.810> take<00:04:03.989> it<00:04:04.139> as<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.260> positive<00:04:04.440> 20

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
20 and it will take it as a positive 20

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.960 
20 and it will take it as a positive 20
so<00:04:06.120> alright<00:04:06.690> now<00:04:07.200> let's<00:04:07.379> see<00:04:07.620> how<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:07.799> sounds
