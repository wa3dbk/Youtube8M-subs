00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.460
 if hendrik richter is in such a hurry around the 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.250
 corner shot comes he is on the way 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.010
 to his next customer because he belongs 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.620
 to the pony riders for a year 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.619
 he and his four colleagues bring letters 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 and packages from a to b schmidt 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.080
 personally and above all environmentally conscious 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.480
 Their offer is well received by the customers 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.970
 the reason for the establishment of her 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.099
 Drahtesel's pride is a whole 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.140
 Practical me yes we are all 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 bicycle couriers for years in the 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.190
 partly in other cities partly 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.559
 also in duisburg and have considered us 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.770
 that is nonsense when we are in another 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.660
 Cities and driving around our our job 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.000
 and we actually have more 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.340
 or less determined to do so 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 struggled through which the driverless 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.020
 to open courier services in Duisburg 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.570
 colleague michael merz is also working 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
 ready for his next drive yet 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.360
 quickly strapped the helmet and go 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.360
 it's 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.710
 muscle strength instead of fuel consumption that is 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.500
 by the way, the motto letters are not 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.760
 everything the duisburg street cowboys 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.210
 transport 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.950
 the idea arose from the 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.570
 cooperation with a biosupermarket 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.040
 down near the inner harbor as we 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.980
 We are thinking about a great one 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.730
 Supplementary thing would be if we were the 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.800
 purchases of those people at home 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.600
 they just can not do that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.600
 are or do not feel like it 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.670
 or not having time and over 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 in addition, the idea arose 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.170
 maybe a shopping service 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.110
 offer 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.370
 no matter if food service or even 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.490
 Relocation helper with the special 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.410
 This bike is not a problem and 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.380
 also from further stretch can be 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.850
 Do not stop the couriers 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.760
 cooperations with other services 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.290
 thanks to almost every wish the boys can 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.050
 meet your customers 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.989
 call is sufficient in winter as well as in 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:11.270
 summer temperatures also make us 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.700
 Clearly, there are nicer, more beautiful days 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.950
 as a cold wet day but are basically 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.560
 have prepared for every weather 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.060
 the right clothes and yes and 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.920
 actually not so much I 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.580
 personally likes hot temperatures 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.230
 less like because I'm just there 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.989
 my limits come as if it were cold 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.540
 is and that and so they keep rolling 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.390
 through duisburgs streets from parcel to 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.390
 Package from one order to the next
