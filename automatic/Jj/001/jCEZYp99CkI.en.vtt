with<00:04:34.190> destiny<00:04:34.669> in<00:04:34.729> the<00:04:34.820> upcoming<00:04:35.060> beta<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.570> see

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
with destiny in the upcoming beta to see

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.940 
with destiny in the upcoming beta to see
how<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.810> larger<00:04:36.200> player<00:04:36.410> base<00:04:36.620> and<00:04:36.860> more

how a larger player base and more

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.440 
how a larger player base and more
content<00:04:37.310> will<00:04:37.460> lend<00:04:37.580> itself<00:04:37.669> to<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.030> game<00:04:38.210> but

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
content will lend itself to the game but

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.969 
content will lend itself to the game but
so<00:04:38.600> far<00:04:38.780> things<00:04:38.990> are<00:04:39.169> looking<00:04:39.380> really<00:04:39.590> good<00:04:39.770> I

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979
