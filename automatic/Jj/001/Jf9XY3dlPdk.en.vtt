00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.020 
doesn't really matter you have to get
invited<00:01:16.950> but<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.670> they<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:17.939> an

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
invited but this time they did an

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.490 
invited but this time they did an
invitation<00:01:18.509> only<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:18.869> believe<00:01:19.020> there's<00:01:19.409> only

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
invitation only I believe there's only

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
invitation only I believe there's only
18s<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> could<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.729> wrong<00:01:20.939> there<00:01:21.330> may<00:01:21.420> be

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
18s there I could be wrong there may be

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.510 
18s there I could be wrong there may be
more<00:01:21.750> but<00:01:21.930> basically<00:01:22.170> most<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.159> big<00:01:23.340> teams

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
more but basically most of the big teams

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.740 
more but basically most of the big teams
are<00:01:23.670> there<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:23.909> everyone<00:01:24.299> has<00:01:24.420> their<00:01:24.570> full

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
are there not everyone has their full

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.120 
are there not everyone has their full
roster<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.680> teams<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> are

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
roster I think the only teams that are

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.219 
roster I think the only teams that are
not<00:01:26.250> there<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.790> are<00:01:27.330> like<00:01:27.450> top<00:01:27.689> teams<00:01:27.990> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
not there that are like top teams is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
not there that are like top teams is
optic<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.860> curse<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.880> everyone<00:01:30.240> else<00:01:30.390> is

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
optic and curse so everyone else is

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
optic and curse so everyone else is
there<00:01:30.810> although<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.229> few<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.040> rosters

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
there although a few of the rosters

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.679 
there although a few of the rosters
aren't<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> hundred<00:01:33.210> percent<00:01:33.299> but

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
aren't like a hundred percent but

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.940 
aren't like a hundred percent but
anyways<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.170> still<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.560> was<00:01:34.650> still<00:01:34.829> pretty

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
anyways it's still it was still pretty

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.560 
anyways it's still it was still pretty

the finals are gonna be on Monday and
what<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.740> means<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.130> basically<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.090> it's

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
what that means is basically it's a it's

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.630 
what that means is basically it's a it's
a<00:01:42.689> pool<00:01:42.930> play<00:01:43.229> tournament<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.100> everybody

plays everybody so for Friday Saturday
and<00:01:47.100> Sunday<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:47.909> everyone's<00:01:48.329> gonna<00:01:48.450> be

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
and Sunday I think everyone's gonna be

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.090 
and Sunday I think everyone's gonna be
playing<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.530> guess<00:01:49.920> like<00:01:50.070> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
playing like the I guess like the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.770 
playing like the I guess like the
seeding<00:01:50.549> games<00:01:50.759> almost<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.509> they're<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
seeding games almost or they're just

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.819 
seeding games almost or they're just
playing<00:01:51.960> each<00:01:52.079> other<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> doesn't<00:01:52.409> matter<00:01:52.710> if

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
playing each other it doesn't matter if

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.990 
playing each other it doesn't matter if
you<00:01:52.920> win<00:01:53.100> or<00:01:53.130> lose<00:01:53.250> you're<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.790> trying<00:01:53.970> to

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
you win or lose you're just trying to

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.880 
you win or lose you're just trying to
get<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.329> win<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.200> win<00:01:55.380> equals<00:01:55.590> one<00:01:55.740> point

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
get a win like one win equals one point

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
get a win like one win equals one point
should<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.159> get<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> most<00:01:56.430> points<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> think

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
should I get the most points and I think

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.940 
should I get the most points and I think
top<00:01:57.479> four<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.780> gonna<00:01:57.960> play<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.350> Monday

beats<00:02:34.540> complexity<00:02:35.540> so<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:35.900> went<00:02:36.200> two<00:02:36.379> and

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409 
beats complexity so they went two and

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.780 
beats complexity so they went two and
one<00:02:36.680> against<00:02:36.890> complexity<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.459> then<00:02:37.549> I<00:02:37.609> don't

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
one against complexity and then I don't

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.440 
one against complexity and then I don't
know<00:02:37.849> what<00:02:37.939> they<00:02:38.060> did<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.269> their<00:02:38.359> other

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
know what they did in their other

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.789 
know what they did in their other
matchup<00:02:38.900> I'm<00:02:39.019> assuming<00:02:39.349> they<00:02:39.439> did<00:02:39.590> pretty

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
matchup I'm assuming they did pretty

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.619 
matchup I'm assuming they did pretty
well<00:02:39.889> but<00:02:40.549> anyways<00:02:40.879> that's<00:02:41.299> another<00:02:41.480> thing

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
well but anyways that's another thing

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.629 
well but anyways that's another thing
with<00:02:41.780> our<00:02:41.840> complexity<00:02:42.379> lost<00:02:42.709> now<00:02:43.340> it's

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:43.639 
with our complexity lost now it's

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.190 
with our complexity lost now it's
actually<00:02:43.849> it's<00:02:44.090> not<00:02:44.180> lost<00:02:44.510> as<00:02:44.870> in<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.139> know

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
actually it's not lost as in you know

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.690 
actually it's not lost as in you know
they<00:02:45.469> got<00:02:45.590> eliminated<00:02:45.829> because<00:02:46.310> it's<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.609> an

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
they got eliminated because it's not an

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.429 
they got eliminated because it's not an
elimination<00:02:46.909> right<00:02:47.420> now<00:02:47.480> but<00:02:47.900> technically

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
elimination right now but technically

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.470 
elimination right now but technically
they<00:02:48.709> did<00:02:48.889> lose<00:02:49.129> a<00:02:49.189> best-of-three<00:02:49.760> even

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
they did lose a best-of-three even

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.179 
they did lose a best-of-three even
though<00:02:50.569> it<00:02:50.689> wasn't<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.470> know<00:02:51.560> quote-unquote

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
though it wasn't you know quote-unquote

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:53.800 
though it wasn't you know quote-unquote
a<00:02:52.220> best<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.579> three<00:02:52.849> they<00:02:53.060> lost<00:02:53.239> 2-1<00:02:53.389> to<00:02:53.510> phase

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
a best of three they lost 2-1 to phase

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.449 
a best of three they lost 2-1 to phase
which<00:02:54.049> is<00:02:54.079> pretty<00:02:54.319> crazy<00:02:54.560> especially<00:02:55.280> since

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
which is pretty crazy especially since

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.670 
which is pretty crazy especially since
it's<00:02:55.609> phased<00:02:55.819> because<00:02:56.359> we<00:02:56.689> wouldn't<00:02:56.900> expect

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
it's phased because we wouldn't expect

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.490 
it's phased because we wouldn't expect
that<00:02:57.919> and<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.609> face<00:02:58.849> took<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.209> CTF<00:02:59.750> off<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.349> them

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
that and and face took a CTF off of them

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.960 
that and and face took a CTF off of them
which<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.950> their<00:03:01.220> best<00:03:01.430> game<00:03:01.609> that's<00:03:01.790> that's

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
which is their best game that's that's

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.729 
which is their best game that's that's
pretty<00:03:02.180> crazy<00:03:02.359> so<00:03:02.720> we<00:03:02.900> might<00:03:03.109> be<00:03:03.260> seeing<00:03:03.530> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
pretty crazy so we might be seeing the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.460 
pretty crazy so we might be seeing the
fall<00:03:04.010> of<00:03:04.040> complexity<00:03:04.939> and<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.540> rise<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:06.049> unite

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
fall of complexity and the rise of unite

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.080 
fall of complexity and the rise of unite
which<00:03:06.829> would<00:03:06.980> be<00:03:07.069> pretty<00:03:07.220> crazy

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
which would be pretty crazy

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.640 
which would be pretty crazy
and<00:03:08.269> if<00:03:08.510> unite<00:03:08.750> wins<00:03:09.019> since<00:03:09.349> now<00:03:09.500> they've

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
and if unite wins since now they've

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.050 
and if unite wins since now they've
picked<00:03:09.769> up<00:03:09.889> parasite<00:03:10.549> that<00:03:10.819> would<00:03:10.909> make

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
picked up parasite that would make

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.179 
picked up parasite that would make
parasite<00:03:11.540> like<00:03:11.689> the<00:03:11.840> most<00:03:12.049> winningest<00:03:12.620> black

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
parasite like the most winningest black

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.670 
parasite like the most winningest black
ops<00:03:13.370> 2<00:03:13.549> player<00:03:13.819> I'm<00:03:14.720> pretty<00:03:14.959> sure<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.470> could<00:03:15.590> be

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
ops 2 player I'm pretty sure it could be

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.140 
ops 2 player I'm pretty sure it could be
wrong<00:03:15.769> about<00:03:15.829> that<00:03:16.129> I'm<00:03:16.250> pretty<00:03:16.700> sure<00:03:16.879> black

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
wrong about that I'm pretty sure black

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.360 
wrong about that I'm pretty sure black
ops<00:03:17.299> 2<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.780> course<00:03:18.019> but<00:03:18.470> that's<00:03:18.949> pretty<00:03:19.069> crazy

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
ops 2 of course but that's pretty crazy

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.619 
ops 2 of course but that's pretty crazy
and<00:03:19.609> then<00:03:19.729> parasite<00:03:20.150> he's<00:03:20.239> actually<00:03:20.389> been

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
and then parasite he's actually been

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:22.479 
and then parasite he's actually been
doing<00:03:20.720> really<00:03:21.049> well<00:03:21.169> as<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> sub<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:22.400> know

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
doing really well as a sub you know

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:23.379 
doing really well as a sub you know
everything's<00:03:22.819> been<00:03:22.940> working<00:03:23.180> out<00:03:23.269> really

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
everything's been working out really

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.849 
everything's been working out really
well<00:03:23.599> for<00:03:23.629> them<00:03:23.930> you<00:03:24.290> know<00:03:24.379> they've<00:03:24.530> just<00:03:24.709> been

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
well for them you know they've just been

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.740 
well for them you know they've just been
destroying<00:03:25.310> everyone<00:03:25.760> and<00:03:26.000> you<00:03:26.540> know<00:03:26.629> they'd

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
destroying everyone and you know they'd

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.649 
destroying everyone and you know they'd
be<00:03:26.810> envy<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.560> they<00:03:27.859> beat<00:03:28.090> TK<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.449> don't<00:03:29.599> know

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
be envy and they beat TK I don't know

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.210 
be envy and they beat TK I don't know
who<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.870> other<00:03:29.989> team<00:03:30.199> maybe<00:03:30.319> was<00:03:30.650> but<00:03:31.010> so

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
who the other team maybe was but so

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.189 
who the other team maybe was but so
that's<00:03:31.310> pretty<00:03:31.519> cool<00:03:31.729> and<00:03:31.940> it's<00:03:32.870> been<00:03:33.019> a<00:03:33.049> good

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:33.199 
that's pretty cool and it's been a good

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:34.659 
that's pretty cool and it's been a good
first<00:03:33.409> day<00:03:33.620> so<00:03:33.769> if<00:03:34.040> you<00:03:34.069> guys<00:03:34.220> are<00:03:34.370> missing<00:03:34.459> out

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:34.669 
first day so if you guys are missing out

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:35.619 
first day so if you guys are missing out
on<00:03:34.729> that<00:03:34.940> I<00:03:34.970> just<00:03:35.060> wanted<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.329> let<00:03:35.449> you<00:03:35.599> know

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
on that I just wanted to let you know

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.210 
on that I just wanted to let you know
it's<00:03:36.019> kind<00:03:36.139> of<00:03:36.169> like<00:03:36.290> with<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.620> informational

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
it's kind of like with the informational

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.920 
it's kind of like with the informational
video<00:03:37.459> I<00:03:37.519> guess<00:03:37.669> though<00:03:38.120> twitch<00:03:38.599> link<00:03:38.810> is

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
video I guess though twitch link is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.199
