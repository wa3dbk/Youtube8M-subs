00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.580
 I'm using three flavors but 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.459
 you can use the flavors of 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.710
 your preference because to the box of three 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.140
 ounces of gelatin I'm going to boil a cup 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.119
 of water then here I have three cups 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.480
 because I'm only doing three 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.480
 flavors 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.600
 I'm going to dissolve very well each package of 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.230
 gelatin in a cup of water by 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.230
 separated 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.090
 in a previously greased mold I'm going to 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.430
 pour each package of gelatin in 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.920
 separate pans and I'll refrigerate 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.260
 well here I have a package of gelatin 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.860
 of vanilla to prepare with four 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860
 milk cups 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.210
 I'm going to heat the four cups of milk 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.210
 and it is not necessary to start boiling 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.340
 and do not stop moving so you do not 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.950
 go to paste now I'm going to dissolve the 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.670
 vanilla flavor gelatin and I'm going to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.670
 let cool 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.540
 since our with latinas two flavors 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.540
 they are firm I'm going to cut into squares 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.240
 and I'm going to take them off 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.210
 I'm going to put all the jellies together 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.210
 so that they remain of several flavors 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.570
 I'm using these glasses to make 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.580
 our gelatins if you can 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.140
 find transparent glasses because it's 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.260
 much better 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.890
 I'm going to place the cubes in each of 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.890
 the glasses 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.360
 now that our gelatin is cold I'm going 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.490
 to add a little extract of 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.130
 vanilla only to give it a flavor 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.550
 more intense this step is completely 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:31.160
 Optional finally I'll pour the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.260
 milk jelly in the cups and 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.260
 I'm going to refrigerate during the night 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 our gelatins are ready here 

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:47.950
 and that's how we stayed 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.220
 now here I have a sample of what 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.700
 is what happens if they add you have said 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.310
 when it is still very hot 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.239
 and then I hope nothing has pleased you and 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.239
 until next time
