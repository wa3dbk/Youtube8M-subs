00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
breach through into this secret room now

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.690 
breach through into this secret room now
if<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.170> crouch<00:00:43.410> you<00:00:43.680> can't<00:00:43.890> stand<00:00:44.250> back<00:00:44.370> up<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
if you crouch you can't stand back up so

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130 
if you crouch you can't stand back up so
I<00:00:44.730> don't<00:00:44.940> suggest<00:00:45.149> crouching<00:00:45.809> unless<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I don't suggest crouching unless you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.990

want<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> stay<00:00:46.500> crouched<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> can't<00:00:47.879> get

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
want to stay crouched but you can't get

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.490 
want to stay crouched but you can't get
lots<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.239> kills<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.840> guess<00:00:49.230> you<00:00:49.350> do

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
lots of kills in here I guess you do

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
lots of kills in here I guess you do
this<00:00:49.559> online<00:00:49.739> if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.640> get<00:00:50.879> lucky<00:00:51.059> mail<00:00:51.300> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this online if you get lucky mail for

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.080 
this online if you get lucky mail for
the<00:00:51.510> first<00:00:51.690> care<00:00:51.870> package<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:53.100> Arden<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.879> mean

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
the first care package but Arden I mean

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.060 
the first care package but Arden I mean
it's<00:00:54.239> not<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:54.809> useful<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.140> online<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.920> it's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
it's not very useful for online but it's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.790 
it's not very useful for online but it's
a<00:00:56.160> cool<00:00:56.340> spot<00:00:56.820> nonetheless<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.620> mean

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
a cool spot nonetheless and I mean

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.200 
a cool spot nonetheless and I mean
there's<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> multi-player<00:00:59.579> glitch<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.030> here's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
there's a multi-player glitch it here's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.569 
there's a multi-player glitch it here's
one<00:01:00.480> multiplayer<00:01:01.020> glitches<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.800> don't

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
one multiplayer glitches so I don't

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.090 
one multiplayer glitches so I don't
think<00:01:02.760> this<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:02.879> very<00:01:03.030> old<00:01:03.359> um<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> just

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
think this is very old um if it is just

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.230 
think this is very old um if it is just
let<00:01:05.220> me<00:01:05.309> comment<00:01:05.519> but<00:01:05.700> there's<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:05.939> no<00:01:06.090> need

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
let me comment but there's way no need

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.030 
let me comment but there's way no need
to<00:01:06.390> leave<00:01:06.510> stupid<00:01:06.930> hate<00:01:07.110> comments<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> read

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to leave stupid hate comments and I read

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.920 
to leave stupid hate comments and I read
those<00:01:08.189> enough<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:09.330> mean<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.659> just<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
those enough and I mean it's just the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.840 
those enough and I mean it's just the
internet<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.619> it's<00:01:10.740> old<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.189> say<00:01:11.369> old<00:01:11.549> I

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
internet so if it's old to say old I

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
internet so if it's old to say old I
would<00:01:12.780> really<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.170> see<00:01:13.439> this<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.700> video

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
would really like to see this the video

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.030 
would really like to see this the video
and<00:01:15.210> proved<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> me<00:01:15.720> how<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.080> old<00:01:16.290> because

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and proved to me how it is old because

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
and proved to me how it is old because
there's<00:01:17.520> really<00:01:17.640> no<00:01:17.820> proof<00:01:18.060> sometimes<00:01:18.509> when

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there's really no proof sometimes when

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.140 
there's really no proof sometimes when
you<00:01:18.780> guys<00:01:18.869> say<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.790> basically<00:01:20.790> that's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
you guys say that but basically that's

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.830 
you guys say that but basically that's
all<00:01:21.299> for<00:01:21.509> that

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
all for that

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.960 
all for that
glitch<00:01:22.259> now<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> second<00:01:23.369> glitch<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.759> on

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
glitch now the second glitch is on
