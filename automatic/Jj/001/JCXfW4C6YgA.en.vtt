 very good fifa 13 and you can play 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.640
 online assembling your team are seeing and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.280
 my team 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.950
 the last of them and had a right of 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.620
 premier league where very strong with 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.239
 78 classification of 100 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.090
 March 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.550
 only everyone doing it because I do not 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.820
 I liked it with this information I have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 another cast you can see there I go 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.250
 change soon for you to see that the bold 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.539
 that only with a team of Brazilians who 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 It's a team that I'm playing more 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.570
 despite being a little weaker than the 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.909
 other 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.310
 there's luís fabiano leandro damião 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.400
 victor réver is a team that I like 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.850
 A lot of play I got to ride and with 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.650
 little time of game I think in fifa 13 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.619
 with it easier for you to set up a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.530
 I'm going to give you tips. 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.810
 for you who are starting now that is 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.009
 your team so good of gold merely 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.090
 you have to play 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.119
 I think you have to have at least 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.000
 from 5 thousand to 10 billion for you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.960
 ends up riding a good gold team so 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.799
 good 11 players there and with 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.090
 some reservations have arisen is 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.060
 whenever you start with the team 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.040
 bronze is a weaker team and you 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 will get much stronger by riding a 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.659
 much stronger team just like I did 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 I had a weaker team and I came in 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.420
 a stronger team 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.689
 good for you to win these things for 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.850
 playing the individual tournaments is a 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.729
 motor or look that I spent 5 thousand dollars 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.009
 coins are imported offline 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 also give enough of the coins 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.700
 3,600 coins 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.069
 so the cool way you do not 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.439
 be very confident in playing online 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.420
 play the fla it for me the coins 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:25.030
 another option will also play against the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.340
 selection of the week and you will win 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.099
 also enough coins 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.889
 there is 1500 meters if you can 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.650
 win playing with and against the selection of 

00:02:32.889 --> 00:02:40.269
 week and also an easy way to guide 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:43.150
 coins in the game is there is the selection of the week 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.730
 who are then seeing accumulation of 5 thousand 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.609
 10,000 coins for you to say if 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.280
 You want to cast the cast, are you? 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:54.579
 create a new cast né for you mokaba 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.239
 riding a team that set up a good team 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.980
 You set up a new cast, you come. 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.780
 here on his return cast and 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.629
 select a new team I think by 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.730
 some people did not know it is so 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.799
 Seeing here another way to earn coins 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.139
 besides some players are being 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.489
 used to know that some players 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.669
 bronze that I still can not understand 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.489
 I'm selling here that they started 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.049
 along with me i 'm already undoing them 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.569
 so if you are using the player 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.620
 also some 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.139
 coins 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.239
 good for you want a cast of gold 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.040
 again creates a new civilian cast 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.569
 olive trees and places the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.720
 name any I put a name 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.419
 Anybody there I will not create it here. 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.599
 For you guys in this video a cast is just 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:43.479
 to show the cast myself I will 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.310
 create for you here and your tips 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.650
 there for someone starting out to 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.109
 who is even accustomed in the way that 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.669
 sometimes do not know so are basic tips 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:57.129
 but I think it helps the law create there the tfc 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:59.259
 put together your own good cast and 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.209
 important now is we leave 

00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.189
 hiring you have to define your 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.099
 training and this is very important 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.169
 because you will hire the players to 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.299
 from the training you choose to 

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:13.780
 help is to get a 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.180
 between the team then this spectrum that is 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.130
 very important you have to choose 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.199
 a training that suits you 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.950
 You know you play well do not end up doing 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.060
 bullshit and end up being disappointed 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.400
 caique 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.710
 is what the team premier league I 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.500
 was that you need the beginning of the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.139
 video not consuming me 433 I just 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.150
 disappointed had great stars there only 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.620
 that I do not know how to play in training 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.410
 So what are we doing with the team? 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.910
 I chose a training that you enjoy 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.919
 play even if you do not 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.080
 disappointing 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:49.139
 then I will see as going through several 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.050
 formations is to show you the 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:57.090
 so many options you have many many 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:05:01.080
 formations of 4 4 4 2 is more current 433 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.960
 most usual cases but there goes a lot of you 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.840
 training and if this aspect is very 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.660
 important for you to your team 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.030
 because you cast a cast from the 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.630
 training you are there, I chose the 3 4 3 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.900
 to show this team demonstration 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.100
 choose your training there in the us 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.220
 auctions 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.800
 first you have to focus your 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:28.620
 first contract the goalkeeper or one by one 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.970
 starts the goalkeeper preferred scheme 343 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.550
 that the training I'm riding my 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:35.490
 gold team several gold players not 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.410
 we need silver here 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.850
 here you have to choose or you go 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.910
 put the team with the same nationality 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.950
 the one that plays in the same league yet example 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.229
 I chose the French values 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.539
 these business nationality calls are 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.210
 very important if you 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.160
 To hire players from the same league is going 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.680
 have a legal relationship than if you 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.419
 playing on a team that does not 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.100
 had it not been on the same line 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.320
 were of the same nationality to fall 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.210
 very close relationship then my tip 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.130
 that I already leave other players in the 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.620
 same league or two months of the same 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.300
 nationality he could pass and 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.120
 I will not deal in the auction of goalkeepers 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.639
 You go one by one I put 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:18.360
 right but does not have in the formation 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.070
 343 still one by one prices so cheap 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.470
 of this French type is the max six 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.760
 Good players come out of 80 up with 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.190
 good prices 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.820
 so do not need france you choose 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.430
 Your league for your nationality and for 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.449
 assemble the team but goes like this one by one 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:39.749
 contracting together 5,000 to 10,000 dogs 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:41.789
 if you have set up the players and do not have 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:43.499
 more money to hire the reserves 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:47.069
 the use of the bronze players that you 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:47.999
 have your team and put there is this going 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.800
 do not even know 

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:54.569
 one by one until you always assemble your team 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.270
 playing will you make it to the 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.939
 your team is you have one 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:01.020
 if you can not get the reservations 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.210
 Hire All Your Backup Money 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:05.099
 you can put it there on the portal 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.169
 square looked for and put a 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:10.529
 player of yours or another cast of your 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:12.539
 To play this team's reserve is 

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:13.319
 I only saw and did not put the goose 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.360
