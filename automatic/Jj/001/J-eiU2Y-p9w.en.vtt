00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.880
 very good kids today in chema and today 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.440
 I bring you a great tourism video 6 that 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.260
 lately there is everyone that never 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.689
 goes with big missed 5 not included me 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.310
 also and well then for bringing a 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.859
 little more variety to the channel and today 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.119
 I come to talk about the update 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.490
 1.14 which is the last to have gotten the 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.679
 game that I think they have already gotten 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.510
 good ones a few days ago but 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:36.949
 well, it's already uploaded when I could and 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.749
 I have also raised it because I still 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.799
 you are in time to get the car I know 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:44.629
 that you just saw on the screen the subaru 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.879
 lived you live or something like that I think it 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.170
 called that it is from these cars that 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.969
 they create companies with collaboration 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.319
 with great tourism that only tend to put 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.479
 to the game although there are some who then 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.979
 they also manufacture them in real life and 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.929
 to achieve it, the only thing that you will have 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.959
 to do is get them to go to a salon 

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:04.969
 seasonal events and get into that 

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:08.299
 subaru bike that is called and you are 

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:10.579
 watching and good in this update you 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.930
 anima has put other things you had 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.539
 at the beginning of the video there was a 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.399
 list with everything they had gotten 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:18.590
 I know very well but I think I think that 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.780
 they had corrected errors then they had 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.429
 also got a new bmw but that already 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.009
 You can not get a career is 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.509
 you have to buy it and well this subaru 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:28.399
 also like all the other great 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.030
 tourism if you put in the section that 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.280
 of vision great tourism you will have there 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.840
 to buy it but they are worth a paste 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.729
 this way you can get it for free 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.860
 this event to get the subaru 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.119
 this free I do not know how long it lasts 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.430
 that I did not like is also that 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.140
 you just saw now that the interior neither 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.479
 they have even done it they have put as 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.670
 the cars these standard have not been 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.050
 curiado nothing of interior and good now 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.360
 I pass it to fast camera to get 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.600
 now until the turn he took out 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.580
 gold 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.680
 to get the car you do not have to 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.080
 take gold or you have to take anything out what the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:04.259
 last the only thing you have to do is 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.759
 go around the circuit but you have 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.110
 to circle circuit without leaving 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.630
 it does not matter what time you do 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.950
 but that they disqualify us and once 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.069
 you have gone around the circuit 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.590
 They will give you the car in this 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.630
 case let's now get to the part 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.220
 where where do I get the gold so that 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.920
 see what the circuit is like and that's the 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.780
 back and get the gold if you want or 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.480
 they are more pasta and it is not easy 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.950
 ok then I got it after 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.600
 a few laps you are already watching 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 that I was bronze then silver and then 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.510
 gold and had already not played great 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.680
 tourism nor is it known that I am the gta that 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.330
 you have seen the first time when 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.120
 I went to slow down the accustomed gta me 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.730
 I passed braking 30 meters 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.319
 and you come dgt to great tourism and it costs you 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.720
 a little bit used to it, but let's go 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.280
 I already say that I also is not that 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.519
 very good at car simulators and 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.940
 more with the command so get pain 

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.230
 it's very easy, you're going to have it very easy 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.409
 so if you want to get it I think that 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.629
 115000 give good total to get 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:07.049
 the gold I think it was 240 thousand or something 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:09.030
 and they will give you the car and well I will not go 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.220
 to talk nothing else I'm going to leave you here 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.890
 this is the return and the 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.769
 back where I leave him gold 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.359
 in the video and then I'll finish and nothing 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:20.609
 will give the car you can see there the 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:22.319
 colors so there are for the car and 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:25.470
 then I will also leave a bit in the end 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.120
 how is the car and that and so far 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.980
 it was basically to tell you this if 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:32.220
 I'm here to tell you that if you want the 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.440
 free car because it toys that if not 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.950
 It happens to you and they already charge it then you already 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.349
 they ask for game money 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.090
 and it was just this, so you already know if 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.950
 you liked the video I would love that 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.150
 you give him alai to share is with 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.280

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.470

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.420

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.560

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.560
 I leave you with the race 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.439
 with nothing 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.630
