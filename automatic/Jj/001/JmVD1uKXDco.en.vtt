we can find an easy way to think of a
story<00:02:12.680> plot

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
story plot

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610

oh lets you scrabble letters to think of

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
oh lets you scrabble letters to think of
ideas<00:02:18.689> brilliant

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
we better get started with this

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.660 
we better get started with this
animation<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.800> needs<00:03:04.950> to<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.160> done<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.460> three
