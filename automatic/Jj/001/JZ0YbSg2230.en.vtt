00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.340 

I<00:01:47.170> believe<00:01:48.010> it's<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.400> 24<00:01:49.000> row<00:01:49.300> I'm<00:01:49.540> not<00:01:49.750> sure

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
I believe it's a 24 row I'm not sure

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.670 
I believe it's a 24 row I'm not sure
and<00:01:51.210> you'll<00:01:52.210> notice<00:01:52.450> at<00:01:52.750> the<00:01:52.900> end<00:01:53.110> he's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
and you'll notice at the end he's

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.930 
and you'll notice at the end he's
finishing<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.670> field<00:01:55.030> and<00:01:55.620> I<00:01:56.620> got<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:57.130> good

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
finishing up this field and I got a good

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.640 
finishing up this field and I got a good
video<00:01:58.270> of

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
video of

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.870 
video of
this<00:02:00.610> platter<00:02:01.020> showing<00:02:02.020> it<00:02:02.140> folding<00:02:02.980> up<00:02:03.190> he

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
this platter showing it folding up he

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.660 
this platter showing it folding up he
never<00:02:04.060> has<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.660> out<00:02:04.810> of<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:04.960> tractor

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
never has to get out of the tractor

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.780 
never has to get out of the tractor
these<00:02:06.670> tractors<00:02:07.180> have<00:02:07.390> GPS<00:02:08.050> in<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.410> now<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:08.920> so

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
these tractors have GPS in it now and so

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.660 
these tractors have GPS in it now and so
they<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.060> get<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.180> real<00:02:10.420> nice<00:02:10.630> straight<00:02:11.080> row

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
they can get a real nice straight row

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.860 
they can get a real nice straight row
they<00:02:12.940> program<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.840> in

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
they program that in

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.590 
they program that in
for<00:02:16.200> each<00:02:16.290> field

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
for each field

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.160 
for each field
not<00:02:19.050> separately

do<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.350> nice<00:02:20.650> job

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.470 

you<00:02:24.590> can<00:02:24.830> see<00:02:24.980> is<00:02:25.040> raising<00:02:25.670> up<00:02:25.760> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.380 

the<00:02:29.720> wings<00:02:30.110> will

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.570 

take<00:02:36.780> down

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
take down

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.750 
take down
you<00:02:38.940> notice<00:02:39.240> there's<00:02:39.450> a

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
you notice there's a

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.220 
you notice there's a
big<00:02:41.300> white<00:02:41.629> tank<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.410> front

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.120 

and<00:02:45.380> chemical<00:02:46.099> some

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.440 

fertilizer<00:02:49.700> on

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.730 

but<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:55.050> control

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.950 

so

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960 
so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.960 
so
insecticides<00:03:00.960> something<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.680> feel

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.630 

the<00:03:04.390> seeds<00:03:04.750> are<00:03:05.020> coated<00:03:05.830> with<00:03:06.040> this<00:03:06.190> special

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the seeds are coated with this special

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.490 
the seeds are coated with this special
treatment

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
treatment

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.550 
treatment
so<00:03:12.100> the<00:03:12.430> bugs<00:03:12.760> don't<00:03:13.030> proceed<00:03:13.870> before

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
so the bugs don't proceed before

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.460 
so the bugs don't proceed before
then<00:03:16.520> the<00:03:16.700> other<00:03:16.880> hopper<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.480> the<00:03:17.569> back<00:03:17.780> is

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
then the other hopper in the back is

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.160 
then the other hopper in the back is
where<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.069> seed<00:03:19.700> goes<00:03:19.970> in<00:03:20.270> the<00:03:21.260> member
