00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.950 
less time probably around 60 hours yeah
and<00:01:51.200> then<00:01:52.200> how<00:01:52.770> long<00:01:53.009> does<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.220> take<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.460> to

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
and then how long does it take you to

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.810 
and then how long does it take you to
distill<00:01:54.960> off<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.649> wash<00:01:56.219> till<00:01:58.250> in<00:01:59.250> fact<00:01:59.520> both

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
distill off your wash till in fact both

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
distill off your wash till in fact both
the<00:01:59.880> wash<00:02:00.149> still<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.570> spirits<00:02:00.930> still

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the wash still and the spirits still

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.280 
the wash still and the spirits still
roughly<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> same<00:02:02.040> length<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.340> time<00:02:02.399> I<00:02:02.579> mean

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
roughly the same length of time I mean

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.630 
roughly the same length of time I mean
from<00:02:04.290> starting<00:02:04.710> at<00:02:04.770> 8<00:02:04.860> o'clock<00:02:04.890> it'll<00:02:05.520> be

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
from starting at 8 o'clock it'll be

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.680 
from starting at 8 o'clock it'll be
around<00:02:06.630> 12:15<00:02:07.560> 12:30<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.179> wash<00:02:09.330> bill<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
around 12:15 12:30 that the wash bill is

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
around 12:15 12:30 that the wash bill is
is<00:02:09.929> distilled<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.610> spirit<00:02:11.910> still

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
is distilled out and the spirit still

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.390 
is distilled out and the spirit still
just<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.420> little<00:02:12.450> longer<00:02:12.780> maybe<00:02:12.959> half

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
just a little longer maybe half

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.490 
just a little longer maybe half
longer<00:02:13.700> than<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.959> with<00:02:14.959> a<00:02:14.989> very<00:02:15.200> small<00:02:15.439> team

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
longer than that with a very small team

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.080 
longer than that with a very small team
like<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.370> happens<00:02:16.640> if<00:02:16.730> someone<00:02:16.909> goes

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
like that what happens if someone goes

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.149 
like that what happens if someone goes
sick<00:02:17.390> well<00:02:18.230> that's<00:02:18.500> interesting<00:02:18.650> because<00:02:18.890> I

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:19.159 
sick well that's interesting because I

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.309 
sick well that's interesting because I
Markham<00:02:19.879> went<00:02:20.090> on<00:02:20.180> holiday<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.689> in<00:02:20.959> July<00:02:21.200> and

Markham went on holiday in in July and

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.860 
Markham went on holiday in in July and
because<00:02:21.590> of<00:02:21.620> all<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.860> delays<00:02:22.040> we've<00:02:22.280> had<00:02:22.870> we

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
because of all the delays we've had we

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.559 
because of all the delays we've had we
needed<00:02:24.140> to<00:02:24.260> keep<00:02:24.439> keep<00:02:24.920> reducing<00:02:25.040> to<00:02:25.610> try<00:02:26.420> and

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
needed to keep keep reducing to try and

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.479 
needed to keep keep reducing to try and
catch<00:02:26.750> up<00:02:27.019> with<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:27.799> year's<00:02:28.129> sort<00:02:28.430> of

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.449 
catch up with this year's sort of
forecast<00:02:28.879> so<00:02:29.629> when<00:02:30.019> I<00:02:30.049> told<00:02:30.829> him<00:02:31.010> about<00:02:31.069> before

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
gonna he's got a month to show me how to

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.619 
gonna he's got a month to show me how to
do<00:02:33.980> it<00:02:34.099> he<00:02:34.189> was<00:02:34.280> a<00:02:34.340> bit<00:02:34.459> horrified<00:02:34.819> but<00:02:35.000> he<00:02:35.420> did

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
do it he was a bit horrified but he did

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:39.339 
do it he was a bit horrified but he did
and<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.920> carried<00:02:37.189> on<00:02:37.280> distilling<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.959> did

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
and we carried on distilling and I did

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.199 
and we carried on distilling and I did
it<00:02:39.470> with<00:02:40.099> my<00:02:40.250> son<00:02:40.459> now<00:02:40.730> it<00:02:40.819> sounds<00:02:40.970> pretty

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
it with my son now it sounds pretty

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:42.250 
it with my son now it sounds pretty
horrifying<00:02:41.659> probably<00:02:41.930> if<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.019> lot<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.200> people

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
horrifying probably if a lot of people

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.099 
horrifying probably if a lot of people
but<00:02:42.970> within<00:02:43.970> a<00:02:44.090> month<00:02:44.269> like<00:02:44.510> I<00:02:44.659> got<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.930> grass

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
but within a month like I got the grass

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:46.030 
but within a month like I got the grass
bit<00:02:45.349> though<00:02:45.530> we<00:02:45.650> had<00:02:45.769> some<00:02:45.920> interesting

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
bit though we had some interesting

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.569 
bit though we had some interesting
moments<00:02:46.690> it<00:02:47.690> all<00:02:47.840> went<00:02:48.079> okay<00:02:48.440> though<00:02:49.220> except

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
moments it all went okay though except

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:51.160 
moments it all went okay though except
the<00:02:49.670> filling<00:02:49.909> was<00:02:50.030> a<00:02:50.060> bit<00:02:50.239> interesting<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:50.870> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
the filling was a bit interesting and I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.110 
the filling was a bit interesting and I
should<00:02:52.129> probably<00:02:52.250> be<00:02:52.489> saying<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:52.790> on<00:02:52.940> camera

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
should probably be saying this on camera

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.369 
should probably be saying this on camera
we<00:02:53.389> would<00:02:53.480> manage<00:02:53.690> to<00:02:53.810> reduce<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.319> with

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
we would manage to reduce it with

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.500 
we would manage to reduce it with
slightly<00:02:54.709> more<00:02:54.799> than<00:02:54.950> 63.5%<00:02:55.849> we<00:02:56.269> should<00:02:56.420> have

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
slightly more than 63.5% we should have

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.629 
slightly more than 63.5% we should have
done
