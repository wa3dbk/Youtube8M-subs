00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 welcome guys we built videos of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.720
 unknown games the series that stands 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.330
 depopulating on youtube is not true if the 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.880
 linesmen but cats today we are up here 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.030
 another very unknown game 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.990
 stranger called stanic ball 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.460
 apparently a little fucking game 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.470
 then we must first explain not 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.449
 is done by the saw as said no 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.580
 fig has never made the teams that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.170
 they have fence and we can gennaro 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.660
 in the race we can practically look 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.760
 just a server where to play 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.610
 in after raising then we can play 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.530
 with the other participants or 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 we can go and start a race 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 andrea put the maximum number of 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 player we want to export us a 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.000
 server where we can go to choose 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.550
 the various balls that are there 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.410
 and each has no different difficulty 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.840
 except one that is called the fa nic 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.700
 indeed this is the super sonic one 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.880
 possessed ball that is practically not 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.140
 you understand a cock when you play 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.970
 this ball therefore has no land 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.129
 also selected is the league polo 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.600
 of legends and I find it is a typical pole 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.230
 banged on the wall because being one 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.430
 ball 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.410
 here it is who looks at you a fucking fool 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.729
 satanic leek is not enough 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.160
 other selection we can do 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.229
 I will continue to select one of the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.810
 if I'm not mistaken 5 maps that are there are 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.979
 five we do the first one but we do 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.360
 another to show you the game 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.030
 what the fuck is practically we are 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.240
 these balls and you have to run with the 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.300
 I actually saw the balls I said or from 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.290
 faq because it's cool you can seem 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.910
 a bullshit 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.670
 but pirate who play it color with with 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.380
 Friends it's cool to suck usually 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.789
 the most stupid games are the most 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.140
 We are all in this amusing point 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:37.210
 balls we have to go around for 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.850
 this is the world for the track 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.770
 small track are two laps to try 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.210
 to finish first do the work 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.039
 race with balls 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.049
 first taste the ice of the balls 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.450
 now I do the race with the balls of 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.159
 balls but nintendo doubt also stay 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.020
 beware of rebounds because if we take 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.040
 what the fuck are they a rock or in a 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.350
 corner and various things 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 to splash out of the apt he did in 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.710
 this track a good record indeed not 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.360
 I can do it more every time there 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.000
 game are always negative with di 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.310
 forgot when you slammed now 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.479
 I outgrown because he fucked up 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 instead no 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.470
 and yet still here, however, now I cheer 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.820
 for because I am stronger because I am 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.440
 stronger no you're going on 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.840
 this is a day that is precisely 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.330
 let's say the single player mode 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.370
 because they are not people online 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.030
 but they are still people managed by 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.670
 computer 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.830
 people back but we're talking about 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.989
 balls is a blast that just when 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.120
 take the billboard that is split 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.430
 I proposed a good physics fake race 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.500
 even if obviously not a community 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.840
 is that he did who knows what he is not 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.430
 who knows what the fuck we are 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.190
 on the second lap and it's cool as a game 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.660
 that is, it was going to make us a video of this 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.730
 evening will play I have known more games 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.549
 stupid pistor fell back to top 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.680
 youtube dear gentlemen is fine loved ones 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:53.660
 gentlemen you now go lingen 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 description first of all and put 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.579
 lay this video according to the second 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.579
 step to do go linking description 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:03.620
 and download this game and play 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.989
 together with your friends then maybe me 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.840
 you also find me playing and we do 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.709
 some guarantees the last one is fine 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.900
 me with de rossi to fuck madonna that thing 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.430
 fucking flight done seen to do the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.599
 Russian shit 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.910
 I hope there is no one among you 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.310
 Russian because otherwise they are understood where 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.430
 is the red from katie supero at the end is 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.739
 I win from who I can still win I am 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.049
 according to this red not making it super 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.290
 now in my opinion or maybe yes maybe you go 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.840
 over the end where he flies home 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.989
 practically the Madonnas this ball 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.959
 red and just decomposed is okay ho 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.160
 finished the race and finished second 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.569
 both now I have passed before because 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.599
 what an anticolane does anyway 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.430
 I arrived second is of canio a 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.840
 select the huge ball and into the 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.480
 selecting a track I never did 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.890
 that is this I never did in fact 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.410
 moment there is no record 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.150
 and destiny this strange skill meanwhile 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.260
 I'm a huge ball in theory I should 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.470
 have a little more weight 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:08.610
 I'm saying bullshit I don't know if it's worth 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.380
 these rules meanwhile mean here if 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.560
 we fall we fall into the void there is one 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:18.780
 fucking star with a face 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.970
 my lady that I understood this 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.340
 really valent ball precisely because it is a 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.080
 a little bigger and therefore a little valley every 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.910
 goal so much that they don't have to choose the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.090
 so it will surely come last 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.480
 fifth is this stuff 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.919
 or the scary turn of death around 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.050
 fearful of corrupt death undermines yes 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.030
 moves away, approaches the camera 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.830
 that we are getting more support than we are 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.210
 first guys we were before it was 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.880
 split the billboard because I don't have it 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.669
 split does not skip this page no 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:53.610
 jump because of a sin seen 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.740
 sir, I knew I had to drop by 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.990
 ok with backspace you return immediately 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.040
 immediately in the roadway immediately in 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.830
 straight away 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.290
 look at how slow a drift is third 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.610
 the tiny ball here was what 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.740
 good this ball that in this track 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.720
 because it doesn't jump a lot because how 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.690
 however, there is a lot of weight, not something 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.090
 I knew I'm verifying now 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.910
 arrived second stick to those who jump 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:21.090
 get billboard new fuck off lean 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.010
 back to robbie and see if I can do it 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:27.720
 see the satanic ball 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.199
 look how cool it costs super stanic 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:36.800
 bonus ended up in the bangarang bell room 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:41.669
 ours towards the top dog motif 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.320
 so random that dances spoltore mlg to 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:46.970
 more so free mountain 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:49.440
 it's this little ball leaves marijuana 

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.780
 this happens only with the superstar 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.340
 ikbal really unmanageable because it has 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.370
 a supersonic speed 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.330
 you can't handle it is impossible to 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.010
 handle 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.510
 goes crazy anyway these are the 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.979
 waterfalls reads or otherwise the boy 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:03.360
 background of losing my movie greeting 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.280
 left as I like challenge liked it 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.810
 perceived in progress a video that is a 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.889
 unknown game that you would like to see in 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.889
 this series and bye bye
