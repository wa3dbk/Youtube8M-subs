00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
a snapper you get not just one but two

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.179 
a snapper you get not just one but two
projects<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.490> video<00:00:21.680> you<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:22.710> try<00:00:23.130> to

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
projects in one video you just try to

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.109 
projects in one video you just try to
find<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.550> better<00:00:23.760> deal<00:00:24.029> than<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:25.820> to<00:00:26.820> make<00:00:26.970> my

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
find a better deal than that to make my

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.089 
find a better deal than that to make my
magic<00:00:27.539> propeller<00:00:28.019> I'm<00:00:28.439> going<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.680> start<00:00:28.949> with

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
magic propeller I'm going to start with

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.269 
magic propeller I'm going to start with
a<00:00:29.160> 3/8<00:00:29.970> inch<00:00:30.000> dowel<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.470> what<00:00:31.769> I<00:00:31.800> need<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> do

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a 3/8 inch dowel and what I need to do

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.569 
a 3/8 inch dowel and what I need to do
is<00:00:32.489> just<00:00:32.700> cut<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.030> series<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.950> v-shaped<00:00:34.950> grooves

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
is just cut a series of v-shaped grooves

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.690 
is just cut a series of v-shaped grooves
into<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.440> what<00:00:37.770> I've<00:00:37.890> decided<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.460> do

point<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.579> my<00:00:45.239> router<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.079> I've<00:00:46.590> set<00:00:46.950> up

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
point bit on my router and I've set up

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889 
point bit on my router and I've set up
this<00:00:47.219> you<00:00:47.489> know<00:00:47.610> really<00:00:47.640> high-tech<00:00:48.450> system

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
this you know really high-tech system

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.279 
this you know really high-tech system
where<00:00:49.620> I've<00:00:49.739> taken<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.460> real<00:00:50.969> thin<00:00:51.420> piece<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
where I've taken a real thin piece of

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.500 
where I've taken a real thin piece of
dowel<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.460> when<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.579> cut<00:00:53.850> one<00:00:54.000> groove<00:00:54.329> I

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
dowel so that when I cut one groove I

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
dowel so that when I cut one groove I
can<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.840> lock<00:00:55.140> it<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.410> there<00:00:55.559> cut<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> next

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
can just lock it in there cut the next

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
can just lock it in there cut the next
groove<00:00:56.309> over<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> over<00:00:56.940> kind<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
groove over it over kind of like you

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:07.429 
groove over it over kind of like you
would<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.750> finger<00:00:58.469> joints

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.520 

now<00:01:08.439> I've<00:01:08.560> got<00:01:08.680> a<00:01:08.710> quarter<00:01:09.250> inch<00:01:09.430> diameter

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
now I've got a quarter inch diameter

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.990 
now I've got a quarter inch diameter
dowel<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:12.159> I'm<00:01:12.369> going<00:01:12.549> to<00:01:12.579> use<00:01:12.640> for<00:01:12.939> the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
dowel that I'm going to use for the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.490 
dowel that I'm going to use for the
propeller<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.600> I'm<00:01:13.719> just<00:01:13.869> going<00:01:14.020> to<00:01:14.079> drill<00:01:14.470> a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
propeller and I'm just going to drill a

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.090 
propeller and I'm just going to drill a
small<00:01:15.039> hole<00:01:15.909> into<00:01:16.360> it<00:01:18.869> then<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:19.899> small<00:01:20.320> nail<00:01:20.710> can

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
small hole into it then a small nail can

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.870 
small hole into it then a small nail can
fit<00:01:21.429> into<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.000> hole<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:22.890> spin<00:01:23.890> the<00:01:24.549> trick<00:01:24.729> is

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
fit into that hole and spin the trick is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760 
fit into that hole and spin the trick is
going<00:01:24.970> to<00:01:25.030> be<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.299> find<00:01:25.509> the<00:01:25.630> exact<00:01:26.140> center<00:01:26.560> I

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
going to be to find the exact center I

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.950 
going to be to find the exact center I
may<00:01:27.009> have<00:01:27.130> to<00:01:27.280> sand<00:01:27.610> down<00:01:27.729> sides<00:01:28.329> to<00:01:28.600> make<00:01:28.780> sure

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
may have to sand down sides to make sure

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.240 
may have to sand down sides to make sure
that<00:01:29.079> I<00:01:29.140> get<00:01:29.259> it<00:01:29.409> you<00:01:29.619> know<00:01:29.740> perfectly

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
that I get it you know perfectly

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.889 
that I get it you know perfectly
balanced<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.060> doesn't<00:01:31.329> look<00:01:31.509> like<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.869> is

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
balanced it doesn't look like it is

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.130 
balanced it doesn't look like it is
right<00:01:32.770> now<00:01:33.149> I'm<00:01:34.149> going<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.390> give<00:01:34.539> this<00:01:34.689> a<00:01:34.750> bit

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
right now I'm going to give this a bit

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.800 
right now I'm going to give this a bit
more<00:01:35.409> of<00:01:35.560> a<00:01:35.649> propeller<00:01:36.039> shape<00:01:36.579> using<00:01:37.329> my<00:01:37.539> belt

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
more of a propeller shape using my belt

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.160 
more of a propeller shape using my belt
sander

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.930 

well<00:01:45.170> I<00:01:45.470> think<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:45.950> got<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.340> about<00:01:46.640> as

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
well I think I got that about as

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.510 
well I think I got that about as
balanced<00:01:47.690> as<00:01:47.810> I'm<00:01:47.990> going<00:01:48.229> to<00:01:48.409> get<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.920> seems<00:01:49.280> to

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
balanced as I'm going to get it seems to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.690 
balanced as I'm going to get it seems to
spin<00:01:49.880> pretty<00:01:50.390> freely<00:01:50.870> so<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.740> have<00:01:52.310> drilled

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
spin pretty freely so I have drilled

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.390 
spin pretty freely so I have drilled
another<00:01:52.940> small<00:01:53.540> hole<00:01:53.900> in<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.380> end<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:55.010> this

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
another small hole in the end of this

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.580 
another small hole in the end of this
dowel<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.300> now<00:01:56.570> I'm<00:01:56.840> just<00:01:57.020> going<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.260> attach

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
dowel and now I'm just going to attach

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.960 
dowel and now I'm just going to attach
the<00:01:57.830> propeller<00:01:58.010> it's<00:01:58.550> pretty

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
the propeller it's pretty

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.400 
the propeller it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:59.330> okay<00:02:01.840> so<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:03.110> comes<00:02:03.350> the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
straightforward okay so now comes the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.440 
straightforward okay so now comes the
totally<00:02:03.890> cool<00:02:04.190> part<00:02:04.550> what<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.060> do<00:02:05.180> is<00:02:05.360> you

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
totally cool part what you do is you

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.180 
totally cool part what you do is you
give<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.810> somebody<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.470> you<00:02:06.680> challenge

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
give this to somebody and you challenge

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460 
give this to somebody and you challenge
them<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.460> get<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.240> propeller<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.690> spin<00:02:08.899> just

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
them to get the propeller to spin just

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.270 
them to get the propeller to spin just
by<00:02:10.190> rubbing<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.420> other<00:02:11.840> dowel<00:02:12.320> along<00:02:13.069> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
by rubbing this other dowel along the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.309 
by rubbing this other dowel along the
ratchet<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.819> well<00:02:14.300> as<00:02:14.510> you'll<00:02:14.690> notice<00:02:14.900> it

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
ratchet and well as you'll notice it

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.010 
ratchet and well as you'll notice it
doesn't<00:02:15.350> do<00:02:15.980> much<00:02:16.190> but<00:02:16.700> wait<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.840> the

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
doesn't do much but wait I have the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.380 
doesn't do much but wait I have the
secret<00:02:18.440> to<00:02:19.190> making<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.670> spin<00:02:19.910> alright<00:02:20.209> check

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
secret to making it spin alright check

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.160 
secret to making it spin alright check
this<00:02:20.450> out

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
this out

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.540 
this out
propeller<00:02:21.739> spin<00:02:22.550> please<00:02:23.030> spin<00:02:23.660> whoa

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
propeller spin please spin whoa

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.930 
propeller spin please spin whoa
and<00:02:25.750> now<00:02:26.750> propeller<00:02:27.709> spin<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.790> other<00:02:29.000> way<00:02:33.940> you

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
and now propeller spin the other way you

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.360 
and now propeller spin the other way you
can<00:02:34.970> go<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.390> way<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.110> I<00:02:36.769> could<00:02:36.980> even<00:02:37.130> come

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
can go that way and I could even come

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.670 
can go that way and I could even come
back<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.940> other<00:02:38.000> way<00:02:38.239> at<00:02:38.450> my<00:02:38.750> commands<00:02:39.320> that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
back the other way at my commands that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.670 
back the other way at my commands that
propeller<00:02:40.130> spins<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:42.140> there's<00:02:42.290> actually<00:02:42.410> of

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
propeller spins well there's actually of

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.380 
propeller spins well there's actually of
course<00:02:42.890> there's<00:02:43.070> a<00:02:43.130> trick<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.640> and<00:02:43.970> well

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
course there's a trick to it and well

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.170 
course there's a trick to it and well
the<00:02:44.540> trick<00:02:44.750> is<00:02:44.930> how<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.140> hold<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:46.180> thinner

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
the trick is how you hold this thinner

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.630 
the trick is how you hold this thinner
dowel<00:02:47.780> here<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.230> if<00:02:48.829> you<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:48.980> rub<00:02:49.340> it<00:02:49.370> this

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
dowel here is if you just rub it this

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.610 
dowel here is if you just rub it this
way<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.360> propeller<00:02:50.690> really<00:02:50.989> won't<00:02:51.140> do<00:02:51.380> much

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
way the propeller really won't do much

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.940 
way the propeller really won't do much
what<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.459> do<00:02:52.610> is<00:02:52.850> you<00:02:52.970> keep<00:02:53.120> one<00:02:53.600> finger<00:02:53.959> along

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
what you do is you keep one finger along

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.030 
what you do is you keep one finger along
the<00:02:55.100> side<00:02:55.340> of<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.640> and<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:56.660> rub<00:02:56.989> it<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.320> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
the side of it and you rub it on the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.009 
the side of it and you rub it on the
ratchet<00:02:58.220> part<00:02:58.790> at<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.060> same<00:02:59.090> time<00:02:59.540> and<00:02:59.810> it'll

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
ratchet part at the same time and it'll

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.530 
ratchet part at the same time and it'll
spin<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.560> if<00:03:00.799> you<00:03:00.890> wanted<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.160> get<00:03:01.280> going<00:03:01.730> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
spin and if you wanted to get going the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.360 
spin and if you wanted to get going the
opposite<00:03:02.930> direction<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.590> do<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:03.980> same<00:03:04.130> thing

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
opposite direction you do the same thing

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:05.710 
opposite direction you do the same thing
except<00:03:04.760> with<00:03:04.850> your<00:03:04.970> thumb<00:03:05.329> you<00:03:05.540> rub<00:03:05.690> your

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
except with your thumb you rub your

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.590 
except with your thumb you rub your
thumb<00:03:06.260> against<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.549> side<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.269> Gretsch<00:03:08.630> it

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
thumb against that side and Gretsch it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.330 
thumb against that side and Gretsch it
nothing<00:03:11.600> is<00:03:11.660> so<00:03:11.840> cool<00:03:12.079> I<00:03:12.260> have<00:03:12.440> no<00:03:12.799> idea<00:03:13.100> how<00:03:13.220> it

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
nothing is so cool I have no idea how it

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.220 
nothing is so cool I have no idea how it
works<00:03:13.459> I'm<00:03:13.760> sure<00:03:14.060> there's<00:03:14.269> you<00:03:14.570> know<00:03:14.630> physics

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
works I'm sure there's you know physics

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.850 
works I'm sure there's you know physics
involved<00:03:16.420> but<00:03:17.420> you<00:03:17.750> know<00:03:17.989> it's<00:03:18.320> enough<00:03:18.620> for<00:03:18.650> me

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
involved but you know it's enough for me

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.979 
involved but you know it's enough for me
to<00:03:19.130> say<00:03:19.310> well<00:03:19.700> that's<00:03:20.120> a<00:03:20.420> pretty<00:03:20.720> neat<00:03:20.959> little

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
to say well that's a pretty neat little

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:29.800 
to say well that's a pretty neat little
project

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.240 

all<00:03:30.810> right<00:03:30.960> to<00:03:31.080> make<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.350> snapper<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.010> did

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
all right to make the snapper all I did

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.030 
all right to make the snapper all I did
is<00:03:32.400> drill<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:33.090> hole<00:03:33.390> as<00:03:33.690> deep<00:03:33.720> as<00:03:34.080> I<00:03:34.200> could<00:03:34.530> into

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
is drill a hole as deep as I could into

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.020 
is drill a hole as deep as I could into
a<00:03:35.150> three-quarter<00:03:36.150> inch<00:03:36.620> square<00:03:37.820> piece<00:03:38.820> of

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
a three-quarter inch square piece of

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.420 
a three-quarter inch square piece of
wood<00:03:39.300> now<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> have<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.080> shorter<00:03:40.740> piece<00:03:41.010> here

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
wood now I have a shorter piece here

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.550 
wood now I have a shorter piece here
that<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.850> just<00:03:42.210> want<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.630> make<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.320> little

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
that I just want to make a little

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:54.080 
that I just want to make a little
pointed<00:03:44.310> area<00:03:52.250> now<00:03:53.250> I've<00:03:53.370> got<00:03:53.520> my<00:03:53.640> two<00:03:53.670> pieces

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
pointed area now I've got my two pieces

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.240 
pointed area now I've got my two pieces
I've<00:03:54.450> got<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.690> hole<00:03:54.930> in<00:03:55.170> this<00:03:55.380> one<00:03:55.710> and<00:03:55.980> this

I've got the hole in this one and this

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.670 
I've got the hole in this one and this
one<00:03:56.310> I've<00:03:56.700> also<00:03:56.940> drilled<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.570> shallower<00:03:58.260> hole

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
one I've also drilled a shallower hole

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.370 
one I've also drilled a shallower hole
and<00:03:58.950> I've<00:03:59.700> got<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.210> quarter<00:04:00.570> inch<00:04:00.720> dowel<00:04:01.050> and

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
and I've got a quarter inch dowel and

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.640 
and I've got a quarter inch dowel and
I've<00:04:02.070> cut<00:04:02.460> a<00:04:02.640> little<00:04:02.970> notch<00:04:03.240> on<00:04:03.870> the<00:04:04.170> bottom<00:04:04.530> of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
I've cut a little notch on the bottom of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.210 
I've cut a little notch on the bottom of
that<00:04:04.880> to<00:04:05.880> grab<00:04:06.120> the<00:04:06.450> rubber<00:04:06.630> band<00:04:06.960> and<00:04:07.260> I'll

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
that to grab the rubber band and I'll

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.900 
that to grab the rubber band and I'll
just<00:04:08.430> wedge<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.330> in<00:04:10.190> you<00:04:11.190> know<00:04:11.310> about<00:04:11.700> like

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
just wedge this in you know about like

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.370 
just wedge this in you know about like
that<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.660> that<00:04:12.840> it'll<00:04:13.140> slide<00:04:13.470> into<00:04:14.040> there<00:04:15.380> and

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
that so that it'll slide into there and

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.640 
that so that it'll slide into there and
a<00:04:16.799> hole<00:04:16.980> all<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.310> way<00:04:17.549> through<00:04:18.090> so<00:04:18.959> that<00:04:18.989> I<00:04:19.350> can

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
a hole all the way through so that I can

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.410 
a hole all the way through so that I can
put<00:04:19.830> the<00:04:19.920> rubber<00:04:20.100> band<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.580> there<00:04:20.790> so<00:04:21.270> I've

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
put the rubber band in there so I've

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.000 
put the rubber band in there so I've
passed<00:04:21.720> my<00:04:21.930> rubber<00:04:22.200> band<00:04:22.500> through<00:04:22.740> there<00:04:22.890> and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
passed my rubber band through there and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.460 
passed my rubber band through there and
tied<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.250> knot<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:23.820> each<00:04:24.360> side<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:24.840> it<00:04:25.140> goes<00:04:25.260> all

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
tied a knot on each side so it goes all

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.440 
tied a knot on each side so it goes all
the<00:04:25.500> way<00:04:25.680> through<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.310> hole<00:04:26.490> now<00:04:27.030> of<00:04:27.210> course

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
the way through the hole now of course

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.660 
the way through the hole now of course
the<00:04:27.600> trick<00:04:27.840> here<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.680> give<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.430> to<00:04:29.640> a

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
the trick here is to give this to a

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.740 
the trick here is to give this to a
person<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.540> tell<00:04:31.170> them<00:04:31.350> to<00:04:31.880> grab<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.330> rubber

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
person and tell them to grab the rubber

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.710 
person and tell them to grab the rubber
band<00:04:34.140> with<00:04:34.710> that<00:04:35.100> notch<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.120> that<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.540> will

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
band with that notch so that it will

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.040 
band with that notch so that it will
spring<00:04:37.260> back<00:04:37.560> amazingly<00:04:38.310> like<00:04:38.910> you<00:04:39.480> can<00:04:39.660> do<00:04:39.840> by

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
spring back amazingly like you can do by

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.210 
spring back amazingly like you can do by
you<00:04:40.380> have<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:41.070> work<00:04:41.460> with<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.890> got<00:04:43.890> it<00:04:44.010> and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
you have to work with this got it and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.830 
you have to work with this got it and
then<00:04:44.340> you<00:04:44.430> pull<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.760> out<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.060> of<00:04:45.450> course<00:04:45.660> it'll

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
then you pull it out and of course it'll

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.480 
then you pull it out and of course it'll
just<00:04:46.080> snap<00:04:46.170> back<00:04:46.320> in<00:04:46.740> every<00:04:47.160> time<00:04:47.370> because

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
just snap back in every time because

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.190 
just snap back in every time because
that<00:04:47.670> rubber<00:04:47.880> band<00:04:48.150> has<00:04:48.360> such<00:04:48.570> you<00:04:49.110> know

pulling power on it yeah it's kind of

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.120 
pulling power on it yeah it's kind of
cheesy<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.690> course<00:04:55.020> there's<00:04:55.380> no<00:04:55.560> way<00:04:55.770> you<00:04:55.830> can
