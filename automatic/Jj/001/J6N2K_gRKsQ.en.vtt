00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
is my iPhoto library it looks like a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
is my iPhoto library it looks like a
single<00:01:14.460> file<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.450> it's<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.689> folder

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
which is actually really small you might

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.050 
which is actually really small you might
find<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.960> your<00:01:25.140> iPhoto<00:01:25.530> library<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:26.040> 20<00:01:26.490> 30

find that your iPhoto library is 20 30
40<00:01:27.750> 60<00:01:28.259> gigabytes<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.610> why<00:01:29.820> your<00:01:30.000> hard

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
40 60 gigabytes and that's why your hard

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.120 
40 60 gigabytes and that's why your hard
drive<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.659> full<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.799> even<00:01:32.009> though<00:01:32.100> my

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
iPhoto library is really small and you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.190 
iPhoto library is really small and you
can<00:01:35.100> see<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> 205<00:01:36.150> gigabytes<00:01:36.720> free<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.170> my

my hard drive is actually empty and
we're<00:01:42.180> going<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.360> move<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.930> iPhoto<00:01:43.380> library

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
we're going to move this iPhoto library

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.789 
we're going to move this iPhoto library
to<00:01:44.159> an<00:01:44.280> external<00:01:44.880> hard<00:01:45.119> drive

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
to an external hard drive

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.679 
to an external hard drive
especially<00:01:46.799> for<00:01:46.979> laptop<00:01:47.399> users<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:48.060> wouldn't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
especially for laptop users I wouldn't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
especially for laptop users I wouldn't
really<00:01:48.780> recommend<00:01:48.869> having<00:01:49.409> your<00:01:49.649> iPhoto

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
really recommend having your iPhoto

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.950 
really recommend having your iPhoto
library<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.759> an<00:01:50.880> external<00:01:51.360> hard<00:01:51.540> drive<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.899> a

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
library on an external hard drive for a

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.200 
library on an external hard drive for a
very<00:01:52.140> long<00:01:52.320> time<00:01:52.520> it's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> good<00:01:53.729> temporary

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
very long time it's a good temporary

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.999 
very long time it's a good temporary
solution<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.780> your<00:01:55.049> best<00:01:55.259> decision<00:01:55.740> really

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
solution but your best decision really

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.459 
solution but your best decision really
is<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.790> replace<00:01:57.119> your<00:01:57.390> small<00:01:57.659> hard<00:01:57.930> drive<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
is to replace your small hard drive with

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.740 
is to replace your small hard drive with
a<00:01:58.500> larger<00:01:58.979> one<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.399> then<00:01:59.909> use<00:02:00.090> an<00:02:00.240> external

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
a larger one and then use an external

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.109 
a larger one and then use an external
hard<00:02:00.960> drive<00:02:00.990> as<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> backup<00:02:01.670> because<00:02:02.670> what<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
hard drive as a backup because what this

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.850 
hard drive as a backup because what this
means<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.509> anytime<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.960> load<00:02:04.259> up<00:02:04.290> iPhoto

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
means is anytime you load up iPhoto

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.380 
means is anytime you load up iPhoto
you're<00:02:05.549> going<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.759> have<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> make<00:02:06.090> sure<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
you're going to have to make sure that

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.059 
you're going to have to make sure that
your<00:02:06.570> external<00:02:06.930> hard<00:02:07.259> drive<00:02:07.409> is<00:02:07.530> plugged<00:02:07.740> in

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
your external hard drive is plugged in

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.699 
your external hard drive is plugged in
but<00:02:08.910> for<00:02:09.090> certain<00:02:09.360> circumstances<00:02:10.140> this<00:02:10.500> might

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
but for certain circumstances this might

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.370 
but for certain circumstances this might
be<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> best<00:02:11.069> solution<00:02:11.580> for<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.879> right<00:02:12.090> now

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
be the best solution for you right now

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.780 
be the best solution for you right now
and<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.650> simply<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:14.010> matter<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.580> over

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
and it's simply a matter of going over

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.420 
and it's simply a matter of going over
to<00:02:14.940> your<00:02:15.060> iPhoto<00:02:15.420> library<00:02:15.770> left<00:02:16.770> clicking<00:02:17.100> and

to your iPhoto library left clicking and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.240 
to your iPhoto library left clicking and
dragging<00:02:17.720> the<00:02:18.720> iPhoto<00:02:19.080> library<00:02:19.620> over<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:20.130> your

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
external hard drive because my test

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
external hard drive because my test
library<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.360> small<00:02:24.720> it's<00:02:25.440> only<00:02:25.650> going<00:02:25.770> to

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
library is so small it's only going to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.080 
library is so small it's only going to
take<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:25.980> couple<00:02:26.250> minutes<00:02:26.460> for<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.910> finish

take a couple minutes for it to finish
copying<00:02:27.710> but<00:02:28.710> don't<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.010> surprised<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.580> your

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.820 

it's<00:02:37.450> important<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.930> note<00:02:38.110> right<00:02:38.380> now<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.740> we

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it's important to note right now that we

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's important to note right now that we
have<00:02:38.950> two<00:02:39.190> copies<00:02:39.730> of<00:02:39.760> our<00:02:40.030> iPhoto<00:02:40.450> library

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
have two copies of our iPhoto library

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.350 
have two copies of our iPhoto library
one<00:02:42.040> is<00:02:42.220> right<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.430> in<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.730> pictures<00:02:43.060> folder

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
one is right here in the pictures folder

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.230 
one is right here in the pictures folder
and<00:02:43.750> another<00:02:44.650> is<00:02:45.010> in<00:02:45.070> our<00:02:45.580> external<00:02:46.060> hard

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
and another is in our external hard

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.660 
and another is in our external hard
drive<00:02:46.480> if<00:02:46.810> I<00:02:47.770> move<00:02:47.920> this<00:02:48.040> down<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.400> can<00:02:48.430> see

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
drive if I move this down you can see

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.830 
drive if I move this down you can see
both<00:02:48.820> copies<00:02:49.270> here<00:02:50.140> and<00:02:50.500> right<00:02:51.280> here<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:52.630> is

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
both copies here and right here this is

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.120 
both copies here and right here this is
important<00:02:53.320> because<00:02:53.440> we<00:02:53.710> don't<00:02:53.920> want<00:02:54.070> to

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
important because we don't want to

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.040 
important because we don't want to
delete<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.610> original<00:02:54.730> version<00:02:55.570> before<00:02:55.720> we've

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
delete the original version before we've

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.840 
delete the original version before we've
tested<00:02:56.320> out<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.650> new<00:02:56.980> version<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.460> make<00:02:57.670> sure

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:57.850 
tested out the new version to make sure

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:59.310 
tested out the new version to make sure
everything<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.180> working<00:02:58.390> correctly

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
everything is working correctly
