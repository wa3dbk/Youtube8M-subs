character design on this guy

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.500 
character design on this guy
I<00:00:28.170> got<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> I'm<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.460> too<00:00:29.760> familiar<00:00:29.939> with<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510

I got a I'm not too familiar with the
character<00:00:30.929> itself<00:00:31.260> but<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.769> design<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.460> think

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
character itself but the design I think

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.420 
character itself but the design I think
is<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.450> an<00:00:33.600> awesome<00:00:33.719> design<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:34.920> was

hundred<00:00:47.730> percent<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.270> but<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> was<00:00:49.620> one

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
hundred percent on that but it was one

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.529 
hundred percent on that but it was one

of those Wolverines is black and red if
that<00:00:51.690> helps<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.699> did<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> lot<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> sculpting

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that helps and I did a lot of sculpting

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.180 
that helps and I did a lot of sculpting
I<00:00:54.780> didn't<00:00:55.020> use<00:00:55.140> any<00:00:55.320> other<00:00:55.530> parts<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.070> that

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I didn't use any other parts for that

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.849 
I didn't use any other parts for that
guy<00:00:56.430> from<00:00:57.090> other<00:00:57.539> characters<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.680> guy

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
guy from other characters just that guy

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.040 
guy from other characters just that guy
so<00:00:59.100> his<00:00:59.219> arms<00:00:59.430> legs<00:00:59.670> everything<00:01:00.000> then<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> lot

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so his arms legs everything then a lot

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.939 
so his arms legs everything then a lot
of<00:01:01.170> sculpting<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> head<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:03.949> actually

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
of sculpting the head is a actually

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.560 
of sculpting the head is a actually
grumbled<00:01:05.369> down<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.790> Wolverine<00:01:06.270> head

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
grumbled down the Wolverine head

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
grumbled down the Wolverine head
completely<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.040> nub<00:01:08.340> on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
completely so it was just like a nub on

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.260 
completely so it was just like a nub on
top<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> ball<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.630> ball<00:01:09.810> joint<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:11.270> then

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
top of the ball the ball joint and then

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.120 
top of the ball the ball joint and then
I<00:01:12.330> hollowed<00:01:12.720> out<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:13.140> Clinton<00:01:13.560> Barton<00:01:13.890> head

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
I hollowed out a Clinton Barton head

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.890 
I hollowed out a Clinton Barton head
from<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> Ronin<00:01:15.060> figure<00:01:16.549> and<00:01:17.549> I've<00:01:18.270> sculpted

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
from the Ronin figure and I've sculpted

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.749 
from the Ronin figure and I've sculpted
the<00:01:19.259> helmet<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.619> top<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> fit<00:01:20.610> that

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
the helmet on top of that and I fit that

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.149 
the helmet on top of that and I fit that
over<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.330> Wolverine<00:01:21.780> nub<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:22.950> could

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
over the Wolverine nub so that I could

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.620 
over the Wolverine nub so that I could
still<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.850> original<00:01:24.000> joint<00:01:24.420> without

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
still use the original joint without

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
still use the original joint without
doing<00:01:24.900> too<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.080> work<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> actual<00:01:26.009> joint

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
doing too much work to the actual joint

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.160 
doing too much work to the actual joint
all<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.759> had<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> do<00:01:27.150> was<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.600> fit<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.900> over

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
all I had to do was just fit this over

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
all I had to do was just fit this over
the<00:01:28.430> existing<00:01:29.430> head<00:01:29.880> that<00:01:30.119> was<00:01:30.270> remaining<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
the existing head that was remaining and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.560 
the existing head that was remaining and
it<00:01:31.079> worked<00:01:31.229> perfectly<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.240> this<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.420> all

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
it worked perfectly and this was all

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.380 
it worked perfectly and this was all
hand<00:01:33.960> sculpted<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.579> star<00:01:35.880> was

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
hand sculpted and the star was

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.260 
hand sculpted and the star was
particularly<00:01:36.960> taxing<00:01:37.640> but<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.150> it

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
particularly taxing but I think it

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.550 
particularly taxing but I think it
turned<00:01:39.450> out<00:01:39.570> pretty<00:01:39.630> good<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.259> I<00:01:40.320> was<00:01:40.409> pretty

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
turned out pretty good so I was pretty

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.469 
turned out pretty good so I was pretty
pleased<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.340> helmet<00:01:41.640> too<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
pleased with that and the helmet too a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
pleased with that and the helmet too a
lot<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.990> different<00:01:43.470> sections<00:01:43.829> were<00:01:44.040> sculpted

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
lot of different sections were sculpted

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.950 
lot of different sections were sculpted
at<00:01:44.579> different<00:01:44.850> times<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:45.509> blended

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
at different times and then blended

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.889 
at different times and then blended
together<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:47.149> obviously<00:01:48.149> sanded<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
together and obviously sanded and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.020 
together and obviously sanded and
painted<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.680> was<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.430> really<00:01:50.700> pleased

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
painted but I was really really pleased

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
these things were sculpted in various

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.510 
these things were sculpted in various
stages<00:02:05.719> for<00:02:06.719> example<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.200> chest<00:02:07.469> pieces<00:02:07.740> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
stages for example the chest pieces the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
stages for example the chest pieces the
little<00:02:08.550> diamond-shaped<00:02:09.390> thing<00:02:09.599> was<00:02:09.750> sculpted

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
little diamond-shaped thing was sculpted

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.530 
little diamond-shaped thing was sculpted
and<00:02:10.530> then<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.649> reject<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.030> sanded<00:02:12.450> in

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then I reject that and sanded in

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.930 
and then I reject that and sanded in
rachet

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
rachet

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.000 
rachet
it<00:02:13.000> sanded<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.480> then<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.720> added<00:02:14.050> this<00:02:14.200> sphere<00:02:14.680> or

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
it sanded it then I added this sphere or

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.550 
it sanded it then I added this sphere or
the<00:02:15.160> disc<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:15.610> top<00:02:15.820> of<00:02:15.970> that<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.330> say<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
the disc on top of that and say and so

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
the disc on top of that and say and so
on<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.830> so<00:02:17.920> forth<00:02:18.190> same<00:02:18.400> thing<00:02:18.580> with<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.850> one

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
on and so forth same thing with that one

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.960 
on and so forth same thing with that one
then<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:19.330> added<00:02:19.660> this<00:02:19.840> one<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.610> built<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.730> gold

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
then I added this one I built the gold

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.360 
then I added this one I built the gold
part<00:02:22.270> first<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:22.990> the<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.190> disc

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
part first and the little disc

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.390 
part first and the little disc
underneath<00:02:24.790> then<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.120> put<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:26.220> one<00:02:27.220> that's

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
underneath then I put the one that's

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.220 
underneath then I put the one that's
white<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:27.760> on<00:02:28.030> top<00:02:28.300> of<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
white now on top of that and the

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.320 
white now on top of that and the
shoulders<00:02:29.710> for<00:02:30.220> example<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.820> built<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
shoulders for example I built this

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.330 
shoulders for example I built this
horizontal<00:02:32.110> part<00:02:32.380> and<00:02:32.530> then<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:32.710> added<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.130> on

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
horizontal part and then I added this on

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.360 
horizontal part and then I added this on
top<00:02:33.520> of<00:02:33.580> it<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:35.200> wrists<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> wrists<00:02:36.250> were

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
top of it the wrists the wrists were

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.990 
top of it the wrists the wrists were
particularly<00:02:36.760> fun<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> did<00:02:39.550> was<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.880> I

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
particularly fun what I did was is I

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.360 
particularly fun what I did was is I
built<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> regular<00:02:41.680> band<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.100> spins

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
built just the regular band that spins

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.190 
built just the regular band that spins
around<00:02:42.520> with<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> wrists<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.600> part<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.050> a

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
around with the wrists that part and a

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.110 
around with the wrists that part and a
little<00:02:44.440> triangle<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:45.010> the<00:02:45.070> front<00:02:45.400> then<00:02:46.090> I

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
little triangle on the front then I

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.570 
little triangle on the front then I
built<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.660> forearm<00:02:47.350> armour<00:02:47.800> on<00:02:47.830> top<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.400> it

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
built the forearm armour on top of it

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.550 
built the forearm armour on top of it
but<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.120> left<00:02:49.270> a<00:02:49.450> gap<00:02:49.630> hopefully<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.200> can<00:02:50.350> see

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
but I left a gap hopefully you can see

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.200 
but I left a gap hopefully you can see
that<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.310> wrist<00:02:51.490> still<00:02:51.820> spins

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
that so that the wrist still spins

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.170 
that so that the wrist still spins
freely<00:02:52.540> inside<00:02:52.870> and<00:02:53.440> it<00:02:54.340> allowed<00:02:54.910> me<00:02:55.150> to

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
freely inside and it allowed me to

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.960 
freely inside and it allowed me to
connect<00:02:55.990> the<00:02:56.520> fin<00:02:57.520> here<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> armour<00:02:58.270> there

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
connect the fin here the armour there

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.100 
connect the fin here the armour there
basically<00:03:00.970> connected<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:01.690> wrist<00:03:01.870> part

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
basically connected to the wrist part

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.420 
basically connected to the wrist part
without<00:03:02.260> actually<00:03:02.590> having<00:03:02.680> it<00:03:02.890> connected<00:03:03.310> so

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
without actually having it connected so

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.160 
without actually having it connected so
it<00:03:03.490> always<00:03:03.670> looks<00:03:04.030> like<00:03:04.210> it's<00:03:04.420> continuous<00:03:05.020> and

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
it always looks like it's continuous and

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.190 
it always looks like it's continuous and
it<00:03:05.260> flows<00:03:05.470> nicely<00:03:05.770> and<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:07.540> allowed<00:03:07.750> me<00:03:07.930> to<00:03:08.050> let

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
it flows nicely and it allowed me to let

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.050 
it flows nicely and it allowed me to let
this<00:03:08.350> connect<00:03:08.890> there<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.520> hollowed<00:03:09.850> it<00:03:09.970> out

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
this connect there and I hollowed it out

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.480 
this connect there and I hollowed it out
inside<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.660> fit<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.080> the<00:03:11.260> elbow<00:03:11.680> fit<00:03:12.130> over<00:03:12.370> the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
inside to fit on the elbow fit over the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.760 
inside to fit on the elbow fit over the
elbow<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.660> can<00:03:13.810> do<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:14.140> with<00:03:14.350> it<00:03:14.530> without

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
elbow so you can do that with it without

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.479 
elbow so you can do that with it without
getting<00:03:15.040> anything<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> way<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:18.100> belt<00:03:18.310> I

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
getting anything in the way the belt I

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.550 
getting anything in the way the belt I
just<00:03:18.700> basically<00:03:18.880> sculpted<00:03:19.810> the<00:03:20.020> belt<00:03:20.260> part

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
just basically sculpted the belt part

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.990 
just basically sculpted the belt part
and<00:03:20.680> then<00:03:20.770> I<00:03:20.860> sculpted<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.370> part<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:21.940> the

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
and then I sculpted the part in the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.020 
and then I sculpted the part in the
middle<00:03:22.270> no<00:03:22.600> big<00:03:22.750> deal<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.170> I<00:03:23.350> did<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:24.040> shin

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
middle no big deal there I did the shin

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.080 
middle no big deal there I did the shin
armor<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.420> like<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.840> did<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.110> forearm<00:03:26.620> there

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
armor just like I did the forearm there

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.340 
armor just like I did the forearm there
not<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.239> part<00:03:28.510> here<00:03:28.720> but<00:03:28.840> just<00:03:29.050> the<00:03:29.140> part

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
not this part here but just the part

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.900 
not this part here but just the part
with<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.560> elbow<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.040> then<00:03:30.430> I<00:03:30.550> did<00:03:30.700> the<00:03:30.790> same

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
with the elbow and then I did the same

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.910 
with the elbow and then I did the same
thing<00:03:31.120> with<00:03:31.270> the<00:03:31.390> kneecap<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.620> it<00:03:32.739> kind

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
thing with the kneecap so that it kind

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.430 
thing with the kneecap so that it kind
of<00:03:33.010> recesses<00:03:33.459> inside<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.150> armor<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:35.350> it

of recesses inside the armor and it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.080

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
allowed me to build the armor the way I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.760 
allowed me to build the armor the way I
wanted<00:03:37.450> it<00:03:37.630> without<00:03:38.050> having<00:03:38.380> to<00:03:38.440> worry<00:03:38.650> about

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
they cut the shin armor at the top of

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.430 
they cut the shin armor at the top of
the<00:03:48.850> shin<00:03:49.060> and<00:03:49.090> then<00:03:49.300> build<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.630> triangle<00:03:50.200> tip

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
the shin and then build the triangle tip

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.410 
the shin and then build the triangle tip
heart<00:03:50.709> on<00:03:50.890> top<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.310> knee<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.730> didn't<00:03:52.239> want

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:52.420 
heart on top of the knee I didn't want

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.640 
heart on top of the knee I didn't want
there<00:03:52.540> to<00:03:52.570> be<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.780> break<00:03:53.080> when<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.290> bent<00:03:53.560> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
there to be a break when you bent the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.199 
there to be a break when you bent the
knee<00:03:53.800> so<00:03:54.070> I<00:03:54.130> wanted<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.489> sculpt<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.850> like<00:03:55.000> this

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
knee so I wanted to sculpt it like this

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.940 
knee so I wanted to sculpt it like this
and<00:03:55.480> I<00:03:55.690> was<00:03:56.050> pretty<00:03:56.260> pleased<00:03:56.530> with<00:03:56.620> how<00:03:56.769> that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
and I was pretty pleased with how that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.320 
and I was pretty pleased with how that
worked<00:03:57.160> out<00:03:57.310> I<00:03:57.340> wasn't<00:03:57.820> sure<00:03:57.940> if<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.150> was<00:03:58.209> gonna

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
worked out I wasn't sure if it was gonna

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.770 
worked out I wasn't sure if it was gonna
work<00:03:58.570> but<00:03:58.630> I<00:03:59.080> think<00:04:00.070> it<00:04:00.459> did<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.940> then<00:04:01.060> I<00:04:01.180> just

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
work but I think it did and then I just

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.449 
work but I think it did and then I just
sculpted<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.410> at<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.620> bottom<00:04:02.920> to<00:04:03.070> allow<00:04:03.160> for

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
sculpted it at the bottom to allow for

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.979 
sculpted it at the bottom to allow for
the<00:04:03.550> foot<00:04:03.730> to<00:04:03.760> move<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.800> there<00:04:05.800> you<00:04:05.860> have<00:04:06.070> it

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
the foot to move and there you have it

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.800 
the foot to move and there you have it
the<00:04:08.400> overall<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:10.150> bulk<00:04:10.360> of<00:04:10.480> this<00:04:10.630> guy

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
the overall the bulk of this guy

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.080 
the overall the bulk of this guy
obviously<00:04:10.989> was<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.500> sculpting<00:04:12.070> the<00:04:12.580> body<00:04:12.730> was

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
obviously was the sculpting the body was

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.550 
obviously was the sculpting the body was
pretty<00:04:13.300> much<00:04:13.450> good<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:13.930> way<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.140> was<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.500> know

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
pretty much good the way it was I know

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.949 
pretty much good the way it was I know
it's<00:04:14.739> not<00:04:14.830> technically<00:04:15.370> right<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
it's not technically right you know the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.530 
it's not technically right you know the
lines<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.530> stomach<00:04:17.919> and<00:04:18.070> whatnot<00:04:18.430> but<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
lines on the stomach and whatnot but it

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.370 
lines on the stomach and whatnot but it
was<00:04:19.989> more<00:04:20.650> than<00:04:20.830> good<00:04:21.010> enough<00:04:21.070> in<00:04:21.400> my<00:04:21.549> opinion

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
was more than good enough in my opinion

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
was more than good enough in my opinion
you<00:04:23.380> get<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.650> idea<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.010> it's<00:04:24.280> Nova

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
you get the idea that it's Nova

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.580 
you get the idea that it's Nova
and<00:04:25.490> uh<00:04:25.540> after<00:04:26.540> all<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.810> sculpting<00:04:27.259> was<00:04:27.290> done

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
and uh after all the sculpting was done

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.379 
and uh after all the sculpting was done
I<00:04:27.620> think<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.040> turned<00:04:28.190> out<00:04:28.310> pretty<00:04:28.460> well<00:04:28.610> the

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
I think it turned out pretty well the

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.870 
I think it turned out pretty well the
hands<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.290> sculpted<00:04:30.949> the<00:04:31.100> band<00:04:31.340> part<00:04:31.699> that

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
hands I just sculpted the band part that

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.760 
hands I just sculpted the band part that
went<00:04:32.030> around<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.389> hand<00:04:32.690> then<00:04:33.320> obviously<00:04:33.710> I

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
went around the hand then obviously I

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.340 
went around the hand then obviously I
put<00:04:34.009> the<00:04:34.130> disc<00:04:34.310> on<00:04:34.460> top<00:04:34.490> of<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:34.970> head<00:04:35.289> for<00:04:36.289> the

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
put the disc on top of the head for the

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.020 
put the disc on top of the head for the
back<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.889> did<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> star

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
back I did the star

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.249 
back I did the star
I<00:04:38.060> had<00:04:38.270> to<00:04:38.360> sculpt<00:04:38.630> each<00:04:38.750> one<00:04:38.870> of<00:04:38.960> those<00:04:39.050> pieces

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
I had to sculpt each one of those pieces

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.560 
I had to sculpt each one of those pieces
individually<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.370> then<00:04:40.580> reshape<00:04:41.150> them<00:04:41.389> and

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
individually and then reshape them and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.450 
individually and then reshape them and
cut<00:04:41.750> them<00:04:41.870> and<00:04:42.080> sand<00:04:42.350> them<00:04:42.500> but<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.190> turned<00:04:43.340> out

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
cut them and sand them but it turned out

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.100 
cut them and sand them but it turned out
pretty<00:04:43.520> good<00:04:43.850> it's<00:04:44.030> not<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.630> know<00:04:44.720> 100

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
pretty good it's not you know 100

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.870 
pretty good it's not you know 100
percent<00:04:45.410> perfect<00:04:45.620> but<00:04:46.009> it<00:04:46.220> is<00:04:46.250> hand<00:04:46.610> sculpted

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
percent perfect but it is hand sculpted

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.770 
percent perfect but it is hand sculpted
all<00:04:47.330> by<00:04:47.570> hand<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.910> give<00:04:49.910> me<00:04:50.000> a<00:04:50.060> little<00:04:50.240> slack<00:04:50.419> if

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
all by hand so give me a little slack if

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.749 
all by hand so give me a little slack if
you<00:04:50.870> notice<00:04:51.289> something<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:51.740> not<00:04:51.889> quite<00:04:52.310> the

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 
you notice something it's not quite the

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.100 
you notice something it's not quite the
way<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.000> should<00:04:53.030> be<00:04:53.210> but<00:04:53.720> I<00:04:53.750> think<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.990> turned

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
way it should be but I think it turned

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.249 
way it should be but I think it turned
out<00:04:54.259> pretty<00:04:54.440> close<00:04:55.990> what<00:04:56.990> else

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
out pretty close what else

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.050 
out pretty close what else
Oh<00:04:57.380> for<00:04:57.680> these<00:04:57.860> little<00:04:58.100> discs<00:04:58.520> in<00:04:58.699> order<00:04:58.970> to

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
Oh for these little discs in order to

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:00.310 
Oh for these little discs in order to
make<00:04:59.180> them<00:04:59.360> look<00:04:59.389> like<00:04:59.570> they're<00:04:59.810> lighting<00:05:00.110> up

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
make them look like they're lighting up

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.529 
make them look like they're lighting up
for<00:05:00.740> his<00:05:00.830> nova<00:05:01.639> ports<00:05:01.970> or<00:05:02.090> whatever<00:05:02.330> you<00:05:02.449> would

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
for his nova ports or whatever you would

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.650 
for his nova ports or whatever you would
call<00:05:02.600> those<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:04.150> painted<00:05:05.150> them<00:05:05.270> all<00:05:05.389> black

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
first get it into focus I painted them

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.360 
first get it into focus I painted them
all<00:05:08.449> black<00:05:08.750> and<00:05:09.470> then<00:05:09.680> on<00:05:09.889> top<00:05:10.070> of<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.310> I

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
all black and then on top of that I

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.950 
all black and then on top of that I
painted<00:05:10.760> everything<00:05:11.240> white<00:05:11.539> so<00:05:11.780> it<00:05:11.840> was<00:05:11.930> a

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
painted everything white so it was a

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.850 
painted everything white so it was a
nice<00:05:12.139> smooth<00:05:12.770> white<00:05:13.300> and<00:05:14.300> then<00:05:14.539> I<00:05:14.570> used<00:05:15.020> a<00:05:15.380> lot

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
nice smooth white and then I used a lot

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.610 
nice smooth white and then I used a lot
diluted<00:05:16.460> like<00:05:16.820> a<00:05:16.930> robin's<00:05:17.930> egg<00:05:18.020> blue<00:05:18.080> type<00:05:18.500> of

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
diluted like a robin's egg blue type of

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.350 
diluted like a robin's egg blue type of
color<00:05:18.800> and<00:05:19.070> just<00:05:19.580> went<00:05:19.729> around<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:20.060> edges

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
color and just went around the edges

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.110 
color and just went around the edges
with<00:05:20.539> that<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:21.080> I<00:05:21.770> kind<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.490> feathered<00:05:22.849> it<00:05:22.970> so

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
with that and I kind of feathered it so

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.820 
with that and I kind of feathered it so
it's<00:05:23.240> not<00:05:23.360> exactly<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.840> smooth<00:05:24.169> line<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.440> wanted

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
it's not exactly a smooth line I wanted

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.370 
it's not exactly a smooth line I wanted
to<00:05:25.039> look<00:05:25.220> like<00:05:25.430> like<00:05:25.910> um<00:05:26.180> kind<00:05:27.050> like<00:05:27.139> the<00:05:27.289> way

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
to look like like um kind like the way

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:28.629 
to look like like um kind like the way
the<00:05:27.500> Sun<00:05:27.740> looks<00:05:27.949> on<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.160> surface<00:05:28.310> away<00:05:28.550> it's

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
the Sun looks on the surface away it's

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:30.370 
the Sun looks on the surface away it's
like<00:05:28.669> molding<00:05:29.330> and<00:05:29.389> kind<00:05:29.660> of<00:05:29.750> moving<00:05:30.139> all<00:05:30.260> the

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
like molding and kind of moving all the

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.320 
like molding and kind of moving all the
time<00:05:30.410> so<00:05:31.370> hopefully<00:05:31.820> I<00:05:31.849> don't<00:05:32.060> know<00:05:32.120> if<00:05:32.240> it's

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
time so hopefully I don't know if it's

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.610 
time so hopefully I don't know if it's
actually<00:05:32.449> picking<00:05:32.780> up<00:05:32.960> in<00:05:33.110> the<00:05:33.199> camera<00:05:33.590> but

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
actually picking up in the camera but

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.900 
actually picking up in the camera but
you<00:05:33.860> can<00:05:34.010> see<00:05:34.190> that<00:05:34.310> the<00:05:34.460> lines<00:05:34.639> aren't

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
you can see that the lines aren't

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.450 
you can see that the lines aren't
completely<00:05:35.570> straight<00:05:36.560> I<00:05:36.590> know<00:05:36.770> it<00:05:36.949> sounds

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:37.460 
completely straight I know it sounds

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.279 
completely straight I know it sounds
like<00:05:37.580> I'm<00:05:37.849> just<00:05:38.090> painted<00:05:38.599> and<00:05:38.750> poorly<00:05:39.110> but

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
like I'm just painted and poorly but

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.689 
like I'm just painted and poorly but
it's<00:05:39.620> a<00:05:40.400> uniformly<00:05:41.830> not<00:05:42.830> uniform<00:05:43.430> if<00:05:43.550> that

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
it's a uniformly not uniform if that

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.670 
it's a uniformly not uniform if that
makes<00:05:43.880> any<00:05:44.030> sense<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:44.599> hopefully<00:05:45.289> you<00:05:45.560> guys

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
makes any sense so hopefully you guys

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.439 
makes any sense so hopefully you guys
get<00:05:46.039> what<00:05:46.130> I'm<00:05:46.220> saying<00:05:46.550> there<00:05:46.729> you<00:05:46.849> can<00:05:47.030> see<00:05:47.240> it

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
get what I'm saying there you can see it

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.350 
get what I'm saying there you can see it
I<00:05:47.930> don't<00:05:48.889> know<00:05:49.099> there<00:05:49.699> may<00:05:49.789> be<00:05:49.820> you<00:05:50.030> can<00:05:50.150> see<00:05:50.300> it

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
I don't know there may be you can see it

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.240 
I don't know there may be you can see it
even<00:05:50.510> though<00:05:50.599> it's<00:05:50.690> darker<00:05:52.180> it's<00:05:53.180> uneven<00:05:54.250> but

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
even though it's darker it's uneven but

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.070 
even though it's darker it's uneven but
it's<00:05:55.460> still<00:05:55.699> symmetrical<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.479> don't<00:05:56.900> know<00:05:56.960> how

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:57.080 
it's still symmetrical I don't know how

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.480 
it's still symmetrical I don't know how
to<00:05:57.139> say<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:57.470> without<00:05:57.680> making<00:05:57.889> it<00:05:58.130> sound<00:05:58.250> like<00:05:58.340> I

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
to say it without making it sound like I

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.939 
to say it without making it sound like I
just<00:05:58.669> screwed<00:05:58.940> up<00:05:59.030> and<00:05:59.409> I'm<00:06:00.409> trying<00:06:00.500> to<00:06:00.740> cover

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:00.949 
just screwed up and I'm trying to cover

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.189 
just screwed up and I'm trying to cover
it<00:06:01.159> but<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.550> did<00:06:01.820> it<00:06:01.909> on<00:06:02.030> purpose<00:06:02.060> I<00:06:02.479> promise<00:06:02.960> and

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
it but I did it on purpose I promise and

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.930 
it but I did it on purpose I promise and
hopefully<00:06:03.949> you<00:06:04.190> can<00:06:04.220> see<00:06:04.520> it<00:06:04.550> know<00:06:04.789> what<00:06:04.880> I'm

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
hopefully you can see it know what I'm

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.620 
hopefully you can see it know what I'm
talking<00:06:05.270> about

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
talking about

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.730 
talking about
anyway<00:06:05.900> I<00:06:05.930> wanted<00:06:06.199> to<00:06:06.260> look<00:06:06.380> like<00:06:06.530> it<00:06:06.650> was

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
anyway I wanted to look like it was

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.589 
anyway I wanted to look like it was
actually<00:06:06.979> lighting<00:06:07.280> up<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.520> did<00:06:07.909> that<00:06:08.120> and

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:08.599 
actually lighting up so I did that and

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.230 
actually lighting up so I did that and
then<00:06:08.840> I<00:06:08.900> used<00:06:09.560> a<00:06:09.830> gloss<00:06:10.310> paint<00:06:10.610> on<00:06:10.760> top<00:06:10.940> of<00:06:11.090> all

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
then I used a gloss paint on top of all

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.390 
then I used a gloss paint on top of all
the<00:06:11.360> white<00:06:11.539> and<00:06:11.780> the<00:06:11.900> blue<00:06:12.159> just<00:06:13.159> to<00:06:13.250> make<00:06:13.370> it

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
the white and the blue just to make it

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.159 
the white and the blue just to make it
look<00:06:13.610> really<00:06:13.849> shiny<00:06:14.090> and<00:06:14.240> I<00:06:14.360> put<00:06:14.570> gloss<00:06:14.750> on<00:06:14.990> top

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
look really shiny and I put gloss on top

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.860 
look really shiny and I put gloss on top
of<00:06:15.320> the<00:06:15.409> star<00:06:15.680> on<00:06:15.889> his<00:06:16.010> mask<00:06:16.220> as<00:06:16.460> well<00:06:16.750> just<00:06:17.750> to

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:17.870 
of the star on his mask as well just to

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:20.890 
of the star on his mask as well just to
tie<00:06:18.050> it<00:06:18.110> into<00:06:18.260> the<00:06:18.349> helmet<00:06:19.270> but<00:06:20.270> he<00:06:20.599> retains

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
tie it into the helmet but he retains

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.740 
tie it into the helmet but he retains
all<00:06:21.020> this<00:06:21.139> articulation<00:06:21.680> obviously<00:06:22.750> nothing

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
all this articulation obviously nothing

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.790 
all this articulation obviously nothing
was<00:06:23.930> hindered<00:06:24.289> there<00:06:24.530> at<00:06:24.830> all<00:06:25.090> so<00:06:26.620> there<00:06:27.620> it<00:06:27.710> is

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
was hindered there at all so there it is

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.980 
was hindered there at all so there it is
there's<00:06:28.039> my<00:06:28.190> Marvel<00:06:28.580> Legends<00:06:28.940> 6-inch<00:06:29.330> Nova<00:06:29.780> I

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
wish we had a figure this guy that

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.580 
wish we had a figure this guy that
wasn't<00:06:32.150> absolutely<00:06:32.659> horrible<00:06:33.199> like<00:06:33.349> the<00:06:33.469> one

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:33.590 
wasn't absolutely horrible like the one

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.430 
wasn't absolutely horrible like the one
we<00:06:33.680> got<00:06:33.860> in<00:06:34.130> the<00:06:34.310> nemesis<00:06:35.300> wave<00:06:35.510> hate<00:06:36.229> that
