motorcars long before there was any

environmental or fuel consumption issue

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.279 
environmental or fuel consumption issue
it<00:00:55.070> was<00:00:55.280> just<00:00:55.489> mobility<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.420> actually

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
it was just mobility and actually

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:58.900 
it was just mobility and actually
thought<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.769> know<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.280> waste<00:00:58.519> that's<00:00:58.730> going

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
thought you know the waste that's going

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.400 
thought you know the waste that's going
to<00:00:58.969> go<00:00:59.090> in<00:00:59.329> one<00:00:59.510> day<00:00:59.690> we're<00:00:59.870> not<00:00:59.899> going<00:01:00.289> to<00:01:00.350> be

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
to go in one day we're not going to be

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.849 
to go in one day we're not going to be
able<00:01:00.500> to<00:01:00.589> drive<00:01:00.769> our<00:01:01.010> cars<00:01:01.750> freely<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:02.960> that's

00:01:03.849 --> 00:01:03.859 
able to drive our cars freely and that's

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.380 
able to drive our cars freely and that's
something<00:01:04.100> I<00:01:04.339> started<00:01:04.760> thinking<00:01:05.030> about<00:01:05.120> quite

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
something I started thinking about quite

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.510 
something I started thinking about quite
seriously<00:01:05.870> and<00:01:06.380> why<00:01:06.590> did<00:01:07.010> you<00:01:07.040> think<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.400> was

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
seriously and why did you think it was

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.810 
seriously and why did you think it was
the<00:01:07.610> right<00:01:07.820> way<00:01:07.970> to<00:01:08.030> go<00:01:08.330> to<00:01:08.390> make<00:01:08.810> small<00:01:09.230> cars

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
the right way to go to make small cars

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.100 
the right way to go to make small cars

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
don't mind I streams quite flexible and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.010 
don't mind I streams quite flexible and
we've<00:01:55.340> really<00:01:56.210> invented<00:01:56.630> a<00:01:56.720> new<00:01:56.840> way<00:01:56.990> of

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
we've really invented a new way of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.690 
we've really invented a new way of
making<00:01:57.140> cars<00:01:57.620> because<00:01:57.920> we've<00:01:58.100> stamped<00:01:58.400> cars

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
making cars because we've stamped cars

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.910 
making cars because we've stamped cars
out<00:01:58.940> of<00:01:59.060> steel<00:01:59.330> since<00:01:59.660> 1911<00:02:00.170> I<00:02:00.530> think<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.800> was

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
out of steel since 1911 I think it was

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.550 
out of steel since 1911 I think it was
the<00:02:01.040> Model<00:02:01.340> T<00:02:01.370> Ford<00:02:01.820> we<00:02:02.510> went<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.840> right<00:02:03.230> back

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
the Model T Ford we went to right back

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.770 
can actually back it on to the point of
sales<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:34.970> there<00:02:35.120> isn't<00:02:35.330> any<00:02:35.480> distribution

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
sales so there isn't any distribution

sales so there isn't any distribution
cost<00:02:36.230> it's<00:02:36.890> only<00:02:37.160> about<00:02:37.450> 20%<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.600> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
cost it's only about 20% of the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.780

out of stamp steel why is it that you

00:04:56.799 --> 00:04:56.809 
thousand of one car you can make more

than two thousand with ice-cream except

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.609 
than two thousand with ice-cream except
then<00:04:59.029> you<00:04:59.149> start<00:04:59.419> having<00:04:59.629> multiples<00:05:00.319> of

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:00.619 
then you start having multiples of

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:03.039 
then you start having multiples of
plants<00:05:01.369> so<00:05:01.759> once<00:05:02.119> you<00:05:02.269> get<00:05:02.419> to<00:05:02.539> that<00:05:02.689> limit

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:03.049

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:04.449 
plants so once you get to that limit
you'd<00:05:03.229> have<00:05:03.439> to<00:05:03.559> double<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.039> tooling

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:04.459 
you'd have to double the tooling

00:05:04.459 --> 00:05:07.149 
you'd have to double the tooling
required<00:05:05.389> and<00:05:05.779> then<00:05:05.959> and<00:05:06.319> then<00:05:06.559> you're<00:05:06.709> edging

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
required and then and then you're edging

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:08.769

up<00:05:07.309> towards<00:05:07.759> the<00:05:07.879> capital<00:05:08.209> investment<00:05:08.689> that

up towards the capital investment that

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:10.149 
up towards the capital investment that
you<00:05:08.929> would<00:05:09.079> need<00:05:09.199> for<00:05:09.259> stamp<00:05:09.679> steel<00:05:09.889> do<00:05:10.099> you

00:05:10.149 --> 00:05:10.159 
you would need for stamp steel do you

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.039 
you would need for stamp steel do you
imagine<00:05:10.369> that<00:05:10.759> most<00:05:10.969> car<00:05:11.239> manufacturers<00:05:11.719> will

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:12.049 
imagine that most car manufacturers will

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:14.049 
imagine that most car manufacturers will
have<00:05:12.079> some<00:05:12.529> sort<00:05:12.739> of<00:05:12.799> ice<00:05:13.009> cream<00:05:13.309> based

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:14.059 
have some sort of ice cream based

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:19.359 
have some sort of ice cream based
vehicle<00:05:14.569> at<00:05:14.689> some<00:05:14.959> point<00:05:15.229> soon<00:05:15.559> I<00:05:16.059> hope<00:05:17.059> so<00:05:18.369> I

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:19.369 
vehicle at some point soon I hope so I

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
vehicle at some point soon I hope so I
really<00:05:19.909> I<00:05:20.119> really<00:05:20.149> hope<00:05:20.629> that<00:05:20.659> people<00:05:22.119> do<00:05:23.119> pick

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
really I really hope that people do pick

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:26.069 
really I really hope that people do pick

up ice cream even if it's finish and
