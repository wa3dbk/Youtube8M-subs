afraid and that's that's why I enjoyed
it<00:01:56.220> so<00:01:56.370> much

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
it so much

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.550 
it so much
quite<00:01:58.140> fast<00:01:58.440> I<00:01:58.770> saw<00:01:59.310> results<00:02:00.290> but<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.320> think

quite fast I saw results but I think

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.100 
quite fast I saw results but I think
that's<00:02:01.710> mainly<00:02:02.010> due<00:02:02.160> to<00:02:02.630> my<00:02:03.630> sporting

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that's mainly due to my sporting

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.870 
that's mainly due to my sporting
background<00:02:04.320> rather<00:02:05.040> than<00:02:05.220> I<00:02:05.460> knew<00:02:05.610> what<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.760> was

stone<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:16.709> I've<00:02:16.800> tightened<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> bit<00:02:17.550> nicer<00:02:17.730> than

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
stone so I've tightened a bit nicer than

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.880 
stone so I've tightened a bit nicer than
I<00:02:18.060> am<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.560> was<00:02:19.770> really<00:02:20.190> really<00:02:20.400> lean

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
I am now and I was really really lean

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.070 
I am now and I was really really lean
but<00:02:22.890> for<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.850> comp<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.330> made<00:02:24.540> many<00:02:24.840> many

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
but for that comp I made many many

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:32.870 
but for that comp I made many many
mistakes<00:02:28.250> terribly<00:02:29.250> mistakes<00:02:29.670> I<00:02:31.700> mean<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.790> was

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
mistakes terribly mistakes I mean I was

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.790 
mistakes terribly mistakes I mean I was
clean<00:02:33.150> weights<00:02:33.450> about<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.050> didn't<00:02:34.590> know<00:02:34.650> wise

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
clean weights about I didn't know wise

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:51.960 
clean weights about I didn't know wise
do

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.470 

there<00:02:52.970> isn't<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.540> quick<00:02:54.530> fix<00:02:54.970> what<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.150> is<00:02:56.300> is

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
there isn't a quick fix what there is is

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.309 
there isn't a quick fix what there is is
a<00:02:56.660> journey<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:58.280> sort<00:02:58.610> of<00:02:59.319> physiological

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
a journey to sort of physiological

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.100 
a journey to sort of physiological
self-awareness<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.459> it<00:03:02.239> will<00:03:02.480> take<00:03:02.720> time

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
self-awareness and it will take time

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.780 
self-awareness and it will take time
possibly<00:03:04.599> just<00:03:05.830> trying<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:06.920> get<00:03:06.980> to<00:03:07.099> grips<00:03:07.340> of

out<00:03:25.160> things<00:03:25.610> learning<00:03:26.000> things<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.069> then

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
out things learning things and then

out things learning things and then

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
trying them out on my body to see if

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.570 
trying them out on my body to see if
they<00:03:30.319> actually<00:03:30.440> work<00:03:30.650> I'm<00:03:30.890> watching<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.459> way

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
they actually work I'm watching the way

they actually work I'm watching the way
my<00:03:31.760> body<00:03:31.940> can<00:03:32.269> respond<00:03:32.780> to<00:03:33.110> things<00:03:33.650> I've<00:03:33.860> tried

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
my body can respond to things I've tried

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.830 
my body can respond to things I've tried
but<00:03:34.700> also<00:03:34.850> with<00:03:35.420> an<00:03:36.110> artistic<00:03:36.470> goal<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.099> mind

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
but also with an artistic goal in mind

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.670 
but also with an artistic goal in mind
so<00:03:38.840> I<00:03:39.140> want<00:03:39.440> to<00:03:39.620> try<00:03:39.890> and<00:03:40.150> look<00:03:41.150> as<00:03:41.410> good<00:03:42.410> as

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
so I want to try and look as good as

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.570 
so I want to try and look as good as
symmetrical<00:03:43.370> as<00:03:44.470> defined<00:03:45.470> as<00:03:45.709> healthy<00:03:46.250> as<00:03:46.430> I

symmetrical as defined as healthy as I

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.270 
symmetrical as defined as healthy as I
can<00:03:48.069> that<00:03:49.069> use<00:03:49.280> science<00:03:49.819> and<00:03:50.120> my<00:03:50.269> knowledge<00:03:50.510> to

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
can that use science and my knowledge to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.210 
can that use science and my knowledge to
sort<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.340> paint<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.670> picture<00:03:52.730> let's<00:03:53.720> go<00:03:54.220> you

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
sort of paint that picture let's go you

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.910 
sort of paint that picture let's go you
have<00:03:55.340> a<00:03:55.370> passion<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.820> learn

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
have a passion to learn

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.380 
have a passion to learn
you've<00:03:57.920> gone<00:03:58.130> line<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.730> look<00:03:58.910> up<00:03:59.090> some

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
you've gone line you look up some

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.060 
you've gone line you look up some
studies<00:03:59.810> you<00:04:00.079> read<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.470> basics<00:04:00.890> on

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
studies you read the basics on

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.860 
studies you read the basics on
physiology<00:04:01.910> you<00:04:02.390> look<00:04:02.540> at<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:02.750> energy

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
physiology you look at the energy

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.890 
physiology you look at the energy
systems<00:04:03.530> and<00:04:03.859> then<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.790> go<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.329> the<00:04:05.510> gym<00:04:05.720> you

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
systems and then you go to the gym you

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.569 
systems and then you go to the gym you
try<00:04:06.109> a<00:04:06.140> few<00:04:06.440> things<00:04:06.500> out<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.160> see<00:04:07.370> how<00:04:07.519> you

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
try a few things out you see how you

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.590 
try a few things out you see how you
feel<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.900> it's<00:04:09.230> just<00:04:09.980> slowly<00:04:10.549> learning<00:04:10.940> for

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
feel and it's just slowly learning for

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.449 
feel and it's just slowly learning for
yourself<00:04:12.079> instead<00:04:12.380> of<00:04:12.709> relying<00:04:12.980> on<00:04:13.220> someone

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
yourself instead of relying on someone

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.220 
yourself instead of relying on someone
else<00:04:13.700> to<00:04:13.850> prescribe<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.510> something<00:04:14.750> that<00:04:15.079> you

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
else to prescribe you something that you

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.150 
else to prescribe you something that you
stick<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:16.570> every<00:04:17.570> day<00:04:17.840> it<00:04:18.530> works<00:04:18.680> better<00:04:19.010> and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
stick to every day it works better and

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.300 
stick to every day it works better and
better<00:04:19.419> to<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.539> point<00:04:20.750> now<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.200> where<00:04:22.010> I<00:04:22.039> am

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
better to the point now and where I am

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:28.180 
better to the point now and where I am
so<00:04:22.610> confident<00:04:23.300> with<00:04:24.020> what<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.500> do<00:04:26.919> five<00:04:27.919> years

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
so confident with what I do five years

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.990 
so confident with what I do five years
ago<00:04:28.539> improving<00:04:29.539> was<00:04:29.660> hard<00:04:29.950> harder<00:04:30.950> four<00:04:31.789> years

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
ago improving was hard harder four years

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.659 
ago improving was hard harder four years
ago<00:04:32.300> became<00:04:33.110> easier<00:04:33.590> three<00:04:33.830> years<00:04:34.010> easier<00:04:34.400> now

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
ago became easier three years easier now

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.960 
ago became easier three years easier now
I<00:04:34.970> can<00:04:35.479> make<00:04:35.600> a<00:04:35.660> change<00:04:36.020> in<00:04:36.200> eight<00:04:36.320> weeks<00:04:36.530> and

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
I can make a change in eight weeks and

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.480 
I can make a change in eight weeks and
without<00:04:37.970> having<00:04:38.180> to<00:04:38.479> try<00:04:38.750> that<00:04:39.289> hard<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.710> so

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
without having to try that hard and so

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.190 
without having to try that hard and so
what<00:04:40.669> I<00:04:40.700> found<00:04:41.120> is<00:04:41.360> the<00:04:41.539> more<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.840> learn<00:04:42.169> about

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
what I found is the more I learn about

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.500 
what I found is the more I learn about
myself<00:04:42.680> the<00:04:43.310> easier<00:04:43.729> it<00:04:43.880> gets<00:04:44.030> and<00:04:44.479> the

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
myself the easier it gets and the

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.510 
myself the easier it gets and the
quicker<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.080> results<00:04:45.440> become<00:04:45.740> and<00:04:46.010> that's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
quicker the results become and that's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.060 
quicker the results become and that's
why<00:04:46.820> it's<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:47.780> gift<00:04:48.050> or<00:04:48.289> not<00:04:48.320> gift<00:04:48.680> but<00:04:48.889> this<00:04:48.950> is

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
why it's a gift or not gift but this is
