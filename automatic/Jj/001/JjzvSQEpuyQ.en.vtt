00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.209 

took<00:00:56.610> two<00:00:57.149> balloons<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.230> same<00:00:58.410> color<00:00:58.710> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
this and I cut a little spout off of it

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.300 
this and I cut a little spout off of it
and<00:01:04.220> then<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.150> wrapped<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.720> over<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.310> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and then I just wrapped it over it so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.109 
and then I just wrapped it over it so
you<00:01:08.369> can<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.060> oh<00:01:10.580> it's<00:01:11.580> wrapped<00:01:11.939> around

you can see it's oh it's wrapped around

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.740 
you can see it's oh it's wrapped around
and<00:01:12.920> then<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.369> one<00:01:14.430> all<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.720> have

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
and then this one all of these have

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.850 
and then this one all of these have
probably<00:01:16.590> six<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.100> seven<00:01:17.400> layers<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
probably six or seven layers and you

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.999 
probably six or seven layers and you
just<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.310> mean<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.939> gives<00:01:21.180> it<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.360> good<00:01:21.570> grip<00:01:22.009> it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
about eight bucks to make I have lentil

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.859 
about eight bucks to make I have lentil
beans<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.000> use<00:01:51.030> something<00:01:51.450> else<00:01:51.659> that

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
beans if you use something else that

might cost a little more a little less

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.899 
might cost a little more a little less
doesn't<00:01:54.030> really<00:01:54.180> matter<00:01:54.590> okay<00:01:55.590> um<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.430> anyways

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
doesn't really matter okay um so anyways

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.950 
doesn't really matter okay um so anyways
the<00:01:57.240> first<00:01:57.689> step<00:01:57.960> in<00:01:58.229> juggling<00:01:59.780> start<00:02:00.780> with

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the first step in juggling start with

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.010 
the first step in juggling start with
one<00:02:02.030> so<00:02:03.030> what<00:02:03.799> juggling<00:02:04.799> basically<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.520> is

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
one so what juggling basically is is

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.180 
one so what juggling basically is is
throwing<00:02:07.020> three<00:02:07.649> balls<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.580> same

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
throwing three balls on the same

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.190 
throwing three balls on the same
every<00:02:10.180> time<00:02:10.620> sort<00:02:11.620> of<00:02:11.710> like<00:02:11.800> this<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:13.540> it's

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
every time sort of like this so it's

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.990 
every time sort of like this so it's
important<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.680> start<00:02:14.950> with<00:02:15.160> one<00:02:15.430> ball<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.880> that

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
important to start with one ball so that

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.630 
important to start with one ball so that
you<00:02:16.090> can<00:02:16.270> get<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.570> path<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.860> same<00:02:18.100> every

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
you can get that path the same every
