00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
right here on the pommel and I aren't

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.229 
right here on the pommel and I aren't
that<00:03:34.450> comfortable<00:03:35.549> for<00:03:36.549> someone<00:03:36.820> using<00:03:37.060> bare

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:40.359 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.920 

I've<00:03:41.230> got<00:03:41.470> some<00:03:41.680> footage<00:03:41.950> I<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.570> put<00:03:46.780> into

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
I've got some footage I have to put into

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.340 
I've got some footage I have to put into
the<00:03:47.109> sword<00:03:47.410> smacking<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.519> bench<00:03:49.269> outside

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.080 

and<00:03:53.350> it<00:03:53.740> holds<00:03:53.920> up<00:03:54.130> very<00:03:54.460> well<00:03:54.520> it<00:03:54.850> doesn't

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
and it holds up very well it doesn't

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.830 
and it holds up very well it doesn't
have<00:03:55.180> any<00:03:55.330> problems<00:03:56.160> it's<00:03:57.160> very<00:03:57.190> sturdy<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.300> I

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
have any problems it's very sturdy and I

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.210 
have any problems it's very sturdy and I
think<00:03:59.050> all<00:03:59.200> in<00:03:59.320> all<00:03:59.410> if<00:03:59.590> you<00:03:59.650> can<00:03:59.830> solve<00:04:00.040> these

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
think all in all if you can solve these

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.920 
think all in all if you can solve these
problems<00:04:00.700> with<00:04:00.820> the<00:04:00.910> pommel<00:04:01.360> maybe<00:04:01.570> put<00:04:01.810> some

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
problems with the pommel maybe put some

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.080 
problems with the pommel maybe put some
extra<00:04:02.050> weight<00:04:02.440> right<00:04:02.680> here<00:04:02.710> this<00:04:03.550> is<00:04:03.670> a<00:04:03.700> really

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
extra weight right here this is a really

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.420 
extra weight right here this is a really
really<00:04:04.300> good<00:04:04.540> sword<00:04:04.870> for<00:04:05.800> practice<00:04:06.310> and

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
really good sword for practice and

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.610 
really good sword for practice and

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
beginners I think some of you that

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.020 
beginners I think some of you that
already<00:04:08.800> have<00:04:09.310> well<00:04:10.300> constructed<00:04:10.930> wasters

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
already have well constructed wasters

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.220 
already have well constructed wasters
are<00:04:13.030> probably<00:04:13.420> going<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.810> like<00:04:13.960> what<00:04:14.140> you

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
are probably going to like what you

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.920 
are probably going to like what you
already<00:04:14.380> have<00:04:14.650> better
