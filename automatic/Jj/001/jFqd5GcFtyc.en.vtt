00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.589
 Bringing you guys another video. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.719
 I'm going to teach you today how to give 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.599
 a turbinate in your character or 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.320
 give an improvement in the pf amp that the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.880
 faction points on xp or its 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.770
 coins beauty 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.260
 So before I show you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.910
 everything related to your combat letter 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.750
 that the combat letter is already going 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.519
 take a look 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.619
 I'll still show you here a 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.929
 fight fast just for you while the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.219
 points we will win this fight and 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.870
 I'll give it a try later. 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.239
 character struggles do not have cuts to 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.879
 people, I hope you do not 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.570
 but the others do not have the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.649
 cuts nests just to stay more dynamic 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.050
 How much faster is the business here? 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 warm up, I will not cut the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.320
 end up even without car beauty because 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.539
 otherwise it will get too long video for 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.710
 explaining a simple thing then it does not have 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.320
 too much sense 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.030
 would be like the clergy who made a video of 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.660
 all fatalities show all 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.670
 fights 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.240
 makes some sense or does in other 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 Incarnations I will not be back now, you 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.320
 saw that we ended with the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:25.470
 brutality until then great 424 1970 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.810
 Teaching beauty what we will do 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:34.680
 now let's main problem good to 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:36.900
 People are going to get here. 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.009
 combat and will squeeze and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.840
 push triangle 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.070
 You will enter to edit the card. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.799
 also you can not see everyone has a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.950
 business down there and one condition 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.909
 so come on first we'll give it to you 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:54.260
 let's shake the background 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:59.510
 the chain has one that is 200 km short 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.020
 here maybe not 200 pf per vittorio 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.510
 beauty 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.500
 we see icon and look for another one that 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:15.660
 gave even a business xp currency the pf that 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:17.940
 You want to win it also gives a 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.489

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.790
 champion in 50 or win victory 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.370
 because it was simpler than his mistake to 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.459
 fucking do not affect 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.920

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.860
 again with a brutality for you 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.360
 that you do not have to see the 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.739
 noticeable difference is the difference 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.620
 doing more or less a good match 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:49.220
 similar to that will not have a way 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:54.560
 It's not going to have to be a beauty here. 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:58.700
 and here is the border that tackles has one of 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.700
 75 mp 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:10.140
 You see here 200 plus 50 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.820
 plus 75 to 325 house bonus only 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.840

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:19.760

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:28.530
 Let's do the same fight on the campuses. 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:32.010
 the 10 created the average difficulty is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.320
 spouting everything was the same then at the end 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.700

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.960

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.130
 front 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:56.190
 You see the difference there separated the 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:04:02.220
 difference there from the other and 424 the match 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:05.010

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.860

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:11.700
