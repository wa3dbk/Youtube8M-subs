00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and it's about science experiments that

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.830 
and it's about science experiments that
are<00:00:06.960> totally<00:00:07.560> gross<00:00:07.770> so<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:09.000> has<00:00:09.240> these

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
gross cards in the lab cards and lap car

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.930 
gross cards in the lab cards and lap car
three<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:16.949> at<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.130> very<00:00:17.310> end<00:00:17.369> -<00:00:17.670> that's<00:00:17.760> why

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.939 
question rods so and well you're
supposed<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> just<00:00:23.730> line<00:00:24.060> up<00:00:24.560> and<00:00:25.560> put<00:00:25.859> it

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
supposed to just line up and put it

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.740 
supposed to just line up and put it
right<00:00:26.010> there<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> then<00:00:26.670> stretch<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.660> then

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
right there and then stretch and then

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.080 
right there and then stretch and then
stretch<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.289> cut<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.619> frankly<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.760> not

stretch it out cut it frankly and not

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.330 
stretch it out cut it frankly and not
working<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:31.560> not<00:00:31.650> gonna<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.949> using<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
working so we're not gonna be using this

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.100 
working so we're not gonna be using this
time<00:00:32.579> tonight<00:00:32.940> it's<00:00:33.180> probably<00:00:33.540> gonna<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
time tonight it's probably gonna have to

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
time tonight it's probably gonna have to
heat<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.320> so<00:00:34.829> we'll<00:00:35.670> let<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.820> heat<00:00:36.090> up<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.420> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
heat up so we'll let it heat up for a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.319 
heat up so we'll let it heat up for a
few<00:00:36.660> days<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.370> we'll<00:00:38.370> try<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.760> get<00:00:39.000> anything

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
few days and we'll try to get anything

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
few days and we'll try to get anything
you<00:00:39.719> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> works<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.829> our

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
you can see if it works this is our

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.240 
you can see if it works this is our
first<00:00:41.340> time<00:00:41.579> playing<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.920> still<00:00:43.920> really

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
then if you get to a lab space then you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.219 
then if you get to a lab space then you
then<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:34.920> win<00:01:35.280> do<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> lab<00:01:36.000> card<00:01:36.299> which<00:01:36.930> has<00:01:37.110> an

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
then you win do a lab card which has an

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.590 
then you win do a lab card which has an
experiment<00:01:37.740> on<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.400> then<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.210> win<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
play now so there are three questions on

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.350 
play now so there are three questions on
these<00:01:46.049> professor<00:01:46.619> cards<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:48.030> youngest

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
these professor cards and the youngest

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.929 
these professor cards and the youngest
person<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> table<00:01:48.990> chooses<00:01:49.979> if<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
person at the table chooses if you

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.370 
person at the table chooses if you
answer<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> first<00:01:51.570> question<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:52.049> second

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
answer the first question the second

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.740 
answer the first question the second
question<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.890> third<00:01:53.100> question<00:01:53.420> so<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
question are the third question so the
