00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.000
 hello to all and all these young people 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.350
 find today for a new 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.969
 breakfast I hope you all 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.619
 very well that I did not miss you too much 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.330
 at the level of breakfast I apologize 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.410
 I have been asked a lot 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.660
 week with all exams 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.150
 I spent at least five six years I 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.800
 the account even more I was overwhelmed I 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.029
 I could not do more than 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 videos that I had already planned 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.180
 since last week 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.680
 So today we come back I 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.390
 we put a strong a little special you 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.800
 will understand with the video of this after 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.210
 noon I just had a little bit 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.650
 lazy to change background but saw that 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.090
 this video comes out before the one I have 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.769
 turned still before but there you do not 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.430
 do not understand an end I say a lot of 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:44.409
 gibberish 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.299
 but here is today for a new 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:48.489
 breakfast so I chose a booster 

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:50.019
 that I bought at crossroads no kill and 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.470
 in blister it cost me a pretty 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:52.120
 blind 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.650
 so I'd like him to give us 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.000
 a good pick that's what's going 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.839
 look like a booster in blister of 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.059
 shock premiums 

00:00:55.839 --> 00:00:59.680
 here is the doubs also if you do not 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.510
 do not know so this is the alarm clock 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.369
 of old rivals a sentence that 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.960
 currently in the news we only see 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:06.580
 it's all over the shock premium 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.229
 in any case I hope we will be spoiled 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.450
 and I'll be right back with us 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.100
 booster out of its history and that's it 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.900
 the booster released and is no longer in his 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.880
 little blister so I hope we're going 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.400
 have a good pick you show them 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.530
 closer up so the pokemon mega train station 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.540

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.970
 supposed to give a piece free eric we're going 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.350
 see if today he respects that the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.310
 back of a booster do not hesitate to do 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.050

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.090
 description and as for me I move on to 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.930
