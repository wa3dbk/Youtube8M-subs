 Among them, I was on an exciting bike on a new course, and I will do anything here at any time 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.240
 I do not know if it will 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.930
 cf そ う Let's change every subject from this time 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.970
 The more I see It'll controller will be passed to everyone that it is it 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:25.320
 Even if you can collect the flag evenly 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:31.350
 First of all, I would like to ask for a top batter on Sakiya for the first time in a long time 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:33.500
 Only for the time being re p Lord of the aircraft I've found seems I boil absolute and affixed to Uragireru

 I want you to go to the top here , leave it to me 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:47.680
 It was not at all Next me I'm notice of the sudden rise in difficulty 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:53.320
 It is still easy to win if this is against the words 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.650
 And the goal is the say that the bottom may romp surprisingly be changed three years second base Tsugisayu 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.370
 Absent 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.400
 Today 's flag Dourou has every first run today 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.890
 The flag is attached 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:06.890
 I'm going to win with this or if it's a continuous loss here I'm worried about the point I will never do such a thing 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.540
 That 's why let's go ahead with this condition 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.540
 Cut from here to the next stage 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:20.400
