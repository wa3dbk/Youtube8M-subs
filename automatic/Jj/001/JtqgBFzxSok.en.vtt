were<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:23.160> few<00:00:23.550> people<00:00:24.029> they<00:00:24.810> complained<00:00:25.320> about

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
were a few people they complained about

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.900 
were a few people they complained about
the<00:00:27.150> sharpness<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> image<00:00:28.500> but<00:00:29.279> they<00:00:29.609> have

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the sharpness of the image but they have

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.979 
the sharpness of the image but they have
to<00:00:30.060> realize<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.869> even<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:33.140> f-16<00:00:34.140> or

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
to realize that even at f-16 or

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.900 
to realize that even at f-16 or
f11<00:00:36.989> your<00:00:37.230> depth<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.649> field<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.190> only<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.610> very

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
f11 your depth of field is only a very

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
f11 your depth of field is only a very
few<00:00:39.149> millimeters<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:40.530> you're<00:00:41.129> doing

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
few millimeters in that one you're doing

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.610 
few millimeters in that one you're doing
that<00:00:41.640> handheld<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:42.750> especially<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.590> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
that handheld and especially it was a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.680 
that handheld and especially it was a
windy<00:00:44.070> day<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.640> today<00:00:44.850> was<00:00:45.059> even<00:00:45.329> windier

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
windy day and today was even windier

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.760 
windy day and today was even windier
then<00:00:46.590> there's<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.730> much<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.840> depth<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.530> field

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
then there's not much in depth of field

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.400 
then there's not much in depth of field
when<00:00:50.280> you're<00:00:50.370> doing<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.760> macro<00:00:51.180> work<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
when you're doing a macro work it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
when you're doing a macro work it
operates<00:00:52.860> obviously<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> regular<00:00:53.730> lens

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
operates obviously like a regular lens

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.209 
operates obviously like a regular lens
so<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.660> you're<00:00:54.750> taking<00:00:55.079> shots<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.860> this

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so when you're taking shots like this

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.900 
so when you're taking shots like this
but<00:00:57.739> for<00:00:58.739> those<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.370> thought<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
but for those of you that thought the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.849 
but for those of you that thought the
shots<00:01:00.180> were<00:01:00.420> out<00:01:00.480> of<00:01:00.510> focus<00:01:00.840> or<00:01:01.140> not<00:01:01.199> it's<00:01:01.649> just

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
shots were out of focus or not it's just

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
shots were out of focus or not it's just
that<00:01:02.070> we<00:01:02.280> have<00:01:02.489> an<00:01:02.699> extremely<00:01:03.180> narrow<00:01:03.899> depth

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
that we have an extremely narrow depth

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.730 
that we have an extremely narrow depth
of<00:01:04.530> field<00:01:04.799> when<00:01:05.700> taking<00:01:06.180> macro<00:01:06.630> shots<00:01:06.990> even<00:01:07.290> at

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
of field when taking macro shots even at

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.880 
of field when taking macro shots even at
a<00:01:07.799> very<00:01:08.010> high<00:01:08.220> f-stop<00:01:09.020> now<00:01:10.020> all<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.409> these<00:01:10.560> were

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
a very high f-stop now all of these were

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.249 
a very high f-stop now all of these were
read<00:01:11.130> taken<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.939> ISO<00:01:12.720> 800<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.760> were

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
read taken at ISO 800 and they were

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.100 
read taken at ISO 800 and they were
sampled<00:01:16.430> around<00:01:17.570> some<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.600> them<00:01:18.810> are<00:01:18.869> very

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
sampled around some of them are very

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.660 
sampled around some of them are very
boring<00:01:19.409> shots<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.310> haven't<00:01:20.580> been

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
boring shots but they haven't been

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.609 
boring shots but they haven't been
edited<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.540> haven't<00:01:21.810> been<00:01:21.930> cropped<00:01:22.320> yet

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
edited or they haven't been cropped yet

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
edited or they haven't been cropped yet
so<00:01:22.830> I<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:22.920> thought<00:01:23.220> I'd<00:01:23.400> leave<00:01:23.610> them<00:01:23.850> as<00:01:24.210> shot

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
so I just thought I'd leave them as shot

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.830 
so I just thought I'd leave them as shot
and<00:01:25.970> they<00:01:26.970> were<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:28.310> sample<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> 802<00:01:30.420> dpi

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and they were a sample that the 802 dpi

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.020 
and they were a sample that the 802 dpi
I<00:01:30.930> could<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.530> gone<00:01:31.710> 1200<00:01:32.520> but<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:32.939> have

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I could have gone 1200 but it would have

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.749 
I could have gone 1200 but it would have
a<00:01:33.320> even<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.350> 16<00:01:34.680> gig<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.159> ram<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.579> would<00:01:35.670> have

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
a even a 16 gig of ram it would have

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.390 
a even a 16 gig of ram it would have
taken<00:01:35.970> me<00:01:36.240> a<00:01:36.270> half<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> day<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
taken me a half the day to do it so I

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.880 
taken me a half the day to do it so I
had<00:01:39.240> more<00:01:39.600> than<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> few<00:01:39.990> people<00:01:40.200> chirp<00:01:40.680> up

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
had more than a few people chirp up

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.380 
had more than a few people chirp up
yesterday<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.670> like<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.240> know<00:01:42.299> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
yesterday it's like well you know you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
yesterday it's like well you know you
just<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.810> d750<00:01:43.350> what's<00:01:43.950> wrong<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
just got the d750 what's wrong with you

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.219 
just got the d750 what's wrong with you
you<00:01:44.610> should<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.850> taken<00:01:45.299> some<00:01:45.540> test<00:01:45.930> shots

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
you should have taken some test shots

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.670 
you should have taken some test shots
with<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:48.470> nikon<00:01:50.030> d750<00:01:51.030> instead<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> d700

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
with the nikon d750 instead of the d700

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.760 
with the nikon d750 instead of the d700
so<00:01:52.909> anyway<00:01:53.909> here<00:01:54.240> are<00:01:54.360> their<00:01:54.509> shots<00:01:54.840> today<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so anyway here are their shots today and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.630 
so anyway here are their shots today and
I'll<00:01:56.610> have<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.560> download<00:01:58.560> link<00:01:58.590> so<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.490> you

below like I said none of these you know
compositionally<00:02:03.899> these<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.290> boring<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.250> you

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
compositionally these are boring but you

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.889 
compositionally these are boring but you
know<00:02:05.850> they<00:02:05.969> haven't<00:02:06.119> been<00:02:06.240> edited<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.750> they

know they haven't been edited and they

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:07.460 
know they haven't been edited and they
haven't<00:02:07.079> been

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470

propped<00:02:07.680> yet<00:02:07.980> so<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:09.350> I<00:02:10.350> said<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.979> could

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
propped yet so and I said they could

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.160 
propped yet so and I said they could
have<00:02:11.250> been<00:02:11.370> sharper<00:02:11.880> because<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.570> only<00:02:12.720> sample

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
have been sharper because I only sample

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.970 
have been sharper because I only sample
these<00:02:13.290> at<00:02:13.500> 800<00:02:13.860> dpi<00:02:14.900> but<00:02:15.900> nevertheless<00:02:16.500> these

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
these at 800 dpi but nevertheless these

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.440 
these at 800 dpi but nevertheless these
were<00:02:17.160> all<00:02:17.250> shot<00:02:17.580> with<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.970> nikon<00:02:19.010> d750<00:02:20.450> you'll

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
which you have extremely narrowed up the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.130 
which you have extremely narrowed up the
field<00:03:35.580> and<00:03:36.030> only<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.480> I'm<00:03:36.750> doing<00:03:36.870> it

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
field and only that I'm doing it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.050 
field and only that I'm doing it
handheld<00:03:37.620> and<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.580> it's<00:03:38.880> also

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
handheld and then like that it's also

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.680 
handheld and then like that it's also
very<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.959> they<00:03:40.170> have<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.530> capture<00:03:41.010> the

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
very when they have to capture the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.190 
very when they have to capture the
flowers<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:42.900> whatnot<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.590> be<00:03:44.900> between<00:03:45.900> the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
flowers and whatnot to be between the

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.500 
flowers and whatnot to be between the
strong<00:03:46.650> gusts<00:03:47.220> of<00:03:47.370> when<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.940> lot<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.150> these<00:03:48.330> are

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
strong gusts of when a lot of these are

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.430 
strong gusts of when a lot of these are
vertical<00:03:48.810> shots<00:03:49.170> too<00:03:49.440> so<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:54.080> I<00:03:55.080> thought<00:03:55.320> I'd

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
vertical shots too so and I thought I'd

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.199 
vertical shots too so and I thought I'd
actually<00:03:55.620> take<00:03:56.070> this<00:03:56.400> shot<00:03:56.760> as<00:03:57.030> an

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
actually take this shot as an

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.890 
actually take this shot as an
introduction<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:58.610> my<00:03:59.610> next<00:03:59.850> video<00:04:00.180> which<00:04:00.690> I'm

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
introduction to my next video which I'm

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.990 
introduction to my next video which I'm
going<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.170> call<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.160> douchbag

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
going to call what is a douchbag

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.600 
going to call what is a douchbag
photography<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.860> kind<00:04:05.160> of<00:04:05.190> makes<00:04:05.430> a

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
photography and this kind of makes a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.830 
photography and this kind of makes a
perfect<00:04:08.610> example<00:04:08.760> of<00:04:09.360> what<00:04:09.739> my<00:04:10.739> next<00:04:11.070> video<00:04:11.370> is

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
perfect example of what my next video is

the advantages of course to the nikon
d750<00:04:28.129> is<00:04:28.610> the<00:04:28.879> flip<00:04:29.330> out<00:04:29.539> to<00:04:29.840> rear<00:04:30.050> LCD<00:04:30.319> screen

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
d750 is the flip out to rear LCD screen

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.089 
d750 is the flip out to rear LCD screen
so<00:04:31.150> instead<00:04:32.150> of<00:04:32.210> actually<00:04:33.050> a<00:04:33.080> squatting<00:04:33.979> in

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
so instead of actually a squatting in

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.399 
so instead of actually a squatting in
the<00:04:34.220> dirt<00:04:34.430> like<00:04:34.639> you're<00:04:34.879> about<00:04:35.030> to<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:36.259> know

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
the dirt like you're about to you know

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:40.779 
the dirt like you're about to you know
drop<00:04:36.710> a<00:04:36.770> pile<00:04:37.129> you<00:04:37.520> can<00:04:37.569> flip<00:04:38.569> out<00:04:38.810> the<00:04:39.789> screen

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:40.789 
drop a pile you can flip out the screen

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.800 
drop a pile you can flip out the screen
on<00:04:41.120> your<00:04:41.330> d750<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.379> take<00:04:42.530> some<00:04:42.740> macro<00:04:43.159> shots

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
on your d750 and take some macro shots

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.869 
on your d750 and take some macro shots
with<00:04:44.810> it<00:04:45.020> this<00:04:45.830> is<00:04:45.889> a<00:04:46.069> tiny<00:04:46.400> little<00:04:46.639> flower

this tiny little flower I didn't

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:02.070 
this tiny little flower I didn't
actually<00:05:00.409> see<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:00.919> when<00:05:01.069> I<00:05:01.130> took<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.460> shot

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
actually see that when I took the shot

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.990 
actually see that when I took the shot
and<00:05:03.080> I<00:05:03.199> said<00:05:03.470> these<00:05:03.680> could<00:05:04.009> have<00:05:04.280> been<00:05:04.340> sharper

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000

and I said these could have been sharper
I<00:05:05.210> could<00:05:05.509> sample<00:05:06.020> these<00:05:06.380> at<00:05:06.710> 1200<00:05:07.310> dpi<00:05:07.669> so<00:05:08.270> if

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
I could sample these at 1200 dpi so if

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.600 
I could sample these at 1200 dpi so if
you're<00:05:09.080> going<00:05:09.229> to<00:05:09.289> complain<00:05:09.620> about<00:05:09.919> sharpness

hanging<00:06:25.430> on<00:06:25.520> people's<00:06:25.880> wall<00:06:26.149> I<00:06:26.180> mean<00:06:26.360> it

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:26.719 
hanging on people's wall I mean it

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.040 
hanging on people's wall I mean it
intrigues<00:06:27.169> them<00:06:27.469> and

intrigues them and
because<00:06:28.740> it's<00:06:28.949> not<00:06:29.460> what<00:06:29.699> we<00:06:29.849> normally<00:06:30.599> see<00:06:31.080> in

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
because it's not what we normally see in

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.800 
because it's not what we normally see in
our<00:06:31.889> everyday<00:06:32.129> lives<00:06:32.639> so<00:06:33.090> it's<00:06:33.300> kind<00:06:33.629> of<00:06:33.660> like

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810
