turn off the light and see if that helps
us<00:04:12.730> see<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.990> think<00:04:14.440> it's<00:04:14.680> a<00:04:16.500> glossy<00:04:17.500> screen<00:04:17.830> and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
us see I think it's a glossy screen and

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.620 
us see I think it's a glossy screen and
so<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.220> get<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> lot<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.519> reflection<00:04:19.030> there's

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
so you get a lot of reflection there's

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:28.650 
so you get a lot of reflection there's
my<00:04:19.780> hand<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.380> can<00:04:20.530> see<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.769> camera<00:04:27.450> now<00:04:28.450> while

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
my hand you can see the camera now while

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.240 
my hand you can see the camera now while
this<00:04:28.810> does<00:04:28.990> run<00:04:29.230> Google<00:04:29.590> Android<00:04:29.860> it's<00:04:30.100> going

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
this does run Google Android it's going

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.480 
this does run Google Android it's going
to<00:04:30.310> be<00:04:30.750> running<00:04:31.750> an<00:04:32.110> hour<00:04:32.410> code<00:04:32.650> archos

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
to be running an hour code archos

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.310 
to be running an hour code archos
interface<00:04:33.970> over<00:04:34.270> the<00:04:34.360> top<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.720> Android<00:04:35.080> and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
interface over the top of Android and

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.440 
interface over the top of Android and
it's<00:04:35.580> right<00:04:36.580> now<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.730> think<00:04:36.820> shipping<00:04:37.240> with<00:04:37.360> an

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
it's right now I think shipping with an

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.020 
it's right now I think shipping with an
earlier<00:04:37.720> version<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:38.050> Android<00:04:38.350> 1.5<00:04:38.680> or<00:04:39.310> 1.6<00:04:39.340> so

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
earlier version of Android 1.5 or 1.6 so

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.070 
earlier version of Android 1.5 or 1.6 so
it's<00:04:40.150> not<00:04:40.240> going<00:04:40.360> to<00:04:40.450> have<00:04:40.540> all<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:40.960> new

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
it's not going to have all of the new

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.000 
it's not going to have all of the new
features<00:04:41.230> that<00:04:41.440> you<00:04:41.710> have<00:04:41.890> in<00:04:42.300> android<00:04:43.300> 2.1<00:04:44.200> it

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
features that you have in android 2.1 it

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.160 
features that you have in android 2.1 it
also<00:04:45.220> doesn't<00:04:45.550> out<00:04:46.030> of<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.180> box<00:04:46.390> access<00:04:46.960> the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
aren't going to be able to download

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.580 
aren't going to be able to download
there<00:04:53.470> is<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.540> version<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.750> firmware<00:04:55.990> floating

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
there is a version of firmware floating

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.500 
there is a version of firmware floating
around<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:57.010> believe<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.520> does<00:04:58.060> give<00:04:58.300> you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
around I believe that does give you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.350 
around I believe that does give you
access<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.500> android<00:04:59.560> market<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.360> i

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
access to the android market and i

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.510 
access to the android market and i
believe<00:05:01.780> there's<00:05:02.020> also<00:05:02.200> a<00:05:02.380> narco<00:05:02.890> store<00:05:03.220> here

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
believe there's also a narco store here

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.700 
believe there's also a narco store here
with<00:05:03.730> some<00:05:04.570> applications<00:05:05.260> that<00:05:05.500> you<00:05:05.590> can

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
with some applications that you can

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.900 
with some applications that you can
download<00:05:06.390> so<00:05:08.070> this<00:05:09.070> is<00:05:09.220> not<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.490> full<00:05:09.610> android

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
download so this is not the full android

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.370 
download so this is not the full android

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.190 

let's<00:05:24.880> just<00:05:25.030> take<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.180> quick<00:05:25.450> look<00:05:25.630> at<00:05:25.780> a<00:05:25.810> sample

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
let's just take a quick look at a sample

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:35.959 
let's just take a quick look at a sample
video<00:05:26.680> that<00:05:26.950> shipped<00:05:27.669> with<00:05:27.730> it

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:37.519 

video<00:05:36.629> playback<00:05:36.839> seems<00:05:37.229> to<00:05:37.319> be<00:05:37.409> pretty

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529 
video playback seems to be pretty

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:42.919 
video playback seems to be pretty
responsive<00:05:41.239> let's<00:05:42.239> go<00:05:42.360> back<00:05:42.509> to<00:05:42.539> the<00:05:42.749> home

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:42.929 
responsive let's go back to the home

00:05:42.929 --> 00:05:46.399 
responsive let's go back to the home
screen<00:05:43.729> and<00:05:44.729> I'm<00:05:45.449> yeah<00:05:45.869> this<00:05:46.049> is<00:05:46.139> my<00:05:46.199> first

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:46.409 
screen and I'm yeah this is my first

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
screen and I'm yeah this is my first
time<00:05:46.499> actually<00:05:46.679> dealing<00:05:46.949> with<00:05:47.099> the<00:05:47.159> interface

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:47.429 
time actually dealing with the interface

00:05:47.429 --> 00:05:49.549 
time actually dealing with the interface
it's<00:05:47.669> quite<00:05:48.329> different<00:05:48.629> from<00:05:48.749> other<00:05:49.110> Android

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:49.559 
it's quite different from other Android

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:51.769 
it's quite different from other Android
interfaces<00:05:50.459> I've<00:05:50.610> used<00:05:50.849> so<00:05:51.239> it's<00:05:51.479> taking<00:05:51.719> a

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:51.779 
interfaces I've used so it's taking a

00:05:51.779 --> 00:05:57.499 
interfaces I've used so it's taking a
few<00:05:51.929> minutes<00:05:52.049> to<00:05:52.259> get<00:05:52.349> used<00:05:52.559> to<00:05:55.579> but<00:05:56.579> it's<00:05:57.299> not

00:05:57.499 --> 00:05:57.509 
few minutes to get used to but it's not

00:05:57.509 --> 00:05:59.809 
few minutes to get used to but it's not
too<00:05:57.779> hard<00:05:57.989> to<00:05:58.079> figure<00:05:58.289> out<00:05:58.639> looks<00:05:59.639> like<00:05:59.729> it

00:05:59.809 --> 00:05:59.819 
too hard to figure out looks like it

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.339

I'm<00:06:28.820> not<00:06:28.940> sure<00:06:29.000> what<00:06:29.120> it's<00:06:29.480> connecting<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:30.080> but

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110

also not sure how to pull up the

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.370 
also not sure how to pull up the
on-screen<00:06:34.460> keyboard<00:06:34.610> just<00:06:35.150> yet<00:06:35.420> it's<00:06:36.230> in<00:06:36.350> the

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
on-screen keyboard just yet it's in the

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.870 
on-screen keyboard just yet it's in the
settings<00:06:36.650> here<00:06:39.310> it<00:06:40.310> looks<00:06:40.460> like<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.670> standard

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
settings here it looks like the standard

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:51.870 
settings here it looks like the standard
Android<00:06:41.510> web<00:06:42.110> browser<00:06:42.380> so

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.030 

so<00:06:52.780> there<00:06:52.930> you<00:06:53.020> go<00:06:53.050> that's<00:06:53.320> a<00:06:53.440> first<00:06:53.650> look<00:06:53.830> at

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:54.040 
so there you go that's a first look at
