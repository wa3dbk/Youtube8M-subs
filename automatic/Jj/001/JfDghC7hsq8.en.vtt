00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.640 

now<00:00:00.510> I'm<00:00:00.630> going<00:00:00.840> to<00:00:00.900> show<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.140> some<00:00:01.439> options

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
now I'm going to show you some options

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.550 
now I'm going to show you some options
you<00:00:02.040> could<00:00:02.250> use<00:00:02.730> your<00:00:02.909> spheres<00:00:03.330> one<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.410> them

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
you could use your spheres one of them

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.670 
you could use your spheres one of them
it's<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.920> create<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.250> finial<00:00:06.230> what<00:00:07.230> I<00:00:07.259> have<00:00:07.500> here

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
it's to create a finial what I have here

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.060 
it's to create a finial what I have here
it's<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.010> precast<00:00:08.880> part<00:00:09.599> of<00:00:09.780> a<00:00:09.870> column<00:00:10.380> crown

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
it's a precast part of a column crown

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.749 
it's a precast part of a column crown
and<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:12.210> has<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.420> circle<00:00:12.870> area<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.610> could

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and it has a circle area so you could

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.630 
and it has a circle area so you could
just<00:00:14.790> set<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.450> sphere<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.139> top<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.500> it<00:00:16.650> or<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
just set the sphere on top of it or and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.670 
just set the sphere on top of it or and
morter<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.420> or<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.750> just<00:00:18.960> set<00:00:19.199> it<00:00:19.320> inside<00:00:19.650> of

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
morter it or you just set it inside of

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.920 
morter it or you just set it inside of
it<00:00:19.890> because<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> has<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> nice<00:00:20.850> entrapment<00:00:21.570> area

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
it because it has a nice entrapment area

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.490 
it because it has a nice entrapment area
so<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.640> pretty<00:00:23.850> much<00:00:24.140> what<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.170> end<00:00:25.380> up

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
so this is pretty much what you end up

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890 
so this is pretty much what you end up
looking<00:00:26.180> something<00:00:27.180> like<00:00:27.420> this

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
looking something like this

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.650 
looking something like this
if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:28.949> shrub<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
if you have a shrub and you have the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.430 
if you have a shrub and you have the
garden<00:00:31.050> hose<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.590> come<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.020> hit<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> shrub

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
garden hose that come and hit the shrub

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.650 
garden hose that come and hit the shrub
you<00:00:35.219> put<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> piece<00:00:35.730> like<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:35.969> that's<00:00:36.480> going

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
you put a piece like this that's going

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.100 
you put a piece like this that's going
nowhere<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:38.340> gonna<00:00:39.059> stop<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.629> garden

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
nowhere but it's gonna stop the garden

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.010 
nowhere but it's gonna stop the garden
hose<00:00:40.290> from<00:00:40.590> hitting<00:00:40.950> your<00:00:41.160> shrub<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.840> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
hose from hitting your shrub so that's a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.860 
hose from hitting your shrub so that's a
one<00:00:43.770> example<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:45.030> other<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.480> showed<00:00:45.750> you

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
one example the other one I showed you

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.549 
one example the other one I showed you
this<00:00:45.989> one<00:00:46.230> here<00:00:46.550> it<00:00:47.550> was<00:00:47.760> designed<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.420> be<00:00:49.200> made

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
this one here it was designed to be made

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.400 
this one here it was designed to be made
as<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.770> fountain<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.820> that's<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.210> area<00:00:51.379> what<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
as a fountain so that's the area what I

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.439 
as a fountain so that's the area what I
have<00:00:52.680> here<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> saucer<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.879> have<00:00:54.149> cast

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
have here it's a saucer that I have cast

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.500 
have here it's a saucer that I have cast
earlier<00:00:55.250> another<00:00:56.250> casting<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.300> white

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
earlier another casting this was white

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.170 
earlier another casting this was white
cement<00:00:57.800> I'm<00:00:58.800> gonna<00:00:59.129> use<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> elevate<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
cement I'm gonna use it to elevate the

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.560 
cement I'm gonna use it to elevate the
sphere<00:01:00.449> inside<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.969> you<00:01:02.969> put<00:01:03.149> your

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sphere inside of it and you put your

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.490 
sphere inside of it and you put your
pump<00:01:03.960> under<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> piece<00:01:05.700> here<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.290> hook

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
pump under this piece here and you hook

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.260 
pump under this piece here and you hook
it<00:01:07.619> up<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:09.049> sphere<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.460> as<00:01:11.729> you<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.090> I'm

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
it up to the sphere and as you see I'm

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.179 
it up to the sphere and as you see I'm
not<00:01:12.330> gonna<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:12.810> it<00:01:12.930> towards<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.950> side

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
not gonna put it towards the side

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
not gonna put it towards the side
because<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:14.880> still<00:01:15.150> mortared<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.810> fresh

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
because it's still mortared and fresh

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.590 
because it's still mortared and fresh
you<00:01:16.619> know<00:01:16.770> but<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.159> will<00:01:17.280> put<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.630 

opening<00:01:21.600> app<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.250> end<00:01:23.400> up<00:01:23.520> with

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
opening app and you end up with

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.859 
opening app and you end up with
something<00:01:24.170> looking<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:27.290> okay<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
something looking like this okay and you

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.740 
something looking like this okay and you
will<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.229> bubbling<00:01:31.680> fountain<00:01:32.360> inside<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
will have a bubbling fountain inside a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.310 
will have a bubbling fountain inside a
saucer<00:01:34.820> another<00:01:35.820> way<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.659> could<00:01:36.840> also<00:01:36.960> use

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
saucer another way you could also use

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.920 
saucer another way you could also use
your<00:01:37.590> sphere<00:01:37.880> what<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.180> done<00:01:39.329> before<00:01:39.509> it

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
your sphere what I have done before it

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.010 
your sphere what I have done before it
you<00:01:40.650> could<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.790> top<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.720> pedestal

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
you could put it on top of a pedestal

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350 
you could put it on top of a pedestal
like<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.619> one<00:01:43.860> instead<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> software

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
like this one instead of the software

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
like this one instead of the software
you<00:01:45.420> could<00:01:45.570> put<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> sphere<00:01:46.110> on<00:01:46.229> top<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
you could put the sphere on top of it it

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.899 
you could put the sphere on top of it it
looks<00:01:47.280> great<00:01:48.380> fears<00:01:49.380> they<00:01:49.590> make<00:01:49.909> an

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
looks great fears they make an

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.690 
looks great fears they make an
architectural<00:01:51.659> element<00:01:51.899> in<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> garden<00:01:52.860> they

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
architectural element in the garden they

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.370 
architectural element in the garden they
are<00:01:53.880> used<00:01:54.119> on<00:01:54.420> top<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.890> pillars<00:01:55.890> as<00:01:56.360> an

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
are used on top of pillars as an

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.539 
are used on top of pillars as an
architectural<00:01:58.380> element<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> finial

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
architectural element as a finial

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.289 
architectural element as a finial
similar<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> this<00:02:00.840> one<00:02:01.340> you<00:02:02.340> could<00:02:02.969> create<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
similar to this one you could create a

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.999 
similar to this one you could create a
combination<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.320> put<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.680> next<00:02:04.829> to

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
combination of them put them next to

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.740 
combination of them put them next to
each<00:02:05.070> other<00:02:05.310> different<00:02:05.969> sizes<00:02:07.160> they're<00:02:08.160> just

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
each other different sizes they're just

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.410 
each other different sizes they're just
beautiful<00:02:09.750> shape<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.709> garden<00:02:11.239> you<00:02:12.239> could

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
beautiful shape in the garden you could

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.759 
beautiful shape in the garden you could
color<00:02:12.750> them

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
color them
