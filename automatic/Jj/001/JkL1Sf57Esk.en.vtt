00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.639
 For that I want to be very short and maybe something like that too 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.740
 Roba math can not do that well 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.060
 I would anyway avoid intelligent Lenz - Coach GEZ use them 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.290
 the possibilities of the cancellation form on their pages SBB 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.749
 to send 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.749
 the newcomer Manor Strom is added 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
 the brothers reality or other cocktail from Luxembourg 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.150
 although that at the games open from the outside left the data 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:29.519
 final round 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.979
 you can do that 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:33.310
 and that apply 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.440
 yes StaÃŸfurt 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.510
 yes we want to have some fun though 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 So I always try so often percent on information policy 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.650
 If anyone comes up with the message that concerns an important job 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.410
 All of us have to do it 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.810
 what yes percent 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.860
 our work outside only affects her and one sings a message and 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.730
 concretely does not resist answers and he asks me with fasting 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.440
 that very 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 and I did that yesterday was omnipresent on a do-gooder me 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.310
 but already it is very much influenced 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.360
 and he should 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.620
 he can be a turning point 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.530
 which calms the authority 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.110
 and so quite loose as well as discussion go in where you last the people 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.820
 Finally, even after high tech procured 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.370
 do not proselytize 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.650
 EichstÃ¤tt festivals 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.010
 I have learned 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.850
 that it is good 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.020
 People realize they are paradoxically confronted 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.490
 you have a solid worldview 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.660
 and then you argue 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.760
 that does not fit into the worldview 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.710
 and anyway do not make the mistake and answer that too 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.690
 Stop worrying about the problem 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.980
 Interested in it 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.920
 then every human will be able to find out the truth on his own 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.960
 and he worked very hard on it "nothing is more valuable 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.650
 otherwise it says in the blog music to believe 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.220
 I should believe that is better 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.690
 he is now working himself 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.800
 and there I can do nothing I can not proselytize I can only hope 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 that is 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.690
 the lower leagues Brandt 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.120
 wm team something and then media because it is not with his world view 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.849
 then he will get information material from everywhere 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.569
 and then he knows the word 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.079
 then you know that by itself 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:16.549
 is not that far yet 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 then it was going to have to be picked up by a woman 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:22.639
 because that's what things are going to do for them 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.869
 and then we should just let that happen 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.579
 so do not fight 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:28.879
 but here 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:31.879
 also the people are looking for 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:37.999
 want to be active in the change and with them something concrete 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:39.399
 Companies 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.399
 network and company tangible things 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:43.899
 fasting
