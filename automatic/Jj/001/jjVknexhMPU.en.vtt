 first four houses gentlemen the 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.940
 first four houses 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.710
 They have exactly the same design 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.840
 inside and buy all the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.670
 houses and dry and they have exactly the 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.230
 same here I will present it to you 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.050
 to check more or less the design of the 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.790
 first of the first four houses ok 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.220
 Well, entering is because it has what 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.800
 they are a few small pictures here a little 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.880
 more I do not know more about how that house of 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.350
 single this one has a lot of good has 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.930
 a little more space has a room a 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.490
 little wider than a dining room what is 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.770
 the kitchen also a little wider 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.440
 has a very large screen in what 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.420
 is the room has its stereo its consoles 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.770
 and things like that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.480
 has then a followed a little wider 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.300
 He also has some booksellers for this 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.670
 side and good this room is therefore 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.459
 obviously where he sleeps there is what 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.040
 that is a baby doll and a fucking thong and 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.260
 thrown 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 and here are the ones that are the stereos and 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.400
 little things like that, a little four or 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.930
 forgot to enter what is the bathroom 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.760
 bathroom is a bit simple too 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.579
 only has what is a room a 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.680
 bathroom with shower and what is the room 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.209
 dining room and kitchen is a bit like them 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.569
 I said more like that for singles it 's a 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.390
 simple house but it was very nice 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.890
 let's go to what is now the garage 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.379
 so that more or less in an idea 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.220
 fit six vehicles as I said is 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.110
 a little bit also a little 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.000
 as a bit simple houses to 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.610
 comparison of those of 400,000 or those 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.900
 obviously, but it is so 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.030
 simple they are beautiful 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.860
 now let's move on with the other three 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.150
 houses that are being these that 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.240
 only fit what are two 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.390
 vehicles and good are 120 thousand towards 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.640
 down ok then these houses like them 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.830
 I said they are exactly the same they have 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.890
 a design very different from what they are 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.930
 these four houses upstairs ok so 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.600
 you are going to decide which house you want 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.040
 buy and if you are interested in this 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.390
 case then I'm going to present what 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.670
 are the two designs of the two cases 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.890
 because more or less is an idea now 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.200
 let's move on with the second house that 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.090
 are the ones that are exactly the same as 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.070
 the last three ok that are selling 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.690
 good as we entered there are some pictures 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.100
 here, I do not know who they are, I think 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.050
 it's from his family he cooks a little 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.990
 It also widens a bit the room is a 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.420
 little girl has as a kind of 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.430
 smoke so it looks like something dense there in 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.320
 the inside part of the armchairs 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.830
 they are very simple it looks like home 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.220
 of a gentleman or something like a nose but 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.050
 as a junkie something like that 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.050
 the fourth one is a bit of the mother there 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:15.240
 has a consoles of dj 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:17.880
 and then a very simple TV very simple 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.739
 also very simple the bathroom is of the 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.290
 shit the truth is very fucking ugly 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.840
 but it is a little wider than the other 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.990
 I do not know why 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.410
 now it does not have good already we entered to what 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.389
 what is the bathroom 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.910
 let's go to what is the garage here 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.229
 I have two vehicles I put in for more or 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.860
 unless it is an idea of ​​how they are going to be 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:38.510
 so tight but good is also well 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.699
 they are cars more or less guys are nine 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.229
 white to see are a bit simple 

00:04:40.699 --> 00:04:44.180
 but well I hope you liked this 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.860
