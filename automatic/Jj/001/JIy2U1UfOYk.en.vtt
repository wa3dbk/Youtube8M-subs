00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
very similar to time to mix it when he

very similar to time to mix it when he
comes<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.700> boil<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:27.119> can<00:01:27.390> top<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
comes to the boil I can top the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.380 
comes to the boil I can top the
insulated<00:01:28.170> leg<00:01:28.350> down<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.150> will<00:01:30.270> keep

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
insulated leg down and then it will keep

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.450 
insulated leg down and then it will keep
all<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.600> heat<00:01:30.810> inside<00:01:31.020> so<00:01:31.890> he's<00:01:32.009> very<00:01:32.189> quick

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
all the heat inside so he's very quick

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
and very efficient if I need to add

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.499 
and very efficient if I need to add
water<00:01:34.650> in<00:01:35.040> by<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> press<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> couple<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
water in by a press of a couple of

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.350 
water in by a press of a couple of
buttons<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.950> actually<00:01:38.070> measure<00:01:38.490> in<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.970> set

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
buttons I can actually measure in a set

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.830 
buttons I can actually measure in a set
amount<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.810> water<00:01:40.369> example<00:01:41.369> one<00:01:41.759> liter<00:01:42.000> and

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
amount of water example one liter and

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.280 
amount of water example one liter and
start<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.560> will<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.040> in<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.430> liter<00:01:44.640> of<00:01:44.790> water

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
start I will put in one liter of water

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.990 
start I will put in one liter of water
so<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.649> we're<00:01:46.829> working<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:47.250> standard<00:01:47.640> methods

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
so if we're working on standard methods

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.780 
so if we're working on standard methods
and<00:01:48.119> standard<00:01:48.420> recipes<00:01:49.189> if<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.340> recipe<00:01:50.610> calls

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and standard recipes if the recipe calls

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.090 
and standard recipes if the recipe calls
for<00:01:50.850> 60<00:01:51.240> liters<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> water<00:01:51.720> we<00:01:52.380> put<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.710> system

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
for 60 liters of water we put in system

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
for 60 liters of water we put in system
eases<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.399> water<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:54.450> he<00:01:54.570> will<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.899> good<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.530> as

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
eases in water and he will be good so as

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.899 
eases in water and he will be good so as
you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:55.890> at<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.130> moment<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.670> pot
