putting<00:02:08.409> a<00:02:08.440> layer<00:02:08.830> of<00:02:08.860> oil<00:02:09.280> paint<00:02:09.640> on<00:02:09.789> top<00:02:09.819> of

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
putting a layer of oil paint on top of

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.970 
putting a layer of oil paint on top of
my<00:02:10.269> acrylics<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.959> think<00:02:11.409> this<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.620> gonna<00:02:11.769> be<00:02:11.890> the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
my acrylics I think this is gonna be the

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.380 
my acrylics I think this is gonna be the
way<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.099> paint<00:02:12.459> from<00:02:12.580> now<00:02:12.760> on<00:02:12.970> I've<00:02:13.180> been

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
way I paint from now on I've been

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.490 
way I paint from now on I've been
thinking<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.720> the<00:02:13.840> process<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.409> my

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
thinking of the process of my

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.170 
thinking of the process of my
traditional<00:02:14.920> paintings<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.879> same

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
traditional paintings as the same

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.210 
traditional paintings as the same
process<00:02:16.750> i<00:02:16.870> use<00:02:16.990> in<00:02:17.140> photoshop<00:02:17.680> where<00:02:17.980> I<00:02:18.010> lay

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
process i use in photoshop where I lay

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.830 
process i use in photoshop where I lay
down<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.580> my<00:02:18.730> flat<00:02:19.030> coast<00:02:19.300> which<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.660> guys

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
down all my flat coast which you guys

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.950 
down all my flat coast which you guys
saw<00:02:20.080> in<00:02:20.200> week<00:02:20.380> one

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
saw in week one

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.780 
saw in week one
and<00:02:21.020> I<00:02:21.110> began<00:02:21.440> blending<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.070> a<00:02:22.160> little<00:02:22.430> bit<00:02:22.610> but

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and I began blending in a little bit but

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.760 
and I began blending in a little bit but
you<00:02:22.910> guys<00:02:23.060> saw<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.360> week<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.990> then<00:02:24.350> I<00:02:24.440> began

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
you guys saw a week to then I began

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.400 
you guys saw a week to then I began
doing<00:02:24.830> my<00:02:25.250> final<00:02:25.610> blends<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.960> find<00:02:27.200> two

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
doing my final blends just to find two

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.900 
doing my final blends just to find two
things<00:02:27.710> a<00:02:27.800> little<00:02:27.890> bit<00:02:28.040> more<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.460> then<00:02:28.520> from

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
things a little bit more and then from

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.060 
things a little bit more and then from
there<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.570> do<00:02:29.630> my<00:02:29.960> detail<00:02:30.500> layer<00:02:30.770> which

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
there I do my detail layer which

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:32.950 
there I do my detail layer which
finishes<00:02:31.430> up<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:31.670> painting<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.480> I<00:02:32.510> think<00:02:32.660> the

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
finishes up the painting so I think the

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.180 
finishes up the painting so I think the
way<00:02:33.050> I'm<00:02:33.140> gonna<00:02:33.230> paint<00:02:33.410> from<00:02:33.530> now<00:02:33.680> on<00:02:33.890> isn't

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
way I'm gonna paint from now on isn't

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:35.890 
way I'm gonna paint from now on isn't
going<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.490> do<00:02:34.610> my<00:02:34.730> first<00:02:34.970> layer<00:02:35.300> in<00:02:35.510> acrylic

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
going to do my first layer in acrylic

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.510 
going to do my first layer in acrylic
just<00:02:36.380> because<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.680> dries<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.130> quickly<00:02:37.250> I

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
just because it dries very quickly I

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.890 
just because it dries very quickly I
don't<00:02:37.730> really<00:02:37.880> have<00:02:37.970> to<00:02:38.090> wait<00:02:38.270> for<00:02:38.300> it<00:02:38.600> then

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
don't really have to wait for it then

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.690 
don't really have to wait for it then
I'm<00:02:38.990> gonna<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.260> some<00:02:39.650> blends<00:02:40.070> in<00:02:40.220> acrylic<00:02:40.610> and

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
I'm gonna do some blends in acrylic and

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.220 
I'm gonna do some blends in acrylic and
then<00:02:40.820> I'm<00:02:40.910> gonna<00:02:41.000> do<00:02:41.150> another<00:02:41.510> blending<00:02:42.050> layer

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
then I'm gonna do another blending layer

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.470 
then I'm gonna do another blending layer
on<00:02:42.440> top<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:42.860> with<00:02:43.040> oil<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:44.000> do<00:02:44.300> my

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
on top of that with oil and then do my

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.570 
on top of that with oil and then do my
detailing<00:02:45.170> in<00:02:45.320> oil<00:02:45.590> as<00:02:45.800> well<00:02:45.830> and<00:02:46.280> it's

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
detailing in oil as well and it's

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.100 
detailing in oil as well and it's
process<00:02:46.850> worked<00:02:47.330> out<00:02:47.510> perfectly<00:02:48.020> because

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
process worked out perfectly because

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.720 
process worked out perfectly because
last<00:02:48.590> week<00:02:48.740> if<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.070> remember<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.400> was<00:02:49.550> talking

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
last week if you remember I was talking

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.280 
last week if you remember I was talking
about<00:02:49.940> having<00:02:50.360> an<00:02:50.420> underpainting<00:02:50.810> how<00:02:51.170> it

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
about having an underpainting how it

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.570 
about having an underpainting how it
could<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.530> helped<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.100> turned<00:02:52.340> out<00:02:52.520> that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
could have helped and it turned out that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.850 
could have helped and it turned out that
this<00:02:52.790> acrylic<00:02:53.090> painting<00:02:53.660> acted<00:02:54.230> very<00:02:54.560> much

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
this acrylic painting acted very much

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.620 
this acrylic painting acted very much
like<00:02:55.130> an<00:02:55.250> underpainting<00:02:55.700> for<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> oil<00:02:56.300> paint

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
like an underpainting for the oil paint

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.240 
like an underpainting for the oil paint
because<00:02:56.780> that<00:02:57.170> oil<00:02:57.380> paint<00:02:57.650> you're<00:02:57.800> looking<00:02:58.100> at

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
because that oil paint you're looking at

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.250 
because that oil paint you're looking at
in<00:02:58.400> these<00:02:58.580> well<00:02:58.910> blended<00:02:59.300> areas<00:02:59.690> is<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.900> very

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
in these well blended areas is a very

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.230 
in these well blended areas is a very
thin<00:03:00.560> layer<00:03:00.740> of<00:03:00.800> oil<00:03:01.160> and<00:03:01.490> I'm<00:03:01.640> satisfied<00:03:01.910> with

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
thin layer of oil and I'm satisfied with

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.520 
thin layer of oil and I'm satisfied with
the<00:03:02.300> way<00:03:02.390> it<00:03:02.510> looks<00:03:02.690> so<00:03:02.840> far<00:03:03.080> so<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.260> think<00:03:03.350> that

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
the way it looks so far so I think that

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.410 
the way it looks so far so I think that
someone<00:03:03.830> would<00:03:03.980> continue<00:03:04.490> to<00:03:04.520> do<00:03:04.850> now<00:03:05.240> what<00:03:05.390> I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
someone would continue to do now what I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.480 
someone would continue to do now what I
plan<00:03:05.750> to<00:03:05.780> do<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.020> I<00:03:06.200> plan<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.470> add<00:03:06.680> more<00:03:07.010> oil<00:03:07.040> on

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
plan to do is I plan to add more oil on

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.400 
plan to do is I plan to add more oil on
the<00:03:07.610> rest<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.910> areas<00:03:08.210> that<00:03:08.270> don't<00:03:08.570> have<00:03:08.870> oil<00:03:09.080> I

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
the rest of areas that don't have oil I

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.220 
the rest of areas that don't have oil I
also<00:03:09.860> plan<00:03:10.520> to<00:03:10.820> buy<00:03:11.150> red<00:03:11.570> paint<00:03:11.900> because<00:03:12.080> I

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
also plan to buy red paint because I

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.440 
also plan to buy red paint because I
don't<00:03:12.530> have<00:03:12.770> red<00:03:13.130> paint<00:03:13.430> at<00:03:13.640> least<00:03:13.850> not<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.060> true

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
don't have red paint at least not a true

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.540 
don't have red paint at least not a true
red<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:15.020> red<00:03:15.140> i<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.500> is<00:03:15.650> very<00:03:15.860> orange<00:03:16.310> like

red the red i have is very orange like
and<00:03:16.760> i'm<00:03:16.880> lucky<00:03:17.210> in<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.420> way<00:03:17.570> that<00:03:17.720> this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
and i'm lucky in the way that this

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.630 
and i'm lucky in the way that this
painting<00:03:18.320> is<00:03:18.380> very<00:03:18.620> orange<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.130> begin<00:03:19.430> with

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
painting is very orange to begin with

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.520

and has a lot of yellows as well but the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.770 
and has a lot of yellows as well but the
rest<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:21.890> painting<00:03:22.310> needs<00:03:22.520> a<00:03:22.940> true<00:03:23.270> red<00:03:23.600> it

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
rest of the painting needs a true red it

rest of the painting needs a true red it
needs<00:03:24.050> that<00:03:24.650> real<00:03:25.310> red<00:03:25.790> in<00:03:26.060> every<00:03:26.840> area<00:03:27.050> that

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
needs that real red in every area that

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.840 
needs that real red in every area that
doesn't<00:03:27.470> have<00:03:27.620> oil<00:03:27.950> paint<00:03:28.190> so<00:03:28.430> I'm<00:03:28.490> gonna<00:03:28.670> need

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850

up the rest of the oil and one of the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.040 
up the rest of the oil and one of the
first<00:03:31.940> things<00:03:32.060> I'm<00:03:32.300> gonna<00:03:32.450> do<00:03:32.600> with<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.750> red

first things I'm gonna do with that red

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.780 
first things I'm gonna do with that red
is<00:03:33.080> I'm<00:03:33.230> gonna<00:03:33.320> blend<00:03:33.620> in<00:03:33.860> this<00:03:34.190> area<00:03:34.580> down

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
is I'm gonna blend in this area down

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.210 
is I'm gonna blend in this area down
here<00:03:34.820> because<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:35.780> yellow<00:03:36.140> is<00:03:36.170> blaring<00:03:36.890> out

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
here because that yellow is blaring out

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.090 
here because that yellow is blaring out

don't want to be painting this thing for

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.730 
don't want to be painting this thing for
another<00:03:53.150> three<00:03:53.450> weeks<00:03:53.480> I'm<00:03:54.200> trying<00:03:54.530> to<00:03:54.590> finish

another three weeks I'm trying to finish

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.530 
another three weeks I'm trying to finish
this<00:03:54.950> thing<00:03:55.160> up<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.460> don't<00:03:55.850> want<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.180> be<00:03:56.270> working

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
this thing up I don't want to be working

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.090 
this thing up I don't want to be working
on<00:03:56.600> this<00:03:56.720> for<00:03:56.900> too<00:03:57.050> long<00:03:57.290> because<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.830> have<00:03:58.070> a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
on this for too long because I have a

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.620 
on this for too long because I have a
bunch<00:03:58.460> of<00:03:58.580> other<00:03:58.760> things<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.090> want<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.420> paint

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
bunch of other things that want to paint

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.210 
bunch of other things that want to paint
remember<00:04:00.230> this<00:04:00.350> is<00:04:00.530> only<00:04:00.710> a<00:04:00.920> practice

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
remember this is only a practice

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.860 
remember this is only a practice
painting<00:04:01.880> and<00:04:02.060> part<00:04:02.360> of<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.480> reason<00:04:02.510> it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
painting and part of the reason it's

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.300 
painting and part of the reason it's
been<00:04:02.960> taking<00:04:03.320> me<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:03.590> long<00:04:03.620> is<00:04:03.980> because<00:04:04.010> I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
been taking me so long is because I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.890 
been taking me so long is because I
don't<00:04:04.580> have<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.820> lot<00:04:05.000> of<00:04:05.030> free<00:04:05.270> time<00:04:05.300> and<00:04:05.720> when<00:04:05.840> I

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
don't have a lot of free time and when I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.030 
don't have a lot of free time and when I
do<00:04:05.960> work<00:04:06.260> on<00:04:06.380> it<00:04:06.530> i'm<00:04:06.590> doing<00:04:06.830> a<00:04:06.890> lot<00:04:06.980> of

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
do work on it i'm doing a lot of

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.130 
do work on it i'm doing a lot of
experimental<00:04:07.730> things<00:04:08.030> so<00:04:08.630> hopefully<00:04:09.020> the

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
experimental things so hopefully the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.450 
experimental things so hopefully the
other<00:04:09.320> paintings<00:04:09.800> in<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:09.950> future<00:04:10.280> unless

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
other paintings in the future unless

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.250 
other paintings in the future unless
they're<00:04:10.820> very<00:04:11.120> large<00:04:11.450> they<00:04:11.750> shouldn't<00:04:12.050> take

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
they're very large they shouldn't take

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.960 
they're very large they shouldn't take
this<00:04:12.470> long<00:04:12.530> overall<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:13.550> pretty<00:04:13.580> much<00:04:13.760> on

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970
