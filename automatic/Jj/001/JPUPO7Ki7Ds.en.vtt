whether the psalm 83 and Isaiah 17 1 war

it<00:01:30.149> seems<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> me<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.960> if<00:01:31.079> Israel<00:01:31.320> used<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
it seems to me that if Israel used a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.670 
it seems to me that if Israel used a
nuclear<00:01:32.759> weapon<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.360> what<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.439> sometimes

nuclear weapon and what is sometimes
called<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.399> Samson<00:01:36.000> option<00:01:36.469> that<00:01:37.469> this<00:01:38.100> could

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
called the Samson option that this could

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
called the Samson option that this could
be<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.549> final<00:01:38.790> leverage<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.899> world<00:01:40.170> uses<00:01:40.860> to

be the final leverage the world uses to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.600 
be the final leverage the world uses to

seven borders and that makes the way

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.109 
seven borders and that makes the way
clear<00:01:48.630> for<00:01:49.549> finalizing<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> peace<00:01:50.909> agreement

with Palestine and giving them Jerusalem
and<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:55.140> I've<00:01:55.350> stated<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.710> other<00:01:56.039> videos<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
and as I've stated my other videos that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.929 
and as I've stated my other videos that
day<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.829> tribulation<00:01:59.399> starts<00:02:01.189> so<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.520> after

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
day the tribulation starts so then after

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450 
day the tribulation starts so then after
the<00:02:03.060> tribulation<00:02:03.359> starts<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.950> would<00:02:05.100> quickly

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the tribulation starts you would quickly

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.759 
the tribulation starts you would quickly
have<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.090> Ezekiel<00:02:06.600> 3839<00:02:07.200> GOG<00:02:08.160> Magog<00:02:08.490> war<00:02:08.759> and

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.400 
have the Ezekiel 3839 GOG Magog war and
I<00:02:10.769> can<00:02:10.979> show<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.519> because<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.330> Ezekiel<00:02:12.870> 38

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I can show this because in Ezekiel 38
