00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.920 
I'm working the shade limit which is a
matte<00:01:42.710> shade<00:01:42.979> into<00:01:43.490> my<00:01:43.609> crease<00:01:43.909> really<00:01:44.659> take

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
matte shade into my crease really take

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.719 
matte shade into my crease really take
your<00:01:45.049> time<00:01:45.229> with<00:01:45.409> this<00:01:45.530> step<00:01:45.770> because<00:01:46.189> I<00:01:46.219> find

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
your time with this step because I find

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:48.700 
your time with this step because I find
Urban<00:01:47.030> Decay<00:01:47.299> matte<00:01:47.539> shadows<00:01:47.960> do<00:01:48.259> not<00:01:48.469> blend

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
Urban Decay matte shadows do not blend

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.039 
Urban Decay matte shadows do not blend
easily<00:01:48.979> whatsoever<00:01:49.969> so<00:01:50.299> make<00:01:50.630> sure<00:01:50.659> you<00:01:50.899> blend

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
easily whatsoever so make sure you blend

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.859 
easily whatsoever so make sure you blend
it<00:01:51.229> out<00:01:51.350> then<00:01:52.100> I'm<00:01:52.219> taking<00:01:52.399> my<00:01:52.640> naked<00:01:53.479> 3<00:01:53.659> brush

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.480 
it out then I'm taking my naked 3 brush
again<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:54.500> I'm<00:01:54.619> tipping<00:01:54.950> into<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:55.280> shade

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
again and I'm tipping into the shade

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.370 
again and I'm tipping into the shade
burnout<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.149> I<00:01:56.420> really<00:01:56.810> wasn't<00:01:56.990> sure<00:01:57.109> what<00:01:57.229> I

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
burnout and I really wasn't sure what I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.139 
burnout and I really wasn't sure what I
was<00:01:57.500> gonna<00:01:57.590> do<00:01:57.890> yet<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:58.130> that<00:01:58.700> just<00:01:58.939> kind<00:01:59.119> of

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
was gonna do yet so that just kind of

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:01.389 
was gonna do yet so that just kind of
went<00:01:59.329> all<00:01:59.450> over<00:01:59.479> my<00:01:59.810> lid<00:02:00.020> for<00:02:00.229> now<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:00.920> now<00:02:01.070> I'm

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
went all over my lid for now and now I'm

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.020 
went all over my lid for now and now I'm
taking<00:02:01.609> the<00:02:02.030> shade<00:02:02.590> buzz<00:02:03.590> yes<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.369> that's

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
taking the shade buzz yes and that's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.290 
taking the shade buzz yes and that's
gonna<00:02:05.179> go<00:02:05.659> into<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.289> outer<00:02:07.039> half<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.880> my<00:02:07.939> lid

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
gonna go into the outer half of my lid

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.029 
gonna go into the outer half of my lid
because<00:02:08.750> then<00:02:08.960> I'm<00:02:09.050> gonna<00:02:09.140> take<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.679> darker

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
because then I'm gonna take a darker

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.650 
because then I'm gonna take a darker
shade<00:02:10.250> nooner<00:02:10.910> from<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> palette<00:02:11.630> and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
shade nooner from the palette and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.350 
shade nooner from the palette and
switching<00:02:12.170> back<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.590> my<00:02:12.710> 217<00:02:13.370> I'm<00:02:13.790> gonna<00:02:14.120> start

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
switching back to my 217 I'm gonna start

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.450 
switching back to my 217 I'm gonna start
working<00:02:14.690> this<00:02:14.810> into<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.590> lower<00:02:15.890> part<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.340> my

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
working this into the lower part of my

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.490 
working this into the lower part of my
crease<00:02:16.700> in<00:02:16.880> my<00:02:16.910> outer<00:02:17.180> corner<00:02:17.660> just<00:02:18.290> for<00:02:18.470> a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
crease in my outer corner just for a

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.920 
crease in my outer corner just for a
little<00:02:18.680> bit<00:02:18.800> more<00:02:19.040> dimension<00:02:19.400> again<00:02:20.090> take

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
little bit more dimension again take

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.199 
little bit more dimension again take
your<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.260> with<00:02:21.440> this<00:02:21.590> step<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.190> just<00:02:22.250> try<00:02:23.150> to

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
your time with this step and just try to

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.000 
your time with this step and just try to
remember<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.659> have<00:02:23.870> patience<00:02:24.500> because<00:02:24.680> we

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
remember to have patience because we

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.450 
remember to have patience because we
want<00:02:25.190> every

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
want every

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.490 
want every
things<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.730> completely<00:02:26.270> seamless<00:02:26.570> so<00:02:27.350> then

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
things to be completely seamless so then

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.040 
things to be completely seamless so then
I<00:02:27.530> actually<00:02:27.920> took<00:02:28.250> a<00:02:28.310> sigma<00:02:28.820> e40<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.930> a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
I actually took a sigma e40 just a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.680 
I actually took a sigma e40 just a
totally<00:02:30.410> clean<00:02:30.680> brush<00:02:31.040> and<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.970> use<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.390> to

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
totally clean brush and just use that to

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.990 
totally clean brush and just use that to
kind<00:02:32.900> of<00:02:32.990> blend<00:02:33.230> everything<00:02:33.410> even<00:02:34.100> more<00:02:34.310> so

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
kind of blend everything even more so

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.730 
kind of blend everything even more so
then<00:02:35.360> because<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.870> rosy<00:02:36.230> tones<00:02:36.440> and<00:02:36.650> these

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
then because the rosy tones and these

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.230 
then because the rosy tones and these
shadows<00:02:37.070> were<00:02:37.100> picking<00:02:37.490> up<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> rosy<00:02:38.000> tones

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
shadows were picking up the rosy tones

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.520 
shadows were picking up the rosy tones
in<00:02:38.510> my<00:02:38.990> waterline

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530
