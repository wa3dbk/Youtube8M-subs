 Hi everyone, in this lesson we will see some techniques to age a photograph. 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 First we click with our right on our level and choose Convert to advanced object. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Then we apply a simple Add Noise filter. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 We create a new Hue / Saturation layer and from the Adjustments we bring the Saturation to 0 to eliminate the colors. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 Leaving a minimum saturation and bringing the shade to yellow we will already have an interesting effect, 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 but in this case we omit. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000
 We create a new photographic filter layer and choose a color on orange to be superimposed on the photograph, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 or select a warmer filter from the Photoshop default ones. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 To create areas that have been ruined by time, let's search among Google Scratch Texture images and take one. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 This is an interesting image. Let's copy it on our photo 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 and set the blending mode to Soft Light, possibly reducing opacity. 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 Now let's create a new exposure level and lower the exposure value to darken the image. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Our intent, however, is to darken only the edges, so we create a layer mask, 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
 do alt + click on it and create a circle from black to white. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
 The effect will be applied, in short, only to the corners depending on the radius we give to the circle. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
 To get more control, though, we can color the mask with a white brush 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 to which we will give a reduced opacity for not having too marked edges. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
 We can quickly create a frame with a yellow coloring selection on a new layer. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:08.000
 We reverse the selection and color the inner part of black. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
 Click on Filter / Pixel Effect / Crystallize and choose an appropriate cell size. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
 Let's eliminate the black part. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:45.000
 We have a torn paper effect that we can further refine by creating a white trace 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:55.000
 and a dark yellow inner shadow with fusion options. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000
 We can also add a texture to give some relief and movement to the paper. 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000
 If instead we want a classic black border we can select the base level, right click 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
 and select fusion options and set an internal trace of the size we want. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.000
 Well, that's all for this lesson. Until next time!
