 my commandments because length of days 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.509

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.220

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.740
 medicine to your body and refreshments for 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.410
 your bones 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.990

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.390

 Jehovah does not tire you of his correction 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.540
 because jehovah he loves punishes like the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.400

 wisdom and that gets the intelligence 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.530
 because your profit is better than 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.160
 gain of silver and its fruits more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.740

 precious stones and everything you can 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.710
 wish you can not compare to it 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.510
 length of days is in his right hand 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:42.540
 in his left riches and honors his 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:46.470

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.690
 those who get hold of it and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.000
 blessed are those who hold it 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.509
 jehovah with wisdom founded the earth 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.850
 he affirmed the heavens with intelligence with 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.380
 their science the chasms were divided 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:06.350
 and dew distill the heavens my son no 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.110

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.200
 fourth the law and the council and they will be life 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.209

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.960
 then you will go your way 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.200
 confidently and your foot will not stumble 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.950
 When you lie down, you will not fear 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 that you will lie down and your dream will be pleasant 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 you will not be afraid of sudden fear nor 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.080
 of the ruin of the wicked when it came 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.620
 because jehovah will be your trust and he 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.420
 will preserve your foot from being imprisoned not you 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.790
 refuse to do good to who is 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.060
 because when you want to be able to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.060
 do not say your neighbor walks and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.030
 come back and tomorrow I will give you when you have 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.790
 with you to give 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.730
 not evil against your neighbor who 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.459
 live confident next to you do not have 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.220
 litigation with nobody without reason if you have not 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.709
 done wrong do not envy man 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.800
 unfair or choose any of your 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.430
 roads because jehovah abhors the 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.450
 perverse 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.459
 But his secret is with the righteous 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.430
 the curse of jehovah is in the house 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:19.910
 of the ungodly blessed the abode of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.130
 the righteous certainly he is flesh will be 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.360
 to the scoffers and the humble 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:31.480
 will give grace the lips will inherit honor 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.480
 But the foolish will carry ignominy
