00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:14.170
 good i am gives in these blocked in the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.960
 last tutorial that I brought you is the 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.810
 last one was brought from another before good you 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.070
 you remember the one with the hidden doors 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.689
 invisible thanks to the existence of blocks 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.220
 that visually measure one meter but that 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.050
 they actually measure a meter and a half 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.960
 there are several blocks in the game with 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.150
 that property the fences the stripes of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.240
 true the two types of stone wall 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.600
 both the normal one and the one that has 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.380
 what is this called as if this is 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.020
 that has moss and the doors 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.210
 for by the berries where he is putting a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.180
 carpet on top we made a surface 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.400
 about which we could pass to condition 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.900
 that the door below was 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.330
 open to let us pass because 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.430
 if there would be only one and a half meters of 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.690
 margin then we could not enter without 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.620
 But here in small detail that 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.660
 I know if you have noticed 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.190
 to the carpet you can go up because the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 carpet is one meter high from 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.250
 ground 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.149
 You see, I have a spare carpet and it's just 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.930
 when you go through the fence when you 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:20.530
 you lift half block up 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.600
 that means 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.479
 that carpets are useful to avoid 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.520
 this problem so common we have a 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.800
 fence full of cattle we try to open 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 to enter and we all escape 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.010
 about population however if we place 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 that's a carpet on top of a piece 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.510
 fence the creatures do not know that by 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.450
 there they can jump because they do not recognize it 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.980
 as a valid route the creatures see 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.690
 that are surrounded by a fence of a 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.520
 one and a half meters therefore they are not going to 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.960
 try to get up there unless you put 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.110
 a solid block of one meter on the other 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 side 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.900
 or how to teach the use for billboards 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.070
 won but it has a pretty use 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.900
 how to say it rather curious 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.430
 I have enough acquaintances that 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.429
 directly 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.009
 have started doing this in their 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.470
 fenced for horses and now you 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.660
 I will teach because normally if you had a 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.760
 fenced like this and you did not have the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.920
 and we do not have the carpet and put on 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.550
 I wanted to jump a one meter wall and 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.860
 half you have to catch run load 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.930
 the jump and jump over sometimes 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 It works sometimes not depending on the lag 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.930
 today I am on the server I am 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.060
 getting some of the harpe 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.130
 artificially so that it sounds a whole 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.599
 little more the effect 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.890
 as you can see 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.680
 you would need a larger fence than 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.200
 this and have a little bit of a run for 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.120
 to be able to enter always and that this was 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.459
 reliable however the horses had 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.739
 a particularity can climb slopes 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:56.080
 one meter high 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:59.200
 just walking and the carpet is 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.819
 one meter from the ground therefore there 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.099
 where you put those two blocks of 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.090
 carpet is a hall that the horse 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.090
 you can walk calmly 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.840
 and yet as you can see 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.950
 the horse still sees the fence of 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.650
 meter and a half therefore it's not going to 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.239
 try to get out of the fence 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.040
 I think it's one of the most 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:22.569
 fast and reliable to make a stable 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.590
 horse that you know the 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.590
 horse is not going to move from there 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.950
 super simple very practical then I 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.290
 pass 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.510
 It would be convenient to do one more meter 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.910
 great that this here but how can you 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.210
 watch 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.190
 it's relatively easy to negotiate up 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.470
 here today's tutorial like favorite 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.660
 subscribe you liked dislike and I 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 comment because if you did not like us 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.400
 we see the next video see you later
