00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.910 

so<00:00:00.810> what<00:00:00.930> I<00:00:00.960> wanted<00:00:01.199> to<00:00:01.290> tell<00:00:01.439> you<00:00:01.560> guys<00:00:01.589> about

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so what I wanted to tell you guys about

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.160 
so what I wanted to tell you guys about
next<00:00:02.520> was<00:00:02.790> just<00:00:03.000> how<00:00:03.179> basically<00:00:03.629> our<00:00:03.870> study<00:00:04.110> of

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
next was just how basically our study of

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.190 
next was just how basically our study of
the<00:00:04.380> cell<00:00:04.620> how<00:00:05.520> it<00:00:05.700> applies<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.810> digestive

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
the cell how it applies to the digestive

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.450 
the cell how it applies to the digestive
system<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.680> there's<00:00:07.859> something<00:00:08.010> that's<00:00:08.280> got

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
system so there's something that's got

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.299 
system so there's something that's got
to<00:00:08.550> connect<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.690> single<00:00:10.080> cell<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.889> an<00:00:11.010> entire

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
to connect one single cell to an entire

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.039 
to connect one single cell to an entire
system<00:00:11.790> so<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.150> gonna<00:00:12.300> discuss<00:00:12.780> how

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
system so we're just gonna discuss how

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.240 
system so we're just gonna discuss how
our<00:00:13.710> little<00:00:13.980> cells<00:00:14.340> are<00:00:14.580> organized<00:00:15.059> into

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:16.250 
our little cells are organized into

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
our little cells are organized into
multicellular<00:00:17.250> organs<00:00:17.789> which<00:00:18.060> make

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
multicellular organs which make

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.460 
multicellular organs which make
organisms<00:00:20.840> alright<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:21.990> what<00:00:22.140> does<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.350> mean

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
organisms alright so what does it mean

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.009 
organisms alright so what does it mean
to<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.740> multicellular<00:00:23.519> multi<00:00:24.480> means<00:00:24.660> many<00:00:24.930> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to be multicellular multi means many and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.839 
to be multicellular multi means many and
cellular<00:00:25.529> means<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.099> cell<00:00:26.340> like<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.730> guys

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
cellular means the cell like you guys

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.330 
cellular means the cell like you guys
know<00:00:27.119> already<00:00:27.420> so<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> be<00:00:28.740> multicellular

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
know already so to be multicellular

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.740 
know already so to be multicellular
means<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> you're<00:00:29.880> more<00:00:29.910> you're<00:00:30.480> made<00:00:30.599> of

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
means that you're more you're made of

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.229 
means that you're more you're made of
more<00:00:30.929> than<00:00:31.080> one<00:00:31.230> cell<00:00:31.500> these<00:00:32.250> organisms<00:00:32.700> here

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
more than one cell these organisms here

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.880 
more than one cell these organisms here
at<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> bottom<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.170> all<00:00:34.380> organisms

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
at the bottom there are all organisms

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.389 
at the bottom there are all organisms
made<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.430> one<00:00:35.670> cell<00:00:36.030> so<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:37.250> right<00:00:38.250> here

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
made of one cell so you have right here

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.700 
made of one cell so you have right here
there's<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.820> organism<00:00:39.329> right<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.530> there's

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
there's an organism right here there's

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.680 
there's an organism right here there's
an<00:00:40.829> organism<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.879> if<00:00:42.149> each<00:00:42.329> one<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.629> an

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
an organism so if each one it's an

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.150 
an organism so if each one it's an
organism<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.230> means<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.530> has<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.800> undergo

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
organism it means it has to undergo

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.860 
organism it means it has to undergo
certain<00:00:44.370> processes<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> has<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.600> able<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
certain processes it has to be able to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
certain processes it has to be able to
reproduce<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.980> has<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.460> able<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> undergo

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
reproduce it has to be able to undergo

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.029 
reproduce it has to be able to undergo
cellular<00:00:48.660> respiration<00:00:48.899> or<00:00:49.350> photosynthesis

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
cellular respiration or photosynthesis

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.549 
cellular respiration or photosynthesis
and<00:00:50.280> it's<00:00:51.030> got<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.390> able<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:51.719> basically

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
and it's got to be able to basically

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.760 
and it's got to be able to basically
excrete<00:00:53.430> waste<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:54.059> ingest<00:00:54.750> food<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.649> if

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
excrete waste and ingest food so if

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.049 
excrete waste and ingest food so if
you're<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:55.949> organism<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.520> have<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.760> do<00:00:56.879> those

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you're an organism you have to do those

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
you're an organism you have to do those
things<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.809> each<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:58.829> organisms<00:00:59.340> here

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
things so each of these organisms here

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.209 
things so each of these organisms here
they<00:01:00.329> do<00:01:00.390> all<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> those<00:01:01.170> things<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.890> it<00:01:02.010> just

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
they do all of those things but it just

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.910 
they do all of those things but it just
in<00:01:02.340> one<00:01:02.609> cell<00:01:03.140> so<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> picture<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.769> an

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
in one cell so this is a picture of an

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.060 
in one cell so this is a picture of an
amoeba<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.610> we<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:07.010> through<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
amoeba and we can see here through a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.020 
amoeba and we can see here through a
video<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.390> amoeba<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.159> feeding<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
video that the amoeba is feeding so if I

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.789 
video that the amoeba is feeding so if I
press<00:01:12.210> play<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.479> on<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> video<00:01:12.900> you'll<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
press play here on the video you'll be

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.440 
press play here on the video you'll be
able<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.520> what's<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.119> on<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.390> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
able to see that what's going on in this

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.649 
able to see that what's going on in this
one<00:01:15.810> cell<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> cytoplasm<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.450> being

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
one cell is that the cytoplasm is being

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.870 
one cell is that the cytoplasm is being
pushed<00:01:18.960> around<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.680> there<00:01:20.369> must<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> piece

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pushed around and there must be a piece

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.480 
pushed around and there must be a piece
of<00:01:20.909> food<00:01:21.330> here<00:01:21.840> that's<00:01:22.590> being<00:01:22.860> engulfed<00:01:23.430> by

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
of food here that's being engulfed by

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.590 
of food here that's being engulfed by
the<00:01:23.640> amoeba<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.490> can<00:01:26.729> kind<00:01:26.970> of<00:01:27.060> see<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.420> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the amoeba so you can kind of see if you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.700 
the amoeba so you can kind of see if you
look<00:01:28.320> back<00:01:28.590> in<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.829> video<00:01:30.290> it's<00:01:31.290> starting<00:01:31.590> to

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
look back in the video it's starting to

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.850 
look back in the video it's starting to
out<00:01:31.890> stretch<00:01:32.369> its<00:01:32.790> cytoplasm<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
out stretch its cytoplasm and it

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.370 
out stretch its cytoplasm and it
encloses<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.630> get<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> food<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.229> was

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
encloses it to get the food that was

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.920 
encloses it to get the food that was
laying<00:01:37.619> there<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:38.820> how<00:01:39.030> one<00:01:39.570> organism

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
laying there so that's how one organism

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
laying there so that's how one organism
would<00:01:40.140> feed<00:01:40.380> so<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.189> single-celled

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
would feed so that's a single-celled

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.910 
would feed so that's a single-celled
organism<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:45.479> here<00:01:45.899> is<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.320> cleaner<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
organism this here is a you cleaner you

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100 
organism this here is a you cleaner you
cleaner<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.869> chloroplasts<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:48.930> them

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
cleaner have chloroplasts in them

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.740 
cleaner have chloroplasts in them
because<00:01:49.500> not<00:01:50.340> only<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.850> ingest<00:01:51.299> food<00:01:51.390> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
because not only do they ingest food but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.800 
because not only do they ingest food but
then<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> also<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.439> photosynthesis<00:01:53.159> so

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
then they can also do photosynthesis so

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.760 
then they can also do photosynthesis so
just<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.899> show<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.350> they<00:01:55.530> could

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
just to show you how they could

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.569 
just to show you how they could
reproduce<00:01:56.040> we<00:01:56.820> can<00:01:57.000> watch<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.570> video<00:01:57.780> here

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
reproduce we can watch this video here

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
reproduce we can watch this video here
we're<00:01:59.579> just<00:01:59.640> going<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> show<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.210> how<00:02:00.570> this

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
we're just going to show you how this

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.190 
we're just going to show you how this
one<00:02:01.860> cell<00:02:02.490> organism<00:02:03.149> let's<00:02:03.719> fill<00:02:03.960> with<00:02:04.079> all

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
one cell organism let's fill with all

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.420 
one cell organism let's fill with all
these<00:02:04.259> little<00:02:04.380> chloroplasts<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> all

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
these little chloroplasts so that all

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
these little chloroplasts so that all
these<00:02:05.579> dots<00:02:05.820> aren't<00:02:06.000> cells<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.990> one<00:02:07.200> cell

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
these dots aren't cells this is one cell

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.389 
these dots aren't cells this is one cell
filled<00:02:07.799> with<00:02:07.890> a<00:02:07.920> bunch<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> little

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
filled with a bunch of little

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.160 
filled with a bunch of little
chloroplasts<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.479> we're<00:02:09.569> gonna<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.899> how<00:02:10.080> it

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
chloroplasts so we're gonna see how it

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.160 
chloroplasts so we're gonna see how it
reproduces<00:02:10.649> by<00:02:10.709> binary<00:02:11.069> fission

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.380 

so<00:02:16.170> this<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.500> almost<00:02:17.150> symbolizing<00:02:18.150> or

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
so this is almost symbolizing or

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.039 
so this is almost symbolizing or
re-enacting<00:02:19.349> mitosis<00:02:19.920> where<00:02:20.819> one<00:02:21.569> cell<00:02:21.840> will

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
re-enacting mitosis where one cell will

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.600 
re-enacting mitosis where one cell will
split<00:02:22.290> down<00:02:22.439> into<00:02:22.799> two<00:02:22.950> cells<00:02:25.220> so<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:26.250> one

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
split down into two cells so that one

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.170 
split down into two cells so that one
organism<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.329> one<00:02:27.480> Paramecium<00:02:29.180> it's

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
organism that one Paramecium it's

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.440 
organism that one Paramecium it's
basically<00:02:30.690> splitting<00:02:31.049> into<00:02:31.319> two<00:02:35.450> by

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
basically splitting into two by

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.569 
basically splitting into two by
stretching<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:38.870> then<00:02:39.870> we<00:02:39.989> can<00:02:40.140> also<00:02:40.260> see<00:02:40.650> how

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
stretching and then we can also see how

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.030 
stretching and then we can also see how
this<00:02:42.120> little<00:02:42.299> slime<00:02:42.750> mold<00:02:43.019> here<00:02:43.260> grows<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
this little slime mold here grows so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.640 
this little slime mold here grows so
this<00:02:44.189> is<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.370> single<00:02:44.760> cell<00:02:44.970> and<00:02:45.329> it's<00:02:46.200> basically

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
this is a single cell and it's basically

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.680 
this is a single cell and it's basically
stretching<00:02:47.010> so<00:02:47.790> that's<00:02:48.000> an<00:02:48.120> organism<00:02:48.540> too

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
stretching so that's an organism too

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:49.910 
stretching so that's an organism too
because<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.049> has<00:02:49.170> to<00:02:49.260> undergo<00:02:49.530> all<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.829> those

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because it has to undergo all of those

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:00.319 
because it has to undergo all of those
processes<00:02:58.639> so<00:02:59.639> you<00:02:59.730> can<00:02:59.879> see<00:03:00.060> how<00:03:00.209> that

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
processes so you can see how that

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.729 
processes so you can see how that
organism<00:03:00.780> moves<00:03:00.959> around<00:03:03.200> so<00:03:04.200> all<00:03:04.440> of<00:03:04.620> those

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
organism moves around so all of those

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.379 
organism moves around so all of those
organisms<00:03:05.159> each<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:05.609> those<00:03:05.700> three<00:03:06.000> ones<00:03:06.180> even

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
organisms each of those three ones even

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.149 
organisms each of those three ones even
though<00:03:06.599> they're<00:03:06.780> organisms<00:03:07.349> they're<00:03:08.010> only

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
though they're organisms they're only

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.180 
though they're organisms they're only
made<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.519> one<00:03:08.760> cell<00:03:09.120> so<00:03:09.900> when<00:03:10.079> you<00:03:10.170> take<00:03:10.440> one

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
made of one cell so when you take one

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.729 
made of one cell so when you take one
cell<00:03:11.549> and<00:03:11.849> you<00:03:12.720> multiply<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.230> by<00:03:13.530> maybe

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
cell and you multiply it by maybe

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.550 
cell and you multiply it by maybe
millions<00:03:14.459> trillions<00:03:15.000> or<00:03:15.450> maybe<00:03:16.290> just

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
millions trillions or maybe just

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.770 
millions trillions or maybe just
billions<00:03:16.879> then<00:03:17.879> you'll<00:03:18.090> get<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.329> multicellular

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
billions then you'll get a multicellular

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.619 
billions then you'll get a multicellular
organism<00:03:19.410> so<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.370> way<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.639> those<00:03:20.819> organisms

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
organism so the way that those organisms

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.129 
organism so the way that those organisms
are<00:03:22.079> organized<00:03:22.949> is<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:24.180> you<00:03:24.359> have<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.569> cell<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
are organized is that you have a cell a

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.830 
are organized is that you have a cell a
cell<00:03:25.889> will<00:03:26.040> make<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:26.370> tissues<00:03:26.579> tissues<00:03:27.510> will

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
cell will make up tissues tissues will

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.170 
cell will make up tissues tissues will
make<00:03:27.989> up<00:03:28.109> organs<00:03:28.459> organs<00:03:29.459> will<00:03:29.609> make<00:03:29.730> up<00:03:29.879> organ

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
make up organs organs will make up organ

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.569 
make up organs organs will make up organ
systems<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.750> organ<00:03:31.620> systems<00:03:31.949> will<00:03:32.160> make<00:03:32.310> up<00:03:32.489> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
systems and organ systems will make up a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.699 
systems and organ systems will make up a
multicellular<00:03:32.970> organism<00:03:33.199> like<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.379> or<00:03:34.500> I<00:03:34.560> or

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
multicellular organism like you or I or

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.900 
multicellular organism like you or I or
a<00:03:35.010> dog<00:03:35.310> or<00:03:35.489> cat<00:03:37.069> so<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.400> all<00:03:38.519> the<00:03:38.669> different

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
a dog or cat so of all the different

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.199 
a dog or cat so of all the different
types<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> cells<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.840> there<00:03:40.169> are<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.910> look<00:03:42.060> at

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
types of cells that there are we look at

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.670 
types of cells that there are we look at
a<00:03:42.239> cheek<00:03:42.480> cell<00:03:42.720> and<00:03:42.989> we<00:03:43.079> looked<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.349> a<00:03:43.379> plant

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
a cheek cell and we looked at a plant

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.949 
a cheek cell and we looked at a plant
cell<00:03:43.949> but<00:03:44.489> there's<00:03:44.639> other<00:03:44.790> cells<00:03:45.090> like<00:03:45.629> these

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
cell but there's other cells like these

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.500 
cell but there's other cells like these
ones<00:03:46.169> here<00:03:46.349> these<00:03:46.560> are<00:03:46.739> muscle<00:03:47.069> cells<00:03:47.510> so

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
ones here these are muscle cells so

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.449 
ones here these are muscle cells so
they're<00:03:48.660> kind<00:03:48.870> of<00:03:48.959> long<00:03:49.169> and<00:03:49.349> flat<00:03:49.590> these<00:03:50.280> are

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
they're kind of long and flat these are

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.430 
they're kind of long and flat these are
bone<00:03:50.669> cells<00:03:51.410> these<00:03:52.410> are<00:03:52.650> neural<00:03:53.069> cells<00:03:54.440> these

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
bone cells these are neural cells these

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.409 
bone cells these are neural cells these
would<00:03:55.739> be<00:03:55.919> like<00:03:56.250> skin<00:03:56.579> cells<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:57.000> you<00:03:57.269> guys

00:03:57.409 --> 00:03:57.419 
would be like skin cells that you guys

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.659 
would be like skin cells that you guys
have<00:03:57.599> already<00:03:57.720> seen<00:03:57.919> these<00:03:58.919> are<00:03:59.099> plant<00:03:59.370> cells

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
have already seen these are plant cells

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.099 
have already seen these are plant cells
because<00:04:00.090> you<00:04:00.180> have<00:04:00.299> chloroplasts<00:04:00.840> in<00:04:00.930> them

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
because you have chloroplasts in them

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.159 
because you have chloroplasts in them
and<00:04:01.319> these<00:04:01.919> would<00:04:02.099> be<00:04:02.190> blood<00:04:02.430> cells<00:04:02.699> so<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.780> the

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
and these would be blood cells so on the

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:05.750 
and these would be blood cells so on the
left<00:04:04.379> you<00:04:04.530> have<00:04:04.560> our<00:04:04.769> red<00:04:04.980> blood<00:04:05.220> cell<00:04:05.430> carries

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
left you have our red blood cell carries

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.729 
left you have our red blood cell carries
oxygen<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.810> right<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.169> have<00:04:07.199> a<00:04:07.409> white

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
oxygen on the right you have a white

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.949 
oxygen on the right you have a white
blood<00:04:07.949> cell<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.760> is<00:04:09.060> one<00:04:09.359> of<00:04:09.479> these<00:04:09.659> cells

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
blood cell that is one of these cells

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.379 
blood cell that is one of these cells
that<00:04:10.079> fight<00:04:10.409> off<00:04:10.560> bacteria<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.150> type<00:04:12.359> of

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
that fight off bacteria and a type of

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:14.119 
that fight off bacteria and a type of
disease<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:12.840> infection<00:04:13.079> and<00:04:13.470> then<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.040> the

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
disease or infection and then in the

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.189 
disease or infection and then in the
middle<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:14.489> have<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:15.030> platelet<00:04:15.419> which

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
middle you have a platelet which

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.560 
middle you have a platelet which
basically<00:04:16.680> is<00:04:16.949> used<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:17.370> clog<00:04:18.120> your<00:04:18.150> blood

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
basically is used to clog your blood

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.500 
basically is used to clog your blood
it's<00:04:18.720> a<00:04:18.780> clotting<00:04:19.019> factor<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:21.120> with<00:04:21.269> all<00:04:21.419> those

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
it's a clotting factor so with all those

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.850 
it's a clotting factor so with all those
different<00:04:21.719> types<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.169> cells<00:04:22.380> that<00:04:22.469> there<00:04:22.710> are

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
different types of cells that there are

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.649 
different types of cells that there are
when<00:04:23.340> you<00:04:23.460> put<00:04:23.490> those<00:04:23.820> cells<00:04:24.060> together<00:04:24.419> they

00:04:24.649 --> 00:04:24.659 
when you put those cells together they

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:26.029 
when you put those cells together they
make<00:04:24.840> up<00:04:24.990> something<00:04:25.169> called<00:04:25.289> a<00:04:25.500> tissue<00:04:25.710> and

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
make up something called a tissue and

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:26.650 
make up something called a tissue and
two

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
two

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.940 
two
they're<00:04:26.900> made<00:04:27.020> up<00:04:27.170> of<00:04:27.290> cells<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:27.740> have

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
they're made up of cells that have

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.160 
they're made up of cells that have
similar<00:04:28.190> functions<00:04:28.730> so<00:04:29.420> the<00:04:29.600> four<00:04:29.780> types<00:04:30.020> of

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
similar functions so the four types of

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.290 
similar functions so the four types of
tissues<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.650> we<00:04:30.770> have<00:04:31.010> that<00:04:31.670> are<00:04:31.790> connective

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
tissues that we have that are connective

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.870 
tissues that we have that are connective
epithelial<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.800> basically<00:04:34.130> means<00:04:34.370> near<00:04:34.700> the

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
epithelial it basically means near the

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.690 
epithelial it basically means near the
surface<00:04:35.410> muscle<00:04:36.410> tissue<00:04:36.590> and<00:04:36.920> nervous<00:04:37.580> tissue

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
surface muscle tissue and nervous tissue

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.990 
surface muscle tissue and nervous tissue
so<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:39.020> connective<00:04:39.380> tissue<00:04:39.760> supports<00:04:40.760> other

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
so the connective tissue supports other

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.760 
so the connective tissue supports other
tissue<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.510> binds<00:04:41.720> tissues<00:04:42.140> together<00:04:42.440> so

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
tissue and binds tissues together so

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:43.930 
tissue and binds tissues together so
when<00:04:42.920> you<00:04:43.010> go<00:04:43.100> to<00:04:43.130> do<00:04:43.310> your<00:04:43.400> dissection<00:04:43.850> of

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
when you go to do your dissection of

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.030 
when you go to do your dissection of
your<00:04:44.120> frog<00:04:44.390> you're<00:04:45.140> going<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.440> have<00:04:45.590> to<00:04:45.800> cut

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
your frog you're going to have to cut

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.620 
your frog you're going to have to cut
down<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.310> middle<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:46.670> frog<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.180> then

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
down the middle of the frog and then

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:48.700 
down the middle of the frog and then
you're<00:04:47.780> going<00:04:47.900> to<00:04:47.990> have<00:04:48.080> to<00:04:48.200> peel<00:04:48.380> back<00:04:48.410> the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
you're going to have to peel back the

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.040 
you're going to have to peel back the
skin<00:04:48.790> by<00:04:49.790> releasing<00:04:50.270> some<00:04:50.540> of<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.720> connective

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
skin by releasing some of the connective

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.080 
skin by releasing some of the connective
tissue<00:04:51.290> that's<00:04:51.920> connecting<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.580> skin<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
tissue that's connecting the skin to the

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.200 
tissue that's connecting the skin to the
muscles<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:54.590> epithelial<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.730> provides

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
muscles the epithelial that provides

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.060 
muscles the epithelial that provides
coverings<00:04:56.630> and<00:04:56.750> linings<00:04:57.170> so<00:04:57.500> all<00:04:57.740> of<00:04:57.890> your

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
coverings and linings so all of your

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.390 
coverings and linings so all of your
organs<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.200> obviously<00:05:00.200> your<00:05:01.010> skin<00:05:01.280> is

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
organs and obviously your skin is

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.690 
organs and obviously your skin is
epithelial<00:05:01.970> -<00:05:02.320> epithelium<00:05:03.320> what<00:05:04.310> it<00:05:04.400> does<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
epithelial - epithelium what it does is

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.760 
epithelial - epithelium what it does is
it<00:05:04.820> covers<00:05:05.000> all<00:05:05.450> of<00:05:05.480> your<00:05:05.690> organs<00:05:06.020> and<00:05:06.380> so<00:05:06.650> all

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
it covers all of your organs and so all

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.170 
it covers all of your organs and so all
your<00:05:06.950> organs<00:05:07.280> are<00:05:07.370> covered<00:05:07.670> in<00:05:07.760> this<00:05:07.910> certain

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
your organs are covered in this certain

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.690 
your organs are covered in this certain
type<00:05:08.300> of<00:05:08.420> tissue<00:05:08.570> all<00:05:09.320> muscles<00:05:10.130> are<00:05:10.340> made<00:05:10.520> of

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
type of tissue all muscles are made of

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.500 
type of tissue all muscles are made of
long<00:05:11.330> strated<00:05:12.080> tissue<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.910> those<00:05:14.150> basically

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
long strated tissue and those basically

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.570 
long strated tissue and those basically
contract<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.350> make<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.620> muscle<00:05:15.920> contract<00:05:16.310> and

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
contract to make the muscle contract and

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.240 
contract to make the muscle contract and
then<00:05:17.150> you<00:05:17.270> also<00:05:17.390> have<00:05:17.600> the<00:05:17.690> nervous<00:05:17.960> tissue

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:18.250 
then you also have the nervous tissue

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.860 
then you also have the nervous tissue
which<00:05:19.250> carries<00:05:19.700> messages<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:20.330> all<00:05:20.540> the<00:05:20.660> parts

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
which carries messages to all the parts

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.600 
which carries messages to all the parts
of<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.020> body<00:05:21.140> so<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.950> those<00:05:22.100> four<00:05:22.280> types<00:05:22.490> of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
of the body so of those four types of

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.820 
of the body so of those four types of
tissues<00:05:22.970> if<00:05:23.450> you<00:05:23.600> put<00:05:23.840> certain<00:05:24.500> tissues

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:24.830 
tissues if you put certain tissues

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.650 
tissues if you put certain tissues
together<00:05:25.040> you<00:05:25.580> can<00:05:25.730> make<00:05:25.850> up<00:05:25.970> a<00:05:26.060> whole<00:05:26.210> organ

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
together you can make up a whole organ

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.850 
together you can make up a whole organ
so<00:05:27.650> for<00:05:27.830> example<00:05:28.220> if<00:05:28.670> you<00:05:28.820> take<00:05:29.030> all<00:05:29.240> of<00:05:29.300> that

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
so for example if you take all of that

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.500 
so for example if you take all of that
muscle<00:05:30.860> tissue<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.430> put<00:05:31.820> it<00:05:31.940> together<00:05:32.090> into

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
muscle tissue and put it together into

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.260 
muscle tissue and put it together into
something<00:05:33.500> called<00:05:33.770> a<00:05:33.890> heart<00:05:34.220> then<00:05:34.820> that<00:05:35.060> heart

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
something called a heart then that heart

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.670 
something called a heart then that heart
has<00:05:35.450> a<00:05:35.480> certain<00:05:35.840> function<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.320> it<00:05:36.410> undergoes

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
has a certain function that it undergoes

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.070 
has a certain function that it undergoes
so<00:05:37.670> when<00:05:37.850> you<00:05:37.940> take<00:05:38.120> certain<00:05:38.360> tissues<00:05:38.870> that

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
so when you take certain tissues that

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.690 
so when you take certain tissues that
specialize<00:05:39.530> in<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.740> certain<00:05:40.010> job<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.460> put<00:05:40.580> them

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
specialize in a certain job and put them

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.180 
specialize in a certain job and put them
together<00:05:40.850> they<00:05:41.480> can<00:05:41.600> turn<00:05:41.720> into<00:05:41.870> an<00:05:42.050> organ<00:05:42.410> so

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
together they can turn into an organ so

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.040 
together they can turn into an organ so
here<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.580> have<00:05:43.700> a<00:05:43.730> stomach<00:05:44.210> that's<00:05:44.420> an<00:05:44.720> organ

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
here you have a stomach that's an organ

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:51.100 
here you have a stomach that's an organ
lungs<00:05:46.060> kidneys<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.660> bladder<00:05:48.260> an<00:05:48.680> eye<00:05:49.190> and<00:05:50.110> this

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
lungs kidneys a bladder an eye and this

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.170 
lungs kidneys a bladder an eye and this
is<00:05:51.290> your<00:05:51.410> liver<00:05:51.590> and<00:05:51.890> there's<00:05:52.670> your<00:05:52.790> pancreas

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
is your liver and there's your pancreas

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.360 
is your liver and there's your pancreas
so<00:05:53.780> when<00:05:53.900> you<00:05:53.990> take<00:05:54.200> certain<00:05:54.470> tissues<00:05:55.130> put

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
so when you take certain tissues put

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.710 
so when you take certain tissues put
them<00:05:55.490> together<00:05:55.610> you<00:05:55.910> can<00:05:56.030> make<00:05:56.120> an<00:05:56.240> organ<00:05:56.540> like

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
them together you can make an organ like

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.390 
them together you can make an organ like
neural<00:05:57.260> tissue<00:05:57.470> put<00:05:57.830> together<00:05:57.950> will<00:05:58.250> make<00:05:58.340> a

00:05:58.390 --> 00:05:58.400 
neural tissue put together will make a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.950 
neural tissue put together will make a
brain<00:06:00.010> when<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.100> put<00:06:01.370> organs<00:06:01.910> together<00:06:02.480> you

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
brain when you put organs together you

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:06.370 
brain when you put organs together you
make<00:06:03.140> organ<00:06:03.470> systems<00:06:04.360> so<00:06:05.360> for<00:06:05.720> example<00:06:06.140> here's

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
make organ systems so for example here's

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.130 
make organ systems so for example here's
all<00:06:06.650> of<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.950> 12<00:06:07.220> organ<00:06:07.730> systems<00:06:08.120> this<00:06:08.780> is<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
all of the 12 organ systems this is the

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.570 
all of the 12 organ systems this is the
integra<00:06:09.560> mentary<00:06:09.890> system<00:06:10.280> which<00:06:10.460> is

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
integra mentary system which is

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.420 
integra mentary system which is
basically<00:06:10.880> your<00:06:11.030> skin<00:06:11.830> this<00:06:12.830> is<00:06:12.890> the<00:06:13.100> muscle

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
basically your skin this is the muscle

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.190 
basically your skin this is the muscle
system<00:06:13.760> so<00:06:13.970> you<00:06:14.060> have<00:06:14.210> all<00:06:14.450> these<00:06:14.600> individual

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:15.200 
system so you have all these individual

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.340 
system so you have all these individual
muscles<00:06:15.560> made<00:06:16.130> up<00:06:16.250> of<00:06:16.370> muscle<00:06:16.550> tissue<00:06:16.820> and<00:06:17.350> all

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
muscles made up of muscle tissue and all

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.810 
muscles made up of muscle tissue and all
those<00:06:18.500> muscles<00:06:18.830> together<00:06:18.980> make<00:06:19.640> up<00:06:19.670> the

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
those muscles together make up the

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.140 
those muscles together make up the
muscle<00:06:20.330> or<00:06:20.600> muscular<00:06:20.990> system<00:06:21.800> all<00:06:22.100> of<00:06:23.030> the

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
muscle or muscular system all of the

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.890 
muscle or muscular system all of the
bone<00:06:23.330> cells<00:06:23.600> put<00:06:23.960> together<00:06:24.110> into<00:06:24.820> tissue

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
bone cells put together into tissue

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.560 
bone cells put together into tissue
makes<00:06:26.900> the<00:06:27.380> skeletal<00:06:27.800> system<00:06:27.920> all<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:29.300> neural

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
makes the skeletal system all the neural

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.090 
makes the skeletal system all the neural
cells<00:06:29.870> put<00:06:30.140> together<00:06:30.260> into<00:06:30.530> nervous<00:06:30.890> tissue

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:31.100 
cells put together into nervous tissue

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.460 
cells put together into nervous tissue
makes<00:06:31.490> the<00:06:31.640> nervous<00:06:31.940> system<00:06:32.270> and<00:06:32.510> then<00:06:33.050> so<00:06:33.350> on

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
makes the nervous system and then so on

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.020 
makes the nervous system and then so on
goes<00:06:33.740> for<00:06:33.950> the<00:06:34.010> endocrine<00:06:34.490> system<00:06:34.520> the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
goes for the endocrine system the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:38.370 
goes for the endocrine system the
circulatory<00:06:35.750> system<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:37.760> lymphatic<00:06:37.940> system

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
circulatory system the lymphatic system

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.520 
circulatory system the lymphatic system
the<00:06:39.380> respiratory<00:06:39.740> system

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
the respiratory system

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.680 
the respiratory system
the<00:06:40.710> digestive<00:06:41.190> system<00:06:41.220> the<00:06:41.850> urinary<00:06:42.570> system

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
the digestive system the urinary system

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.470 
the digestive system the urinary system
and<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:43.770> reproductive<00:06:44.190> system<00:06:44.460> so<00:06:45.270> the<00:06:45.360> one

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.480 
and the reproductive system so the one

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.670 
and the reproductive system so the one
that<00:06:45.600> we're<00:06:45.690> going<00:06:45.780> to<00:06:45.840> be<00:06:45.960> focusing<00:06:46.320> on<00:06:46.470> is

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 
that we're going to be focusing on is

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.180 
that we're going to be focusing on is
the<00:06:46.710> digestive<00:06:47.250> system<00:06:48.740> so<00:06:49.740> when<00:06:49.860> you<00:06:49.980> take

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
the digestive system so when you take

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.920 
the digestive system so when you take
organ<00:06:50.580> systems<00:06:50.940> and<00:06:51.060> put<00:06:51.240> them<00:06:51.360> together<00:06:51.540> they

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
organ systems and put them together they

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.600 
organ systems and put them together they
make<00:06:52.110> something<00:06:52.440> called<00:06:52.590> an<00:06:52.800> organism<00:06:53.430> like

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
make something called an organism like

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.720 
make something called an organism like
you<00:06:53.790> and<00:06:53.970> I<00:06:54.030> so<00:06:54.930> an<00:06:55.050> organism<00:06:55.560> is<00:06:55.740> made<00:06:55.980> up<00:06:56.190> of<00:06:56.370> a

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:56.730 
you and I so an organism is made up of a

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:58.040 
you and I so an organism is made up of a
bunch<00:06:56.760> of<00:06:57.030> different<00:06:57.180> organ<00:06:57.570> systems<00:06:57.870> put

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
bunch of different organ systems put

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.740 
bunch of different organ systems put
together<00:06:58.170> and<00:06:59.000> organisms<00:07:00.000> can<00:07:00.420> take<00:07:00.600> in

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:00.750 
together and organisms can take in

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.110 
together and organisms can take in
material<00:07:01.230> they<00:07:02.010> can<00:07:02.070> produce<00:07:02.310> energy<00:07:02.550> they

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
material they can produce energy they

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.700 
material they can produce energy they
can<00:07:03.300> release<00:07:03.510> waste<00:07:03.810> they<00:07:04.110> can<00:07:04.290> grow<00:07:04.470> they<00:07:04.680> can

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
can release waste they can grow they can

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.170 
can release waste they can grow they can
respond<00:07:05.250> to<00:07:05.400> the<00:07:05.520> environment<00:07:05.940> and<00:07:06.060> they<00:07:06.150> can

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:06.180 
respond to the environment and they can

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:08.900 
respond to the environment and they can
reproduce<00:07:06.560> so<00:07:07.560> if<00:07:07.830> something<00:07:08.310> does<00:07:08.520> all<00:07:08.880> of

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
reproduce so if something does all of

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.940 
reproduce so if something does all of
these<00:07:09.360> things<00:07:09.690> it's<00:07:10.020> considered<00:07:10.410> to<00:07:10.530> be<00:07:10.710> an

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950 
these things it's considered to be an

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.280 
these things it's considered to be an
organism<00:07:11.520> and<00:07:11.700> all<00:07:11.850> organisms<00:07:12.300> can<00:07:12.750> do<00:07:12.930> all<00:07:13.140> of

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
organism and all organisms can do all of

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.500 
organism and all organisms can do all of
these<00:07:13.440> things<00:07:13.770> so<00:07:14.730> what<00:07:14.910> the<00:07:15.000> picture<00:07:15.270> below

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:15.510 
these things so what the picture below

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.740 
these things so what the picture below
is<00:07:15.660> showing<00:07:15.930> you<00:07:16.080> is<00:07:16.230> that<00:07:16.950> as<00:07:17.160> time

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
is showing you is that as time

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.720 
is showing you is that as time
progresses<00:07:19.310> animals<00:07:20.310> go<00:07:20.400> from<00:07:20.580> being

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:20.730 
progresses animals go from being

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.840 
progresses animals go from being
something<00:07:20.910> very<00:07:21.060> small<00:07:21.840> and<00:07:22.850> less

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
something very small and less

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.370 
something very small and less
complicated<00:07:24.419> to<00:07:24.870> something<00:07:25.200> more

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:25.380 
complicated to something more

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.060 
complicated to something more
complicated<00:07:25.669> like<00:07:26.669> mammals<00:07:27.330> such<00:07:27.750> as<00:07:27.810> whales

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:28.070 
complicated like mammals such as whales

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:32.380 
complicated like mammals such as whales
like<00:07:29.070> arthropods<00:07:29.610> such<00:07:29.880> as<00:07:30.030> crabs<00:07:30.470> worms

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:32.390 
like arthropods such as crabs worms

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.290 
like arthropods such as crabs worms
mollusks<00:07:33.390> like<00:07:33.780> snails<00:07:34.169> and<00:07:34.530> even<00:07:35.430> sea<00:07:35.760> stars

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
mollusks like snails and even sea stars

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.260 
mollusks like snails and even sea stars
so<00:07:36.720> all<00:07:36.870> these<00:07:37.080> organisms<00:07:37.440> are<00:07:37.770> multicellular

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270 
so all these organisms are multicellular

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.340 
so all these organisms are multicellular
but<00:07:39.270> they<00:07:39.360> all<00:07:39.510> had<00:07:39.690> to<00:07:39.780> come<00:07:39.930> from<00:07:40.140> something

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
but they all had to come from something

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.470 
but they all had to come from something
unicellular<00:07:40.919> that's<00:07:41.250> how<00:07:41.340> they<00:07:41.490> evolved<00:07:42.030> so

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:42.480 
unicellular that's how they evolved so

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.940 
unicellular that's how they evolved so
it's<00:07:42.600> important<00:07:42.960> that<00:07:42.990> we<00:07:43.200> understand<00:07:43.770> the

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:43.950 
it's important that we understand the

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.670 
it's important that we understand the
basis<00:07:44.490> of<00:07:44.520> their<00:07:45.120> evolution<00:07:45.600> the<00:07:46.080> cell<00:07:46.380> and

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 
basis of their evolution the cell and

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.280 
basis of their evolution the cell and
how<00:07:47.160> that<00:07:47.460> builds<00:07:48.330> on<00:07:48.419> itself<00:07:48.570> to<00:07:49.140> make

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290 
how that builds on itself to make

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:52.400 
how that builds on itself to make
something<00:07:49.500> like<00:07:49.770> you<00:07:50.160> and<00:07:50.310> I
