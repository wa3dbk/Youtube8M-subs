00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
I get well we're here today in Changi

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.370 
I get well we're here today in Changi
and<00:00:09.019> today<00:00:10.019> we're<00:00:10.590> going<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.800> talk<00:00:10.950> about<00:00:12.380> this

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and today we're going to talk about this

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.580 
and today we're going to talk about this
trio<00:00:13.700> are<00:00:14.700> chunky<00:00:15.179> basically<00:00:15.960> comes<00:00:16.230> from<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
trio are chunky basically comes from the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.210 
trio are chunky basically comes from the
word<00:00:17.390> chenghai<00:00:18.390> and<00:00:18.630> chenghai<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.680> actually<00:00:20.189> a

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
word chenghai and chenghai is actually a

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820 
word chenghai and chenghai is actually a
type<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.460> tree<00:00:21.080> this<00:00:22.080> is<00:00:22.230> not<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> chenghai

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
type of tree this is not the chenghai

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.300 
type of tree this is not the chenghai
tree<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.340> this<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.670> close<00:00:24.029> relative<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
tree but this is a close relative of the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.519 
tree but this is a close relative of the
chin<00:00:26.310> wifey<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.939> snow<00:00:27.599> Nazz<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.039> dumb<00:00:29.039> Amelia

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
chin wifey and snow Nazz the dumb Amelia

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.420 
chin wifey and snow Nazz the dumb Amelia
now<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.590> thing<00:00:31.859> about<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.820> name<00:00:33.030> Changi<00:00:33.930> and

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
now the thing about the name Changi and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.940 
now the thing about the name Changi and
changa<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:36.200> very<00:00:37.200> much<00:00:37.290> linked<00:00:37.770> together

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
changa is that very much linked together

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.930 
changa is that very much linked together
and<00:00:38.570> one<00:00:39.570> reason<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:39.989> because<00:00:40.730> chenghai<00:00:41.730> as

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
and one reason is because chenghai as

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.369 
and one reason is because chenghai as
the<00:00:42.360> wood<00:00:42.570> goes<00:00:43.399> actually<00:00:44.399> its<00:00:45.270> own<00:00:45.510> word<00:00:45.899> that

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the wood goes actually its own word that

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.690 
the wood goes actually its own word that
comes<00:00:46.559> from<00:00:46.950> Tamil<00:00:47.910> Nadu<00:00:48.030> India<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:49.700> Tamil

the southern tip of India in fact is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.529 
the southern tip of India in fact is
considered<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.949> equivalent<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.670> Cape<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
considered the equivalent of Cape of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.590 
considered the equivalent of Cape of
Good<00:00:57.570> Hope<00:00:58.309> and<00:00:59.309> during<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.239> olden<00:01:00.570> days

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
Good Hope and during the olden days

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.320 
Good Hope and during the olden days
people<00:01:02.030> would<00:01:03.030> basically<00:01:03.470> use<00:01:05.330> chenghai

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
people would basically use chenghai

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.050 
people would basically use chenghai
which<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> tropical<00:01:07.979> hardwood<00:01:08.659> to<00:01:09.659> actually

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
which is a tropical hardwood to actually

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.420 
which is a tropical hardwood to actually
fabricate<00:01:12.060> ships<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.080> boats<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.830> anything

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
fabricate ships and boats and anything

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.390 
fabricate ships and boats and anything
that<00:01:14.460> has<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.530> water<00:01:16.530> resistance<00:01:17.220> is

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
that has to do with water resistance is

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.600 
that has to do with water resistance is
it<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.970> equivalent<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:19.049> plastic

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
it was the equivalent of the plastic

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.090 
it was the equivalent of the plastic
during<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.700> Age<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.030> sail<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:22.650> one<00:01:22.799> reason

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
during the Age of sail and one reason

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
during the Age of sail and one reason
was<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.200> chenghai<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.380> far<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> wood

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
was because chenghai as far as the wood

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.530 
was because chenghai as far as the wood
is<00:01:26.159> concerned<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.600> lot<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> oils

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
is concerned has a lot of oils

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.720 
is concerned has a lot of oils
and<00:01:30.130> it<00:01:31.130> has<00:01:31.310> a<00:01:31.340> very<00:01:31.670> high<00:01:31.970> silica<00:01:32.960> content

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
and it has a very high silica content

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.160 
and it has a very high silica content
but<00:01:34.730> all<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.180> important<00:01:35.690> because<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.140> oil

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
but all is important because the oil

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.020 
but all is important because the oil
prevents<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.160> wood<00:01:37.340> for<00:01:37.580> night<00:01:37.760> it<00:01:37.910> is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
prevents the wood for night it is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.290 
prevents the wood for night it is
splitting<00:01:39.040> when<00:01:40.040> is<00:01:40.160> exposed<00:01:40.580> to<00:01:40.670> elements

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
splitting when is exposed to elements

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.540 
splitting when is exposed to elements
and<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.470> silica<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.160> basically<00:01:43.700> an<00:01:43.850> actual

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
and the silica is basically an actual

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.330 
and the silica is basically an actual
natural<00:01:46.550> sand<00:01:47.060> paper<00:01:47.300> that<00:01:47.570> prevents<00:01:48.340> that

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
natural sand paper that prevents that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.160 
natural sand paper that prevents that
prevents<00:01:49.700> it<00:01:49.880> from<00:01:49.970> getting<00:01:50.180> too<00:01:50.479> slippery<00:01:50.870> so

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
prevents it from getting too slippery so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.530 
prevents it from getting too slippery so
is<00:01:51.290> good<00:01:51.530> for<00:01:51.710> sure<00:01:51.920> footing<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.580> whenever

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
is good for sure footing and whenever

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.580 
is good for sure footing and whenever
you<00:01:53.810> tie<00:01:53.990> rope<00:01:54.290> over<00:01:54.710> a<00:01:55.180> piece<00:01:56.180> on<00:01:56.410> changa<00:01:57.410> you

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
you tie rope over a piece on changa you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.250 
you tie rope over a piece on changa you
can<00:01:57.800> be<00:01:57.920> assured<00:01:58.010> that<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.550> doesn't<00:01:58.910> basically

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
can be assured that it doesn't basically

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.359 
can be assured that it doesn't basically
slip<00:02:00.260> off<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:03.229> third<00:02:03.440> thing<00:02:03.470> about<00:02:03.890> changa<00:02:04.310> is

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
slip off the third thing about changa is

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:07.900 
slip off the third thing about changa is
that<00:02:04.729> is<00:02:05.479> incredibly<00:02:06.550> resilient<00:02:07.550> and

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
that is incredibly resilient and

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.080 
that is incredibly resilient and
flexible<00:02:08.380> and<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:10.820> realized<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:12.790> people<00:02:13.790> say

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
flexible and I realized that people say

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.960 
flexible and I realized that people say
that<00:02:14.300> both<00:02:14.600> in<00:02:14.990> Asia<00:02:15.290> of<00:02:15.530> antiquity<00:02:16.130> used<00:02:16.850> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
that both in Asia of antiquity used to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.180 
that both in Asia of antiquity used to
be<00:02:17.120> constructed<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:17.990> teak<00:02:18.380> but<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.070> be

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
be constructed out of teak but to be

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.010 
be constructed out of teak but to be
honest<00:02:19.459> with<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.730> can't<00:02:20.030> imagine<00:02:20.390> how<00:02:20.540> how

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
honest with you I can't imagine how how

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.180 
honest with you I can't imagine how how
that<00:02:21.290> could<00:02:21.470> be<00:02:21.500> so<00:02:21.970> because<00:02:22.970> firstly<00:02:23.330> teak<00:02:23.630> is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that could be so because firstly teak is

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.340 
that could be so because firstly teak is
this<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:27.320> grown<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:28.690> locations<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.870> are<00:02:30.200> very

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
this is grown in locations that are very

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.430 
this is grown in locations that are very
far<00:02:30.739> away<00:02:30.860> from<00:02:30.980> coastal<00:02:31.520> region

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
far away from coastal region

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.360 
far away from coastal region
and<00:02:33.780> secondly<00:02:36.600> they<00:02:37.600> take<00:02:37.840> as<00:02:38.020> long<00:02:38.470> as<00:02:38.680> six<00:02:39.220> to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
and secondly they take as long as six to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.760 
and secondly they take as long as six to
seven<00:02:39.670> times<00:02:39.820> longer<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.420> growth<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:40.810> Cheng

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
seven times longer the growth and Cheng

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.980
