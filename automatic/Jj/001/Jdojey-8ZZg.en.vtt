00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
now we can move on to our next bit which

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.120 
now we can move on to our next bit which
is<00:01:38.159> miso<00:01:38.850> rice<00:01:39.290> so<00:01:40.290> it's<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> very<00:01:40.650> simple<00:01:40.890> rice

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
is miso rice so it's a very simple rice

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.859 
is miso rice so it's a very simple rice
dish<00:01:41.400> we're<00:01:41.759> going<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:41.909> cook<00:01:42.180> it<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.479> Lee<00:01:42.659> so

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
dish we're going to cook it in Lee so

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.749 
dish we're going to cook it in Lee so
stock<00:01:43.259> okay<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:43.979> gives<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.250> extra<00:01:44.520> flavor

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
stock okay so it gives it extra flavor

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
stock okay so it gives it extra flavor
and<00:01:45.299> this<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.540> just<00:01:45.750> one<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.079> bought<00:01:46.320> miso<00:01:46.860> soup

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and this is just one we bought miso soup

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.300 
and this is just one we bought miso soup
so<00:01:48.090> what<00:01:48.299> would<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> find<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.930> there<00:01:49.140> miso<00:01:50.040> is

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310

is just a long grain but you can

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.750 
is just a long grain but you can
actually

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
actually

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.450 
actually
fancy<00:02:07.450> wafer<00:02:08.020> or<00:02:08.290> whatever<00:02:08.830> you've<00:02:08.950> got<00:02:08.980> that

fancy wafer or whatever you've got that

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.210 
fancy wafer or whatever you've got that
can<00:02:09.610> go<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.820> as<00:02:09.910> well<00:02:10.120> do<00:02:10.660> that<00:02:10.810> one<00:02:10.990> stir<00:02:11.350> and

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
can go in as well do that one stir and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.190 
can go in as well do that one stir and
that'll<00:02:12.460> need<00:02:12.610> 10<00:02:12.910> or<00:02:12.940> 12<00:02:13.210> minutes<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:14.020> cook

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
that'll need 10 or 12 minutes to cook

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.690 
that'll need 10 or 12 minutes to cook
out<00:02:14.380> but<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> should<00:02:14.890> absorb<00:02:15.250> all<00:02:15.550> of<00:02:15.580> that

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
out but it should absorb all of that

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.160 
out but it should absorb all of that
water<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.360> now<00:02:16.540> we<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> look<00:02:17.020> out

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
water and now we can have a look out

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.150 
water and now we can have a look out
tofu<00:02:17.770> tofu<00:02:18.190> yes<00:02:19.350> convince<00:02:20.350> me<00:02:20.620> you're<00:02:20.980> not

applause yes bean curd and then
basically<00:02:34.990> it's<00:02:35.380> pressed<00:02:36.070> so<00:02:36.520> you<00:02:36.580> get<00:02:36.820> this

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
basically it's pressed so you get this

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.470 
basically it's pressed so you get this
very<00:02:37.320> soft<00:02:38.320> rubbery<00:02:38.800> texture<00:02:39.310> kind<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.420> a

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
very soft rubbery texture kind of a

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.540 
very soft rubbery texture kind of a
spongy<00:02:40.840> it's<00:02:41.110> got<00:02:41.290> very<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.590> flavor<00:02:41.980> yeah

really high in protein yeah it's a very
low<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.160> fat<00:02:54.340> and<00:02:54.760> we've<00:02:54.880> been<00:02:55.000> asked<00:02:55.240> for<00:02:55.300> it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
low in fat and we've been asked for it

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.670 
low in fat and we've been asked for it
loads<00:02:55.630> that's<00:02:55.990> exactly<00:02:56.410> what<00:02:56.500> we're<00:02:56.590> gonna

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
loads that's exactly what we're gonna

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.220 
loads that's exactly what we're gonna
give<00:02:56.830> it<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.950> go<00:02:57.070> place<00:02:57.490> it<00:02:57.520> on<00:02:57.790> to<00:02:58.120> some<00:02:58.900> kitchen

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
give it a go place it on to some kitchen

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.570 
give it a go place it on to some kitchen
roll<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.920> if<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.190> get<00:03:00.250> small<00:03:00.430> that

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
roll then if you can get small that

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.800 
roll then if you can get small that
wouldn't<00:03:00.790> get<00:03:00.880> as<00:03:00.970> much<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.390> moisture<00:03:01.780> out

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
wouldn't get as much that moisture out

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.540 
wouldn't get as much that moisture out
there<00:03:01.930> as<00:03:02.170> possible<00:03:02.320> kind<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:03.040> roll<00:03:03.370> it<00:03:03.400> over

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:03.550 
there as possible kind of roll it over

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.180 
there as possible kind of roll it over
all<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.060> Pat<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.990> down<00:03:05.140> basically<00:03:05.740> get<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:05.980> pan<00:03:06.160> a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
all it Pat it down basically get a pan a

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.580 
all it Pat it down basically get a pan a
