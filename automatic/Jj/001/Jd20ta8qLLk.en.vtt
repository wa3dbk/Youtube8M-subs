00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:06.380
 If a customer is too damaged broken the incrustation no longer 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.760
 it's possible 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.659
 in this case the tooth should be restored with an artificial crown 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:15.699
 dentists also call this process to found a tooth 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.990
 as if it were a sheath the crown wraps the root hermetically by 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.759
 everywhere 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:26.630
 This form is protected against cavities and against new charges 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.680
 that could be produced by the hooks that the prosthesis retains those hooks 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
 they are obstacles for cleaning 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.860
 the crowns also serve as pillars for bridge constructions 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 when you have to change one or more teeth 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.470
 the edge of the crown is usually below the margin that went to the theo 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.320
 It may also be above the gum line in an area that does not 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.620
 be visible 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 this has the great advantage that the passage from the crown to the tooth can be 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.070
 control and above all clean easily 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.060
 if the customer is heavily destroyed 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.390
 it must be restored by the dentist 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.020
 in most cases it is usually done with cement from it not mere 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.780
 glass 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.630
 as it is done in the therapy of fillings 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.259
 the cement fills the cavity produced by caries 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.539
 in teeth with root treatment the dentist will screw or one or more 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.880
 screws in the root canal 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.549
 in order to guarantee a better anchorage 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.549
 and will reconstruct the dental form 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.179
 the tooth is carved so that later the crown will pass in trouble 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.990
 and that an exact transition is provided without slots or free spaces in the 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:45.770
 marginal sector 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.540
 before making the impression the dentist or his assistant introduce fine threads of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.850
 cotton in the south a gival cushion 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.539
 This form carefully separates the gum from the root 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.509
 and the small hemorrhages that occur with ease are cut in 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.390
 simple without cameras 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.920
 to make the impression the centuries are removed the margin is inscribed the one that was 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.120
 separated from the tooth long enough to be able to inject the dough 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.630
 elastic of the shape impression in kabul sada and unimpeded in the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.659
 gingival groove 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.659
 you can get a very accurate impression 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:29.789
 the impression a negative is emptied into plaster in the thorium mold the mold of 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:33.659
 obtained work is an exact reproduction of the situation of the mouth 

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:40.239
 when circumstances are especially difficult or when there are 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.569
 that making several crowns is necessary to measure and transfer the relationships of the 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.569
 bite and maxillary has called articulator 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:56.049
 in this way the technician can know all the movements of the jaws 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 of the patient 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:04.939
 a temporary cover protects the carved molar until the final crown 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.199
 is finished in the laboratory 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:12.799
 the shape the color and the stability of it are not always ideal but what 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.039
 more important is its protective function 

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:20.329
 in case of falling the temporary cover and not being able to go to the dentist 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.919
 You can use a sugar-free gum or a bit of a cream that fixes the 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:26.590
 grandparents 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.590
 to get out of the way 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.179
 in case of missing the provisional cover the clients to lie down move 

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:42.209
 thus narrowing the space in asking for the proper and correct placement of 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.619
 the final crown 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:49.669
 the temporary cover has to be placed again even when the tooth is 

00:03:49.669 --> 00:03:51.629
 insensitive 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:56.590
 even if the root is protected against cavities with a pretty tooth 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.919
 each crown is worth only what is worth the foundation on which it is 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:06.289
 only hygiene and regular control by the dentist 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.620
 guarantees some long service life 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.700
 and the enjoyment of the new and complicated dental restoration
