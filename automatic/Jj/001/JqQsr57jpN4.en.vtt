00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.910 
the last twenty years
the<00:00:34.410> origin<00:00:35.219> was<00:00:35.790> kind<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.480> strange<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.230> quite

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the origin was kind of strange and quite

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.729 
the origin was kind of strange and quite
accidental<00:00:38.550> actually<00:00:39.030> my<00:00:39.410> original<00:00:40.410> intent

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
accidental actually my original intent

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.110 
accidental actually my original intent
was<00:00:41.719> to<00:00:42.719> try<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:43.379> make<00:00:43.739> drawings<00:00:44.160> using<00:00:44.820> steel

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
was to try and make drawings using steel

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.389 
was to try and make drawings using steel
I<00:00:45.360> fell<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.289> love<00:00:46.320> with<00:00:46.590> steel<00:00:46.860> somebody

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
I fell in love with steel somebody

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.119 
I fell in love with steel somebody
taught<00:00:47.610> me<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> weld<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.719> kept<00:00:49.590> finding<00:00:49.829> all

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
taught me how to weld I kept finding all

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
taught me how to weld I kept finding all
these<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.489> neat<00:00:50.850> pieces<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.449> steel<00:00:51.719> that

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
these really neat pieces of steel that

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.069 
these really neat pieces of steel that
kind<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> reminded<00:00:52.890> me<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:53.129> interesting

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
kind of reminded me of interesting

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.920 
kind of reminded me of interesting
textures<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.500> limes<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.430> art<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.940> I<00:00:57.719> thought

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
textures and limes and art and I thought

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.779 
textures and limes and art and I thought
wouldn't<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.379> be<00:00:58.469> great<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> instead<00:00:59.609> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
wouldn't it be great to instead of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.930 
wouldn't it be great to instead of
making<00:01:00.510> drawings<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.649> paper<00:01:01.850> sort<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
making drawings on paper sort of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
making drawings on paper sort of
liberated<00:01:03.449> drawings<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.229> use<00:01:04.409> steel

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
liberated drawings and just use steel

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.250 
liberated drawings and just use steel
and<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:05.970> welded<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.630> bunch<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.020> steel

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and so I welded a bunch of steel

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.500 
and so I welded a bunch of steel
drawings<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> hung<00:01:08.670> them<00:01:08.850> on<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.060> wall<00:01:09.240> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
drawings and hung them on the wall and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
drawings and hung them on the wall and
lo<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> behold<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:11.189> got<00:01:11.400> shadows<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
lo and behold I got shadows so the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.859 
lo and behold I got shadows so the
shadows<00:01:14.760> were<00:01:14.850> not<00:01:15.000> easy<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.420> deal<00:01:15.630> with

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
shadows were not easy to deal with

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
shadows were not easy to deal with
because<00:01:16.080> they<00:01:16.439> kept<00:01:16.710> interfering<00:01:17.580> with<00:01:17.880> how

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because they kept interfering with how

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.039 
because they kept interfering with how
my<00:01:18.960> drawings<00:01:19.439> were<00:01:19.590> being<00:01:19.860> seen<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:21.049> shocking

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
my drawings were being seen a shocking

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
my drawings were being seen a shocking

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
changes in store however when the light

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.569 
is moved to one designated spot
instantly<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:28.020> shadow<00:01:28.350> loses<00:01:28.950> its<00:01:29.100> organic

in<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.000> artwork<00:01:42.649> it's<00:01:43.649> very<00:01:43.950> much<00:01:44.189> like

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:45.350 
in the artwork it's very much like

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.010 
in the artwork it's very much like
carving<00:01:46.350> out<00:01:47.210> chunks

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
in a beam of light so it's like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.240 
in a beam of light so it's like
sculpting<00:01:51.450> light<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.440> relationship<00:01:53.070> between

sculpting light the relationship between

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
the object in the shadow become really

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.490 
the object in the shadow become really
important<00:01:56.580> and<00:01:56.760> interesting<00:01:56.970> and<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:58.320> I

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
important and interesting and that I

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.380 
important and interesting and that I
find<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:59.159> this<00:01:59.820> sort<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.180> disconnect

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
find that this sort of disconnect

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.590 
find that this sort of disconnect
between<00:02:01.220> what<00:02:02.220> the<00:02:02.369> steel<00:02:02.670> looks<00:02:03.030> like<00:02:03.270> and

between what the steel looks like and

between what the steel looks like and
what<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.320> shadow<00:02:04.560> looks<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.159> creates<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
what the shadow looks like creates the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.180 
what the shadow looks like creates the
right<00:02:06.150> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.570> tension<00:02:07.050> the<00:02:07.650> first<00:02:07.890> few

right kind of tension the first few
shows<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.000> had<00:02:09.270> people<00:02:09.780> insisted<00:02:10.649> on

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
shows that I had people insisted on

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440
