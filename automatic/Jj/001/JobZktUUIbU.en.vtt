keep you turn back you look back at them

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.830 
keep you turn back you look back at them
and<00:02:05.490> they<00:02:05.670> spawn<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> it's<00:02:06.659> really

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
and they spawn there and it's really

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.369 
and they spawn there and it's really
easy<00:02:06.960> kills<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.729> i<00:02:08.729> prefer<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.629> spawn<00:02:10.170> though

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
easy kills I i prefer the a spawn though

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.199 
easy kills I i prefer the a spawn though
because<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> a<00:02:11.310> spawn<00:02:11.819> you<00:02:12.030> know<00:02:12.150> you

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
because with the a spawn you know you

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.400 
because with the a spawn you know you
can<00:02:12.420> sit<00:02:12.629> on<00:02:12.750> those<00:02:12.900> stairs

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
attacking zone I love camping up here

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.570 
attacking zone I love camping up here
was<00:02:18.840> tak<00:02:19.020> well<00:02:19.440> would<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:19.710> put<00:02:19.890> attack<00:02:20.160> insert

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
was tak well would you put attack insert

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.880 
was tak well would you put attack insert
in<00:02:20.850> your<00:02:20.910> spawn<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:22.110> is<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.530> defeats<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
in your spawn that is that defeats the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.340 
in your spawn that is that defeats the
purpose<00:02:23.220> doesn't<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.850> like<00:02:24.420> honestly<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.900> if

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
purpose doesn't it like honestly like if

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.780 
purpose doesn't it like honestly like if
you<00:02:25.560> want<00:02:25.680> attacking<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.400> want<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
you want attacking so you want to put it

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.550 
you want attacking so you want to put it
in<00:02:26.820> an<00:02:26.910> enemy<00:02:27.240> spawn<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.810> when<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.080> die<00:02:28.260> can

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
in an enemy spawn so when you die can

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.840 
in an enemy spawn so when you die can
quickly<00:02:28.830> flank<00:02:29.220> them<00:02:29.370> or<00:02:29.490> something<00:02:29.610> like

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
quickly flank them or something like

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.000 
quickly flank them or something like
that<00:02:29.910> so<00:02:30.090> people<00:02:30.660> obviously<00:02:30.960> do<00:02:31.440> not<00:02:31.470> know<00:02:31.830> how

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that so people obviously do not know how

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
that so people obviously do not know how
to<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.130> tactical<00:02:32.880> insertions<00:02:33.540> like<00:02:33.840> how

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
to use tactical insertions like how

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.200 
to use tactical insertions like how
