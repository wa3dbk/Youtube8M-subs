 Sardinia 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.580
 the only place in Italy immersed in

 a protected marine area 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.330
 then the marina of villasimius apart

 protected 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.300
 one of the most important features 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.300
 of the port of villasimius and that is 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.060
 sheltered from any wind so the wind 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.120
 predominant which is the mistral 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.960
 certainly not harmful and above all not 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.830

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.820
 hard to find 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.800
