Sadie's Ben's high performance engines
and<00:00:40.460> with<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.730> knowledge<00:00:40.879> that<00:00:41.030> Adrian

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
and with the knowledge that Adrian

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.779 
and with the knowledge that Adrian
already<00:00:41.780> has<00:00:41.930> with<00:00:42.109> them<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:42.649> that<00:00:43.070> seemed

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
already has with them so that seemed

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.150 
already has with them so that seemed
just<00:00:44.539> just<00:00:44.870> natural<00:00:45.289> for<00:00:45.320> us<00:00:45.500> to<00:00:45.590> follow<00:00:45.829> that

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
just just natural for us to follow that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.569 
just just natural for us to follow that
I<00:00:46.399> have<00:00:46.760> from<00:00:47.510> a<00:00:48.050> good<00:00:48.769> feeling<00:00:49.129> that<00:00:49.160> we<00:00:49.399> can

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
I have from a good feeling that we can

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.910 
I have from a good feeling that we can
do<00:00:50.030> better<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.600> car<00:00:50.809> looks<00:00:51.019> very<00:00:51.230> good

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
do better the car looks very good

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.299 
do better the car looks very good
already<00:00:52.190> in<00:00:52.399> the<00:00:52.519> wind<00:00:52.699> tunnel<00:00:52.789> and

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
already in the wind tunnel and

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.639 
already in the wind tunnel and
performance<00:00:55.309> wise<00:00:55.489> I<00:00:55.820> think<00:00:56.030> will<00:00:56.539> be<00:00:56.690> a<00:00:56.719> big

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
performance wise I think will be a big

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.770 
performance wise I think will be a big
gain<00:00:57.859> again<00:00:58.190> we<00:00:58.460> have<00:00:58.640> also<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.239> lot<00:00:59.660> of

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
gain again we have also a lot of

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.020 
gain again we have also a lot of
different<00:01:00.079> regulations<00:01:00.469> which<00:01:01.250> should

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
different regulations which should

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.090 
different regulations which should
probably<00:01:02.629> help<00:01:02.809> us<00:01:03.019> a<00:01:03.199> little<00:01:03.350> bit<00:01:03.620> because

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
probably help us a little bit because

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.850 
probably help us a little bit because
other<00:01:04.430> teams<00:01:04.730> they<00:01:05.390> have<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.780> start<00:01:06.050> from<00:01:06.140> more

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
other teams they have to start from more

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.070 
other teams they have to start from more
of<00:01:07.010> a<00:01:07.100> beginning<00:01:07.430> again<00:01:07.640> or<00:01:08.090> they<00:01:08.120> can't<00:01:08.570> take

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
of a beginning again or they can't take

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.200 
of a beginning again or they can't take
the<00:01:09.320> car<00:01:09.530> they<00:01:10.040> actually<00:01:10.190> run<00:01:10.520> this<00:01:10.700> year<00:01:11.000> and

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
the car they actually run this year and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.940 
the car they actually run this year and
just<00:01:11.240> make<00:01:11.840> it<00:01:11.870> a<00:01:12.050> little<00:01:12.200> bit<00:01:12.380> better<00:01:12.500> is

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
just make it a little bit better is

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.340 
just make it a little bit better is
helpful<00:01:13.820> for<00:01:14.000> especially<00:01:14.600> our<00:01:14.720> smaller<00:01:15.050> team
