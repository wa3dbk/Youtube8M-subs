robbed time actually you don't have to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.510

keep<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:06.020> steady<00:01:06.320> beat<00:01:06.560> all<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.040> time<00:01:07.220> unless

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
keep a steady beat all the time unless

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.650 
keep a steady beat all the time unless
you're<00:01:07.670> playing<00:01:07.850> with<00:01:07.940> a<00:01:08.000> group<00:01:08.270> of<00:01:08.420> course

you're playing with a group of course

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.480 
you're playing with a group of course
but<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:08.870> presume<00:01:09.350> you're<00:01:09.620> playing<00:01:09.830> solo<00:01:10.100> piano

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.160 
but I presume you're playing solo piano
so<00:01:10.820> no<00:01:11.270> matter<00:01:11.450> what<00:01:11.660> song<00:01:11.930> you're<00:01:12.140> playing

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
so no matter what song you're playing

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.040 
so no matter what song you're playing
you<00:01:13.070> can<00:01:13.280> speed<00:01:13.580> up<00:01:13.610> and<00:01:13.880> slow<00:01:14.090> down<00:01:14.540> when<00:01:14.900> it's

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
you can speed up and slow down when it's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.870 
you can speed up and slow down when it's
appropriate<00:01:15.350> let<00:01:16.010> me<00:01:16.100> illustrate<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.729> on

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
okay and that doesn't take any practice

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.830 
okay and that doesn't take any practice
at<00:02:17.690> all<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.019> takes<00:02:18.200> a<00:02:18.319> mindset<00:02:18.769> that<00:02:19.840> to

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
at all it just takes a mindset that to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.930 
at all it just takes a mindset that to
remind<00:02:21.230> yourself<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.769> you<00:02:22.400> are<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.610> captain

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
of your ship you can speed up and slow

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.640 
of your ship you can speed up and slow
down<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.670> by<00:02:26.300> doing<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.660> you<00:02:26.930> make<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.379> lot

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
down and by doing that you make it a lot

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.130 
down and by doing that you make it a lot
more<00:02:27.830> interesting<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:29.599> second<00:02:29.989> way<00:02:30.110> you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
more interesting in the second way you

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.960 
more interesting in the second way you
can<00:02:30.290> improve<00:02:30.530> your<00:02:30.739> planning<00:02:31.129> right<00:02:31.430> now<00:02:31.489> is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
can improve your planning right now is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.839 
can improve your planning right now is
by<00:02:32.299> using<00:02:32.569> a<00:02:32.959> contrast<00:02:33.799> in<00:02:33.950> dynamics<00:02:34.610> most

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
by using a contrast in dynamics most

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.809 
by using a contrast in dynamics most
people<00:02:35.150> play<00:02:35.739> all<00:02:36.739> one<00:02:37.190> level<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:37.670> like<00:02:37.730> a

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
people play all one level it's like a

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.449 
people play all one level it's like a
speaker<00:02:38.360> this<00:02:38.510> talks<00:02:39.110> at<00:02:39.349> one<00:02:39.530> all<00:02:39.769> one<00:02:40.129> level

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 
speaker this talks at one all one level

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.089 
speaker this talks at one all one level
and<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:42.170> know<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.319> don't<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.709> speakers

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
and you know you don't like speakers

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.140 
and you know you don't like speakers
like<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.489> because<00:02:43.760> they're<00:02:43.879> very<00:02:44.030> very

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
like that because they're very very

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.100 

you<00:03:00.010> see<00:03:00.190> because<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.690> play<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.720> first<00:03:01.989> part

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
you see because I play the first part

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.470

allow<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.470> second<00:03:02.770> part<00:03:02.920> i<00:03:03.180> softened<00:03:04.180> up

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
allow the second part i softened up

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.330 
allow the second part i softened up
quite<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.020> right<00:03:05.170> away<00:03:05.410> and<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.130> can<00:03:06.250> do

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
quite a bit right away and you can do

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.979 
quite a bit right away and you can do
that<00:03:06.489> throughout<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:06.940> song<00:03:07.180> as<00:03:07.420> appropriate

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
usually it's phrase by phrase but it

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.430 
usually it's phrase by phrase but it
could<00:03:10.239> be<00:03:10.390> anywhere<00:03:10.959> let<00:03:11.140> me<00:03:11.200> give<00:03:11.319> you<00:03:11.410> a

could be anywhere let me give you a
little<00:03:11.620> more<00:03:11.739> example<00:03:13.830> that's<00:03:14.830> kind<00:03:15.099> of

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
little more example that's kind of

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:27.930 
little more example that's kind of
average<00:03:17.099> that<00:03:18.099> was<00:03:18.310> softer<00:03:21.599> that's<00:03:22.599> average

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:35.610 

love

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.860 

you're<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:37.040> louder<00:03:37.610> sound<00:03:37.760> there<00:03:38.269> okay<00:03:38.569> so<00:03:38.629> you

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
you're a louder sound there okay so you

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.539 
you're a louder sound there okay so you
can<00:03:39.049> get<00:03:39.230> softer<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:39.799> louder<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.189> that<00:03:40.340> makes

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
can get softer and louder and that makes

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.039 
can get softer and louder and that makes
your<00:03:40.640> plane<00:03:40.879> more<00:03:41.090> interesting<00:03:41.659> too<00:03:41.840> doesn't

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
your plane more interesting too doesn't

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.250 
your plane more interesting too doesn't

can play softer and the third way to

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.910 
can play softer and the third way to
improve<00:03:52.430> immediately<00:03:52.730> is<00:03:53.239> you<00:03:54.109> can<00:03:54.530> get

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
higher and lower can't you you don't

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.849

but<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.250> second<00:04:07.580> phrase<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:07.940> might<00:04:08.150> do<00:04:08.300> this

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:07.790 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.210 

and<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.870> last<00:05:10.139> example<00:05:10.680> I<00:05:10.800> combined<00:05:11.190> all

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
and that last example I combined all

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.770 
and that last example I combined all
three<00:05:11.400> didn't<00:05:11.880> I<00:05:11.940> got<00:05:12.210> higher

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780
