first<00:01:01.050> thing<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.410> noticed<00:01:01.770> let<00:01:02.609> me<00:01:02.670> take<00:01:02.820> that

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
first thing I noticed let me take that

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.490 
first thing I noticed let me take that
back<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.660> I<00:01:03.690> pulled<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.080> off<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> stand

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
back when I pulled it off the stand

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.109 
back when I pulled it off the stand
after<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.949> built<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> first<00:01:05.700> time<00:01:05.909> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
after we built it for the first time I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.920 
after we built it for the first time I
said<00:01:06.630> wow<00:01:07.290> this<00:01:07.950> is<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.520> light<00:01:08.760> bike<00:01:09.000> on<00:01:09.240> my

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
said wow this is a light bike on my

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
said wow this is a light bike on my
first<00:01:10.229> ride<00:01:10.530> however<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.369> wasn't<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.299> first

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
first ride however that wasn't the first

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.200 
first ride however that wasn't the first
thing<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.140> noticed<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.830> noticed<00:01:14.189> first<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
thing I noticed I noticed first and

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.030 
thing I noticed I noticed first and
foremost<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.869> head<00:01:16.290> tube<00:01:16.560> was

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
foremost that the head tube was

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.700 
foremost that the head tube was
incredibly<00:01:17.939> stiff<00:01:18.270> it's<00:01:18.869> in<00:01:18.990> my<00:01:19.110> complaint<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
incredibly stiff it's in my complaint on

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
incredibly stiff it's in my complaint on
lighter<00:01:19.979> bikes<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> tend<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> have<00:01:21.210> a
