 legal aspects 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.089
 given constitution 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:21.009

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.310

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.439
 consideration of this petition 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.699

 and turning if supreme council and 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:33.240

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.290
 planned part of my report 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.210
 given the coefficient that was left 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.110
 were left 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.760
 street network legislators 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.100
 miss n will determine additives 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.750
 wormwood political party update 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.080

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.450
 stand for independence 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.960
 pro-russian parties 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.580
 has a political agreement with a single 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.600
 Russia 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.070
 which has the most in 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.750
 State Duma 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.120
 has the most 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.400
 in all subjects almost 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.480
 Russian strategists 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.640
 I believe that the presence of the majority 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.040
 is a major advantage 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.180
 Transnistrian parliament 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.700
 unlike coalition 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 majority in Moldova and Ukraine 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.719
 comments would like 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:19.260
 made up considering that 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.630
 what a controversy in general 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.440
 was around exactly 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.230
 of these aspects 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.440
 very glad that I can today express my 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.370
 opinion in the presence of the president 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.070
 his official representatives and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.510
 older guiding round 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.670
 considered today 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.200
 presidential assets held a seminar 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.780
 constitution acceptance 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.750
 statement of the president himself 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.860
 I, as a citizen of China 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.930
 deputy of the supreme council 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.010
 used non-reflection of the right 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.400
 and today guaranteed article 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.749
 22 constitutions 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.459
 right to freedom of opinion natives 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:50.270

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.679
 selective 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.289
 which gathering is adversary 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.760
 election 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.930
 price increase 92a 50 percent of the vote 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.700
 I want to speak on this issue which 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.300
 ten times it is perfectly understood from 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.880
 vital 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.720
 us for the whole republic 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.720
 let's say if 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.210
 that I personally had hope that 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.979
 provoked domestic political 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.679
 a crisis 

00:02:11.679 --> 00:02:13.480
 which we are from April 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.870
 for the eighth month will not grow and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.370
 put their organizations more 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.219
 number of transdniestrians 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.309
 I am deeply convinced that and organized 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:22.959
 purposefully company 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.489
 to discredit the supreme council 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.859
 initiated by the president 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:26.759
 referendum 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:29.619
 with the text of the anthem of such a constitution this step 

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:31.189
 deepening confrontation 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.419
 Transnistrian society 

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:35.089
 much was said only about the essence of some 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:36.689
 provisions of the draft constitution 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.900
 so for the summer 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.049
 government of victor area 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.559
 small sports 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.099
 why have questions estimated only 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.149
 situations 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:45.739
 Yes, because we have a number of populated 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.869
 items are under double control 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.979
 because we have the authorities of moldova 

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:51.749
 and transdniestria in various populated 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.579
 points and for some populated 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.019
 items you know from a poll with a tanning bed 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.929
 control compound authorities republic 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:02:58.769
 Moldova 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.939
 moreover will feel 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:00.889
 remind 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.429
 our fathers founders 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:04.179
 what do independence declarations do 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.299
 transdniestria is settlements 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.039
 were named 

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.459
 sitting such an urgent need 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.569
 exclude such locality with 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.069
 constitution 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.459
 we have a feature 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.969
 we have a feature of ours 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.359
 countries so that they are recognized as fat 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.809
 community we have features that zones 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.959
 its security zone that zone 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.169
 safety friend too our people 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.579
 in this security zone there is 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.469
 people who honestly don't know where 

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:28.519
 put yourself to bear 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.529
 or transdniestria moldova 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:33.589
 local issues offer supra 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.570
 found trying to comment 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.450
 I will also stop on this need to speak 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.370
 that without much of one form or another 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.280
 develop differently sled cis and 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.470
 European countries and develops on 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.630
 the basis of state 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.750
 support is divided on the ground it said 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.690
 chooses they mean bout something common world 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.680
 tendencies rati transfer on the ground 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.380
 more states and functions with great 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.900
 amount of funding 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.640
 collected in our territory 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.170
 It is proposed that each village chapter 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.379
 appointed 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:01.409
 it has no analogue which country 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.959
 strive to create civilized 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.889
 management organization rules 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.679
 By the way local government is 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:08.379
 not only most European countries 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:10.959
 space but for comparison 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.929
 but there is even honduras 

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:15.299
 that everyone knew if nobody knows 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.919
 transdniestria 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.449
 surpasses many chances 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.909
 from the history of Lebanon still coming 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:22.939
 the fourth 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.860
 16th century elected from the best people all claims 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.909
 and authorities according to the decree of the king of elections 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.740
 I will remind then in Russia 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.979
 functioned institute 

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.789
 serfdom 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:35.289
 in the USSR people's choices and 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:37.080
 Formed local councils the whole story by 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.619
 mayor also elected leader 

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:39.490
 rural administrative 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:40.969
 paragraph moreover a similar system 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.550
 with Russia and now itâ€™s still proposed to start 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.150
 such 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.639
 fox head of the district appointed by the president 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.370
 This approach to order in Russia or 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.740
 16 years return 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.680
 whether they are worth Rogozin 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.389
 representatives by empowering 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.729
 often forming the chamber of parliament 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.050
 such an approval scheme 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.919
 there is no parliament of the Russian Federation 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.310
 saying goodbye to pressure and by getting so 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.520
 telasi city council eligibility 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.050
 without giving them or vesting rights 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.190
 how to choose in Russia 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.800
 citizens and assert globes 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.789
 the head of the district g or city 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:13.659
 such sentences interfere however 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:15.289
 case loud statements 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:16.800
 relations with Stavropol 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.560
 the region 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.050
 despite the fact that there are even mayors of cities 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.150
 understands 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.220
 but the House of Parliament is also approved 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.030
 transnistrian abilities here he 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.259
 was such until the end of 2002 and 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:28.340
 the proposal of the president himself 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.669
 by making changes to 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:30.949
 constitution by order in 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:32.050
 unicameral 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.669
 with the wording of everything he don't want with 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.000
 low efficiency 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.629
 bicameral parliament 

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:39.499
 but wards go to russia stayed 

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:41.879
 Pira parliament in the Sverdlovsk region 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:43.169
 with a population exceeding 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:45.360
 Sverdlovsk region for example through our 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.580
 the region's estimate is almost 10 times there about five 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.499
 million inhabitants 

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:51.030
 holy 50 times more than transdniestria 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.740
 and doing and third place 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.090
 cost-effective potential while 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.700
 Russia 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.860
 to the House of Parliament on the Federation Council 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.900
 upper house elected by the people 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.610
 they are assigned offers our 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.719
 President of the part is not clear with whom 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:04.659
 the question is moto is concerned with thereby 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.340
 want to create aston martin active states 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.160
 if we are talking about upgrading 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.130
 Russians are calm 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.100
 justice minister premier institute court 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:13.699
 or France 

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:15.490
 and if this is the case then the district bid on 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.169
 subjects with their governors 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:18.539
 ministers further 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.300
 for example itself federation kamenka 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.589
 you governor 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:23.869
 so in a compact council would 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:25.059
 live on representatives 

00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:26.590
 different nationalities 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.540
 This is an absurd examination system. 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:29.219
 by state 

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:30.860
 we do not apply the first place itself 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.020
 rates 

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.550
 delegation of authority to all authorities 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.490
 different areas on the correspondence form 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:36.410
 the plan of the initiators of this project 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.949
 powers will cease 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:40.150
 and deputies will be elected or invited 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.259
 will discuss the heads of administration 

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:43.809
 ministers it's all clear 

00:06:43.809 --> 00:06:45.309
 despite the revision of authority 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:46.749
 president is unclear why he is not 

00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:48.379
 cease and authority holds 

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.359
 jointly new nobody's own ejection 

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:51.469
 president 

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:53.759
 it would be more understandable fair 

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.669
 maybe forgotten or regional 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:56.439
 standards 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.339
 looks very interesting from all sides 

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:59.589
 the proposal to hold the next 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:01.669
 election won't let him popsop edict 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:02.529
 president 

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:04.319
 Here is such a message citizens PMR choose 

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:06.029
 Putin poprad recovered but she 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.899
 this man even very respected 

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:10.829
 yes and the rules of the game about gas probably 

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:12.279
 expect relevant 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.669
 possible and run for 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:15.069
 it can only approximate 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.699
 Transnistrian leader 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:18.419
 federations 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.080
 since the last election is practically 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.800
 the decrees were held before the twentieth 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.139
 century 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:24.969
 very curious in terms of the new 

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:27.289
 draft constitution what citizens in 

00:07:27.289 --> 00:07:28.389
 The new constitution is proposed 

00:07:28.389 --> 00:07:30.219
 re-vote for 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:31.389
 right to free medical 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:32.899
 service 

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:34.999
 graphics my dear as far as it is 

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:36.479
 free today 

00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:38.080
 when such a rate is so flooded 

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.349
 offender of institutions 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:42.219
 it turns out that the forecast him again the pit will be 

00:07:42.219 --> 00:07:44.659
 more free than today 

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:46.550
 Beta Kai Norm if no one answered 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.110
 why today many are paying for 

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:49.659
 Mezenskoy served besides that and 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.169
 protection of the situation there are no restrictions 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:53.939
 what services are paid which 

00:07:53.939 --> 00:07:55.189
 free 

00:07:55.189 --> 00:07:56.169
 also citizens are invited 

00:07:56.169 --> 00:07:58.269
 re for example vote for 

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.319
 right to work 

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.830
 which also today reached Odessa 35 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.830
 constitution if there is such a rule 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:06.219
 Is it worth it to understand so that they are still voted 

00:08:06.219 --> 00:08:08.240
 since we have done a cleansing account 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.720
 however state execution 

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.139
 responsibilities for creating conditions for 

00:08:12.139 --> 00:08:13.569
 implementation of the right to work 

00:08:13.569 --> 00:08:15.749
 today here is the republic who is for it 

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:16.659
 responsible republic
