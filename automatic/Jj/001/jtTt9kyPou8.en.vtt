00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.089 

if<00:03:05.420> Brock<00:03:05.989> would<00:03:06.230> score<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.709> it<00:03:06.829> would<00:03:06.920> be

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
if Brock would score this it would be

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.319 
if Brock would score this it would be
six<00:03:07.489> five<00:03:07.879> and<00:03:08.239> if<00:03:08.590> Tomasello<00:03:09.590> if<00:03:10.459> it<00:03:10.670> holds<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
six five and if Tomasello if it holds it

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.770 
six five and if Tomasello if it holds it
will<00:03:11.450> be<00:03:11.540> ten<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:12.140> two<00:03:12.920> Oh<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:14.209> three<00:03:14.599> and<00:03:14.659> a<00:03:14.750> two

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
will be ten to two Oh a three and a two

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.500 
will be ten to two Oh a three and a two
so<00:03:15.049> they<00:03:18.250> so<00:03:19.250> Brock<00:03:19.549> won't<00:03:19.819> give<00:03:20.030> up<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.269> point
