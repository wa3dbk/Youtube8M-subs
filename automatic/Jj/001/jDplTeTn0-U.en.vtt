end of this year they might eventually

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.210 
end of this year they might eventually
make<00:02:24.000> a<00:02:24.030> fire<00:02:24.330> team<00:02:24.600> or<00:02:24.780> even<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:25.590> map<00:02:25.830> where<00:02:26.100> you

make a fire team or even a map where you
can<00:02:26.430> control<00:02:26.970> an<00:02:27.750> entire<00:02:28.320> plane<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
can control an entire plane and like you

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.640 
can control an entire plane and like you
can<00:02:29.730> fly<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.000> because<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> sound<00:02:31.350> like<00:02:31.410> I'm

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
can fly it because now I sound like I'm

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.070 
can fly it because now I sound like I'm
obsessed<00:02:32.010> with<00:02:32.490> planes<00:02:32.820> already<00:02:33.090> I'm<00:02:33.450> not<00:02:33.630> so

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
obsessed with planes already I'm not so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.500 
obsessed with planes already I'm not so
much<00:02:34.290> I'm<00:02:34.650> not<00:02:34.830> really<00:02:34.980> obsessed<00:02:35.400> so<00:02:35.580> much<00:02:35.790> bit

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
much I'm not really obsessed so much bit

much I'm not really obsessed so much bit
uh<00:02:37.220> I'm<00:02:38.220> just<00:02:38.580> thinking<00:02:38.940> how<00:02:39.060> cool<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.540> game

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
uh I'm just thinking how cool the game

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.780 
uh I'm just thinking how cool the game
would<00:02:39.930> be<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.260> there<00:02:40.440> was<00:02:40.620> planes<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.610> can

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
would be if there was planes you can

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.690 
would be if there was planes you can
control<00:02:42.209> especially<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.930> combat<00:02:43.380> arms<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:44.550> be

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
control especially in combat arms to be

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.880 
control especially in combat arms to be
honest<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> robot<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:45.959> being<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.680> boss

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
honest the robot here as being the boss

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.520 
honest the robot here as being the boss
robot<00:02:47.400> it<00:02:47.550> was<00:02:47.910> pretty<00:02:48.120> frustrating<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:49.320> see

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530

robot it was pretty frustrating you see
how<00:02:49.709> slow<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.400> walks<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.209> print<00:02:51.570> it's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
how slow it walks and it's print it's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.530 
how slow it walks and it's print it's
not<00:02:52.380> even<00:02:52.650> as<00:02:52.769> half<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.430> other<00:02:53.580> guy<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.420> if

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
not even as half of the other guy so if

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.090 
not even as half of the other guy so if
you've<00:02:54.690> noticed<00:02:54.959> here<00:02:55.410> this<00:02:55.560> guy<00:02:55.739> is<00:02:55.800> trying

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
you've noticed here this guy is trying

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.640 
you've noticed here this guy is trying
to<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.430> smart<00:02:56.760> he's<00:02:57.330> using<00:02:57.840> his<00:02:58.050> character

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
to be smart he's using his character

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.460 
to be smart he's using his character
he's<00:02:58.800> not<00:02:59.040> even<00:02:59.310> using<00:02:59.340> his<00:02:59.850> robot<00:03:00.330> and<00:03:00.600> I<00:03:01.260> just

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
he's not even using his robot and I just

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.040 
he's not even using his robot and I just
killed<00:03:01.739> him<00:03:01.950> he<00:03:02.760> has<00:03:02.910> much<00:03:03.180> less<00:03:03.450> health<00:03:03.780> than

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
killed him he has much less health than

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.400 
killed him he has much less health than
using<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.530> robot<00:03:04.950> but<00:03:05.220> um<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.600> way<00:03:06.810> it's

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
using a robot but um in a way it's

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.020 
using a robot but um in a way it's
better<00:03:07.799> for<00:03:08.070> him<00:03:08.160> because<00:03:08.310> he<00:03:08.430> can<00:03:08.700> sprint

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
better for him because he can sprint

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.240 
better for him because he can sprint
fast<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.660> everything<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.260> he<00:03:10.709> can<00:03:10.890> get<00:03:11.130> away

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
fast and everything and he can get away

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.160 
fast and everything and he can get away
from<00:03:11.459> me<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.000> he<00:03:12.180> can<00:03:12.330> even<00:03:12.450> hide<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.930> I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
from me and I he can even hide out I

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.900 
from me and I he can even hide out I
mean<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.739> told<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.100> guys<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.310> was<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.640> first

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
mean as I told you guys it was the first

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.240 
mean as I told you guys it was the first
time<00:03:15.060> I'd<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.450> playing<00:03:15.720> this<00:03:16.019> game<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.799> don't

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
time I'd be playing this game so I don't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.789 
time I'd be playing this game so I don't
know<00:03:17.370> really<00:03:17.610> what<00:03:17.910> goes<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.989> I<00:03:19.230> don't

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
know really what goes on and I don't

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.080 
know really what goes on and I don't
even<00:03:20.010> know<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.280> map<00:03:20.489> I'm<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.910> like

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
even know the map I'm just like

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.120 
even know the map I'm just like
wandering<00:03:21.630> around<00:03:21.900> that's<00:03:22.290> why<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.500> took<00:03:22.650> five

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
wandering around that's why I took five

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.860 
wandering around that's why I took five
minutes<00:03:23.160> to<00:03:23.640> complete<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.060> but<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> end

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
minutes to complete this but in the end

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.720 
minutes to complete this but in the end
it's<00:03:25.440> pretty<00:03:25.650> good<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.010> longer<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> take<00:03:26.489> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
it's pretty good the longer you take the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.569 
it's pretty good the longer you take the
better<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.360> are<00:03:27.390> because<00:03:28.130> it'll<00:03:29.130> keep<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.430> on

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
better you are because it'll keep you on

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.210 
better you are because it'll keep you on
your<00:03:29.760> score<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.420> longest<00:03:30.810> lifetime<00:03:31.440> so<00:03:31.980> it'll

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
your score the longest lifetime so it'll

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.100 
your score the longest lifetime so it'll
basically<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.820> place<00:03:33.090> me<00:03:33.299> right<00:03:33.540> first<00:03:33.900> on

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
basically just place me right first on

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.289 
basically just place me right first on
the<00:03:34.290> rankings<00:03:34.739> so<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.640> that's<00:03:35.760> a<00:03:35.940> good<00:03:36.090> thing

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
the rankings so that that's a good thing

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.259 
the rankings so that that's a good thing
so<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.200> see<00:03:37.950> here<00:03:38.220> like<00:03:38.400> my<00:03:38.730> health<00:03:39.060> is

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
so you see here like my health is

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.990 
so you see here like my health is
basically<00:03:39.900> invincible<00:03:40.739> my<00:03:41.310> health<00:03:41.579> will<00:03:41.790> just

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
basically invincible my health will just

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.810 
basically invincible my health will just
never<00:03:42.269> ever<00:03:42.600> finish<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.739> are<00:03:44.579> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
never ever finish and you are the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.819 
never ever finish and you are the
persons<00:03:45.239> like<00:03:45.420> there's<00:03:46.140> like<00:03:46.260> actually<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
persons like there's like actually the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.100 
persons like there's like actually the
Nexus<00:03:47.250> lab<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.670> looks<00:03:47.850> pretty<00:03:48.000> weird<00:03:48.420> looks

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
Nexus lab it looks pretty weird looks

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.020 
Nexus lab it looks pretty weird looks
basically<00:03:49.470> like<00:03:49.769> a<00:03:49.920> company<00:03:50.579> about<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
basically like a company about it's a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.750 
basically like a company about it's a
lab<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:52.350> be<00:03:52.380> honest<00:03:52.799> you'd<00:03:52.950> expect<00:03:53.280> a<00:03:53.400> lab<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
lab to be honest you'd expect a lab to

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.170 
lab to be honest you'd expect a lab to
have<00:03:53.910> like<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.120> lot<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.980> man<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.280> portions<00:03:56.970> and

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
have like a lot of man and portions and

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.210 
have like a lot of man and portions and
stuff<00:03:57.450> but<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:57.870> didn't<00:03:58.440> see<00:03:58.560> any<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.829> those<00:03:58.950> here

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
stuff but I didn't see any of those here

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.640 
stuff but I didn't see any of those here

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
all I see is like just a plain old

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.100 
all I see is like just a plain old
company<00:04:02.310> if<00:04:02.489> they've<00:04:02.730> put<00:04:03.030> a<00:04:03.060> couple<00:04:03.329> offices

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
and G see if I can't even tell the

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.090 
and G see if I can't even tell the
difference<00:04:06.000> here<00:04:06.450> like<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.260> the<00:04:07.380> main<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.950> the

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
difference here like in the main in the

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.430 
difference here like in the main in the
same

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
same

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.570 
same
it<00:04:08.830> looks<00:04:09.220> pretty<00:04:09.450> scientific<00:04:10.740> thing<00:04:11.740> I<00:04:12.040> mean

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
it looks pretty scientific thing I mean

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.490 
it looks pretty scientific thing I mean
what<00:04:13.000> really<00:04:13.270> makes<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.690> lab<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.230> because

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
what really makes it a lab is because

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.850 
what really makes it a lab is because
it's<00:04:14.680> filled<00:04:14.920> with<00:04:15.070> robots<00:04:15.670> now<00:04:16.030> in<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.200> end<00:04:17.410> I
