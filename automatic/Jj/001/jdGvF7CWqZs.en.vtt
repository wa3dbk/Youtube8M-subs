00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
time I've used GoPro studio but it's

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.680 
time I've used GoPro studio but it's
also<00:00:14.219> possible<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.179> pretty<00:00:15.570> much

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
also possible to do pretty much

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.590 
also possible to do pretty much
everything<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.890> Sony<00:00:17.190> Vegas<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.180> Sony<00:00:18.390> Vegas

is a bit of a one-stop shop there's a

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.550 
is a bit of a one-stop shop there's a
lot<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.480> different<00:00:21.810> plugins<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.439> can

lot of different plugins that you can
use<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.220> correct<00:00:23.630> your<00:00:24.630> GoPro<00:00:25.050> videos<00:00:25.439> so<00:00:26.220> I've

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
use to correct your GoPro videos so I've

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.439 
use to correct your GoPro videos so I've
got<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.380> GoPro<00:00:28.380> video<00:00:28.859> here<00:00:29.310> it's<00:00:29.910> shot<00:00:30.240> with

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
got this GoPro video here it's shot with

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.950 
got this GoPro video here it's shot with
protune<00:00:31.260> color<00:00:32.160> profile<00:00:32.700> set<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> flat<00:00:33.600> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
protune color profile set to flat so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.319 
protune color profile set to flat so
there's<00:00:34.170> not<00:00:34.350> much<00:00:34.760> saturation<00:00:35.760> there's<00:00:36.180> not

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there's not much saturation there's not

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.510 
there's not much saturation there's not
much<00:00:36.480> contrast<00:00:37.079> there's<00:00:37.380> not<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:37.710> color<00:00:38.129> and

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
much contrast there's not much color and

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.060 
much contrast there's not much color and
we're<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.540> Sony<00:00:39.840> Vegas<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.590> bring

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
we're going to use Sony Vegas to bring

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.479 
we're going to use Sony Vegas to bring
all<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.430> colors<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.590> sharpness<00:00:43.590> etc<00:00:44.250> back

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
all that colors and sharpness etc back

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.459 
all that colors and sharpness etc back
and<00:00:44.760> then<00:00:45.239> we're<00:00:45.360> going<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.539> color<00:00:46.050> correct

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
and then we're going to color correct

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.450 
and then we're going to color correct
the<00:00:46.590> video<00:00:47.149> for<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.270> depth<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:48.690> we're<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
the video for the depth that we're at so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.110 
the video for the depth that we're at so
I'm<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.000> select<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> video<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:53.120> right

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
I'm going to select the video here right

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.330 
I'm going to select the video here right
click<00:00:54.449> video<00:00:55.110> event<00:00:55.440> FX<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.320> correct<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
click video event FX so to correct the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.660 
click video event FX so to correct the
protune<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.930> then<00:01:01.320> select<00:01:01.829> brightness<00:01:02.280> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
protune and then select brightness and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.469 
protune and then select brightness and
contrast<00:01:02.930> saturation<00:01:03.949> adjust<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.479> sharpen

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
contrast saturation adjust and sharpen

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.020 
contrast saturation adjust and sharpen
so<00:01:07.350> these<00:01:07.590> will<00:01:07.860> be<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.159> compensate<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.939> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
so these will be to compensate for the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.750 
so these will be to compensate for the
protune<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:10.070> next<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.250> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.580> select

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
protune and next I'm going to select

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.050 
protune and next I'm going to select
color<00:01:12.630> balance<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.380> color<00:01:14.189> corrector<00:01:14.880> I'm

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
color balance and color corrector I'm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.120 
color balance and color corrector I'm
going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.360> use<00:01:15.570> these<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.020> add<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.470> red<00:01:16.799> back

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
going to use these to add the red back

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.999 
going to use these to add the red back
that<00:01:17.460> was<00:01:17.670> lost<00:01:18.060> due<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.110> depth<00:01:20.659> okay<00:01:21.659> so

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
that was lost due to the depth okay so

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.950 
that was lost due to the depth okay so
the<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.400> plugins<00:01:23.880> have<00:01:24.030> been<00:01:24.180> selected<00:01:24.689> over

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the the plugins have been selected over

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.660 
the the plugins have been selected over
here<00:01:25.229> I'm<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.890> select<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> first<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
here I'm going to select the first one

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
here I'm going to select the first one
brightness<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.570> contrast<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.799> going<00:01:28.979> to

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
brightness and contrast and I'm going to

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.670 
brightness and contrast and I'm going to
add<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.460> contrast<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.360> because<00:01:31.049> protune

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
add the contrast back because protune

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.620 
add the contrast back because protune
flat<00:01:32.130> videos<00:01:32.610> don't<00:01:33.060> have<00:01:33.360> much<00:01:33.720> contrast<00:01:35.630> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
flat videos don't have much contrast so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.130 
flat videos don't have much contrast so
there's<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> contrast<00:01:37.619> added<00:01:38.100> back<00:01:39.140> next

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
there's the contrast added back next

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.469 
there's the contrast added back next
step<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.860> saturation<00:01:41.640> because<00:01:41.790> protune

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
step is the saturation because protune

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.050 
step is the saturation because protune
flat<00:01:42.810> videos<00:01:43.200> are<00:01:43.549> purposefully<00:01:44.549> under

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
flat videos are purposefully under

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.490 
flat videos are purposefully under
saturated<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.799> let's<00:01:47.790> add<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.500> saturation

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
saturated so let's add the saturation

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.120 
saturated so let's add the saturation
back<00:01:49.890> amount<00:01:50.759> low<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.570> high<00:01:52.170> areas<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.829> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
back amount low and high areas of the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.490 
back amount low and high areas of the
video<00:01:56.360> all<00:01:57.360> right<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:57.750> now<00:01:57.899> I've<00:01:58.020> got<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> very

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
video all right so now I've got a very

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.499 
video all right so now I've got a very
blue<00:01:58.979> video<00:02:00.200> last<00:02:01.200> step<00:02:01.560> sharp<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.790> now<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
blue video last step sharp and now the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.499 
blue video last step sharp and now the
amount<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.930> sharpness<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.560> want<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.009> add<00:02:05.159> back

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
amount of sharpness you want to add back

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.809 
amount of sharpness you want to add back
depends<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:07.409> protein<00:02:08.009> settings<00:02:08.459> you<00:02:08.580> use

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
depends on the protein settings you use

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.600 
depends on the protein settings you use
did<00:02:09.119> you<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.450> sharpness<00:02:10.379> set<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.860> low<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:11.459> it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
did you have sharpness set to low if it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.030 
did you have sharpness set to low if it
was<00:02:11.760> set

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
was set

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.250 
was set
too<00:02:12.129> low<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.849> definitely<00:02:13.180> want<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.629> add<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
too low you definitely want to add the

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.130 
too low you definitely want to add the
sharpness<00:02:14.799> back<00:02:15.099> using<00:02:15.730> Vegas<00:02:16.329> if<00:02:16.510> you<00:02:17.019> have

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
sharpness back using Vegas if you have

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.380 
sharpness back using Vegas if you have
the<00:02:17.260> sharpener<00:02:17.650> set<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.069> high<00:02:18.310> well<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.180> won't

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
the sharpener set to high well you won't

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.020 
the sharpener set to high well you won't
need<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.629> adjust<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.439> sharpness<00:02:20.799> that<00:02:21.730> much

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
need to adjust the sharpness that much

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.910 
need to adjust the sharpness that much
we're<00:02:22.810> going<00:02:22.930> to<00:02:22.989> move<00:02:23.170> on<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:23.590> color

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
we're going to move on to the color

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.520 
we're going to move on to the color
correction<00:02:24.400> part<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.569> there's<00:02:25.870> two<00:02:26.200> plugins

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
correction part so there's two plugins

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.170 
correction part so there's two plugins
in<00:02:26.890> Vegas<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:27.519> can<00:02:27.700> do<00:02:27.849> the<00:02:27.969> color

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
in Vegas that can do the color

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.509 
in Vegas that can do the color
correction<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:29.290> easier<00:02:29.799> one<00:02:30.069> is<00:02:30.250> called

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
correction the easier one is called

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.030 
correction the easier one is called
color<00:02:30.819> balance<00:02:31.359> and<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.079> more<00:02:32.319> advanced<00:02:32.890> one

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
color balance and the more advanced one

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.979 
color balance and the more advanced one
is<00:02:33.189> called<00:02:33.430> color<00:02:33.700> corrector<00:02:34.269> I'm<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:34.930> to

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
is called color corrector I'm going to

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.349 
is called color corrector I'm going to
unselect<00:02:35.650> color<00:02:36.010> corrector<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.700> select

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:37.359 
unselect color corrector and select

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.459 
unselect color corrector and select
color<00:02:37.840> balance<00:02:39.180> now<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.239> type<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:41.109> is<00:02:41.139> set

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:41.469 
color balance now the type here is set

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.039 
color balance now the type here is set
to<00:02:41.650> mid-tones<00:02:42.219> and<00:02:42.489> all<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.180> need<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.480> do<00:02:43.629> is

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
to mid-tones and all you need to do is

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.710 
to mid-tones and all you need to do is
take<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.560> red<00:02:44.829> slider<00:02:45.250> and<00:02:45.549> slide<00:02:46.359> it<00:02:46.540> up

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.330 

slide<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.900> up<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.290> point<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:51.010> water

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
slide it up to the point that the water

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.890 
slide it up to the point that the water
does<00:02:51.730> not<00:02:51.760> turn<00:02:52.359> red<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:57.780> somewhere<00:02:58.780> around

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
does not turn red so somewhere around

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.170 
does not turn red so somewhere around
there<00:02:59.260> looks<00:02:59.500> good<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.919> me<00:02:59.950> now<00:03:00.849> we<00:03:00.909> can

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
there looks good to me now we can

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.839 
there looks good to me now we can
unselect<00:03:01.599> it<00:03:01.870> so<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.739> without<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.609> color

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
unselect it so that without the color

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:14.140 
unselect it so that without the color
balance<00:03:04.060> and<00:03:04.389> with<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.409> color<00:03:05.650> balance

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.180 

so<00:03:15.150> color<00:03:15.390> balance<00:03:15.690> is<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.960> easiest<00:03:16.290> way<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
so color balance is the easiest way the

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.330 
so color balance is the easiest way the
more<00:03:17.430> advanced<00:03:18.000> way<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.740> to<00:03:19.740> use<00:03:19.770> the<00:03:19.950> color

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
more advanced way is to use the color

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.250 
more advanced way is to use the color
corrector<00:03:20.910> so<00:03:21.570> I'm<00:03:21.630> going<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.810> select<00:03:21.990> the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
corrector so I'm going to select the

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.280 
corrector so I'm going to select the
color<00:03:22.440> corrector<00:03:23.090> now<00:03:24.090> color<00:03:24.450> corrector<00:03:24.930> uses

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
color corrector now color corrector uses

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.470 
color corrector now color corrector uses
color<00:03:25.620> wheels<00:03:25.980> which<00:03:26.640> means<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.060> can<00:03:27.240> pull

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
color wheels which means you can pull

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690 
color wheels which means you can pull
the<00:03:27.600> color<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.050> all<00:03:28.200> different<00:03:28.440> directions<00:03:28.700> so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
the color in all different directions so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.640 
the color in all different directions so
if<00:03:29.820> your<00:03:29.970> water's<00:03:30.240> more<00:03:30.450> green<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.470> pull

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
if your water's more green you can pull

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.010 
if your water's more green you can pull
it<00:03:31.770> more<00:03:31.950> magenta<00:03:32.400> if<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.150> more<00:03:33.390> blue<00:03:33.720> you

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
it more magenta if it's more blue you

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.420 
it more magenta if it's more blue you
can<00:03:34.140> pull<00:03:34.350> it<00:03:34.470> more<00:03:34.650> red<00:03:34.950> or<00:03:34.980> yellow<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:37.430> here

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
can pull it more red or yellow so here

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.699 
can pull it more red or yellow so here
the<00:03:38.730> color<00:03:39.240> correction<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.840> split<00:03:40.140> into<00:03:40.320> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
the color correction is split into the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.890 
the color correction is split into the
lower<00:03:40.980> areas<00:03:41.400> of<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.670> video<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.390> mid-tones

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
lower areas of the video the mid-tones

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.830 
lower areas of the video the mid-tones
and<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.380> highs<00:03:43.620> so<00:03:44.580> let's<00:03:45.090> start<00:03:45.510> because

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
and the highs so let's start because

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.420 
and the highs so let's start because
this<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.140> a<00:03:46.170> blue<00:03:46.470> water<00:03:46.709> video<00:03:46.980> I'm<00:03:47.250> going<00:03:47.370> to

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
this is a blue water video I'm going to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.760 
this is a blue water video I'm going to
shift<00:03:47.670> more<00:03:47.970> to<00:03:48.209> red<00:03:49.400> add<00:03:50.400> some<00:03:50.700> red<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.770> the

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
shift more to red add some red in the

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.949 
shift more to red add some red in the
lows<00:03:53.010> the<00:03:53.640> mid-tones<00:03:54.180> which<00:03:54.450> has<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.780> most

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
lows the mid-tones which has the most

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:03.640 
lows the mid-tones which has the most
effect

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.600 

and<00:04:03.739> the<00:04:04.610> highest

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.430 

all<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.570> now<00:04:09.690> this<00:04:09.870> video<00:04:10.050> has<00:04:10.410> been

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
all right so now this video has been

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.210 
all right so now this video has been
corrected<00:04:11.430> let's<00:04:12.360> play<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:12.720> back<00:04:12.960> I<00:04:16.220> think

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220
