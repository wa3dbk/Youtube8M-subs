 he is the perfect place for a price 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.039
 to get the best marks that the goals are not 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.289
 and he is tight no Seibert at best I'm developing my courses now 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.119

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.210
 so the user can 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.399
 I break Käßmann over Novotel pinks

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.260
 at the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.280
 or 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 It looks like 16 meters off the dot 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.890
 epd very explains work the desired lohr 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.610
 it's a good question for me to properly tennis-court my ship 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.480
 summer 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.660
 by Dr Marcel Geeren miserable from Turkey 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.830
 I could not buy it anymore 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.830
 is this crater 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.140
 me also very nice 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 in the picture one to ten very serious 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.790
 if I can show you the pattern 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.130
 okay i have to hans-peter against that's not it's only till 10 o'clock 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 is formative and I can turn away from him 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.540
 because the next driver of furniture minutes 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 there enjoy the new modules 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 so had Munich 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.870
 03 09 gg 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.180
 so when Stena says I'm not sure 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.229
 now it looks like this 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.229
 October Euro 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.570
 not so good with 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.360
 Refereed this piece were seen lived properly 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.300
 I think this should have changed markets and education 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.520
 I can safely do APA 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.719
 Thank you very much the question I always said 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.719
 Communities is my favorite color 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.519
 so do that so different 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.669
 Children "It's a law that just agrees 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.159
 more for the first time in Germany can recognize the interest 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.169
 in the defensive forces Andreas 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.059
 Aral what Ammann offered 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:32.999
 the injured help a child 

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:34.169
 and he is close 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.479
 such a thing from real bad buy 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:39.149
 wealthy 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.149
 the number 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.129
 so 4 1 3 against UMMC 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.359
 Nino 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:53.189
 So contrary to the same in the victory equal to the not bleached lists 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 well now the rating will be the most intimate Ruth Genner 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.539
 but I'm pulling in the United Nations 

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:02.760

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.399
 from ca first is Dr 

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:07.809
 it did not work that way 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.919
 then he does not even think of Sekic the Cham Paper 

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:14.469
 mainvestor transparent 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.769

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 Mine did not convince me 8 ha 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.909
 both the minister is from the inside 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:30.119
 Sounds not only at one point on one side 

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:32.419
 so and that is in Dannenberg 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.379
 Detlef Radtke 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.290

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.959
 Although not recognized as often 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.019
 Heubisch and keep themselves from so-called layer rulers

 it looks like that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 they are happening too well 

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:07.330
 if i dont sense this this didnt match the early one 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.040

 to be at the start 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.379
 Houghton now 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.150
 in the middle 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.150
 the latter is very nice 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.270
 while quite good APA 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.120
 and finally 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.309
 the Denglisch turns a short video 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:11.490

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.460
 if can pull 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:21.710
 but skilful grader key w 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.410
 SID 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.410
 like Frank Carstens artists 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.850
 Act is one hates nail the boss is allowed to do that right diagonally 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.960
 The bond markets give way at an angle 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.960
 find the highest here 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.729
 employees are especially popular 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.749
 first time sets 

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:48.419
 were suddenly stopped because of it 

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:51.289
 Christian Keller from the bank Metzler 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.509

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.509
 Christie through skillful sprouts that's true too 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.389
 These are not the really big ones 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:02.870
 this is just cancel 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.949
 Smoke 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:05.110

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.189
 At the end, Schulz 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:17.400
 "I would not do that now 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.729
 just offer 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:19.839
 hopefully 

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.899
 I would not spend my life and thoughtful cost of account information 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:25.560
 Yes 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.139
 For the first time in the first half of the year, the diner started to store valuables 

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.860

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:38.509
 wanting to grow again so geoghegan-quinn are at home 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:39.719

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.949
 MGT just too dark I can not be petty for visibility 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.240
 devices 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.650

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:53.850
 I think yes we make the deserved deserve the rest of my parents Thuringia 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.279
 You can see if I was sick the last time 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:06:58.210
 but 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.440
 genève-servette their strict rules of the game 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.339
 if not then 

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:05.020
 since come in between or something 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.849
