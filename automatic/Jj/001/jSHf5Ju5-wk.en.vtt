00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 now the staff that is more up to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.830
 You too, and yes, I'm recording. 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.620
 multiple tags today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.080
 so I have the same look this tag 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.220
 It's five books is an island I went to. 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.640
 guided by joseph the girl but later 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.560
 of TV literate also let me do it myself 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.560
 I asked her and she left me soon after. 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 the gm indicated then we were indicated and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 Let's do it, I found it a little. 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.890
 difficult this difficult is easy difficult 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.149
 because I stayed the same as me 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.070
 asking costa are you know and then 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.620
 house on this island that I am washing 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.230
 so easy and easy because later I 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 I said do not let the levels 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.949
 the books that I would like to 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.690
 have been around for a long time and I do not 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.489
 I would also like to read because I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:06.810
 I would need to re-read them so I chose 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.570
 five books the first book and né 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.520
 Let's repeat some of the other tag would be 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.520
 around the world in 80 days by 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.259
 to treat an adventure and I like 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 enough of this book because you pass 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.740
 for several places and you do not get sick 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 attractive 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.820
 so this is cool because I'm sure 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.759
 If I'm rebell I'll improve. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 as well as the training of principle 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.960
 So this is one of the books I 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.450
 I chose to take to an island in the 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.520
 second book and being well again 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.420
 would be to create potter and the relics of 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.060
 death 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 My favorite book is even the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 Phoenix 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.939
 only I decide to take this is to be the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 end of everything and for having a lot 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.710
 many things will happen in this book 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.880
 and partner end result I really like 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.750
 of this book despite loving the fifth 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.380
 I would have to take these people to relay and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.119
 to remember the whole saga and what the 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.489
 series represented in my life the 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.129
 third book would be the great gatsby of 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.750
 f scott fitzgerald simply because it is 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.570
 The best book I read this year. 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.540
 it is a moment and because it is sensational and 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:21.240
 passes so many life lessons that I 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.550
 I took it for myself through my 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.530
 reading was what I did not have in 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.390
 I'll leave the link here below. 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.880
 for the video review I left 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.240
 What I did do from the book, I 'm sure. 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.840
 I will read this book for the rest of my life. 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.390
 life is sensational then I loved that 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.630
 book was sure to take him to this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.080
 It's good until now I had an adventure. 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.050
 classic I had a fantasy that also 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.900
 It's a classic, let's see how that I 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.380
 I had a grass, right? 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 and now I would choose a kit for 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.370
 take to the island paraná to have fun 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.790
 little and have a more superficial reading 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 or quieter my easier to 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.920
 be life that would not be rose design 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.350
 I know the name of this name. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.090
 I already said that in another video. 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.110
 I have not done the caption yet if it 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:22.080
 level but surely it is already I will do 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.299
 and get rid of the customer is sensational 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.030
 Maybe it's another nursery that I 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.489
 like I have most enjoyed reading is 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.820
 different from others 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:35.250
 the main character is a man who 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.769
 already have enough of the others despite 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.610
 customer terms with characters 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.329
 main 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.730
 but it also has the 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:48.900
 asperger syndrome that would be autism 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.540
 He is an artist and he is very cool. 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.450
 he is a professor of genetics and this 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:58.260
 Ours is simply sensational because 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.320
 he reminded me of the sheldon of df and it is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.500
 incredible because although it looks like 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:08.989
 So he does not have it in the end he 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.820
 improves with his touches and is 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.120
 cinema the character that you in the beginning 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:17.040
 he is very much so irrational but soon 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.930
 he becomes an incredible character 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.070
 because although he has this syndrome 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.980
 he has 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:25.920
 one half of this mentality of him does not 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.080
 it's so natural it's very rational it 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.360
 think we agree with him and even 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.220
 Make some rumors we'll end up 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.080
 coming back and agreeing with what he 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.270
 is saying it really is certain that 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.050
 he does and the fifth book that has not yet 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.680
 I showed national but it is something sensational 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.320
 people I won on birthday 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:48.420
 recently I think this week of my 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.030
 Book My boyfriend and it's amazing 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:53.100
 why choosing this level would be 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.800
 because he is too big and that never 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.690
 it would have been for a long time but 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.630
 also because it is a book that I 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:04.740
 I have it, he knows I do not know when I'm going. 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:08.190
 and if I can read but it's a goal to 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.390
 My life is the sensational book and I 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.360
 I'm sure you're going to have enough. 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:16.290
 during my stay on the island be it 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.800
 of life or the miserable 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.780
 by vitor hugo 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.610
 this version looks like a book is fine 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.300
 small but it is not 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:34.230
 so I 'll show you another video, but 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:36.270
 this is the book 102 full of them 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.470
 sensational we are lost to 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.230
 disbelief 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.520
 then it would certainly be a good request 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.760
 To take this tag to him, that 's okay. 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.160
 turned up until I think then the grandfather see who 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.890
 I did not even here yet and I will indicate 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:55.290
 Leave it here, I did not know. For you, it's more. 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:57.090
 who want to feel free in 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.680

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.260

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.540
 next video
