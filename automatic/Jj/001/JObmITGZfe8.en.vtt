00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.539
 O 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:13.329
 oo mend we have an hour 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.599
 that's the way it's called the right one 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.419
 in it but also for years our outstanding students what we people 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:23.779
 realized in those years said hiroaki in the emeia that is that each student has a 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.340
 personality at the time of playing here we can also see 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.880
 that the students have developed their games towards 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.790
 those musical themes that they like then we have differentiated since 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.100
 classes of drains and techno 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.579
 these highlights 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.890
 ended up appearing not only in the curitiba scene but also in the 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.010
 state of Parana 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.880
 It is interesting to be able to observe the development of these students 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.110
 and also ended up becoming a sort of teaser upload and north of the 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.660
 new students 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.949
 may be 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.800
 I reflected there 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.380
 that he also has a chance to come to have a prominence in a career of 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.100
 highlight is that we do not know this day network made of opportunities sometimes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:15.820
 is 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.100
 work with a duel of leaders 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.080
 it's actually been she kicked off like this for all the students 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.970
 they can 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.290
 really that first contact with the bullet of the first contact 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.290
 face to face with the track as well as the main tools we use 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.190
 to honor our students 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.210
 is the error is that is the ortiz mano is that is the hours is a split award 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.510
 in eight categories 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.600
 for sale 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.020
 stamp owners 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.650
 have the opportunity to expose their work to the world
