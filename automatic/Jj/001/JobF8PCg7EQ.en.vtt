00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.910
 hello how about you guys welcome to 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.620
 configurarequipos am angel vÃ­lchez and 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.020
 Today we are here to make a 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.029
 small guide or a series of tips to 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.789
 when buying a mobile phone 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:19.400
 used or second hand watch is one of 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.460
 the most important things is that when 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.279
 buy something used do not cheat us or not 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.009
 we receive something that agrees with what 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.749
 that promised the offer well for 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.960
 it is important to go to pages 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:35.360
 specialized in second-party ads 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.430
 hand they have reputation systems and 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.420
 in which we can report a scam 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.760
 or something similar 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.900
 so a thousand second-hand ads or 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.060
 walt aft 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.830
 ebay and I give for example has a good 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.420
 reputation system of sellers that 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.090
 allows us to know a little about 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.790
 reliability of it if we can then 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.890
 well another thing is very important 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.380
 try to always look for a phone 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.540
 mobile phone of someone who lives near 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.430
 our area why because of this 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.710
 way we can somehow make a 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.960
 stay and see the mobile phone in 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.270
 person things we have to look very 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 well that the housing is completely 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.289
 that does not have many scratches very 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.140
 important that the buttons work 

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:17.850
 you all take us after a disappointment or 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
 that the screen for example is not 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.610
 I leave little in this to things because 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.490
 the fact that it has a failure does not 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.439
 it implies that we do not buy the terminal 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.200
 change some accessories some 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.880
 parts is usually very cheap and easy as well 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.709
 that if you find any damage 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.709
 take advantage at that moment to 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:39.630
 renegotiate or bargain in the price other 

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:42.679
 which is important to always check 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.880
 what you can is that the usb connector 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:47.280
 work correctly you already know that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.869
 many people are very beasts try 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.539
 connect in some way and end 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.849
 damaging the charging terminal so it's 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.429
 important as long as you can use it 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:57.840
 another of the tips that we give to the 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.479
 time to buy a mobile phone from 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.939
 second hand is that you try to do the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.520
 ie payment transaction through 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.829
 a platform that guarantees you a 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 refund in case of fraud or that the 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.480
 product come damaged for example as 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.430
 paypal some of the most platforms 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.210
 popular as ebay for example I'll 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.270
 It allows 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.300
 and little more than telling you is important yes 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.930
 that you try that the seller gives you the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.000
 of purchase this serves two reasons why 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.580
 a side like this we make sure that the 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.950
 mobile phone is not stolen since 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.020
 you know that the law punishes so much that 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.030
 sells something stolen like the one who buys it 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.240
 and guys I assure you that it is very easy 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.490
 detect a stolen phone the other 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.440
 advantage of having the ticket of 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.260
 purchase is that if the terminal is still in 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.640
 guarantee with the purchase ticket 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.100
 We can take our phone to 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.640
 free technical service without having 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.220
 what to do own expense 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.740
 and nothing else I think these tips and a 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.480
 little bit of common sense are going to make you 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.580
 any purchase and not just one 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.730
 mobile phone but from any other 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:08.520
 device is a safe purchase and 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.200
 successful if you will not have problems very 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.360
 nothing more guys we hope that I have 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.770
