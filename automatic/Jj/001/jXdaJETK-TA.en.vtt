proceed what I'm gonna do there I'm
gonna<00:01:23.400> deal<00:01:23.610> with<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.820> signature<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
gonna deal with the signature and I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.440 
gonna deal with the signature and I
always<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.950> straight<00:01:26.220> lines<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:27.150> wasn't<00:01:27.420> a

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
straight line and maybe maybe that's a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.520 
straight line and maybe maybe that's a
