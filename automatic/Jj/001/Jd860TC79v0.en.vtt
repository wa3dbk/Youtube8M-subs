00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.649
 under 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.080
 e 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.510
 hi to all and welcome to 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.280
 gameblog.fr here on the center 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.410
 playstation look right behind me 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.650
 the famous project because you know this 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.730
 pure car simulation ago 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.200
 few moments I had the opportunity to 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.570
 play drive flop you know you 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.940
 have our impressions on gameblog 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.379
 and suddenly it was an opportunity to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.960
 really compare these two 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.070
 quite diametrically opposed styles 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.770
 since on one side of the rail club 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.989
 it is these arcades and which projects cars 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.300
 it's very very very simulation so 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.850
 very honestly the visual rendering is 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.199
 quite different I find that at the level 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.989
 of this comparison the over two 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.750
 ps4 drive club versions take it for 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.760
 the moment project 15 clearly seems 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:09.130
 to really be pulling all his power 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.610
 on the pc really sure booster but on 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.930
 ps4 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.390
 in the version anyway we could 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.530
 try this alliance still not bad ago 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.710
 some small framerate swings 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.990
 nothing dramatic yet but the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.880
 rendering is a little worse than that of 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.320
 drive club on the other hand in terms of 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.330
 driving sensations down there one is 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.049
 really in pure simulation 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.020
 truly must be done extremely 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.690
 attention the weight gains we feel the 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.060
 vehicle shirking under either as soon as we 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.040
 put a tire on the low side a little bit 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.900
 as soon as we bite a little bit on the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.160
 lawn and suddenly there are very good 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.900
 sensations especially with the views 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.340
 interior I do not know if our friend a 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.780
 moment we are going to put in then the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.390
 interior view is really good 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.010
 very immersive his balance well we are 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.300
 in and then the competitors around 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.890
 we are very lively 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.420
 they try paris does not hesitate to 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.650
 really try to make you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.360
 fish tails to finally pass 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.460
 they really are making their way 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.260
 is not in a wait-and-see steering he 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.330
 must really sweat on the controller 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.150
 it reminds a little bit of the title of 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.460
 god suzuki- on the two ferrari who 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.570
 was really f355 challenge that was 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.159
 really very pointed at this level 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.879
 it is close enough to the shot is enough 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.989
 punitive 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.030
 we may have a little less 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.069
 the habit on more living room consoles 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.690
 on pc but suddenly I found at 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.909
 as the races 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.629
 I chained down the pleasure comes because 

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.250
 that suddenly we have to be 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:22.989
 extremely attentive you will have it 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.360
 understood it's really all 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.700
 first impressions this is a version 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.860
 which is absolutely not finalized on 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.540
 ps4 right now but that was it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.189
 opportunity the power compare two 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.719
 car stocks the two turns there 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.180
 on ps4 but you know it a project because 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.230
 will also be released on other xbox machines 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.060
 next gen and pc 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.400
 here we go we find ourselves very quickly on 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.470
 gameblog hashtag e3 gameblog to follow 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.319
 the living room and its backstage on twitter 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.269
 all week long with iggy feathers and 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.599
 with my mouth then I'm counting on you 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.599
