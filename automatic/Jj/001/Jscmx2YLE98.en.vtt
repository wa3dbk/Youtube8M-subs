 Pencil technique * by Rui Castro Lobo 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The first step is to draw, with a light colored pencil, the coloring theme. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.880
 The second stage consists of coloring, the whole drawing with pencils of medium tonality. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.880
 In this example, another middle key is blue. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 Another medium shade is carmine. 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 The third stage consists of coloring, through overlapping, areas whose colors are intended to be mixed. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 It is the case of the carmine with the yellow, to obtain orange color. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 When mixing now, yellow to carmine, an orange color is created even more alive. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.200
 Mix blue to yellow to get green. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 When you mix it now, yellow to blue, it creates an even more lively green. 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.200
 Mix white to blue to get light blue. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.400
 The fourth stage consists of coloring, through overlapping, areas of light tonality and brightness. 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:32.000
 Mix white with the various colors for light shades of these colors. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 The fourth stage consists of coloring, through overlapping, areas of dark tonality. 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.000
 Add some black notes. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
 Reinforce some areas of darker tonality. 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.320
 Add small notes of brightness. 

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.920
 Reinforce some areas of lighter hue. 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.360
 To finish, color the trunk starting with the middle tone. 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.000
 Color the darker tone. 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.240
 Color the highlights. 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.240
 Finish with some brightness details. 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.200
 Now it's your turn!
