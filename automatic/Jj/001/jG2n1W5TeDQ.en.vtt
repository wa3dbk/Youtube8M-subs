that wall street view looks like as well
so<00:00:21.029> I've<00:00:21.330> done<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.720> previous<00:00:22.050> devices<00:00:22.529> so

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
so I've done this on previous devices so

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.070 
so I've done this on previous devices so
miles<00:00:23.730> put<00:00:23.970> through<00:00:24.240> space<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:24.990> as

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
miles put through space in this one as

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.189 
miles put through space in this one as
well<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.830> let's<00:00:26.010> jump<00:00:26.189> into<00:00:26.369> application<00:00:27.199> so

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
well so let's jump into application so

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.759 
well so let's jump into application so
it's<00:00:28.890> going<00:00:29.070> fine<00:00:29.189> application<00:00:29.849> first<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.269> all

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:30.769 
it's going fine application first of all

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.080 
it's going fine application first of all
and<00:00:31.769> we'll<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.279> zoom<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.700> bit<00:00:32.820> so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.150 
free you know pretty fast if you got
quick<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.989> obviously<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.710> will<00:00:49.920> get

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
quick like that obviously you will get

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.090 
quick like that obviously you will get
your<00:00:50.480> you<00:00:51.480> barden<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.170> that's<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.070> be

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
your you barden but that's to be

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.010 
your you barden but that's to be
expected<00:00:54.829> so<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.489> Pinta<00:00:56.940> zoom<00:00:57.120> feature<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
expected so the Pinta zoom feature is a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.069 
expected so the Pinta zoom feature is a
not<00:00:58.949> pre<00:00:59.190> pretty<00:00:59.579> quick<00:00:59.760> as<00:00:59.879> well<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
not pre pretty quick as well and it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.689 
not pre pretty quick as well and it
seems<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.440> little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.920> hesitation<00:01:02.100> but

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
seems to a little bit of hesitation but

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.520 
seems to a little bit of hesitation but
not<00:01:02.910> nothing<00:01:03.300> major<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.260> there's<00:01:04.439> nothing

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
not nothing major and there's nothing

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
not nothing major and there's nothing
i'd<00:01:04.860> say<00:01:05.100> i<00:01:05.519> wouldn't<00:01:05.939> get<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.150> phone<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
i'd say i wouldn't get the phone just

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.719

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.859 
want a problem at all so you know that's
basically<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> basic<00:01:56.850> feature<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
basically the basic feature on the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.080 
basically the basic feature on the
honestly<00:01:58.649> within<00:01:58.920> Google<00:01:59.280> Maps<00:01:59.430> yourself<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
honestly within Google Maps yourself and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
honestly within Google Maps yourself and
we'll<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.020> quick<00:02:01.170> look<00:02:01.200> at<00:02:01.469> street<00:02:01.799> view

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
we'll have a quick look at street view

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
we'll have a quick look at street view
as<00:02:02.070> well<00:02:02.630> so<00:02:03.630> I'll<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.579> load<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.820> dress<00:02:06.149> up

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360

as well so I'll just load the dress up
and<00:02:07.759> we'll<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:08.940> street<00:02:09.300> view

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and we'll do street view

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.259 
and we'll do street view
right<00:02:12.069> so<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:12.370> is<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.670> street<00:02:12.940> view<00:02:13.120> in

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
right so this is the street view in

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.470 
right so this is the street view in

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
hesitation on this part at all he's you

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.759 
hesitation on this part at all he's you
know<00:02:36.370> very<00:02:36.670> very<00:02:36.940> slow<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.420> we<00:02:38.319> shall<00:02:38.530> turn

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
know very very slow and we shall turn

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:40.770 
know very very slow and we shall turn
compass<00:02:39.159> motor<00:02:39.400> which<00:02:40.150> obviously<00:02:40.360> could<00:02:40.659> be<00:02:40.720> a

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
compass motor which obviously could be a

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.440 
compass motor which obviously could be a
bit<00:02:40.930> difficult<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.379> show<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.099> full

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
bit difficult to show the the full

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.180 
bit difficult to show the the full
aspect<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.629> it<00:02:43.780> but<00:02:44.019> I<00:02:45.629> think<00:02:46.629> you'll<00:02:46.750> agree

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
aspect of it but I think you'll agree

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.759 
aspect of it but I think you'll agree
it's<00:02:48.190> pretty<00:02:48.989> pretty<00:02:49.989> faster<00:02:50.349> what<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.590> come

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
it's pretty pretty faster what you come

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.580 
it's pretty pretty faster what you come
you<00:02:51.040> know<00:02:51.129> you<00:02:51.220> can't<00:02:51.459> see<00:02:51.579> on<00:02:51.609> there<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:53.410> it's

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
you know you can't see on there and it's

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.259 
you know you can't see on there and it's
very<00:02:53.739> hard<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.040> show<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.459> default<00:02:54.879> detailed

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
very hard to show the default detailed

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.349 
very hard to show the default detailed
demo<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.799> i<00:02:56.829> can<00:02:57.129> just<00:02:57.430> a<00:02:57.640> word<00:02:57.879> for<00:02:58.060> that<00:02:58.120> one

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
demo so i can just a word for that one

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:01.649 
demo so i can just a word for that one
but<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:59.140> know<00:02:59.319> I<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.760> know<00:03:00.879> he's<00:03:01.329> pretty

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
but you know I you know he's pretty

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.860 
but you know I you know he's pretty
impressive<00:03:02.220> he<00:03:03.220> definitely<00:03:03.540> lives<00:03:04.540> up<00:03:04.629> to<00:03:04.690> the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
impressive he definitely lives up to the

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.809 
impressive he definitely lives up to the
galaxy's<00:03:05.440> to<00:03:05.650> in<00:03:05.769> terms<00:03:06.010> this<00:03:06.250> stuff<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:06.609> terms
