these are some hot water tank pictures

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.910 
these are some hot water tank pictures
as<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.820> can<00:01:53.939> see<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.350> the<00:01:55.350> build-up<00:01:55.740> and

demonstration of the equinox heating
system<00:04:49.930> as<00:04:50.320> we<00:04:51.009> can<00:04:51.160> see<00:04:51.509> obviously<00:04:52.509> a

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
system as we can see obviously a

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.360 
system as we can see obviously a
three-way<00:04:53.020> valve<00:04:53.440> and<00:04:53.740> the<00:04:53.800> controller<00:04:54.160> and

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
three-way valve and the controller and

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.499 
three-way valve and the controller and
stuff<00:04:54.550> is<00:04:54.669> in<00:04:54.820> there<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.120> this<00:04:55.270> is<00:04:55.389> a<00:04:55.419> little

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
stuff is in there so this is a little

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.600 
stuff is in there so this is a little
different<00:04:56.350> display<00:04:56.800> but<00:04:56.979> it's<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.430> same

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
different display but it's the same

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.969 
different display but it's the same
thing<00:04:57.639> cold<00:04:58.599> water<00:04:58.870> is<00:04:59.169> poking<00:04:59.740> out<00:04:59.860> of<00:04:59.889> the

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
thing cold water is poking out of the

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.439 
thing cold water is poking out of the
bottom<00:05:00.280> of<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.430> tank<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:00.880> sent<00:05:01.330> to<00:05:01.419> the

collector<00:05:01.930> on<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> roof<00:05:04.139> now<00:05:05.139> this<00:05:05.349> is

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
collector on the roof now this is

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.469

actually<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:06.190> isn't<00:05:06.400> a<00:05:06.550> glycol<00:05:06.970> system<00:05:07.360> this

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:07.479 
actually this isn't a glycol system this

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:09.960 
actually this isn't a glycol system this
