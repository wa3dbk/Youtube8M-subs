00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:03.959
 all right 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.180
 hi youtube was pick szeged and 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.650
 welcome to the review of the m 27 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.760
 season 2 here remember that your 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.559
 videos are not to demonstrate skills 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.389
 but so that they see how they will work in 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.340
 hands of an average wimpy like I am 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.810
 I also if they are here do not forget 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.369
 comment with the next weapon that they are 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.650
 green or else comment with the 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.300
 word of the day that is photo let's start 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.000
 with the review of the m 27 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.619
 r in real life to m27 and see and now 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.720
 serious sea or is a weapon developed 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.550
 because I clan with the country of germany for 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.769
 the service of the USA especially of the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.269
 marines since the year of 2011 uses the 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.839
 ammunition common and current and standard 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:40.879
 the 5.56 x 45 millimeters of the NATO with 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:42.979
 the firing rate of 640 shots 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.720
 per minute maximum even curious because 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:47.780
 is giving me it is based on the platform 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.909
 the jec lean with the hk 416 that shoots 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.320
 clearly faster the reason for the 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.330
 slower speed is because you can 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.699
 overheat less since this weapon 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.170
 is nobody in proposal to work 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.180
 between what would be a machine gun 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.250
 light and an assault rifle or something like that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.530
 how to suppress fire but it will not be a 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.479
 marksman rifle is like I covered it in 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.400
 the split between various weapons and now 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.320
 observe 2003 this weapon is unlocked 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.000
 from the beginning for the class of 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.770
 side support 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.840
 and if you want to use it with the 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.790
 Russian class have to get 170,000 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.230
 points in the support class have 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.300
 model of damage identical to what they would be 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.740
 the assault rifles with a death of 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.440
 four shots within the first eight 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.300
 meters and after 50 meters a death 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.920
 of six shots in terms of the design that 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.690
 both occupy the screen of your mobility 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.010
 it's pretty mobile it's the best of the 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.260
 kind of support if you want 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.369
 function as what would be a kind of 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.290
 assault but with the possibility of 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.900
 have four visas the boxes of 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.210
 ammo is the option along with the the 86 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.890
 a 2 has 45 bullets in the charger more 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.330
 one in the bedroom which is the biggest 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.990
 advantage over what would be rifles of 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.399
 assault 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.920
 now well past statistics now 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.800
 we went to what makes this weapon great 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.050
 we started by recharging 1.9 seconds 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.910
 when you have bullets from the charger and 2.50 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.979
 no bullets in the charger is the most 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.320
 fast from support class 2 the 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.820
 cadence of 750 shots per minute of 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.229
 this weapon makes it a strong 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.600
 contender in close combat 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.539
 even at long distance only 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.640
 overcome by what will be the m 249 3 the 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.800
 bullet speed of 650 shots per 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.209
 minute what makes the bullet faster 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.709
 of the support class so 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.360
 shoot moving targets at 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.900
 long distance will not be a big problem 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.700
 with 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.590
 this machine gun the shooting modes that 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.629
 you have automatic and semi automatic 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.310
 only and the good iron look is 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.860
 useful in quotation marks since when you 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.239
 they shoot after a while followed the 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.799
 flash that will be the end of the barrel 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.810
 it covers a little whatever your look 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.790
 then I recommend you better what 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.170
 would be a look if we talk about what 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.329
 will be the shooting pattern that is also 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.790
 controls mainly going upwards 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.260
 and to the right if you do not go 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.689
 to lie if you are used to 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.579
 easy weapons in quotes like the m m 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.590
 16 over 1,400 and 6 are going to have a little 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.450
 of problems if they like to use weapons 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.220
 like those that three to three or some to 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.750
 put the heavier than this 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.639
 definitely not going to feel the 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.870
 difference and you will have a very option 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:59.269
 similar to what they did reflected 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.859
 high in the support class regarding the 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.659
 pressure I must say that while it is not 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:04.159
 perfect and they will have some problems 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.109
 if you are used to 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.060
 as the class assault I must say that it is 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.099
 too precise and too mobile with 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.409
 a point 4 with zero being the most accurate 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:15.019
 of the 4 point score counted from the 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.939
 look and 3.5 from the hip is clearly 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:18.530
 the most accurate weapon of the kind of support 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.139
 good for some variations maybe the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.720
 86 to 2 is more anticipatory situations 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.530
 if you put the heavy cannon even 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.450
 even more 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.610
 and they're going to realize that it's almost almost 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.500
 like having an assault rifle in your 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.940
 pocket the bad part is that maybe not 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.860
 have that shooting pattern so easy 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.090
 to handle as with a rifle assault by 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.680
 the fact that he had told them about 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.720
 pattern shot up and towards 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.090
 the right and also if you want 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.860
 be precise they need to click through 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.110
 each burst is to say not to be seen totally 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.120
 but automatically make one a few clicks 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.459
 click for every 5 shots ie 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.500
 small bursts to make them more 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.970
 effective equally that make a 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.950
 small sacrifice that will have to run 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.150
 since making small bursts his 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.920
 multiplier of the first shot 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.910
 practically doubles the pattern of 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.560
 shot that he had already said with 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.420
 Priority in terms of accessories 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.040
 suggested depending on who use it 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.480
 if you are going to use the most as 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.160
 what will be a long reach for the 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.590
 class of support usually the class 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.880
 It is recommended to have a bipod and what 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.860
 it would be a heavy gun if you go to 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.390
 use it in close combat or 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.640
 more or less half distance where they know 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.590
 that your contenders are going to be more 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.060
 know that they use a laser sight and if 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.010
 they also have problems controlling 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.690
 the pattern shot to the right can 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.040
 Also use a front handle as well 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.900
 that being elevates me to a qualification of 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.870
 4 slices of pizza on 4 because 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.249
 it's just a pretty useful weapon in 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.869
 the support class is the opposite 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:35.119
 It is very versatile for almost any 

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:36.469
 situation except obviously having a 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:38.509
 a lot of bullets that would be the 

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.099
 only drawback however is a 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:42.259
 great machine gun and definitely 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:44.059
 it is worth to remove all the accessories 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.679
 for her and good up to here the review 

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:47.659
 from the 27 m I hope you liked it 

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:49.969
 if so, please a rating 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.319
 to the video and go to the channel if they are not 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.879
 subscribed to see the most 

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:54.199
 content and if you want to subscribe 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:55.609
 facebook and twitter is in the 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.169
 description and other videos that have not 

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:59.649
 seen on the next screen we see 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.649
 in the next 

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.580
 all right
