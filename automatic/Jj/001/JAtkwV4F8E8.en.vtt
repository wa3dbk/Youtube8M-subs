see<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> grease<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> on<00:01:26.310> here<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:27.390> will

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
see the grease is on here that will

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.109 
see the grease is on here that will
cause<00:01:27.689> any<00:01:28.020> column<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> slip<00:01:29.009> no<00:01:29.610> problem

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
cause any column to slip no problem

though<00:01:31.040> just<00:01:32.040> cinder<00:01:32.460> up

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
though just cinder up

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.240 
though just cinder up
so<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.720> means<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.650> really<00:01:35.040> don't

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
so what that means is you really don't

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.480 
so what that means is you really don't
want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.490> touch<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.150> calling<00:01:37.049> surface<00:01:37.530> which

wouldn't want to throw it in the back of
the<00:01:43.920> trucks<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.970> might<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.299> some<00:01:45.509> grease

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the trucks was it might be some grease

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.830 
the trucks was it might be some grease
or<00:01:46.110> some<00:01:46.290> oil<00:01:46.700> because<00:01:47.700> if<00:01:47.880> it<00:01:48.030> did<00:01:48.270> stay<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
for a long period of time it could

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.319 
for a long period of time it could
penetrate<00:01:51.450> into<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.110> pores<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:53.329> eventually

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
penetrate into the pores and eventually

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.410 
penetrate into the pores and eventually

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
learn your column we're going to do just

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289
