00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 I also like the problems there 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:07.680
 have one of the top theme in the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.570
 esl he plays there starcraft 2 the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.030
 work then if others haye free 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.349
 but he comes around the world so that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 and much more now in the talk with 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:21.619
 kuli okay, the situation is altogether quite 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
 Well 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.340
 yesterday here now little 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.640
 gambled ran reasonably well that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.349
 means yesterday was the qualification 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.930
 for the world cyber games I am 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.190
 become second 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 You play a specific game 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.460
 That's exactly what starcraft 2 is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.809
 real time strategy game short to 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.620
 explanation one can imagine how 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 chess but in contrast to the bay 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.530
 you also have to ride with the rider and 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.300
 acted with the runners Hauptmann pan 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.920
 it's not just that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.219
 which trains you make then as well 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.440
 you make the trains 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 There is also this measurement in the game 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.090
 aperam action panels and so the fast 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.430
 Names stop in like 300 actions that the 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.500
 to make a minute only as one 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.689
 Amount then okay how much do you have I am 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 one of the slower professionals i have 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.580
 So perhaps as 140 around 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.390
 okay how do you manage it then on place 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.560
 two he is not of course not brand 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.720
 just how fast you click 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.720
 but you also have to be colleagues 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.579
 will be happy soon again 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 can make a good decision and that 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.259
 it's just not one of my strengths 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
 for the pure speed 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.119
 One is called also the armor 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.770
 general exactly the players so in 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.810
 Starcraft has three weapons underneath 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.460
 is one of the terrans are for the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 people and there you can stop too 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.640
 at that time also a unit has the tank 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.770
 Panzer and I became well-known by it 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 to build a lot of them 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.479
 I'm a little bit of that now 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.500
 but the game style deviated so the 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:04.049
 spitzname stops just how do you become 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.579
 profi gamer how do you get there because of me 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.540
 There are a lot of people around 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.090
 home 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:13.470
 starcraft 2 play how does the water look 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.970
 is millions of years in total 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.340
 The game is several million times 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.910
 helge quantity sells a lot and how 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.950
 you will be profi gamer so stop 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.750
 just so I would say I say 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.880
 just stop starcraft 2 very much 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.920
 Long strong teams played in starcraft 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.540
 1 2 there was just no big scene 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.900
 every now and then a few smaller ones 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.720
 events and then as the purchase of two out 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.590
 came immediately changed and was called 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.720
 quite good 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.910
 and then that's just how it developed 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.990
 increased there were more and more 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.400
 big events what does that mean? 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.440
 Privacy means what did you have 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.720
 before that happens for plans 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:57.270
 and what has changed now yes it 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.650
 then either already or more often 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.870
 so that one just on the weekend 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:04.230
 then there is a lot to do there are events 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.840
 the big tournaments with me is that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.430
 always a bit twisted actually 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.480
 in the people have the normal job 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.300
 I always have to work 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.340
 Free okay in an evening or on 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.019
 then sometimes already play weekend 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.180
 a bit stressful and problematic 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:29.070
 you want to get there someday 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.370
 what do you think there is sometimes it is it 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.450
 maybe a way of the one way 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.620
 bring where you might not want to go 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.880
 because you can not do that anymore and 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.110
 can let whatever you want 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.570
 or is it really a perspective 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.580
 It did not matter that's it 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.950
 fantastic the same is the one that weighs 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.540
 that on everything will say that that 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.940
 horse so it makes a lot of fun one 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.709
 comes around a lot I'm now already 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.480
 several times I already know usa 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.480
 I'll never go that easy otherwise 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.280
 Come and experience a lot also finds 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.650
 makes many new contacts and friends 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.579
 so 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:08.269
 It's worth it, you seem 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.950
 you have to be deeply relaxed to the 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.090
 Games are for gambling 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.680
 So I would say it has its 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.920
 Advantages because if you stop on the 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.070
 plays stage and totally it plays 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:21.739
 you automatically have worse but also 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.660
 otherwise content I think that travel so 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.090
 always a bit stressful and if 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.590
 you just can not handle it anymore 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.370
 then that will affect the 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.430
 performance 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.750
 there are some players who have theirs 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.639
 online for example are extremely strong 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.440
 and then you will be on stage as soon as possible 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.550
 you on the stage do not play anymore 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:43.639
 hinbekommen as always a bit 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.240
 sad since no game works and 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.260
 a not-so what his strategy 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.900
 That has changed positively 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:57.130
 the armor is no longer effective 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:05:00.830
 channel in a match against protoss 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:03.310
 that works well and for us 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:06.340
 not always as desired but it 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.389
 I also have a lot of work training 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.570
 You can not even do it that way 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.710
 make fast but star has taken 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.220
 and takes his time 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.960
 ok then patience and spit and again 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.630
 full 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.880
 thank you more about gaming for example 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.729
 living with dolls developer of edna 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.849
 breaks out jan mÃ¼ller-michaelis he says 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:31.250
 there was or said crytek got angry 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:34.360
 looked because he is somehow not so 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:38.260
 on the games you prefer something 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.729
 develop and also very exciting and 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:44.570
 funny even if it's a sad one 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:46.099
 title has told haudegen why she 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.740
 sometimes have to cry but are great 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:51.409
 guys and if they cry then that is 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.970
 too nice now so how 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:55.760
 I should let time to 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.010
 decide on one of these two 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.770
 that's why videos are so active 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.039
 I just wait until the doctor 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.039
 coming 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.080
 but not only these
