00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 the girls once we are with a new 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.730
 video and here in my kitchen now it's going to be 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.080
 a dessert that is already good after 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 a meal can not miss the dessert 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.519
 really good now I'm going to teach 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.350
 how to make a banana cake but not 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.620
 in the oven so stay here to 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.930
 know how there 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.330
 here I have the ingredients and 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.360
 first let's start with the flour 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.770
 banana bread mix this can you 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.930
 find is useful preferably for 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.570
 those who live here in the USA in 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.700
 mexico can if you do not enter this because 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.140
 the truth I do not know if it's Mexican though 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.140
 but I do not know if they sell it there 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.989
 I think they can use any 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.699
 matter if it is not of this fabric 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.519
 it's called chiquita the brand something like that 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.079
 they can use another one that is not of this one 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:56.079
 you're going to need an egg, your banana, you 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:03.410
 Vanilla your powder for baking power to 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.120
 put our mixture but not what 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.860
 let's put it in the oven but 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.170
 of formal we want it to come out spongy 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.080
 not though we put it in the pan 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.180
 and you this to beat because the truth is not 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.950
 It is very necessary if you have a blender 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.630
 I also have but it's not very 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.220
 I need you to make me lie 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.340
 to striped all that movement then 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:25.729
 nothing else you take tubes 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.270
 in this way to stir a third of 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.890
 water and a container for the mixture not 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.570
 very important 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 most importantly the karam frying pan and you 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.520
 butter to put in the area of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.950
 so they do not stick and he had 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
 stoves since I said I was encouraged to do 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.640
 this video because I know that maybe 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.550
 there are ones that are afraid of the oven or 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.130
 they do not have west because they simply do not 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.320
 like to use voices to the best 16 no no I 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.450
 liked to know if it's okay and then you can 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.790
 make your desserts yet but in the study 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.020
 matisse what better truth and good we are going to 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.520
 start 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:08.800
 ok I already put my money they are now in 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.970
 miss me tile 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.440
 is 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.920
 and now we are going to beat 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.920
 okay 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.560
 and we are going to be fine either 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.560
 banana 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.970
 thus 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.409
 if we continue this time with things 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:48.560
 well the banana do not want us to go 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.560
 to leave a piece true and in the pie 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.700
 everything is fine 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.860
 is my bra with butter was 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.510
 fighting with him but he put it with my 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.850
 miserable or I do not know how you day but good 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:19.560

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:23.610
 for this is going to be the mix and I 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.210
 what I do I put the medium here and 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.010
 I'll leave it like 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:31.280
 [Music] 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.920
 I leave it with about 15-20 I have to be 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.140
 looking at this care the truth either 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.270
 I'm going to leave it there and what I use are 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.930
 chopsticks 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:44.469
 when your cake is 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.430
 it's like you more or less know that 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:51.159
 it will no longer be or something goods and 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:54.250
 he punched in the grass in the pastel no and he 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.200
 install with stick busbar is that 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.159
 still not there if they do not go wrong 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.430
 we are already going to empty the mixture here 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:05.849
 is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.849
 showing the plates 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.620
 and I'm going to see it 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.620
 and I miss this 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.180
 and we empty 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.180
 [Music] 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.530
 good leave nothing of me 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.710
 miserable to take away all the excess to 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.879
 the pot and then to start learning 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.909
 because good is also my mix up 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:50.509
 So now I'm going to learn 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:52.120
 medium ok let's leave a little while there and 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.470
 Well now you come back 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.249
 here is my cake 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.420
 it's so 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:06.490
 and well I have my 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.490
 my cream to put the rainbow 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:14.460
 well let's put it on 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.460
 but yes less 

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.669
 how 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.759
 remember that your cake has to be 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.300
 order to be able to answer the creampie 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.300
 reeve ok 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:37.430
 cold Cold Cold 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:41.680
 and so it's easier to manage 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.680
 the creampie and stop it here 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:47.060
 I believe that to be without 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.980
 no sweet is not cake 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.520
