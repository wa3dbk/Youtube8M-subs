00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.220
 Well hello dear friends in 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.250
 This video review I will tell you about 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.380
 shield for the game varfeys small hack buy no 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 name previously launched the game here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.320
 also launched a shield which 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 by itself bought for inject years that way 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.640
 the context menu is invoked with 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.470
 home keys 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.439
 Here it looks so mean first thing 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:32.870
 you can set up an interface for yourself and I 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:37.469
 in the color tab here is 1 color form up 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:41.969
 choose a runner back and forth as you 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:43.739
 like now choose a color for yourself then 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.680
 there is a principle this is not particularly important 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.190
 the element hereafter the cakes 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.110
 first tab hawk it includes such 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.940
 functions like shutdown recoil 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 i.e. anti recoil and accuracy 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:04.019
 here then there is a p-3d box drive 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.720
 enemies box rectangle then say 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.900
 here then the skeleton I usually use it 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.240
 now you will see how it looks in the game 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.220
 that's the same from a distance who cares 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.740
 how far is the enemy yes and 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.510
 in general, that's also an individual 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.600
 color setting 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.900
 their own and also for the enemies behind the wall and 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 in front of you and of course shows 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.420
 small highlight 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.930
 all enemies or just your own ones then 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.120
 go to the next tab and im 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.230
 the first one includes the wall count 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:42.110
 it is important for those who use them and in the RFP 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:45.960
 so as not to bathe not to shoot through the walls 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.670
 akkas goals also choose where will 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.690
 salting in the head or in the body 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.780
 initially take the body then on and im 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 shoots automatically that is on 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.170
 usual automatically shoot with 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.410
 salt or you can put 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.940
 key example i put it and it will be 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:08.179
 induced only in the case when you 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:11.910
 hold the key and then the magnet is with us 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.300
 so in a magnet magnet i will show you already in 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.160
 the game 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.580
 there are coordinates that you can 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.770
 customize as you will be more convenient 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.770
 That principle is all this will find the game 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.920
 answer context menu can be turned off 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.069
 join those already playing 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.770
 while the game is loading I want from 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.190
 myself personally thank dmitri but 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:45.780
 smart 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:49.100
 for a great cheat in all likelihood me 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.100
 for now just exclude 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.820
 but let's hope for a split second now 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:03.510
 see for yourself how the skeleton looks 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.950
 here and in parallel it will be induced 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:24.700
 I hope they just started, we will have time 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:34.620
 pasca control points in many 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:34.620
 countries are waiting 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.410
 as well as possible and at the usual clear 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.860
 destroy as persistent 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.550
 so on and let them shoot 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.550
 head 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.690
 we see brushes getting into 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:25.289
 so let's go some more but now it is 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:29.180
 time to try a magnet so a magnet 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:31.770
 contributed so 02 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.160
 each exposes for himself as he 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.160
 conveniently 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.370
 so on this but also ended a lot 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.879
 high magnet demonstration running 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.879
 fine 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.120
 just gorgeous 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:47.429
 and they are parallel to the magnet is true that I 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:47.429
 haven't kicked out of this company yet 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.700
 ammo replenished to play 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.930
 here at the moment the cheat is ready and 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:15.539
 completely that is some features still 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:18.669
 not included in it such as rapid fire 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:21.030
 in principle, next you will see that 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.030
 will be 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.250
 here is the most gusto 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:47.020
 In principle, I think this can be done. 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:47.020
 complete our review 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.380
 and then we become the dominator data 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.460
 party 

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.780
 highly recommend walking with 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.080
 Proven people to you would not 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.260
 have filed a complaint on this we end 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:28.300
 Thank you all for watching with you 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:28.300
 new york enjoyable games goodbye
