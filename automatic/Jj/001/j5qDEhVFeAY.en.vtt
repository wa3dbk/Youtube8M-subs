00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.230
 Hello, my love is already approaching autumn 

00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:18.000
 I wanted to make them look perfect for 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.050
 this season at the same time dark and some 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.050
 simple eyes 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.300
 The first thing I will be doing is 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.790
 hydrating my face with this one 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.830
 horsehair moment and I love it and it goes 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.140
 according to my skin type that is 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.790
 combined to fat so important is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.220
 the first step and second I will be 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.330
 hydrating my lips with this balm 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.949
 of mincho tenant this and if that is 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.720
 extremely important to have the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.210
 face and lips well hydrated 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.840
 now he will be using a first of 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.879
 face this is your face and basically what 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.130
 What it does is that my makeup lasts all 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.520
 the day now I will be filling in my 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.649
 Prawit eyebrows with this eyeliner anna 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.950
 stay in the chocolate tone and 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:08.080
 I practically fill my eyebrows with 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.240
 small pieces rather stuart 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.610
 visual so I have it for you to see 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.259
 this but all with small pieces 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.590
 to make it look much more natural 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.590
 wax 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.000
 so that the eyebrow is more perfect and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.969
 see how cleaner the area I will be 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.759
 using this jennings council that I 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.229
 fascinate this I really use it for 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.539
 several little things but this time I 'll go 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.179
 using to clean around my 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.970
 eyebrows with this racket of elx that costs 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:55.490
 only one dollar so it solves me 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.310
 very well and as you can see from this 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.829
 appearance that the cea is more I do not know 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 how perfect is clean and that finish 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:05.070
 I also like the eyebrows 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.650
 how is the face going to be 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:12.030
 using the long color network stain me 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:15.240
 love fascinates me is a base that is 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.250
 medium coverage and I really like that 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.500
 color goes perfect with my skin tone 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.480
 so I'm going to be using the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.540

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.269

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.530

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.180
 a little bit of baking truth they do not know 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.519
 I made a video further east than 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.170

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.760

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.510

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.269

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:12.849
 makeup on the face and then I'm going to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.960
 be using translucent powder 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:18.520
 loose 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.520

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.190
 ah 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.040
 two 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.040
 ah 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.080

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.510
 i 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.220
 what loose dust lies on the 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.540
 face i will be using this duo 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:04.700
 of bronze and blogs but already mine died 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:09.110
 this one of him so I'm going to be giving him 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.950
 more structure to the face with this duo and 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.010
 if to blur the double chin out the 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.280
 cheeks out and tune my nose I'm going to 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.220
 be using the bronzer and as 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.350
 you can see then more or less like that I give 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.030
 it's where I put myself I use the eyebrow 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.440
 to give me take where I put the bronze 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.750
 and a little bit in the nose also for 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.760
 to refine but nothing precise but 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.910
 like I want a look like that tan 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.340
 so I'm going to be using a lot the 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:45.670
 process and now I'm going to be removing the 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.670
 excess loose powder with this quote 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.990
 basically the only thing that I will be 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:55.440
 making the eyes is to delineate them with 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.930
 this mascara liner I think it's 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.250
 this so that the look is opened and 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.380
 placing mask I'm 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.260

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.139
 carbon black my favorite mask 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.030
 all times and if much more expensive and 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.650
 nothing but not using my men 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.960
 or anything because I have a lipstick 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.990
 pretty striking I want the look to be 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.260

 I am inheriting this one lancear like blush 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:32.910
 it's because I want a more tanned look 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.830

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.900
