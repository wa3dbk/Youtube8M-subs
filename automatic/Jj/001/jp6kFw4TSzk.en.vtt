00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
they spawn closer to see and look at me

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.289 
they spawn closer to see and look at me

playing the objective even when i'm on a
kill<00:01:54.570> streak<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.439> beautiful<00:01:55.950> thing

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

so<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> go<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.119> Hut<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> overlook

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
so I like to go in that Hut and overlook

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.499 
so I like to go in that Hut and overlook
that<00:02:01.460> feel<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.729> they<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.030> spawn<00:02:03.299> there

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
that feel because they can spawn there

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.880 
that feel because they can spawn there
along<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> run<00:02:04.259> through<00:02:04.619> there

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
along and they like to run through there

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
along and they like to run through there
and<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:05.670> really<00:02:05.790> easy<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.060> pick<00:02:06.270> kills<00:02:06.540> if

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
and it's really easy to pick kills if

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.029 
and it's really easy to pick kills if
you're<00:02:06.810> using<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.110> three-round<00:02:07.649> burst<00:02:07.860> or

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
you're using a three-round burst or

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
you're using a three-round burst or
semi-automatic<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.940> my<00:02:09.060> case<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.709> usually

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
semi-automatic in my case I usually

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.990 
semi-automatic in my case I usually
don't<00:02:10.800> find<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.160> much<00:02:11.370> success<00:02:11.580> if<00:02:11.879> I'm

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
don't find that much success if I'm

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
don't find that much success if I'm
using<00:02:12.209> like<00:02:12.450> an<00:02:12.830> automatic

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
using like an automatic

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.290

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
up in like back in the day when I was

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.420 
up in like back in the day when I was
prestiging<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.050> used<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> right<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:17.160> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
prestiging I used the right here is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.589 
prestiging I used the right here is
where<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.640> was<00:02:17.790> talking<00:02:18.060> about<00:02:18.180> that<00:02:18.360> little

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
where I was talking about that little

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.360 
where I was talking about that little
area<00:02:18.830> back<00:02:19.830> in<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.040> day<00:02:20.130> when<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.310> was

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
area back in the day when I was

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.729 
area back in the day when I was
prestiging<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.660> a<00:02:21.690> famas<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.440> can<00:02:22.590> never

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
prestiging I use a famas and I can never

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.250 
prestiging I use a famas and I can never
use<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.130> this<00:02:23.190> map<00:02:23.430> because<00:02:23.760> um<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.300> feel

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
use it on this map because um I feel

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
use it on this map because um I feel
like<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> auto<00:02:25.709> doesn't<00:02:26.610> work<00:02:26.730> very<00:02:26.760> well

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
like the auto doesn't work very well

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.839 
like the auto doesn't work very well
with<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.690> range<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.459> just<00:02:29.670> my

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
with that range but that's just my

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.000 
with that range but that's just my
opinion<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.569> would<00:02:30.750> suggest<00:02:30.900> using<00:02:31.319> the<00:02:31.620> F<00:02:31.800> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
opinion I would suggest using the F and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.910 
opinion I would suggest using the F and
fail<00:02:32.220> or<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.700> g11<00:02:33.150> or<00:02:33.720> m16<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.680> you're<00:02:34.800> going

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
fail or the g11 or m16 if you're going

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.130 
fail or the g11 or m16 if you're going
to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> strategy<00:02:35.580> and<00:02:35.989> begin<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
to do the strategy and begin the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.979 
to do the strategy and begin the
tranching<00:02:37.739> my<00:02:37.890> gunship<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.610> doing<00:02:38.880> work<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.390> i

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
tranching my gunship is doing work and i

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.059 
tranching my gunship is doing work and i
believe<00:02:40.769> i<00:02:41.040> started<00:02:41.730> at<00:02:41.880> 12<00:02:42.239> no<00:02:42.840> 11<00:02:43.530> kills<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
believe i started at 12 no 11 kills and

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.330 
believe i started at 12 no 11 kills and
i<00:02:44.610> end<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.209> gunship<00:02:45.690> with<00:02:45.720> 37<00:02:46.560> which<00:02:47.130> is

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
i end this gunship with 37 which is

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.180 
i end this gunship with 37 which is
pretty<00:02:47.790> nice<00:02:48.030> that's<00:02:48.500> 26<00:02:49.500> kills<00:02:49.800> right<00:02:49.980> there

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
pretty nice that's 26 kills right there

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.850 
pretty nice that's 26 kills right there
if<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.239> did<00:02:51.390> my<00:02:51.510> math<00:02:51.690> right<00:02:51.989> I<00:02:52.410> find<00:02:52.799> myself

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
if I did my math right I find myself

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.009 
if I did my math right I find myself
often<00:02:53.459> when<00:02:54.030> referring<00:02:54.330> to<00:02:54.390> math<00:02:54.600> stuff<00:02:54.930> i

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
often when referring to math stuff i

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.840 
often when referring to math stuff i
usually<00:02:55.500> don't<00:02:55.680> apply<00:02:56.040> myself<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.519> all<00:02:56.670> and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
usually don't apply myself at all and

usually don't apply myself at all and
I'll<00:02:56.940> just<00:02:57.060> kind<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.269> like<00:02:57.390> quickly<00:02:57.720> think<00:02:57.959> I

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
I'll just kind of like quickly think I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
I'll just kind of like quickly think I
mean<00:02:58.590> I<00:02:58.799> don't<00:02:59.160> even<00:02:59.250> want<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.670> go<00:02:59.790> back<00:03:00.000> and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
make sure that's that 26 of the actual

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.009 
make sure that's that 26 of the actual
number<00:03:02.430> kills<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.790> got<00:03:02.940> but<00:03:03.150> that's<00:03:03.660> just<00:03:03.840> what
