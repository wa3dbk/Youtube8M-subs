00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.530
 way of life 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.200
 good to all how are you here 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:16.400
 Rodriguez this time I'm going to talk about 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.970
 the weapons of this new next pack of 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.009
 butterfield club quarters 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.660
 and well let's start with the rifles 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:29.570
 of assault that is the doctor's arms 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.570
 good to start we have the scale l 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:38.550
 this soul is a variant of scar h 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.820
 will not have automatic fire fire 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.060
 to bursts the range range will be 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.020
 between medium and long is not yet known and the 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.910
 cadence is still to be defined 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.160
 no more is known of this soul 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.160
 then we have the ag 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.250
 and that has automatic fire fire to 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.740
 bursts range of scope in between and 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:09.159
 cadence 650 and 750 round here the 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.159
 cadence 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.850
 today we are going to move to the arms of 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.600
 engineers 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:26.500
 we'll start with the cw 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.450
 automatic fire blast game 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.000
 range of scope will be half of the 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:41.170
 cadence will oscillate between the 800 1850 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:42.909
 then we have the walk 21 call me 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.540
 the shooting mode will be fire 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.899
 automatic fire bursts range of 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:54.549
 reach will be long and cadence will oscillate 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:58.030
 between 750 and 900 what it will do between 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.920
 cw was the metal 21 one of the weapons 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.420
 more primordial than maybe there will be in 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.420
 the rank of engineer 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.830
 we went to the support arms this time 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.920
 let's 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.920
 to give the characteristics of the 86's 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:21.190
 as fire automatic fire shooting 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.600
 to bursts medium reach and cadence between 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.600
 600 and 750 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:32.790
 we went to the side automatic flight 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.790
 fire bursts long reach and cadence 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.790
 650 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.970
 let's go to the recognitions for now 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.239
 These are new and could not be 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.430
 find will not be after a game 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.120
 deranged as a sniper will be 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.970
 I believe that the red buttons 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.330
 what is confirmed is that the jota in 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:03.540
 the 90 is from red as you saw in it 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:07.400
 tlc video of don already by three 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:11.180
 and good and the other sniper was the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.180
 m4 and 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.970
 for now you do not know anything else 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.340
 and then for all the classes we're going to 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.530
 have the blades 12 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 and now we know from previous that it is the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.140
 best game either 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.460
 from other platforms good and we know that 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.790
 It will be a shotgun of about 6 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.840
 bullets and 8 and with extended charger can 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.790
 being that reaches the skins or superiors 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.380
 for now I do not know anything else loneliness 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.600
 and the other one will be the 5k m 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.990
 and that of this I have only been able to find 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.060
 the image but I do not know much more good 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.470
 I hope you liked it and that I have 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.750
 served the information 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.850
 give it a like 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.630
 you think I did not work because this 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.630
 takes curro 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:09.390
 If you do not believe that I deserve it 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.969
 better say look at me missing 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.350
 this this this and that and you put it on me 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:17.050
 in the comments and for the next time 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.720
 I'm going to do better but good enough 

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.590
 roll me up and 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.590
 until next time
