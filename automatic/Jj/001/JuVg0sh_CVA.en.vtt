change in the body and a lot of training
or<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.450> training<00:01:09.930> will<00:01:10.470> improve<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.010> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
or more training will improve you that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.980 
or more training will improve you that
much<00:01:11.369> more<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.090> necessarily<00:01:12.689> so

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
much more and that's not necessarily so

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
contest the training would become

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.420 
contest the training would become
actually<00:01:45.329> briefer<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.810> more<00:01:46.079> intense<00:01:46.470> and
