00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.330
 I have prepared a special pizza today. 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.000
 Didn't we use pizza when we were doing Catallena? 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.730
 Yes 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.660
 I thought about the 5 kinds of pizzas that I had set at that time. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000
 Super multi 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.530
 The first is the Chicago pizza that everyone wants to eat!

 <c.yellow><i>Um~</i> 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.200
 - Is it delicious? - How? 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.830
 First, the cake is a bit thick but the cheese also has a very thick layer. 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.400
 Really like a strong aroma of the United States 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.330
 - Just like I came to the US - so we also taste 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.400
 Still thinking about Chicago, what is not pizza? 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.360
 Can't just give it to you

 <c.yellow><i>Mental arithmetic showdown, Nana victory</i> 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.930
 Ah, yes, it’s 74. 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.160
 Ah, I actually lost to Lin Nana. 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.130
 This is the shame of the house. 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.300
 injured 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.200
 Did you actually lose to Lin Nana? 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.760
 <c.yellow><i>What is the taste of Chicago pizza that Nana tasted?</i>

 <c.yellow><i>It’s a pity to give it to others.</i> 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.330
 - It's the taste I imagined - is it? 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.900
 The taste of the cheese is really strong. 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.400
 Next one 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.500

 <c.yellow><i>Sure enough, the taste of the Flora flower pizza is?</i> 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.460
 There is a smell of grass in the mouth 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.530
 Not the taste that people want to eat especially 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.860
 But it’s good to eat it simply. 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.900
 <c.yellow><i>Alternate 3. The cakes on the rolls are full of all kinds of ingredients: the pizza</i>

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.160
 Can we taste it too? Lizzy? 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.430
 Didn't you have that recently? 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.100
 I am dreaming, I dreamt of ghosts. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.660

 Do you think that dark circles have disappeared at the moment of eating? 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
 - Ah, because of salmon? - Salmon has a good effect on dark circles.

 The 5th place is? 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.760
 Because I personally like ketchup, put salmon in the 5th 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.600
 Try to separate the salmon and the pizza.
