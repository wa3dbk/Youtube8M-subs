00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.870
 i 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.540
 hello everyone how are welcome once 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:14.120
 once more to my channel today 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.430
 I want to answer a question that is very 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.000
 frequent both my YouTube channel and 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.590
 in instagram and what is the difference 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.240
 between what is the green juice and the 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.490
 green smoothie 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.829
 really the only difference is the 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.050
 amount of fiber practically the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.460
 The function of the extractor is to extract all 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.260
 the nutrients all the vitamins 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.930
 minerals here is this little jug 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.090
 leaving behind everything that is fiber 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.160
 then this is this green juice 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.710
 It is practically with many nutrients 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.570
 it does not give you fiber so it does not give you 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.019
 satiety but I found your body to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.649
 difference of what is the green smoothie 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:57.260
 practically what is done is to throw 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:59.480
 a lot of vegetables and only a portion 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.300
 of fruit sometimes if they do not want to put 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 strong is excellent 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.030
 practically what you do is that you 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.370
 grind all the ingredients then 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.950
 all the properties of all 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.960
 the fruit that you put this brings 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 a lot of fiber this 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.100
 helps what constipation is already 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.620
 you used part of the fiber that you have 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.030
 to build during the day if you're 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.370
 so it's a green juice then you 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 you have to make sure to consume fiber the 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.870
 fiber requirement during the day what 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.640
 which is very simple when it 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.650
 Take a balanced diet 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.660
 these benefits of this green smoothie 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 exquisite gives a lot more satiety for 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.580
 the amount of fiber and nutrients in 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.979
 this in the green smoothie title you get to 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.910
 complement perhaps with why this is 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:47.310
 moringa be spirulina with this super 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.410
 maybe bus with proteins of origin 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.259
 vegetable like the almonds then 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.800
 It could be a full breakfast if 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.500
 your 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.540
 they only put vegetables and a 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.640
 fruit portion is not a breakfast 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.160
 complete is simply a green smoothie 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.810
 which is that they help to have the body 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.570
 with more fiber 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.429
 the key to any of these juices 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 or green smoothies is that you only 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.230
 you add a piece of fruit or nothing 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.330
 cut so that it is not so much sugar in 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.310
 this type of juices the goal really 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.709
 of these two types of juices is to nourish the 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 body is to people who do not like 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.190
 eating vegetables makes green smoothie 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.050
 elections that is an excellent option 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.430
 just the green juice is just like the 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.590
 adults the videos can also 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.480
 build what are green juices or 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.730
 green smoothies including a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.940
 better leave aside the juices 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.519
 packaged orange juices and opt for 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.769
 do not move from then on practically the 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.080
 only difference is the amount of fiber 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:46.380
 the green smoothie is going to provide fiber 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.420
 this one was not contributing fiber and that's the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.790
 difference of purpose is the same 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.799
 which is to nourish the body and well 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
 let's make two recipes one for the 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.150
 green tube and another for the blender 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.880
 but that's how our green smoothie looks 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.850
 Take a cup of spinach half a cup 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.970
 Pineapple 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.410
 half a cup of water parsley a little 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.060
 parsley and two stalks of celery 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.220
 practically this is the one that contains 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.290
 all the pounds 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.650
 can you put the fruit that you 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.650
 want 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.720
 well this green juice that as you can see 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.209
 is not green has carrot affects the 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.069
 broad cucumber and this I put fruit 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.470
 because he 's fine with the carrot and 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.310
 they contain a lot of sugar and you do not need 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.140
 have experts no bad fruit there is no 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.610
 need to put fruit but as 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.670
 you want 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.170
 they are great not everything to be of 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.810
 green color because that's another question 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.410
 that they do me a lot then this is the 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.780
 juice this is the one that has no fiber and 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.870
 this is the green smoothie that does have 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.180
 fiber and beige I do not know if they can see that 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.000
 there you see fiber more or less and it's 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.380
 say with more 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.470
 let's see with your press more 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.080
 transparent how often they can 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.360
 consume the Berber juices practically 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.670
 is made of nutrients you can 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.580
 take every day of preference 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.890
 after your glass of water fasting 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.140
 u212 of water can opt for a smoothie 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.020
 green or a green juice which is better 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:25.210
 now yes that can vary previous of the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.950
 fresh green liquified week a week 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.080
 or green juice nothing happens the tooth 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.460
 reds more juices while wearing a

 good nutrition during the day 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.950
