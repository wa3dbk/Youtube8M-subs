00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
 finish 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.830
 and I want 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.100
 today 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.860
 a sweet potato sauce there are people who do not 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:17.009
 he knows very well what it is about but 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.509
 is a tuber called sweet potato 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.160
 sometimes it kills me but the question is 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.369
 this is something like a potato 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.760
 orange color especially sweet and very 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.390
 meloso and I will do this ingredient 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:36.720
 many chocolates recipes 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:40.110
 croquettes either make a sauce the 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:43.949
 I have baked potatoes that can be 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:48.379
 steaming or baking we go that like 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.379
 and ye with the peel skin 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:56.250
 this in itself is already going 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.070
 a delight in my case ate 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.080
 especially as much of the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.410
 chestnut is seen that in Spain in some 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.950
 areas that are consumed enough and shapes 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.180
 that are practically unknown 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.740
 but yes they are radiant easy 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.110
 to find in our go this are 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.479
 ecological that the sweet potato will give us 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.479
 you will see as a texture 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.070
 and the wonderful texture that we are going to 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.229
 add things to take the 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.670
 flavor of the sauce 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:35.399
 here we have great almond cream 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.229
 but that we can actually use 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.229
 we can also crush white almond 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.790
 and because I already have it and use it a lot 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.790
 same kitchen 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.840
 scolding 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.820
 then we will put a few hazelnuts 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.790
 this all at ease and you will see that it is 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.710
 try it and say come a little bit more than 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.390
 here a little bit over there 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.390
 this is a law in toast 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.480
 a little oil 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.060
 those who want olive or who 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.830
 sesame 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.830
 a little bit of rice vinegar 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.900
 this is yellow that is like the sauce 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.599
 soy to give a good touch saladito 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.670
 of contrast then we will try it and in 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.709
 every case we have a little bit more there are two 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.019
 ingredients that we can choose or 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.950
 even put a little bit of each this is 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:42.040
 garlic powder and this is ginger powder 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.489
 we could also grate the root and make 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:48.239
 the juice come I'm going to choose a 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.239
 little bit of science 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.970
 this is salvia 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.770
 to give a touch of forest touch 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.550
 aromatic herbs and now 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.580
 to crush with the water you need to 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.780
 the texture that we like the first year 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.780
 add a little water 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.640
 and title 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 now more or less we already have it 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.819
 crushed and we tested it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.909
 a tad higher 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.909
 well 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.510
 this sauce we can 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.700
 use in the salad to accompany 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.190
 cereals any any dish or 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.960
 for a toast 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.960
 for example I have here 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.280
 and lightly toasted a little bread 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:09.740
 integral awakens ecological and I'm going to 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:16.580
 serve I'm going to eat it like that with the 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:19.370
 salsita is a few shoots of alfalfa that 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.940
 I've done it and I will show to 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.940
 prepare at home 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.700
 and the black olives 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.569
 And here is my toast with sauce 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.510
 sweet potato 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:39.220
