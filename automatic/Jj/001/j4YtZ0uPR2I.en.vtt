know<00:01:54.020> when<00:01:54.619> you're<00:01:54.740> using<00:01:54.860> a<00:01:55.040> c-stand<00:01:55.810> this

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
know when you're using a c-stand this

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.780 
know when you're using a c-stand this
grip<00:01:57.170> head<00:01:57.320> right<00:01:57.740> here<00:01:58.009> some<00:01:58.520> people<00:01:58.729> um

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
grip head right here some people um

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.929 
grip head right here some people um
would<00:01:58.909> go<00:01:59.000> go<00:01:59.149> ahead<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:01.399> has<00:02:01.579> to<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.790> on<00:02:01.850> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
would go go ahead it has to be on the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.240 
would go go ahead it has to be on the
right<00:02:02.060> hand<00:02:02.090> side<00:02:02.560> and<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.860> reason<00:02:04.070> for<00:02:04.159> that

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
right hand side and the reason for that

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.670 
right hand side and the reason for that
is<00:02:04.520> basically<00:02:04.880> physics<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.350> I'll<00:02:06.439> show<00:02:06.590> you

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
is basically physics and I'll show you

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.560 
is basically physics and I'll show you
that<00:02:06.799> right<00:02:07.219> now

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
that right now

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.389 
that right now
so<00:02:08.570> let's<00:02:09.320> say<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:09.739> this<00:02:09.860> is<00:02:10.009> where<00:02:10.160> you<00:02:10.220> have

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
so let's say that this is where you have

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.020 
so let's say that this is where you have
your<00:02:10.610> light<00:02:11.480> or<00:02:11.750> your<00:02:12.290> scrim<00:02:12.829> or<00:02:13.340> you<00:02:13.940> know

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
your light or your scrim or you know

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.910 
your light or your scrim or you know
anything<00:02:14.780> else<00:02:14.930> that<00:02:15.110> has<00:02:15.379> any<00:02:15.410> kind<00:02:15.830> of

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
anything else that has any kind of

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.350 
anything else that has any kind of
weight<00:02:16.129> to<00:02:16.340> it<00:02:16.550> what<00:02:17.000> you're<00:02:17.090> going<00:02:17.209> to<00:02:17.239> want

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
weight to it what you're going to want

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.780 
weight to it what you're going to want
to<00:02:17.420> do

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
to do

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
to do
extend<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.629> okay<00:02:19.049> let's<00:02:19.290> say<00:02:19.409> that<00:02:19.590> you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
extend it out okay let's say that you

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.709 
extend it out okay let's say that you
want<00:02:19.829> it<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.069> right<00:02:20.459> about<00:02:20.670> there<00:02:20.879> and<00:02:21.090> you

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
want it right right about there and you

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.619 
want it right right about there and you
want<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:21.959> tighten<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.290> down<00:02:22.349> now<00:02:23.159> if<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.120> were

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
want to tighten it down now if this were

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.300 
want to tighten it down now if this were
on<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.900> other<00:02:24.989> side<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:26.040> could<00:02:26.159> have<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
on the other side you could have a

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.039 
on the other side you could have a
problem<00:02:26.579> but<00:02:27.209> the<00:02:27.329> reason<00:02:27.599> why<00:02:27.689> you<00:02:27.750> wanted<00:02:27.959> on

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
problem but the reason why you wanted on

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.289 
problem but the reason why you wanted on
the<00:02:28.140> right<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.500> basically<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.159> if<00:02:29.879> you<00:02:30.150> go

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
the right is basically because if you go

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.410 
the right is basically because if you go
and<00:02:30.450> pull<00:02:30.689> on<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.079> it's<00:02:31.650> gonna<00:02:31.799> stay<00:02:32.239> where<00:02:33.239> it

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
and pull on it it's gonna stay where it

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.869 
and pull on it it's gonna stay where it
is<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.930> that's<00:02:34.290> because<00:02:34.829> you'll<00:02:35.400> only<00:02:35.609> be

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
is and that's because you'll only be

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.520 
is and that's because you'll only be
tightening<00:02:36.329> it<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.140> way<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.290> check

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
tightening it and the way you check

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.289 
tightening it and the way you check
yourself<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.609> make<00:02:38.730> sure<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.030> you<00:02:39.180> are

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
yourself is to make sure that you are

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.910 
yourself is to make sure that you are
tightening<00:02:39.659> in<00:02:40.109> the<00:02:40.290> direction<00:02:40.560> that<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
tightening in the direction that the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.130 
tightening in the direction that the
weight<00:02:41.129> is<00:02:41.159> this<00:02:42.090> was<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> mistake<00:02:42.689> that<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.900> had

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
weight is this was a mistake that I had

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.449 
weight is this was a mistake that I had
the<00:02:43.260> pleasure<00:02:43.409> of<00:02:43.590> making<00:02:43.920> him<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.069> company<00:02:44.370> of

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
the pleasure of making him a company of

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.750 
the pleasure of making him a company of
friends<00:02:44.870> people<00:02:45.870> who<00:02:46.109> were<00:02:46.430> nice<00:02:47.430> enough<00:02:47.609> to

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
friends people who were nice enough to

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.869 
friends people who were nice enough to
point<00:02:48.060> out<00:02:48.269> my<00:02:48.450> mistakes<00:02:48.480> and<00:02:49.109> tell<00:02:49.439> me<00:02:49.590> why

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:49.879 
point out my mistakes and tell me why

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.149 
point out my mistakes and tell me why
this<00:02:50.879> was<00:02:51.060> a<00:02:51.090> problem<00:02:51.540> because<00:02:52.470> if<00:02:52.799> you<00:02:52.889> put<00:02:53.129> it

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
this was a problem because if you put it

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.099 
this was a problem because if you put it
on<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.430> other<00:02:53.519> side<00:02:53.780> now<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.959> on<00:02:55.049> the

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
on the other side now it's on the

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:59.569 
on the other side now it's on the
left-hand<00:02:55.409> side<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:58.010> don't<00:02:59.010> tighten<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.370> that

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
left-hand side and don't tighten it that

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.849 
left-hand side and don't tighten it that
way<00:02:59.700> let's<00:02:59.909> say<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.090> put<00:03:00.299> your<00:03:00.419> load<00:03:00.859> over

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
way let's say you put your load over

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.819 
way let's say you put your load over
here<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.810> it's<00:03:03.810> heavy<00:03:04.109> it's<00:03:04.349> heavy<00:03:04.439> it's

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
here and it's heavy it's heavy it's

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.379 
here and it's heavy it's heavy it's
heavy<00:03:04.919> it's<00:03:05.250> heavy<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.760> all<00:03:05.879> of<00:03:06.000> a<00:03:06.060> sudden<00:03:06.329> it

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
heavy it's heavy and all of a sudden it

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.629 
heavy it's heavy and all of a sudden it
breaks<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.799> come<00:03:07.980> crashing<00:03:08.519> to<00:03:08.549> the

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
breaks and it can come crashing to the

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.390 
breaks and it can come crashing to the
floor<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.180> whoever<00:03:09.930> or<00:03:10.139> whatever<00:03:10.319> who<00:03:11.250> is

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
floor and whoever or whatever who is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.550 
floor and whoever or whatever who is
underneath<00:03:11.760> you<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.510> gonna<00:03:12.689> have<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:12.989> very<00:03:13.349> bad

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
underneath you is gonna have a very bad

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.080 
underneath you is gonna have a very bad
day<00:03:13.799> it's<00:03:14.220> gonna<00:03:14.310> be<00:03:14.430> your<00:03:14.579> fault

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
day it's gonna be your fault

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.970 
day it's gonna be your fault
and<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.959> don't<00:03:16.109> want<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.409> you<00:03:16.470> want<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:16.889> get

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and you don't want that you want to get

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.720 
and you don't want that you want to get
invited<00:03:17.310> back<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:19.049> there's<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.040> keep<00:03:20.549> it<00:03:20.669> on

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
invited back so there's that keep it on

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:21.890 
invited back so there's that keep it on
the<00:03:20.790> right-hand<00:03:20.939> side

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
the right-hand side

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.259 
the right-hand side
think<00:03:22.199> of<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.349> as<00:03:22.409> rot<00:03:22.799> our<00:03:23.069> ott<00:03:23.669> right<00:03:23.970> over

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
think of it as rot our ott right over

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.089 
think of it as rot our ott right over
the<00:03:24.359> top<00:03:24.540> you<00:03:25.319> don't<00:03:25.409> want<00:03:25.620> this<00:03:25.799> arm

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
the top you don't want this arm

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.449 
the top you don't want this arm
underneath<00:03:27.199> it's<00:03:28.199> stronger<00:03:28.709> on<00:03:28.859> the<00:03:28.979> top<00:03:29.159> and

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
underneath it's stronger on the top and

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.949 
underneath it's stronger on the top and
you<00:03:29.669> want<00:03:29.849> it<00:03:29.909> on<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.030> right<00:03:30.209> hand<00:03:30.389> side<00:03:30.629> and

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
you want it on the right hand side and

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.140 
you want it on the right hand side and
that<00:03:31.199> also<00:03:31.470> holds<00:03:31.919> true<00:03:32.099> for<00:03:32.129> this<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:32.729> you

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
that also holds true for this if you

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.330

the top and raise this part first and
then<00:06:48.190> once<00:06:48.340> you<00:06:48.430> get<00:06:48.550> that<00:06:48.610> all<00:06:49.210> the<00:06:49.270> way<00:06:49.450> this

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
then once you get that all the way this

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.879 
then once you get that all the way this
can<00:06:49.870> go<00:06:49.930> a<00:06:50.050> lot<00:06:50.169> further<00:06:50.410> that<00:06:50.560> this<00:06:50.680> probably

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
can go a lot further that this probably

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.200 
can go a lot further that this probably
goes<00:06:51.010> down<00:06:51.190> to<00:06:51.310> about<00:06:51.340> here<00:06:51.639> and<00:06:51.820> probably

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
goes down to about here and probably

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:53.580 
goes down to about here and probably

all<00:06:55.240> the<00:06:55.300> way<00:06:55.330> up<00:06:55.570> so<00:06:56.320> then<00:06:56.440> you<00:06:56.500> can<00:06:56.620> do<00:06:56.680> that

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
all the way up so then you can do that

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:00.000 
all the way up so then you can do that
and<00:06:57.100> then<00:06:57.250> you<00:06:57.310> have<00:06:57.460> two<00:06:57.760> separate<00:06:58.410> areas<00:06:59.410> -

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.010 
and then you have two separate areas -

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:03.300 
and then you have two separate areas -
or<00:07:00.210> sections<00:07:01.210> to<00:07:01.389> raise<00:07:01.540> up<00:07:01.750> so<00:07:02.470> like<00:07:03.130> I<00:07:03.190> said

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
or sections to raise up so like I said

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.950 
or sections to raise up so like I said
this<00:07:03.430> thing<00:07:03.610> can<00:07:03.760> get<00:07:03.880> to<00:07:04.030> about<00:07:04.120> ten<00:07:04.810> or

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
this thing can get to about ten or

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.560 
this thing can get to about ten or
twelve<00:07:04.990> feet<00:07:05.310> they<00:07:06.310> have<00:07:06.400> smaller<00:07:06.729> ones<00:07:07.060> that

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
twelve feet they have smaller ones that

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.240 
twelve feet they have smaller ones that
can<00:07:07.960> be<00:07:07.990> used<00:07:08.260> as<00:07:08.530> well<00:07:08.740> if<00:07:08.919> you<00:07:08.979> need<00:07:09.070> to<00:07:09.160> get

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.250 
can be used as well if you need to get

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:12.120 
can be used as well if you need to get
into<00:07:09.340> a<00:07:09.400> bit<00:07:09.580> of<00:07:09.639> a<00:07:09.700> tighter<00:07:09.880> spot<00:07:10.240> but<00:07:11.080> um<00:07:11.260> yes

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:12.130 
into a bit of a tighter spot but um yes

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.680 
into a bit of a tighter spot but um yes
so<00:07:12.160> this<00:07:12.880> is<00:07:12.940> a<00:07:13.120> c-stand

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
so this is a c-stand

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:16.590 
so this is a c-stand
it's<00:07:14.169> a<00:07:14.229> basic<00:07:14.560> overview<00:07:14.680> of<00:07:15.040> it<00:07:15.280> and<00:07:15.460> it<00:07:16.270> is

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:16.600 
it's a basic overview of it and it is

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.180 
it's a basic overview of it and it is
