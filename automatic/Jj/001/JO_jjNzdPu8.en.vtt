00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.370
 new episode of sharp of the week 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.170
 Most of the good things are three after all 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.179
 in this case today there are four 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 this box has the legendary cobbler 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.740
 reinvented since july 2014 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.330
 presented itself in the new gloss we 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.330
 look at the whole times more closely 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:43.770
 ripen comes color can eat 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.489
 you give a brief overview of that 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.559
 History of the box for today 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.030
 I had the great luck my 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.940
 passion to become a profession 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.670
 I already went to school 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 started to have special shoes too 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.719
 want and had sometime with so 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.730
 Side jobs and ice cream sell here 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.559
 market research because my hobby 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.510
 financed and eventually came the point 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.330
 where I said to myself how do I come 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.010
 cheaper to get these shoes and then 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.549
 There was the possibility a load 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.840
 undo 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.310
 I 'll do it and load the fourth 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.600
 by server ocs meanwhile something 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.640
 distinguishes the current load from 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 the store before I think that's it 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.770
 here quite expensive the near 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.720
 So we have a lot in principle 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.610
 actually creativity is always a game 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.680
 we have creativity with us this time 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.140
 money combined and hopefully have 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.329
 a result what the people like as 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 I think so these gimmicks like now 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.530
 a robot is a shoe store that is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.759
 already I think what special very 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.659
 so a bit flair of such a 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.520
 storage hall 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.680
 as you're there so you have yourself the 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 idea that it gave rise to his 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.770
 we have the principle in the team we have 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.320
 talked about what you do there 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.909
 can and then came the idea that camp 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.140
 the funny we were so from time to time 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.979
 a little kidding and have us 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.930
 himself then fooled 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.399
 our last country he was so small 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.899
 that we have in principle already the 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.460
 sale maybe as a storage area 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.110
 have used and why have told us 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.030
 Well most people now expect from 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.680
 for sure a big thing right now 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.989
 so sterile i mean that's me 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.129
 now also relatively sterile though 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.460
 maybe we satirize ourselves 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.590
 and 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.310
 Just stock as a theme and put 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 that then fancier 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.780
 the shoe 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.349
 In the end, it's about product 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.480
 Selling 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.030
 if we enter this box for something 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.060
 the customer may be pleased with the products 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.640
 no, so many think that should 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.560
 We are very special box 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.010
 Of course in a way special 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.790
 but quite close to the customer that is 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.959
 normalsterblicher comes in the 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.400
 I have no idea about sneakers 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.830
 with us are just as well the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.450
 nerd the day off from the computer 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.069
 Spends looking around at what online 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.110
 shop somehow which shoe anywhere in the world 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.090
 we can actually get that out 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.010
 entire population in principle with 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.080
 to serve our product assortment 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.030
 we only see to it also has other 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.739
 So would wait, of course, we have the 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.690
 then we have in our upper school 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.180
 floor gives that textiles we have t 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.340
 shirts sweaters that will keep on going 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.840
 expanded our assortment, so to speak 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.010
 because we have bigger loads again 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.120
 we still have the possibility of accessories 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.090
 to show again 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.349
 watches and his stories so 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.579
 that will give it all back to us 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.170
 So in principle is actually for everyone 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.950
 What we have wholly white 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.360
 black shoes 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.739
 that is in principle in everyone 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.019
 to wear a social layer that is 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.750
 from the hipster to the cool guy to the 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.950
 worker types there is everyone in it 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.269
 principle because this shoe is easy 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.250
 white and black school neutral 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.190
 that anybody can wear that we have 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.920
 of course also unusual things there 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.799
 but even basics a secret against 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.420
 stinky sneakers so of course you 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.370
 could she wash or a tea bag 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.930
 I think that would be that kind of thing 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.030
 house recipe does not cost much 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.920
 one of tea bags in the school pure 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.150
 Please check again or use 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.950
 Now I'm not using this 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.660
 certainly so our claim is it 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.030
 Always keep customers happy 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.739
 whether schools with shoes or without 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.660
 that is, if you come in today 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.130
 we will not find it 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.090
 that we forgive our face but 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.609
 tell us a person 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.920
 as long as we do not do anything that's for 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.810
 us always the main thing in the long term 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.880
 Tying a customer does not mean 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.950
 absolutely something to sell if I am 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.019
 you sold nothing in today's days and 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.090
 honest saying the school is not here 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.979
 then you know the next time the type 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.000
 is really alright because he turns me 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:26.000
 none of what I recover because sometimes 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.900
 that were impressions to the box i 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.090
 Anyone will find out if it is here 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.550
 The shoe lover is 100 in the can 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.780
 shelf or the berlin tourist many 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.290
 thanks for turning on until to 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.290
 next time
