00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 With the help of the host, the ryder goes 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.410
 beat'em ups in the already seventh round 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.360
 and can play a game modes as well as nine 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 character and new techniques 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.320
 but let's go through all the modes 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.570
 which a beat'em up partly but 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.830
 Most extreme standards are only extreme 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.600
 offer little new or varied 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.519
 starting with the story mode is this 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.130
 actually only understandable in the beach 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.029
 one has read or looked one begins 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.219
 The first campaign in combat tactics 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.649
 command from the end of this bankers of 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.530
 However, ideology not travel their 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.719
 with money to go lady gaga of his ones 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.300
 before and after character so 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.250
 Cinemas Hometown Oppressed in Principle 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.500
 So my story you really 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 if you understand the whole 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.059
 Since she knows only a part of the action 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.360
 Saga covers next to this story there is 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 also an extra stage with muramasa 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.609
 a finger character but this too short 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.050
 that she is barely worth mentioning and then 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.690
 there is still the first campaign 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.390
 but uli woestmann always plays the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.159
 antagonist fights the self is 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.740
 But do not tchibo in the case 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.570
 but iron 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.790
 All in all, that's just going to happen to you 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.549
 texts and no ingame scenes told 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.549
 So neither any cutscenes yet 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.500
 rpg moderate textboxes but is a 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.630
 beat'em up so I personally rather put 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 worth less on an exciting acs 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.710
 the one about an act you as a fan 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 yes already knows and unfortunately too much 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.280
 is short 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.979
 huth the story mode is not so now 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.750
 what the game is, but it is 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.600
 are still some more modes added 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.210
 So next we have the fashion 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.369
 he would be predicted to build 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.869
 once creative to me personally though 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.619
 also had the most fun 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.600
 the customer comes is like the fans below 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.319
 you know the spd has now 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.170
 disposed 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:11.910
 so should theoretically the weakest mazin 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.450
 and number one will be the strongest 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.269
 well in theory in heek mundo 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.410
 Congress is about the ispa of 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.209
 to kick her way 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.489
 but sometimes it just fights 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.959
 Characters is good because you have to first 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.799
 others defeat to them 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.560
 get through 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.150
 including four of her fighters 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.880
 which here in seven brand new 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.069
 I have added this offer 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.560
 the most varied variety when you are 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.769
 not just child one has g1 or two against 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.980
 two 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:43.049
 because everything was mixed until you 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.860
 finally then also espada 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.680
 breaks through and an exciting and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.000
 not exactly light has come before 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.650
 then of course there is the kate 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.390
 fashion to the man probably nothing more 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.579
 must say and the player against 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.000
 computer mode also explains itself 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.340
 even 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.019
 Although you can of course against 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 other players via the playstation 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.579
 network and climb in rankings 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.310
 I was however not granted to 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.910
 test because my psp unfortunately not in 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.910
 the situation is 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.040
 even if the character selection of 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.109
 game is varied and just fans 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.239
 with known techniques and the like 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:23.909
 will have lots of fun is pretty 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.129
 balanced and with character like 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.780
 josef penninger hollow in the cinema or the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:30.090
 Giant characters like alone or yes 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.950
 you can do more innovations despite 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.470
 various handicaps difficult to exist 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.980
 The latter then play themselves 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.290
 so extremely bad so with these 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.420
 new elements of the game what we as a courtesy 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.500
 There is no real fun here 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.530
 wants to come up 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.349
 some characters got through me immediately 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:52.139
 banker or bridge we are others though 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.629
 just use this in special text or 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:56.310
 do not have 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.349
 it is clear that a beat'em ups that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.840
 always characters are easier 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.549
 use and master but are here 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.989
 The gap between extremely useful 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.459
 and extremely lane that big at it 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.620
 these characters through my music 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.919
 she does not enjoy at all 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.380
 to test out big character selection already 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:19.109
 good if in a game by doing so 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.750
 everything so anja lenz will renounce me 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.849
 personally love something 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.380
 In conclusion , that's really possible 

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.780
 only one game is really into the game 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.419
 quence and I can say that she herself 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.610
 beat times very much because too short 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.979
 story mode with a little creative 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.630
 reverse campaign and the typical 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.380
 It just can not recognize fashion 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.630
 to convince 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.550
 the eco mondo was complete as before 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.690
 said the only really interesting 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.030
 with a change 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.610
 But this alone is not a purchase 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:50.460
 value world gambling with other players 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.039
 But I would like to be warned already 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.570
 the game is in japanese and how like 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.270
 because you are missing with the German one 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:00.000
 account can do anything I can 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.280
 you say my psp of this faction 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.620
 light is one-sided, but I have 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.630
 guess it will come to that 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.000
 beaten up by little Japanese otake 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.770
 to be well for hardcore fans 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.750
 series I can because a recommendation 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.490
 due to the uncle care and the 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.009
 expressing diversity in the characters 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.000
 everyone else just wants to buy 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.000
 a good beat'em up
