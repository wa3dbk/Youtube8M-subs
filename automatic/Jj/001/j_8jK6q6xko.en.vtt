00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
bit not a lot like you do with your a

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.389 
bit not a lot like you do with your a
handsy<00:01:30.790> player<00:01:31.090> but<00:01:31.780> also<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:32.440> good<00:01:32.830> check<00:01:33.130> test

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
handsy player but also a good check test

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.669

here<00:01:36.429> as<00:01:36.580> opposed<00:01:37.360> to<00:01:37.479> here<00:01:37.600> that's<00:01:38.320> a<00:01:38.619> big<00:01:39.009> key

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
here as opposed to here that's a big key

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.609

to<00:01:39.940> many<00:01:40.179> of<00:01:40.300> you<00:01:40.420> think<00:01:40.660> too<00:01:41.259> many<00:01:41.380> of<00:01:41.500> you

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619
