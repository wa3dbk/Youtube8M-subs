probably all day for the next two days

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.700 
probably all day for the next two days
but<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:12.540> opening<00:00:13.170> cinematic

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
but we do have the opening cinematic

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.680 
but we do have the opening cinematic
which<00:00:13.889> is<00:00:14.309> somewhat<00:00:14.700> similar<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> what<00:00:15.330> we<00:00:15.450> saw

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
which is somewhat similar to what we saw

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.439 
which is somewhat similar to what we saw
on<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.379> trailer<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.310> other<00:00:17.460> day<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.150> think

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
on the trailer the other day but I think

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.269 
on the trailer the other day but I think
there<00:00:18.630> are<00:00:18.660> some<00:00:19.230> minor<00:00:19.500> differences<00:00:19.770> so

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
there are some minor differences so

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.650 
there are some minor differences so
let's<00:00:20.490> check<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> out<00:00:22.640> when<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.670> met<00:00:24.119> we<00:00:24.449> had
