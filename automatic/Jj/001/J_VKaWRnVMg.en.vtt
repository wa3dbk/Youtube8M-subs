00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
hello and welcome to the first in a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.670 
hello and welcome to the first in a
series<00:00:02.280> of<00:00:02.460> blender<00:00:03.000> tutorials<00:00:03.319> in<00:00:04.319> which

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
series of blender tutorials in which

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.920 
series of blender tutorials in which
we're<00:00:04.920> going<00:00:05.040> to<00:00:05.100> learn<00:00:05.279> how<00:00:05.609> to<00:00:05.870> work<00:00:06.870> with

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
we're going to learn how to work with

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.350 
we're going to learn how to work with
basic<00:00:07.560> modeling<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.250> animation<00:00:08.670> tools<00:00:09.090> in

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
basic modeling and animation tools in

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.620 
basic modeling and animation tools in
blender<00:00:10.110> so<00:00:10.920> blender<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.519> an<00:00:11.700> open<00:00:12.030> source<00:00:12.269> 3d

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
blender so blender is an open source 3d

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.709 
blender so blender is an open source 3d
modeling<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.440> animation<00:00:13.639> package<00:00:14.639> very<00:00:15.450> much

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
modeling and animation package very much

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.590 
modeling and animation package very much
like<00:00:15.990> Maya<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.800> 3ds<00:00:17.279> max<00:00:17.670> which<00:00:18.119> would<00:00:18.449> be

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
like Maya and 3ds max which would be

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.269 
like Maya and 3ds max which would be
industry<00:00:19.050> standard<00:00:19.439> treating<00:00:19.830> modeling<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
industry standard treating modeling and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.700 
industry standard treating modeling and
animation<00:00:20.580> tools<00:00:20.970> but<00:00:21.840> blender<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.350> open

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
animation tools but blender is open

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.880 
animation tools but blender is open
source<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.220> completely<00:00:23.880> free<00:00:24.470> as<00:00:25.470> well<00:00:25.740> as

by<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.859> blender<00:00:29.279> community<00:00:30.019> so<00:00:31.019> first<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.650> all

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
by the blender community so first of all

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.170 
by the blender community so first of all
we're<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> look<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.640> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
we're going to have a look at the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.299 
we're going to have a look at the
blender<00:00:34.170> interface<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:36.649> mmm<00:00:37.649> we<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.070> see

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
blender interface and mmm we can see

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
blender interface and mmm we can see
here<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.940> viewing<00:00:39.329> pane<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.440> moving

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
here that the viewing pane is for moving

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.990 
here that the viewing pane is for moving
objects<00:00:41.700> for<00:00:42.510> rotating<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.670> changing<00:00:44.670> views

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
objects for rotating and changing views

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.720 
objects for rotating and changing views
and<00:00:45.300> when<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.350> open<00:00:46.680> blender<00:00:46.860> first<00:00:47.280> you

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
and when you open blender first you

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.720 
and when you open blender first you
always<00:00:48.090> start<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.539> three<00:00:48.960> objects<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.770> cube<00:00:50.460> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
always start with three objects a cube a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.000 
always start with three objects a cube a
lamp<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.949> camera<00:00:53.809> so<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.870> select<00:00:55.440> objects

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
lamp and a camera so to select objects

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.260 
lamp and a camera so to select objects
in<00:00:56.100> blender<00:00:56.460> all<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> is

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
in blender all you have to do is

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.709 
in blender all you have to do is
right-click<00:00:57.570> on<00:00:58.109> them<00:00:58.260> with<00:00:58.440> your<00:00:58.590> mouse<00:00:58.739> and

00:00:59.709 --> 00:00:59.719 
right-click on them with your mouse and

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:02.959 
right-click on them with your mouse and
with<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.840> right<00:01:01.020> mouse<00:01:01.230> button<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.969> then

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
with the right mouse button and then

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.090 
with the right mouse button and then
that<00:01:03.030> selects<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> puts<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:04.710> yellow

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
that selects them and puts this yellow

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210 
that selects them and puts this yellow
outline<00:01:06.060> around<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.530> can<00:01:07.740> change<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
outline around them you can change the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.020 
outline around them you can change the
view<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.790> three<00:01:09.570> different<00:01:09.840> ways<00:01:11.030> it's

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
view in three different ways it's

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.510 
view in three different ways it's
essential<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.530> mouse<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.310> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
essential that you have a mouse with a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820 
essential that you have a mouse with a
roller<00:01:14.790> wheel<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.390> order<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.869> use<00:01:16.049> blender

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
roller wheel in order to use blender

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.609 
roller wheel in order to use blender
properly<00:01:17.570> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.720> don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.439> those

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
properly if you don't have one of those

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.740 
properly if you don't have one of those
it<00:01:19.920> makes<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> extremely<00:01:20.759> difficult<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.540> use

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it makes it extremely difficult to use

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.530 
it makes it extremely difficult to use
the<00:01:21.990> software<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:23.520> go<00:01:23.939> ahead<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.210> invest

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
the software so just go ahead and invest

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.429 
the software so just go ahead and invest
in<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:26.119> mouse<00:01:27.119> with<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.450> roller<00:01:27.659> wheel<00:01:27.900> they're

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
in a mouse with a roller wheel they're

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.249 
in a mouse with a roller wheel they're
fairly<00:01:29.009> inexpensive<00:01:29.689> so<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.840> first<00:01:31.079> way<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
fairly inexpensive so the first way that

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
fairly inexpensive so the first way that
you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.710> change<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.189> view<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.729> by<00:01:32.970> zooming<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
you can change the view is by zooming in

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.690 
you can change the view is by zooming in
and<00:01:33.869> out<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.520> mouse

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and out and to do that with the mouse

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.410 
and out and to do that with the mouse
you<00:01:35.729> can<00:01:36.290> ho-ho<00:01:37.290> roll<00:01:38.210> scroll<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.390> mouse

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
you can ho-ho roll scroll the mouse

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.929 
you can ho-ho roll scroll the mouse
wheel<00:01:39.600> up<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.259> down<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
wheel up and down and that's going to

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.510 
wheel up and down and that's going to
zoom<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.409> object<00:01:43.560> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
zoom in and out on your object the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.580 
zoom in and out on your object the
second<00:01:44.909> way<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> rotate<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> perspective

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
second way is to rotate the perspective

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
second way is to rotate the perspective
by<00:01:46.890> pressing<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.640> holding<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.270> mouse<00:01:48.360> wheel

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
by pressing and holding the mouse wheel

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.920 
by pressing and holding the mouse wheel
and<00:01:49.110> moving<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.220> mouse<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.600> will

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
and moving the mouse and this will

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.880 
and moving the mouse and this will
rotate<00:01:52.170> your<00:01:52.590> object<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.189> 3d<00:01:53.640> space<00:01:53.909> and<00:01:54.890> the

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
rotate your object in 3d space and the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.760 
rotate your object in 3d space and the
third<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.340> final<00:01:56.700> way<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.180> pan<00:01:57.540> by<00:01:58.380> holding

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
third and final way is to pan by holding

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.980 
third and final way is to pan by holding
the<00:01:58.890> shift<00:01:59.159> key<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.700> then<00:02:00.240> pressing<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
the shift key and then pressing and

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
the shift key and then pressing and
holding<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.290> mouse<00:02:01.530> wheel<00:02:01.829> button<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
holding the mouse wheel button and

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
holding the mouse wheel button and
moving<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> mouse<00:02:03.210> around<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:04.350> the<00:02:04.500> three

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
moving the mouse around so the three

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.819 
moving the mouse around so the three
ways<00:02:04.890> again<00:02:05.250> are<00:02:05.490> zoom<00:02:06.000> by<00:02:06.780> scrolling<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.619> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
between perspective and orthogonal view

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.810 
between perspective and orthogonal view
so<00:03:28.960> orthogonal<00:03:29.680> is<00:03:29.860> usually<00:03:30.520> better<00:03:30.700> for

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
so orthogonal is usually better for

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.360 
so orthogonal is usually better for
modeling<00:03:31.420> objects<00:03:32.020> as<00:03:32.170> it<00:03:32.440> does<00:03:32.860> not<00:03:33.040> appear

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
modeling objects as it does not appear

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.190 
modeling objects as it does not appear
to<00:03:33.610> distort<00:03:34.180> shapes<00:03:34.570> when<00:03:34.870> you're<00:03:35.020> moving

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
to distort shapes when you're moving

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.140 
to distort shapes when you're moving
whereas<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.310> you're<00:03:36.430> in<00:03:36.490> perspective<00:03:37.120> mode

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
whereas if you're in perspective mode

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.920 
whereas if you're in perspective mode
and<00:03:37.650> you're<00:03:38.650> moving<00:03:39.100> or<00:03:39.250> panning<00:03:40.120> or<00:03:40.330> zooming

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
and you're moving or panning or zooming

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.050 
and you're moving or panning or zooming
in<00:03:41.440> you're<00:03:41.650> going<00:03:41.800> to<00:03:41.890> get<00:03:42.220> a<00:03:42.460> distorted

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060

perspective<00:03:43.840> on<00:03:43.990> your<00:03:44.320> object<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:46.570> it's

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
perspective on your object so it's

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.800 
perspective on your object so it's
generally<00:03:47.560> better<00:03:48.010> to<00:03:48.340> work<00:03:48.850> in<00:03:49.060> orthogonal

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810
