 Internet resource mega review dot com 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.460
 Today we have a review 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:17.690

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.920
 series from the company jenius is headphones and 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 chase and g600 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.300
 they came out and were presented at the end 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.340
 February of the current year 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.449
 and today we have them in the laboratory 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.690
 if you remember we had a mouse test 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.790
 James case dzhenius kir children and married 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.700
 emperor pro they are also representative 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.860
 This particular series can be viewed to these 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.730
 video we have on the channel today we 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.039
 consider gaming headphones these headphones 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 can be connected to a computer and 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.149
 consoles including mac computers worth 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.649
 this model is now 2100 rubles 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.390
 cost is not the most democratic 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.230
 especially for jane flowers products they 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.489
 always famous 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.350
 more affordable price tag and profitable 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.450
 different from the competitor now they are all 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 closer closer 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.159
 competitive model we are compared 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.500
 more expensive segment but let's 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.119
 specifically on the ears and only about solyak in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.080
 spectacular packaging here is transparent 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.549
 window you can evaluate the headphones themselves here 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.200
 same scorpion can be seen that on 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.060
 ears of the remote here 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.680
 general compatibility information 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.130
 there is a tapir written on the x-box 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.990
 playstation 3 and the magician until the end of the regular 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.939
 until you can install it here 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.890
 behind instructions on how you can 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.180
 install these headphones how to use 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.090
 and let's see 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:43.950
 it's here inside that we have them well 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 so tightly packed in packing all the strength 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:55.460
 approximately the same stylization under 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.810
 metal is very much here with us 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.270
 accessories despite the fact that these are headphones 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.610
 if such a cable is an adapter here we are 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 connect the audio jack and it's already 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.630
 specifically in the console and conveniently that these 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.070
 cables there is a way out here 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.000
 watch already specifically your let 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.910
 which at home and use also and 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.900
 very comfortable good approach there is a removable 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:24.209
 mikrofonchik here unfortunately there is no noise 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.340
 crush or out of the sponge but so open 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:32.760
 not quite that is, it looks a little 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:35.070
 cheap where all the legs by the way we still have 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.980
 here is an instruction for connecting the house 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.420
 hardly needed here especially 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.380
 set up a few must try everything 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:48.000
 make and customize without problems aksa 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.190
 legs remove all unnecessary portal to watch 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.280
 specifically 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:58.640
 headphones and so here we have a frequency in 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.400
 salvation from 20 to 20,000 hertz in these ears 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.350
 impedance 32 ohm 417 overeat instead 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.110
 Headphones 30 kilograms and they do not put pressure on 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.280
 head warm on head sit 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:13.830
 to the fixation of the mitrophone 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.709
 just take it and connect everything here 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:20.040
 Microphone get ready you can use 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.680
 exactly with the microphone further 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.030
 cruel I let the microphone from 100 to 10 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.070
 thousand hertz just out of us 5420 white 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.360
 the microphone can be turned off and now by 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.200
 the design itself can be changed here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.600
 holography for big for little ones 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.660
 heads all this is possible 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.800
 nine the only thing that depresses it 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.520
 glossy plastic need as much as possible 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.840
 notice cursing shines and very quickly 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.020
 For lyapko with that is, you will touch 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.490
 shoot your ears and color sleep rub that 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.040
 you can easily wipe cloth rag 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.630
 can here not keep close here 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.240
 also image on scorpion 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.730
 series name dx game and green 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.530
 inserts a dog under the backlight is not 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.670
 backlight 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.350
 another negative point is 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.570
 used dermantin used it 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.850
 head nonsense rustle plus when we 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.550
 Wear headphones on your head or about 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.440
 within an hour already in this part is very 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.740
 sweat a lot i mean we are recruited 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.930
 moisture droplets not so much solution 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.180
 use of openwork gaming headphones 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.870
 dermantina once assume that usually 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:26.630
 players do not sit for 10 to 20 minutes 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.820
 We played for hours and it will come down to comfortable 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.130
 top level can certainly be justified 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.930
 it is not worth standing with a price tag that is 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.120
 two thousand one hundred rubles and people who 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.600
 want to save maybe it will 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.430
 compromise and so here we have the diameter 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.010
 membranes 40 millimeters and we have 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:48.710
 non-single magnet and there is a mini connector 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:52.540
 jack two we have with the wire and very 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.490
 by the millions of third-party everything is actually everything 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.290
 so the headphones also have a remote 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.020
 here you can configure 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.250
 from this side we are setting off 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.740
 the case of the microphone here is lit LED 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.080
 bright red and green here 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.970
 switch between dog gaming modes 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.370
 that is, we now press one console 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.030
 mode and on the back of the cable we 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.790
 there are two eat two tiger scouts 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.260
 one audigy standard another yusb something 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.600
 there is everywhere use for computer 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.160
 this use for consoles or for 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.390
 phone, that is, you need to connect 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.890
 adapter and the whole thing works for us 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:30.890
 what else about headphones 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.750
 that's all unfortunately here 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.030
 There is no software specifically to manage something 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.850
 there is a change voice we tune the sound 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.800
 it does n't sound high and 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.540
 mids represented less 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.880
 good myself 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:45.940
 for a budget it's worse a few hours here 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.490
 virtually no ie explosions breaks 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.680
 shells there so such effects effects in 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:56.020
 fully able to hear not here 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:58.060
 there is simply no such capacious bass 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.920
 medium represented normal sound 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:04.420
 also recorded well 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.040
 sorry creak and noise and cod no everything in 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:09.060
 this plan is normal so budget 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.990
 Headphones can completely consider them 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.940
 once again not a poet 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:15.610
 I note I did not like that forest favor 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:19.450
 gloss and dermantin if look more like 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.270
 then you can not notice it until your ears 

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.640
 headphones my ears here at the head like 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.980
 dermantin very strongly felt personally 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.830
 I have more than an hour 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.930
 the use of patience is not enough then 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.090
 there is very very uncomfortable and I want 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.100
 simply remove the headset is probably someone so 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.360
 will like to answer with pleasure 

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.160
 your questions in the comments 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.350
 our channel is signed there are still many ahead 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:45.300
 many interesting remind it were 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:48.900
 genius and chase g600 headphones 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:54.600
 dx series representative gaming model 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.600
