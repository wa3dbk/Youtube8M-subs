and after I've scan them go round them
if<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.190> are<00:02:50.310> designing<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:51.000> should<00:02:51.240> know<00:02:51.390> how

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
if you are designing you should know how

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.750 
if you are designing you should know how
it<00:02:51.720> works<00:02:51.930> what<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:52.350> gotta<00:02:52.500> do<00:02:52.710> is<00:02:52.890> you've<00:02:53.610> got

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
it works what you gotta do is you've got

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
it works what you gotta do is you've got
to<00:02:53.790> draw<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> out<00:02:54.330> then<00:02:55.080> you've<00:02:55.260> got<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> scan

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
to draw it out then you've got to scan

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.440 
to draw it out then you've got to scan
them<00:02:56.220> than<00:02:56.370> off<00:02:56.490> your<00:02:56.730> scan<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.210> put<00:02:57.330> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
them than off your scan and put the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.290 
them than off your scan and put the
image<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.750> photoshop<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:58.710> export<00:02:59.370> all<00:02:59.970> their

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
image in photoshop then export all their

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.030 
image in photoshop then export all their
mainland<00:03:00.660> years<00:03:00.900> over<00:03:01.080> to<00:03:01.230> illustrate<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:01.920> go

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
mainland years over to illustrate it go

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.390 
mainland years over to illustrate it go
around<00:03:02.370> them<00:03:02.550> export<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.120> paths<00:03:03.390> put<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.930> in

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
around them export the paths put it in

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.670 
around them export the paths put it in
for<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.520> s-max<00:03:05.910> for<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.390> s-max<00:03:06.690> cinema<00:03:07.170> 4d<00:03:07.440> or

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
would then extrude them and make exactly
