another<00:00:52.159> level<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.970> focus<00:00:53.769> of<00:00:54.769> energy<00:00:55.479> that<00:00:56.479> I

00:00:56.499 --> 00:00:56.509 
another level of focus of energy that I

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:58.509 
another level of focus of energy that I
don't<00:00:56.720> even<00:00:56.839> know<00:00:56.960> if<00:00:57.350> he<00:00:57.949> knew<00:00:58.189> that<00:00:58.220> he

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
don't even know if he knew that he

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.969 
don't even know if he knew that he
possessed<00:00:58.909> it<00:00:59.089> I<00:00:59.350> could<00:01:00.350> say<00:01:00.470> I<00:01:00.500> agree<00:01:00.830> with

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
focus and duel of energy I think goes

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.640 
focus and duel of energy I think goes
out<00:01:07.040> with<00:01:07.159> an<00:01:07.250> injury<00:01:07.610> of<00:01:08.540> any<00:01:08.689> kind<00:01:09.079> that<00:01:09.409> puts
