 hello everyone we are the play 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.690
 nintendo life and this day we are like 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.520
 always my partner because we have 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.259
 also missed the third bayern and then there is 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.519
 another friend of mine if he wants to say goodbye 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:15.589
 say hello, you do not belong 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.309
 meanwhile there are games that 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.000
 He was doing 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.670
 I don't know he is sick so he closed well and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.679
 today we should see how to find the 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.320
 wigan 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:29.269
 the power map of the GTs then has in 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.390
 future I will show even the most powerful 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.370
 ie the right gta machine then 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.330
 follow all these steps, that is, do 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:42.050
 see the map to see where that is 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:44.480
 nice her ass daddy you then have to 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.680
 practically going to the map is seeing 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 children and friends how many I owe 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.530
 to go 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 you have to put the makeup of never before 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:01:05.150
 wanted that found of all on 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:07.190
 internet and you have to go to frame 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.520
 this area photographed write 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.620
 update so we give 5 seconds to 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.430
 take a picture of it then put the make-up on 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.290
 of the cars colangelo council that then 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.909
 they had to go we will make you put it 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.200
 the link descriptions will not be all 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:30.050
 types of gta san andreas 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:32.000
 ok business paris hilton pink but you can 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 really, however, one can 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.350
 let's see our collaborator luca si 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.990
 call and fast but then it is true that you can 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.990
 make an earthquake appear seen 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:51.630
 disgusting turin that is unfair boy 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.510
 because to me trt al known I make-up 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.740
 wait for the kids we want with the 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:02.580
 car but no by the second time 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.619
 of this we will all do the second one 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.470
 part perhaps today true 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.110
 the council is notoriously remembered 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.619
 guys the rails that come from 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.619
 memories 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.190
 I advise you to put on makeup but 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.380
 researched rather essential because when 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.380
 finally came a while to go 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.950
 automatically it puts born police 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.630
 four were still boys games 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.430
 from the point where we started and where to 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.110
 guys that point would be the point 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.070
 initial from him sinti to gta episodes 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.519
 always understood hupac from the thrones and then the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.730
 next video we'll show how it was 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.750
 finished the maximum height e 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.840
 at the same time how to fly 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.239
 the only way to fly the number is 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.040
 plus a future we will also show how 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.470
 find the beautiful car more beautiful than 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.450
 city ​​is true that unfortunately later 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.450
 they had found it, but we think later 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:15.450
 I would have found more or less strong 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:17.960
 of course no guys had to be 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.280
 record ours to be a director 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:30.750
 then remove all of the car's steering wheels 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:36.270
 diversity 156 succumbed to escape 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:40.890
 here you will find what is happening to me 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.440
 excuse the fax machine for the duties 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 printed here are the screen case 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:53.510
 where many cars come and go 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:53.510
 follow this path I'm doing 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.270
 turn some maps is not even i 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.310
 polizziotti v here's the one found the weapon 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.150
 more powerful gta because we ca n't 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:12.900
 take it and now we'll see from here it will be 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:13.590
 so and now we will see what is fat 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.070
 we'll see 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.780
 look at the tracked weapon I would tell you 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.720
 that its power we make appear to 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.990
 a blade car to make them Egyptian 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.180
 this is a guys you see the trick of 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.980
 infinite weapons true yes because otherwise 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.080
 then this weapon ends then we do n't know 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:40.400
 the other find other parts you are san 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:43.780

 power stronger than del shoots rockets 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.080
 rocket launcher I meant 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.140
