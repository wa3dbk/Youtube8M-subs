00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.190
 change because without you I change you 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.840
 It's good for nothing, so I find super 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.050
 ugly that to change the gift that you 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.400
 meeting had not cf or 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.290
 that the other person is going to change it 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.000
 I chose what I do when I do not like a 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.829
 I keep the gift and then the gift of 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.289
 people 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.639
 and a woman is super easy to make 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:27.400
 I'm going to give you a gift 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.460
 bunch of silly necklaces 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.189
 Bracelets gives the same thing but a man is 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.139
 harder than cream and you do not know what 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:37.840
 give him then what we do all the 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.790
 we give away socks 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.710
 but now there is one thing that happens that is 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.330
 very strange because if everyone would 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.670
 gives men's socks 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.180
 good always have with potatoes 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.030
 they do not put it on what they do and the heaviest 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.100
 is when your grandma makes you a gift 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.750
 and pulls with an uncomfortable phrase I follow my 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.680
 hijita this gift for you to use it with 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.680
 his cock in bed 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.639
 do not say open it do not open it to all the 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.040
 family looking at it April you take it out a 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.650
 big guatero 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.300
 and when one is on a plane always 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:15.570
 have the same conversation on the phone 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:21.160
 they call you and listen and this to grace 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:24.280
 if you did not pass if I do not know no thanks 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.169
 thank you thank you for remembering but 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.969
 when one is 30 years old like me 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.900
 you can not hear that conversation anymore 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:35.610
 listen to this something thanks and thanks for 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.469
 I do not know what I did not marry 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.539
 yes yes I know I 'm old yes I know that I 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.099
 left my pololo if I know I have no children 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.249
 and I know my apartment is disgusting 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.499
 Thanks for remembering 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:48.929
 but the saddest part of a birthday is 

00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:50.489
 wait all day for a so-called cache of 

00:05:48.929 --> 00:05:51.629
 text the day with cell phone if it's going to 

00:05:50.489 --> 00:05:53.339
 agree this where they call was 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:54.959
 to remember to remember really calls you 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:56.990
 not for that better birthday voice and 

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.580
 coma 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.140
 or the lesson that called quickie 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.140
 you sent it the boss reports 

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:10.080
 and something else you want thank you very much good 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.080
 nights
