00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
line and every time it just gets harder

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.300 

there's<00:01:41.320> something<00:01:41.590> it's<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.950> child<00:01:42.159> in

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
there's something it's just a child in

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.830 
there's something it's just a child in
there<00:01:42.460> they<00:01:43.060> are<00:01:43.229> usually<00:01:44.580> successful<00:01:45.840> most

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
there they are usually successful most

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.609 
there they are usually successful most
of<00:01:47.080> them<00:01:47.229> cross<00:01:47.590> if<00:01:47.950> they<00:01:48.640> cross<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:50.229> first

of them cross if they cross in first
place<00:01:50.890> they<00:01:51.340> get<00:01:51.610> five<00:01:52.210> hundred<00:01:52.360> dollars<00:01:52.869> as

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
place they get five hundred dollars as

long as they cross they get an A if they

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:59.940 
long as they cross they get an A if they
don't<00:01:57.430> go<00:01:57.640> all<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:57.970> way<00:01:58.180> is<00:01:58.740> depending<00:01:59.740> where

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
don't go all the way is depending where

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:19.500 
don't go all the way is depending where
they<00:02:00.159> fall<00:02:00.520> that<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:18.489> that<00:02:18.700> it's<00:02:18.910> a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
they fall that the think that it's a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
they fall that the think that it's a
miracle<00:02:20.170> walking<00:02:21.040> on<00:02:21.160> water

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
miracle walking on water

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.520 
miracle walking on water
but<00:02:22.329> like<00:02:23.049> anything<00:02:23.350> else<00:02:23.640> if<00:02:24.930> you<00:02:25.930> research

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
but like anything else if you research

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.390 
but like anything else if you research
it<00:02:26.590> and<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:28.140> design<00:02:29.140> that<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.620> follow<00:02:29.890> a

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
it and you design that and follow a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.520 
it and you design that and follow a
proper<00:02:30.970> process<00:02:31.660> it's<00:02:32.520> achievable
