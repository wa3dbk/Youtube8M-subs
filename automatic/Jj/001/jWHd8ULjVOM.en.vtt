gonna show you what I think is the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.989 
gonna show you what I think is the

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:53.999 
easiest way to do that and you might

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.939 
easiest way to do that and you might
just<00:00:54.269> ask<00:00:54.420> yourself<00:00:54.780> well<00:00:55.019> why<00:00:55.379> not<00:00:55.410> just<00:00:55.769> move

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
just ask yourself well why not just move

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.160 
just ask yourself well why not just move
the<00:00:56.070> items<00:00:56.339> to<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.519> trash<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.749> do<00:00:57.960> that

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the items to the trash you can do that

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.459 
the items to the trash you can do that
but<00:00:58.949> I<00:00:59.129> found<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> sometimes<00:01:00.179> the<00:01:00.659> trash<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
but I found that sometimes the trash is

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
but I found that sometimes the trash is
not<00:01:01.499> the<00:01:01.800> best<00:01:02.010> way<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.339> do<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.359> you

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
not the best way to do it because you

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.149 
not the best way to do it because you
have<00:01:03.749> to<00:01:03.870> remember<00:01:04.050> to<00:01:04.260> empty<00:01:04.379> your<00:01:04.650> trash<00:01:04.680> or

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
have to remember to empty your trash or

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.010 
have to remember to empty your trash or
those<00:01:05.640> items<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.120> still<00:01:06.360> sitting<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.870> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
those items are still sitting there on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.820 
those items are still sitting there on
the<00:01:07.200> USB<00:01:07.500> flash<00:01:07.920> drive<00:01:08.930> also<00:01:09.930> sometimes<00:01:10.500> I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the USB flash drive also sometimes I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.320 
the USB flash drive also sometimes I
don't<00:01:10.980> want<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> empty<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:11.700> trash<00:01:12.000> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
don't want to empty my trash because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.790 
don't want to empty my trash because
I've<00:01:12.450> got<00:01:12.630> other<00:01:12.840> files<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> haven't

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
I've got other files and I haven't

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
rid of it after I'm sure I'm not gonna

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.240 
rid of it after I'm sure I'm not gonna
ever<00:01:20.880> need<00:01:21.060> that<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.510> so<00:01:22.350> I've<00:01:22.680> got<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.980> better

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
way to do that that's with the program

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
way to do that that's with the program

to<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.560> I'm<00:01:35.070> gonna<00:01:35.220> be<00:01:35.400> demonstrating<00:01:35.940> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
to use it I'm gonna be demonstrating it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
to use it I'm gonna be demonstrating it
with<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.330> lion<00:01:36.840> version<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.440> I<00:01:37.500> have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
with the lion version that I have

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.320 
with the lion version that I have
currently<00:01:38.190> but<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.760> works<00:01:38.970> pretty<00:01:39.120> much<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
currently but it works pretty much the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.750 
currently but it works pretty much the
same<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.590> Snow<00:01:40.860> Leopard<00:01:41.010> version<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
same for the Snow Leopard version and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.290 
same for the Snow Leopard version and
Leopard<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> let's<00:01:43.470> dig<00:01:43.710> right<00:01:43.770> into<00:01:44.400> it<00:01:44.550> first

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
Leopard so let's dig right into it first

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.910 
Leopard so let's dig right into it first

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and that's using that program called

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.150 
and that's using that program called
Disk<00:02:11.670> Utility<00:02:12.110> now<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.200> gonna<00:02:13.349> hit<00:02:13.620> command
