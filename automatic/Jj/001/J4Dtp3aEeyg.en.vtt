00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:05.189
 what happens space snails here yes 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.730
 retransmitting and again from the 

00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.040
 hangar to be if they say 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.540
 I bring you a new video in which we are going 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.670
 to be able to contemplate the freelance ship 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.350
 how is it pronounced so we're going to 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 take a look and let's do some 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.820
 tiny tests 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.789
 At first glance we see that the armament 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.070
 comes quite well comes equipped by 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.750
 at least what I missiles 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.090
 I understand that if you set a goal, 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 Bust almost sure as I give everything 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.600
 that artillery 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.680
 so let's try to enter inside and 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.680
 let's see it a little better 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.650
 something that is a hatch the galleries or 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.310
 be to enter 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.310
 I like inside 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.920
 what I'm seeing that the cabin is 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.840
 quite dark I understand that they are going to put 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.370
 some light or some way there is some 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.280
 thing to be able to see better because to 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.040
 simple view I'm seeing here 400 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.830
 I understand that would be the pilot 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.400
 co-pilot and the two companions so 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.630
 to be 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.630
 I'm going to sit in one of them 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.860
 the truth that the design of the ship is 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.860
 really pretty 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.990
 to see if any of this is a 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.700
 defensive turret I understand that yes I 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.460
 it looks very good it's pretty similar to 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.410
 a turret of these defensive of the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.270
 constellation although I creator is a 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.380
 little more tiny but does not want 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.380
 say it is less effective 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.830
 to see what else we can see from here 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.030
 to the before the missiles the two 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.930
 propellers of the host 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.250
 and that's the good cargo bridge the 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.810
 gate to enter the loading dock 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.810
 of the ship to what we will see 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 this would be the door there seems to be like 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.400
 a little ladder but it does not let me 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.310
 interact today we're going down on things 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.310
 galleries climbed up or down 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.350
 I do not see any button to download it 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.270
 but I understand that there will be some way 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.270
 to be able to lower that chair 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.050
 good now the test of fire I will be able 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.850
 put the google can not put it now 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.440
 some invisible part so let's go to 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.440
 leave doubts and go inside 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.819
 Yes that lets me 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.850
 to 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.030
 I thought that he would not let me 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.450
 some kind of search would leave me trapped 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.450
 to the door 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.090
 and this here will be another tower I understand 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 I did not have 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.880
 it looks like a tower or 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.590
 a sensor 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.590
 and then more defensive tower type 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.560
 on the part of the impeller yes I think it's a 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.330
 driving 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.730
 the truth that the ship is quite 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.290
 pretty but I think that recently they have 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.880
 made a small change in what is the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.350
 nose 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.320
 to see if they modify it and here we can 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.630
 visualize in a next video then nothing 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.520
 people I hope you liked the 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.470
 Video any suggestion any 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.500
 doubt anything you want me to do 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.000
 Do not hesitate to ask for it and any 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.289
 consult in the channel or if not the same 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.749
 star citizen website 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:11.099
 or you know we see each other and thanks for 

00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:11.099
