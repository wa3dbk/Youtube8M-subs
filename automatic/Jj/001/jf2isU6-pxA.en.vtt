00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:13.080
 Hi there, this is a small review of this 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:16.410
 activities like replacing tires on a motorcycle 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 stealth trigger 50 sm 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:24.210
 this is originally a road version which 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:27.289
 was with road wheels was taken 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.460
 decision at some point to put 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.820
 off-road wheels to try 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.230
 ride off-road 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.120
 means according to forum members 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:48.440
 more precisely the participants of the discussion on u tube 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:55.410
 front wheels mounted 4,6017 on 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:59.550
 alloy wheels front wheel fell without 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:04.199
 camera means normally manufacturer 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:09.409
 Kendo tire made in taiwan back 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:15.270
 the wheel is mounted too kendo 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.100
 5-10 17 model now remember what 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.680
 problematic and here I do not see where 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.720
 It is indicated but in general, without difficulty, you are all 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.820
 it will find on the Internet 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 mean what else can you tell him 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.790
 were given in principle to tire with 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.090
 installing these wheels in general then with 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.240
 Now back forward did not have to 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.880
 to suffer because back tire back 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.040
 tire did not get up 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 without a camera, that is, it was packed 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.920
 and failed tire put u to put 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.400
 her and without camera therefore 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.180
 I had to put a camera back on it 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:05.950
 as he explained for the fact that she was 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:11.230
 cramped what else can you tell about 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.690
 removing the rear wheel here here is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:20.620
 such is the sleeve that is inserted into 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.620
 the wheel here is there look clearly 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.440
 silver chromed 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:34.190
 and here is dark green so get up 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:37.670
 the insert in general is first confused and here 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.570
 this here is this long bolt not there 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.360
 lez here unfortunately long studied with it 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.940
 eventually swapped and 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:56.390
 put so tread in this rubber 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:59.269
 rough rough protector we suspect 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:04.060
 that enough tags in general I think 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:08.110
 that will cling to the ground well 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:15.160
 so what else can you tell you went 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:18.160
 Yesterday on the highway, in principle, the bus leads 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:22.170
 yourself ok without any 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.750
 surprises can go on asphalt true 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:32.230
 the temperature was about 10 degrees 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.569
 there is not very warm that you are still 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:38.220
 tell well maybe some common 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.890
 moments this 50 cc version stayed 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:45.209
 it was bought a long time but with all 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.680
 this mileage at the moment is 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.599
 only nine hundred and twenty-five 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.120
 kilometers 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:57.849
 in fact new can only be said 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:06.459
 passed the run-in he goes 70 kilometers 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:13.959
 an hour can be somewhere downhill 75 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:16.390
 speedometer machine so I don’t know 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.979
 be someone waiting on him for some special 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:20.079
 miracles 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.530
 than steadily travels 60 kilometers an hour 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:29.890
 so to speak 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:34.180
 70 kilometers per hour on the straight and and a little 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:36.430
 over 70 is also possible to drive at 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:41.160
 certain conditions there are all kinds of slides 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:44.650
 so here we see written on the engine 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.560
 49 cubic centimeters still possible 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:52.260
 to tell 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.860
 it is extremely fuel 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:03.000
 several values ​​here I wrote here 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:05.150
 reserve open state closed well in 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:11.820
 Generally such a confused review 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:14.810
 dedicated tire dedicated to all 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.810
 thank you for your attention
