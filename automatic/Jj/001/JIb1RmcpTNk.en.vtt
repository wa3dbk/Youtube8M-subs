predetermined<00:02:19.830> pretty<00:02:20.610> close<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.769> it's<00:02:22.769> a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
predetermined pretty close and it's a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.130 
predetermined pretty close and it's a
calculating<00:02:23.970> it's<00:02:24.120> got<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.480> GPS<00:02:24.870> fix

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
calculating it's got the GPS fix

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.949 
calculating it's got the GPS fix
immediately<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.599> I'm<00:02:27.599> going<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.840> show

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
immediately and and I'm going to show

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:41.520 
immediately and and I'm going to show
you<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.200> call<00:02:28.379> right<00:02:28.590> now

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.740 

so<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:43.310> goes<00:02:43.520> straight<00:02:43.730> to<00:02:43.880> that<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> I'm

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
so it goes straight to that and I'm

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.600 
so it goes straight to that and I'm
going<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.930> decline<00:02:45.350> so<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.310> don't<00:02:46.460> get<00:02:46.550> any

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
going to decline so we don't get any

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.460 
going to decline so we don't get any
noise<00:02:47.000> interference<00:02:47.300> but<00:02:47.810> it<00:02:47.930> pops<00:02:48.320> right

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
noise interference but it pops right

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.830 
noise interference but it pops right
back<00:02:48.800> into<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.220> application<00:02:49.790> itself<00:02:50.570> and

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
back into the application itself and

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.820 
back into the application itself and
we're<00:02:51.530> navigating<00:02:52.600> immediately

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
we're navigating immediately

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.550 
we're navigating immediately
so<00:02:54.830> we'll<00:02:55.460> start<00:02:55.850> start<00:02:56.570> going<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.410> can

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
so we'll start start going and you can

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.660 
so we'll start start going and you can
see<00:02:57.770> how<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.130> how<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.610> treats<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.330> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
see how it how it treats the the

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
mile on pedal road as you can see that

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.460 
mile on pedal road as you can see that
the<00:03:10.790> amplified<00:03:11.480> speaker<00:03:11.900> is<00:03:11.990> pretty<00:03:12.260> loud

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
the amplified speaker is pretty loud

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.100 
the amplified speaker is pretty loud
decent<00:03:13.460> enough<00:03:13.640> for<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.450> be<00:03:14.570> over<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:14.930> road

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
decent enough for to be over the road

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.810 
decent enough for to be over the road
noise<00:03:15.320> and<00:03:15.380> all<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.040> other<00:03:16.190> stuff<00:03:16.550> and<00:03:17.440> you

noise and all the other stuff and you

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.610 
noise and all the other stuff and you
also<00:03:19.820> notice<00:03:20.300> that<00:03:20.330> it's<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.050> Heather<00:03:21.260> cliff

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
also notice that it's that Heather cliff

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.410 
also notice that it's that Heather cliff
Road<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.430> does<00:03:22.610> have<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:23.030> text-to-speech

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
Road so it does have the text-to-speech

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:39.300 
Road so it does have the text-to-speech
which<00:03:24.080> is<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.320> really<00:03:24.620> nice<00:03:24.800> feature

show you a few other things I'm going to
go<00:04:52.199> ahead<00:04:52.320> and<00:04:52.560> show<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:54.300> increased<00:04:55.289> GPS

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
go ahead and show you the increased GPS

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.050 
go ahead and show you the increased GPS
signal<00:04:58.500> I'll<00:04:58.740> do<00:04:59.010> that<00:04:59.220> using<00:05:01.550> GPS<00:05:02.550> drive

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
signal I'll do that using GPS drive

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:09.320 
signal I'll do that using GPS drive
which<00:05:03.870> has<00:05:04.110> a<00:05:04.729> signal<00:05:07.520> strength<00:05:08.520> as<00:05:08.760> you<00:05:08.820> can

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
which has a signal strength as you can

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.250 
which has a signal strength as you can
see<00:05:09.479> on<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.690> bottom<00:05:09.930> we<00:05:10.680> have<00:05:11.720> maybe<00:05:12.720> seven<00:05:13.169> or

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
see on the bottom we have maybe seven or

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.770 
see on the bottom we have maybe seven or
eight<00:05:13.380> bars<00:05:14.150> I'm<00:05:15.150> going<00:05:15.270> to<00:05:15.330> go<00:05:15.479> ahead<00:05:15.570> and

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
eight bars I'm going to go ahead and

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.860 
eight bars I'm going to go ahead and
remove<00:05:16.550> the<00:05:17.550> iPhone<00:05:18.000> from<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.479> cradle<00:05:19.760> and<00:05:20.870> it

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
remove the iPhone from the cradle and it

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.100 
remove the iPhone from the cradle and it
just<00:05:22.080> dropped<00:05:22.410> by<00:05:22.680> two<00:05:23.400> three<00:05:23.870> three<00:05:24.870> bars

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
just dropped by two three three bars

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.010 
just dropped by two three three bars
four<00:05:25.470> bars<00:05:25.680> something<00:05:26.130> like<00:05:26.250> that<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:27.810> it

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
four bars something like that so it

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:31.580 
four bars something like that so it
definitely<00:05:28.490> helps<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.729> GPS<00:05:30.419> signal<00:05:30.900> the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
definitely helps the GPS signal the

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.960 
definitely helps the GPS signal the
other<00:05:31.710> thing<00:05:31.919> I<00:05:32.010> want<00:05:32.160> to<00:05:32.250> show<00:05:32.430> you<00:05:32.490> is<00:05:32.760> that

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
other thing I want to show you is that

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.659 
other thing I want to show you is that
even<00:05:33.360> though<00:05:33.660> I<00:05:33.690> took<00:05:34.080> the<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:35.010> phone<00:05:35.220> out<00:05:35.430> of

even though I took the the phone out of

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.779 
even though I took the the phone out of
the<00:05:35.789> cradle<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.500> still<00:05:37.500> have<00:05:37.710> a<00:05:37.919> blue<00:05:38.190> Bluetooth

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.480 
the cradle I still have a blue Bluetooth
connect<00:05:39.389> connection<00:05:40.110> I'm<00:05:41.099> going<00:05:41.250> to<00:05:41.310> go<00:05:41.400> ahead

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
connect connection I'm going to go ahead
