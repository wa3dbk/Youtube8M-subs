00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
these and I see the 22 people bought

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.130 
these and I see the 22 people bought
these<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:47.880> our<00:01:48.060> link<00:01:48.299> over<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.659> last<00:01:48.869> week

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
these from our link over the last week

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.350 
these from our link over the last week
does<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> thing<00:01:50.189> work<00:01:50.369> let<00:01:50.759> me<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.090> because

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
does this thing work let me know because

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.030 
does this thing work let me know because
I<00:01:51.509> would<00:01:51.720> certainly<00:01:52.020> consider<00:01:52.229> buying<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.829> if

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
I would certainly consider buying one if

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.350 
I would certainly consider buying one if
it<00:01:53.159> did<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.490> seems<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:53.880> cool<00:01:54.119> thing<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
it did it seems like a cool thing to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.080 
it did it seems like a cool thing to
have<00:01:54.509> uh<00:01:55.159> although<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.399> still<00:01:56.640> probably

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
have uh although it still probably

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.459 
have uh although it still probably
wouldn't<00:01:57.540> make<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:57.990> that<00:01:58.079> i<00:01:58.140> can<00:01:58.229> make

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
wouldn't make it so that i can make

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.399 
wouldn't make it so that i can make
pancakes<00:01:58.979> without<00:01:59.159> uh<00:01:59.869> halfway<00:02:00.869> burning<00:02:01.259> down

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
pancakes without uh halfway burning down

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.080 
pancakes without uh halfway burning down
my<00:02:01.469> kitchen<00:02:01.979> but<00:02:02.130> that's<00:02:02.280> probably<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.759> story

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
my kitchen but that's probably a story

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
my kitchen but that's probably a story
for<00:02:03.329> another<00:02:03.360> day
