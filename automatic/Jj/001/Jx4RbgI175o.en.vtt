00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
animation you can see that we have one

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.259 
animation you can see that we have one
asteroid<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.340> we<00:00:23.460> need<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.640> whole<00:00:23.850> bunch<00:00:24.119> of

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
asteroid but we need a whole bunch of

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
asteroid but we need a whole bunch of
them<00:00:24.390> to<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.410> we're<00:00:25.650> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.010> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
them to do that we're going to need to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.150 
them to do that we're going to need to
copy<00:00:26.400> this<00:00:26.609> asteroid<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.300> its<00:00:27.630> motions

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.870 
copy of both the object and its motions
see<00:01:57.979> and<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.159> see<00:01:59.310> that<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.490> object

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
see and you can see that the object

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.719 
see and you can see that the object
appeared<00:02:00.240> at<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> current<00:02:00.659> moment<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.079> time

let's<00:02:02.729> move<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:03.060> asteroid<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> new

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
let's move this asteroid to a new

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.889 
let's move this asteroid to a new
position<00:02:06.920> multi-select<00:02:08.390> move<00:02:09.390> forward

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899

just<00:02:11.290> another<00:02:12.930> position<00:02:15.540> about<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.750> select

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
just another position about the select

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:24.380 
just another position about the select
forward<00:02:18.900> based<00:02:19.900> another<00:02:21.239> it<00:02:22.239> into<00:02:22.599> position

forward based another it into position

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.630 
forward based another it into position
although<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:26.019> select<00:02:26.379> now<00:02:27.280> what<00:02:27.459> if<00:02:27.549> we

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
although you select now what if we

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.670 
although you select now what if we
wanted<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:28.000> new<00:02:28.299> object<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:29.079> move<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.260> like

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
wanted a new object to move just like

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.770 
wanted a new object to move just like
these<00:02:30.010> asteroids<00:02:30.519> are<00:02:30.790> moving<00:02:31.060> we<00:02:31.510> can<00:02:31.659> do

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
these asteroids are moving we can do

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.039 
these asteroids are moving we can do
that<00:02:31.930> too<00:02:32.109> let's<00:02:33.040> move<00:02:33.250> forward<00:02:33.750> draw<00:02:34.750> new

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
that too let's move forward draw new

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:43.140 
that too let's move forward draw new

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
motion while an object is selected I

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:48.539 
motion while an object is selected I
apply<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.540> motion<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.650> object<00:02:47.829> rather

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
apply the motion to that object rather

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.530 
apply the motion to that object rather
than<00:02:48.819> getting<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.180> new<00:02:49.389> copy<00:02:49.659> of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:50.049> object

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
than getting a new copy of the object

00:02:51.540 --> 00:03:00.750 
than getting a new copy of the object
