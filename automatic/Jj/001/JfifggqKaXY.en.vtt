00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.980

 houses of body view rose but also 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.090
 It has to be in cascais.

 portugal more cascais especially 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.959
 way of collaborating in the form of 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.860
 coordinating with our spectacular is something 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:23.980
 that we have never seen in other areas of the world 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.760
