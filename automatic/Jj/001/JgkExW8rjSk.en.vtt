the<00:02:21.450> way<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.629> it's<00:02:22.139> gonna<00:02:22.290> tell<00:02:22.799> us<00:02:22.889> about<00:02:23.010> this

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
the way so it's gonna tell us about this

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.979 
the way so it's gonna tell us about this
coil<00:02:23.400> what<00:02:23.639> exactly<00:02:24.060> go<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
coil what exactly go this is the

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.720 
coil what exactly go this is the
foundation<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.620> our<00:02:25.739> company<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.370> coil<00:02:26.579> is

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
foundation of our company this coil is

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.309 
foundation of our company this coil is
detachable<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.720> can<00:02:27.840> put<00:02:28.079> it<00:02:28.139> in<00:02:28.230> your

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
detachable and you can put it in your

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.500 
detachable and you can put it in your
freezer<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.100> allow<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.670> much<00:02:29.880> cooler<00:02:30.180> and

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
freezer and allow you a much cooler and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.860 
freezer and allow you a much cooler and
more<00:02:31.500> concentrated<00:02:32.190> hit<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:33.239> will<00:02:33.510> help

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
more concentrated hit that will help

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.830 
more concentrated hit that will help
hopefully<00:02:34.560> ease<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.549> pressures<00:02:36.329> of<00:02:36.420> smoking

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
hopefully ease the pressures of smoking

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.640 
hopefully ease the pressures of smoking
so<00:02:37.170> there<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> go

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650
