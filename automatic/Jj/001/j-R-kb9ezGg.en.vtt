00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
feel like the media is perpetuating this

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.870 
feel like the media is perpetuating this
just<00:00:59.700> between<00:01:00.410> myself<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.680> Roy<00:01:02.340> Williams<00:01:02.580> and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
just between myself and Roy Williams and

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.460 
just between myself and Roy Williams and
the<00:01:02.940> basketball<00:01:03.300> program<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.900> not<00:01:04.049> about<00:01:04.230> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the basketball program is not about that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.590 
the basketball program is not about that
and<00:01:04.710> I<00:01:05.160> think<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.550> everybody<00:01:05.760> who's<00:01:06.210> looking

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
and I think that everybody who's looking

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140 
and I think that everybody who's looking
at<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:08.160> completely<00:01:08.760> confused

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
at it in that way is completely confused

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.110 
at it in that way is completely confused
because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.870> corruption<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:11.010> NCAA<00:01:11.790> and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
because the corruption of the NCAA and

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.560 
because the corruption of the NCAA and
how<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:13.230> athletes<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:13.980> being<00:01:14.130> treated<00:01:14.570> it's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
how our athletes are being treated it's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
how our athletes are being treated it's
the<00:01:15.810> most<00:01:15.990> important<00:01:16.560> part<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.980> I<00:01:17.580> think<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the most important part and I think that

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.560 
the most important part and I think that
if<00:01:18.240> Roy<00:01:18.540> Williams<00:01:19.400> doesn't<00:01:20.400> step<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.390> take

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
if Roy Williams doesn't step up and take

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.700 
if Roy Williams doesn't step up and take
responsibility<00:01:22.610> you<00:01:23.610> say<00:01:23.850> well<00:01:24.480> Roy<00:01:24.720> you

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.220 
I mean I was a participant but I was

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.939 
I mean I was a participant but I was
also<00:06:40.400> 17<00:06:40.970> years<00:06:41.150> old<00:06:41.389> and<00:06:41.659> like<00:06:42.409> Jalen<00:06:42.740> said<00:06:42.919> I
