00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.080
 we are from dietalinea the company that imports and distributes in Italy 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.390
 company products bel gamestorm asp enna di garda more than 160 years of the 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.040
 production of stoves and fireplaces because you have decided to display acidity no 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:19.749
 such an energy expo 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.069
 because nestor malta is a company that has patented a combustion system 

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.900
 truly revolutionary 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.980
 it is possible to burn wood burning wood 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.469
 that instead of burning with the usual system as you can see in this 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.329
 moment the absolutely standard classic combustion as we are used to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.379
 see classically every day but by means of a very simple 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 remote control that had to pour democracia emotion is going to change 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.399
 completely and a commotion process for gasification or not will be started 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.989
 we more burn the black too much too fast but we will go to 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.539
 exploit all the volatile parts contained in the wood to be able to 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.489
 get a much slower burning and above all for 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.780
 gasification it is possible to note how much they are coming at this time 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.930
 burn only gaseous parties of ancient wood the line of lightly 

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.229
 solid state this truly revolutionary system because in appearance 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.549
 energy means great energy savings and wood 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.890
 it acts as a continuous reserve of energy that is transformed into gas 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.229
 it has never been seen in the wood sector until now 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.420
 lattice by means of a very practical remote control that also serves as a 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.060
 chronothermostat it is possible to set the room temperatures 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.200
 in order to get different 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.500
 for temperatures in the time slots of the day 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.390
 silos and other products 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.400
 away of the products we can see today 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.180
 they are a small part of the whole range of stoves for example this one 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900
 but because it is historically a great pro for wood and coal stoves 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.150
 in this case we can make cast iron stoves 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.340
 it is spoken of you very actual design let us forget the classic stoves in 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.090
 grandma's cast iron but a cast iron stove this case is certainly design 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.240
 contemporary avant-garde even with absolutely enamelling 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.720
 very very refined notes we can also note a very evolution 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.340
 clogging of a rotating stove attacks 33 syndicates fh 33 a vertical stove with 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.599
 possibility of shooting

 at the center of the room for 360 degrees roma himself 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:21.349
 also we can also see how 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.580
 practical system of accessibility to the controls allows with a practical 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:29.319
 screen-printed cannellino to obtain the management of all that it systems 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.789

 total cleaning of the exams 

00:02:33.929 --> 00:02:37.379
 let's remember that this new model that is budgetary in this period is called 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.859
 aipo of the we call us in jargon just for liking that it remembers 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.079
 vaguely endesa enel and ipod and here is a small overview of what it all is 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.949
 chicken the rest of the production range the stamapa 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.940
 important technology. adidas boxing returned to the car 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.199

 we will notice that you go there you will see present in our prechÃ¨ are of
