00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
too hot and I was wondering how many

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.550 
too hot and I was wondering how many
other<00:01:06.990> people<00:01:07.159> cope<00:01:08.390> temperature<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
other people cope temperature and so in

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.429 
other people cope temperature and so in
other<00:01:10.920> country<00:01:11.640> who<00:01:11.820> helped<00:01:12.060> climate<00:01:12.810> country

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
other country who helped climate country

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.070 
other country who helped climate country
they<00:01:14.040> all<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.490> air<00:01:15.060> conditioning<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:18.080> that's

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
they all have air conditioning so that's

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
they all have air conditioning so that's
okay<00:01:19.619> but<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> UK<00:01:21.080> and<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.290> many<00:01:22.729> houses

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
okay but in the UK and not many houses

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.440 
okay but in the UK and not many houses
has<00:01:24.210> air<00:01:24.990> conditioning<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:26.549> their<00:01:26.820> bedrooms

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
has air conditioning in their bedrooms

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.940 
has air conditioning in their bedrooms
so<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:28.619> that<00:01:29.280> case<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.020> bamboo

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
so in that case that so this is bamboo

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.740 
so in that case that so this is bamboo
fiber<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.909> bed<00:01:33.509> leaning<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.500> really<00:01:34.740> good

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
fiber a bed leaning it's a really good
