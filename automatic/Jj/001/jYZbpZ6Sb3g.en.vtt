00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
catching passes here and they're just

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.560 
catching passes here and they're just
ridiculous<00:04:13.590> um<00:04:14.310> so<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> have<00:04:14.730> to<00:04:14.820> say<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.299> and

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
ridiculous um so I have to say that and

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.560 
ridiculous um so I have to say that and
mobility<00:04:16.500> would<00:04:16.890> be<00:04:17.039> my<00:04:17.220> top<00:04:17.609> two<00:04:18.060> and<00:04:18.390> then<00:04:18.479> I
