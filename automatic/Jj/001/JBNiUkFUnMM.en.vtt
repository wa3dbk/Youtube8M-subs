00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.549
 hello everyone with you brought down Minkin and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.130
 regular boxing 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:11.370
 puzzles still i bought myself still 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.349
 one parcel ordered the case is that 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.500
 Now the most important thing and pass me on 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.750
 great exams and then is it all 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.130
 will be ahead of me 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:26.269
 here the parcel fell behind all fell owls 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.769
 Here and take business cards code corner gypsum 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.109
 challenge your abilities here 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.149
 Internet address if anyone is interested 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.809
 write off there you can order 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.910
 inexpensive cool cubes so all in 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.739
 the bag is empty now 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:49.670
 let's start the opening of this package 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:01:01.100
 so probably here so we open and yes 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:05.070
 probably so a second is just a miracle 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:08.490
 the first thing I have is a cap for 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 aurora orange which is me 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:18.030
 lacked as you see and now I have her 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:24.570
 I 'll put myself here and I have a full one 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:27.600
 cube order is a special thank you 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 Alexei, I asked him to look for himself 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.939
 cover of course yes i have a stick here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 it's not a stick but one picture is not 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.920
 changes because it 's better to go with 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.790
 so color than 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 scratch your hand on the regulation screw which 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.470
 It was under the hood so that we listed 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.800
 further further 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.370
 two logos corner code drink new 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.240
 logo and as you see here of course 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.240
 hard to see 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.900
 gleam but it is a new design that is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.960
 These logo glasses will come in handy for me and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:12.290
 the first thing we have here is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.190
 Dina cut, which I was also waiting here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.230
 he is this this dina cube that is here 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.880
 so here is such a triangle spinning 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 a bit like a scoop 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.140
 However, I think it will collect 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.560
 Well a little harder while I was with him had not yet 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.880
 figured out here but 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.770
 I repeat the puzzle is very interesting 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:44.720
 cool of course is still pretty 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.209
 mediocre but I will have smeared 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:55.820
 and I will have both silk and say 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:00.230
 so here the cap is not on the cube this is the logo and 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.920
 new then whose ordered myself so i 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:07.760
 I ordered myself I ordered myself masterfully 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.900
 Now look at this very miracle 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.240
 he is this very masterful 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:19.870
 from lan lan 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:25.610
 here are guys wow 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:27.830
 torsion is just phenomenal so it 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:36.020
 would be a great addition to my 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:49.400
 now let's see what the collection is like 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:54.710
 everything should work now 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:04:01.000
 return to the original form like this 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:05.030
 there is so it masterfully goes on 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.600
 fine this is crazy 3 by 3 and 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:12.050
 venus venus is what's painted here 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:17.870
 total in collection as you know 8 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:20.540
 cubes by the number of the planet that is I 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.300
 took one of them I don't know why I took 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.910
 is this just me he liked me 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:38.480
 honestly brulee know how they do themselves 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:41.900
 function here as you see here 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:49.550
 there is a center remains unchanged when 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:52.940
 rotating these all rotating parts so here 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:57.980
 the regulation cap was going on here 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:05:04.400
 firm dayan plus confessions but in general 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:08.440
 it will be interesting I will tell you that is 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.440
 here in this circle 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:21.079
 so everything returned to its place so with 

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:24.029
 I will understand him later and last 

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:28.669
 buying so I apologize as interruptions 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:38.779
 with light this is my linga 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:38.779
 ivory he just believes they 

00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:54.569
 Of course the distant greased cube but I told them 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:56.519
 more than pleased there is no cube grease but all 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.549
 equal after let's say the same review or 

00:05:56.519 --> 00:06:02.479
 diana birth is unusual this is the first 

00:05:59.549 --> 00:06:05.639
 my treshka from my company 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.249
 so I carefully chose not know 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:10.709
 I take it did not want to twist a friend to me 

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:13.409
 for some reason he did not like it but decided 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:16.379
 order yourself and living looked there 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:20.249
 a couple of reviews from foreign 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:25.199
 speedcuber in principle spider cube of course 

00:06:20.249 --> 00:06:28.289
 very noisy will repeat but really 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.839
 but I will do a decent review of this cube 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:34.669
 in a separate video and now all huge 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:34.669
 thanks for watching and goodbye
