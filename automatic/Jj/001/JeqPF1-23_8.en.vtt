00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.500
 show you the discover pro system of 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.599
 volkswagen golf gti 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.080
 so what do we have a screen a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.060
 8 inch display in HD really well 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 defined and here we have physical keys for 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 regarding the various media radio 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.760
 music sources founded voice for 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.519
 voice command 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.859
 nav really navigation traffic 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.240
 traffic information settings 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.140
 of the car and menu the screen 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.880
 main 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.219
 we are connected with a device 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.170
 bluetooth and so now we want 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.980
 feel with lenny kravitz the system 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.980
 audio of this golf 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.280
 the system really sounds very good there 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 they look like their own speakers 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.469
 they have really deep basses they are 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.410
 reached the maximum volume on 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:07.130
 audio system did not distort the volume 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:10.369
 making him use the boxes or a picture 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.800
 really worth the sound system with 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.200
 this infotainment system 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.210
 then I move from various sources 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.430
 we have jukebox or songs that 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.460
 we store inside the hard disk 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.990
 a of the cv dvd sd card machine that 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.479
 you have seen presentation we can 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.960
 insert as in the cd inside the 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.520
 glove compartment at weeks and usb 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.170
 selection or all the songs but with the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.789
 bluetooth are not displayed and here 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.399
 sound position settings 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:46.220
 low volume medium high bunun spider 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:49.220
 in short, the usual things after which we have 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.929
 see the radio screen with 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.179
 truly this is a here 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.350
 capacitive touchscreen that is to say 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.329
 that like the football of the phones you see 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.680
 it really flows easily here 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.290
 we have all the memory stations 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.610
 routes that are 15 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.829
 after that, fm am setup band 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.070
 also here posts on the news sound 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:15.440
 of the real traffic that interrupts us 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.540
 the sound of a radio and puts us 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.560
 rtl examples for traffic news 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:27.049
 manual selection and then this in 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.970
 practice then here see above 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.650
 we have various individual written for 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.910
 regarding the selection of 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.230
 driving mode you have seen in the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.940
 presentation video with the little key 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:41.060
 mood now charged and field how much 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.609
 take let's say the connected phone and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.459
 outdoor temperature 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.320
 then we can add phone here 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.880
 to favorites for example we go up 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.500
 phone and call 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.450
 a contract we call often 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.460
 let's say we have the keypad you see 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:00.110
 the sense of proximity that makes it immediately 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:04.130
 here and we can also m through 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.950
 voice command contacts also registers 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.240
 here the setup we are going to see bluetooth 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.900
 user profile we can immunize 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.370
 obviously more devices and remember 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.360
 don't forget the phone this is one 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.700
 interesting function 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.140
 let's say consensus warns when we 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.100
 let's get out of the car 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.900
 if we leave the phone inside 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:26.840
 of the machine warns us with a with a 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:37.780
 buzzer call number tell the number of 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:37.780
 Please no phone then cancels 90 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.700
 I showed him the voice command 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.010
 through the voice button the voice is not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.410
 so robotic and feels really good 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.940
 to cancel, nothing is needed but 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.680
 you have to click on the screen like 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.410
 you saw I can put a number 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.670
 through own voice we go on 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.530
 navigation function the map is 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.850
 really nice 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.710
 as you can see here we have a new one 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.000
 destination my destinations then 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.740
 let's see how to enter a 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.920
 destination with the usual keyboard not 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:12.080
 it's qwerty you see really very fast 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.150
 has implemented the commands 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:20.390
 after that we go to see the zoom 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.799
 we can regulate it through 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.540
 this key 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.260
 then my itineraries points to 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.890
 interest the visual or 2d or 3d network 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.060
 the radio automatic zoom or from 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:36.370
 this screen we can go to 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.600
 change the radio setup let's go 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.310
 reference path options 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.070
 fuel or you can also warn 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.330
 if we are reserve as in our case the 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.770
 nearest gas station 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.650
 map then as I said it shows 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.060
 really good real traffic in the tmc 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.730
 traffic news 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.990
 see how well this is flowing 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.280
 car 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.260
 here is our gt 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.880
 tells us to refuel not 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.860
 we can go to view all the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.000
 tire press information 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.910
 driving assistance 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.530
 lights in short all the settings also 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.730
 time and date then also the settings 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.419
 regarding the system 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:16.900
 infotainment less we give instead to 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.900
 main screen 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:24.050
 as I said really nice to 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:25.700
 graphic then and after strings with the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.639
 ignition volume wheel here we have 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.290
 see it does the traces function of 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:33.950
 scroll this wheel and also 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:36.740
 okay then here we go to see 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:40.750
 instead the steering wheel controls that can 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.380
 be called voice command 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.350
 one volume change radio station 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:48.850
 source not source subject to 

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.920
 change with this button here and here 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.350
 let's call the songs instead like I said 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.690
 first maybe a little too many keys up 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.090
 this gt but I have to say that if you do 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.180
 i don't get used to not being there 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:04.300
 therefore a really difficult system 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.620
 really good infotainment in my opinion 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.510
 on the class all the infotainment systems 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.930
 and its category and is worthy of 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.580
 be put on end-of-car cars too 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.470
 higher than higher than 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.440
 this golf like I said screen 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.060
 really well defined really well 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.030
 touch screens and functions working 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:23.169
 they are all easy to reach 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.330
 really with extreme ease 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.950
 I dare say thanks to those physical keys 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.410
 which allows us to go 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:31.960
 therefore within each function 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.530
 I would say that from this system discover pro 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.220
 by volkswagen golf gti is everything from enrico 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.220
 I consult everyone
