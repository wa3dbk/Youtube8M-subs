00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
sheet goods with the face side down so I

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.340 
sheet goods with the face side down so I
don't<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:49.950> tear<00:01:50.280> out<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.869> base<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.110> my

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
but let's talk about layout I like to

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.520 
but let's talk about layout I like to
set<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.130> top<00:02:06.340> of<00:02:06.520> my<00:02:06.640> panels<00:02:07.060> at<00:02:07.210> 32<00:02:07.750> inches<00:02:08.110> so

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
set the top of my panels at 32 inches so

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.980 
set the top of my panels at 32 inches so
I<00:02:08.560> put<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> level<00:02:09.340> line<00:02:09.700> on<00:02:10.030> these<00:02:10.210> two<00:02:10.450> walls

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
I put a level line on these two walls

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.260 
I put a level line on these two walls
I've<00:02:11.560> propped<00:02:11.980> up<00:02:12.220> this<00:02:12.430> first<00:02:12.700> piece<00:02:13.090> with

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
I've propped up this first piece with

I've propped up this first piece with
the<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:13.600> wedges<00:02:13.780> so<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.320> right<00:02:14.650> up<00:02:14.920> to

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
the little wedges so it's right up to

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.950 
the little wedges so it's right up to
the<00:02:15.190> line<00:02:15.400> I'm<00:02:16.210> going<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.390> show<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.750> rest

the line I'm going to show you the rest

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.680 
the line I'm going to show you the rest
of<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.200> system<00:02:17.650> here's<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.160> base<00:02:18.400> MDF<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.660> a

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
of the system here's the base MDF with a

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.870 
of the system here's the base MDF with a
solid<00:02:20.170> molding<00:02:20.590> that's<00:02:21.220> going<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.490> cover<00:02:21.670> this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
solid molding that's going to cover this

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.580 
solid molding that's going to cover this
gap<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.420> I<00:02:22.480> don't<00:02:22.690> have<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.930> worry<00:02:23.110> about<00:02:23.230> that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
gap so I don't have to worry about that

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.190 
gap so I don't have to worry about that
the<00:02:24.400> reason<00:02:24.790> I'm<00:02:24.880> so<00:02:25.030> fussy<00:02:25.450> about<00:02:25.480> staying<00:02:25.990> on

cut this end and fit it I want to take

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.520 
cut this end and fit it I want to take
the<00:03:05.320> material<00:03:05.470> off<00:03:05.950> this<00:03:06.220> end<00:03:06.489> what<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.530> is

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the material off this end what I do is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.390 
the material off this end what I do is
flip<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.130> over<00:03:10.769> but<00:03:11.769> it<00:03:11.920> up<00:03:12.010> against<00:03:12.310> the

flip it over but it up against the

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.449 
flip it over but it up against the
corner<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.360> I<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.560> see<00:03:14.769> that<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:15.010> have<00:03:15.160> to<00:03:15.310> make

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
corner and I can see that I have to make

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.120 
corner and I can see that I have to make
a<00:03:15.489> cut<00:03:15.850> right<00:03:16.090> there<00:03:16.830> removing<00:03:17.830> this<00:03:17.920> material

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
a cut right there removing this material

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.390 
a cut right there removing this material
that<00:03:19.030> leaves<00:03:19.330> me<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.540> nice<00:03:19.930> wide<00:03:20.350> course<00:03:20.800> that's

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
that leaves me a nice wide course that's

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.980 
that leaves me a nice wide course that's
perfect

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.750

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
to get any better than that now in this

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.760 
to get any better than that now in this
inside<00:06:18.090> corner<00:06:18.570> what<00:06:18.720> I<00:06:18.750> like<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.169> do<00:06:19.320> is<00:06:19.530> put<00:06:19.740> a

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
inside corner what I like to do is put a

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.430 
inside corner what I like to do is put a
mark<00:06:20.070> right<00:06:20.310> here<00:06:20.370> come<00:06:21.090> in<00:06:21.270> at<00:06:21.389> a<00:06:21.450> 45<00:06:21.690> degree

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
mark right here come in at a 45 degree

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.530 
mark right here come in at a 45 degree
cut<00:06:22.650> and<00:06:22.889> we<00:06:22.979> move<00:06:23.220> just<00:06:23.610> the<00:06:23.760> rounded<00:06:24.240> over

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
cut and we move just the rounded over

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.629 
cut and we move just the rounded over
portion<00:06:25.020> and<00:06:25.500> I'll<00:06:25.620> come<00:06:25.800> back<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.040> clip<00:06:26.490> the

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:26.639 
portion and I'll come back and clip the

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.010 
portion and I'll come back and clip the
corner<00:06:26.940> on<00:06:27.060> this<00:06:27.210> piece<00:06:27.479> and<00:06:27.660> I<00:06:27.690> should<00:06:27.870> have<00:06:27.990> a

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
corner on this piece and I should have a

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:40.810 
corner on this piece and I should have a
nice<00:06:28.290> tight<00:06:28.680> joint

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.380 

and<00:06:41.820> that's<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:42.510> way<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:42.690> should<00:06:43.350> fit<00:06:44.120> in<00:06:45.120> on

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
and that's the way that should fit in on

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.030 
and that's the way that should fit in on
this<00:06:45.600> outside<00:06:46.200> corner

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
this outside corner

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.210 
this outside corner
another<00:06:48.000> miter<00:06:48.480> joint

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.480 
this is the molding that's going to go

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.750 
this is the molding that's going to go
under<00:06:55.960> the<00:06:56.140> cap<00:06:56.410> and<00:06:56.770> I've<00:06:57.040> just<00:06:57.370> tipped<00:06:57.580> my

against the top piece only that front
edge<00:07:04.990> is<00:07:05.170> going<00:07:05.320> to<00:07:05.380> make<00:07:05.560> contact<00:07:06.160> giving<00:07:06.550> me

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:06.670 
edge is going to make contact giving me

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.830 
edge is going to make contact giving me
a<00:07:06.700> nice<00:07:06.910> tight<00:07:07.420> fit
