 Hello, how are you all showing my name?

 thousand students and welcome 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.390
 public and private education I'm going to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.129
 do pros and cons in the two types of 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 education I want to make this clear then 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.699
 I do not want to offend students of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.650
 schools I just want those who 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.930
 have channel in a comment that 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.030
 they think about that so well then 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.620
 more preambles let's start I went to a 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.290
 public school in santander aid 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.060
 It is the best public aid school 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.000
 santander which is called brokerage 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.960
 Relief secretary key quotes 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.399
 course is the best school there is no 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 I can say that they approved was their 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.390
 out there the people for the best 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 to say it the parents but that to put to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
 their children in a public education because 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.030
 to assume that the curricula and 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.399
 the professors they offer are 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.130
 certified by the government or by a 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.050
 teacher organization is assumed the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.330
 information that will be in this video is 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.460
 about what I lived and saw during my 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.890
 education at school ok 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.049
 ok because if it's not ok I can 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.450
 change I can tell you everything 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.409
 what you need to know about the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.409
 public education 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.859
 and private 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.410
 seriously we will do that in one case 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.410
 public and private 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.280
 As I had already been saying, I went out in a 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.649
 Socorro School Santander is a 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.359
 very good school I can not deny the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.219
 most of their teachers teach very 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:02:00.409
 well the subjects of their classes but the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.719
 another minority 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:07.829
 for not being offensive I do not know how to say it 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.750
 No offense, they were complete bugs 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.790
 the first many times remember the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.650
 that they were too lazy and what more 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.239
 laugh gives me is that the teachers more 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.000
 vague were the education teachers 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:20.060
 physical 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.560
 centuries of physical education that is I am 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.450
 in most of the teachers' schools 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400
 for parents physical education hours if 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.740
 your physical education teacher paid them 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.180
 like this idea, they're not going to lie to me 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.650
 I know you also stop 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.930
 just treat education teacher 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.670
 physical the stopped looking I know that if 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.830
 I know that if everyone did it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.510
 nobody escaped is now let's talk 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.790
 about something that I always said always 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.770
 I always hated I never understood the fact 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.920
 return to the students for bringing a 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:49.010
 different uniform or bring long hair 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.470
 the girls were returned by their nails or 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.980
 bring makeup another 'parenthesis' 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.290
 americas are girls, that is always said 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.540
 that and they have never found a sense 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.550
 logical to that perspective that the 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.500
 colleges return students by 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.420
 those stupidities who sleep the 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.550
 students at home do not care if 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.560
 that child has money to go to his house 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.530
 if your parents are at home if you have 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.870
 the keys of your house if it can happen to you 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.580
 something from the school trip to your home 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.459
 they do not think about anything they just think about doing 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.620
 meet the rules of your school or 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.550
 it's stupid in a return in your 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.010
 house if they change 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.750
 report and it returns that good you can see 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.650
 in certain in the course of which was 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:33.320
 his house is the wolf child and for stealing it what 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.150
 they kill or they just do to today 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.760
 you in the world that we live and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.410
 you know that that is totally possible 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.910
 teachers never think about that 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.970
 they simply want to enforce 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.100
 laws of your school or your rector or 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.600
 laws to be given the win and put the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.340
 parents of that child are convinced of 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.620
 who is studying when they will see that the 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.900
 work comes from his son and see that he does not 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.370
 arrives they will become worried and the rest 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.930
 of the story I think it's now singing 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.100
 the presumptions to imagine who 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.930
 is responsible for the death 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.990
 disappearance or things that happen to 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.000
 child to the girl because the school or 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.610
 they do not think about what could happen 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.770
 that is one of the things that I always hated 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:11.510
 which public son another of the things 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.930
 what I always said is that there was a lot 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.930
 bullying 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.480
 thank you very much game 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.959
 that is very good to bullying not to 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.959
 bullying 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.470
 ah 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.209
 we give him 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.080
 another thing that was always his classes of 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.610
 religion and its catechism 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.069
 that is to say thesis did not have the 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.990
 Answers for all kinds of questions 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:51.479
 It's something like your girlfriend left you 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.910
 ask your dogs for catechism 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.530
 zelaya questions in the catechism his 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.230
 fascists in bullying questions the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.410
 xerecismo 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.660
 and I want to clarify that I am not an atheist but 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.620
 I'm not Catholic either, the truth is I'm fine 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.330
 I write you from global 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.860
 so if I go to your house do not try 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.250
 look for an excuse not to open your 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.250
 door 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.130
 the truth I am Christian my mother always 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.590
 transmits to me the things of God always 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.419
 from chiquito tonces then I can not deny 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.490
 I believe that much in God I have it 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.199
 present in all the things of my life and 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.600
 the truth always thought that to be 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.520
 with god there is no need to go to a 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.320
 church is simply to have god 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.600
 in the things of his present life always 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.639
 now we will talk a little about the occasion 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.620
 private then favorable on the occasion 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:41.139
 private is that almost always exams 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.820
 of ifes the results are more 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.100
 artistic public education 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.139
 I think they will prepare them better for that 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.729
 with all due respect but you know that 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.100
 students whether they are from schools 

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.900
 Private universities are always for 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.580
 so to say more enlarged than those of 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.650
 public education I want the 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.660
 private school students I 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:00.370
 leave in the comments and also there 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.530
 they return us for the same reasons as 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:04.690
 public code or if they return us by 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.430
 some other reasons I just want 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.560
 know whether they are returned or not 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.389
 and then about teachers the 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.340
 I really can not say anything because always 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:14.260
 I'm on the bus since that extra was 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.419
 yes but I guess the thing is not 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.660
 It changes a lot to be a teacher or teacher 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:21.900
 math will always be the grumpy 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:24.270
 the chemistry teacher is a love the 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:26.610
 man of philosophy of those that always 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.830
 the teachers will always ride 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.110
 of physics and physical education are the most 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.910
 relaxed and more lazy from school and 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.600
 teachers of Spanish because in my case 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:39.620
 it was that more we rode it poor God 7 

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.260
 a being truly sorry 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:44.540
 I regret the truth I do not regret 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.970
 and here came the video today I want 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.979
 tell them something the important thing to be in the 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:50.780
 public education or private education 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:53.120
 it does not matter if they are in sixth 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.340
 study boys come out of that stage of 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.930
 your life with your head held high and then 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.120
 when they enter the next stage of their 

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:00.889
 life will the university be able to do 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.740
 all that if they could not read in 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:05.930
 the school so they will no longer have to 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.490
 no teacher or maybe the most 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.380
 Probably they do not have their parents 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:11.260
 saying that all the time I studied 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.250
 study study things are going to change 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:15.320
 you are going to have to take your 

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:17.870
 own decisions for life and 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.030
 believe me that I did not miss it 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:21.979
 I did not miss his parents 

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.110
 telling him to study his parents 

00:07:21.979 --> 00:07:26.660
 scolding the giving them advice they create 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.039
 you miss that and boys try not to 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:30.199
 make life so impossible to their 

00:07:28.039 --> 00:07:31.699
 parents want to run is difficult because 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:34.729
 not to do what he pleases 

00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.130
 but they create everything one does today 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:39.470
 will see in the future we will not be young by 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:41.690
 always all we do today have 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:43.370
 some consequences later so 

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.510
 We lead our lives at this time 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:46.820
 ok but yes 

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.740
 thinking what goes into a future not 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.510
 forget that my name is Miguel Quintero 

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.820
 and that there is only his way of life 

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:55.360
 depending on yourselves so I 

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.360
 bless them
