00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the more we ended up taking the video on 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.049
 my tablet to show today 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.750
 how to use convent simulate a 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.950
 attack simulate an attack a yes you 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.630
 have of course simulated an attack 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 without clash of plant so that's it 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.369
 first an application folded under 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.920
 I will put in the description of a site 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.630
 finally one to one at Beijing would finally put 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.340
 I do not know yet an application what 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.230
 so the app I would put it a 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 I'll put it in the description 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 what, then, I had it that they are 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.679
 it's fashionable game 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.410
 I 'm trying this version for 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.489
 android on ios opponents who 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 valence but there are many other things 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.469
 in this video on me I'm doing 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.059
 proof of purchase android so me I from 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.899
 change for that looks like a trick a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.110
 about normal but here I do not have the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.280
 bonuses 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.620
 here so basically there you're going 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.989
 a completely logical thing 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.809
 but if they have to find it's going to be a 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.730
 Chinese support so what's the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.829
 the only one that is not like that is this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.589
 Chinese tale there I have it's a trick 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.030
 like that you open it first you I 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.280
 think it might ask you 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.830
 an update finally it depends on you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 open it up here it flies open maybe 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.979
 that you will see you will have to turn the 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.560
 head to see the stuff that will be hard 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.240
 still there it opens you the thing it wants 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.409
 to say here you have some little tricks 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.659
 years do not make yourself new 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.600

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:27.119

 you are going to teach you small 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.740
 trick there is a little clock clock and 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.650
 you click on it too 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.310

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.720
 you will not have anything to download me I 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.549
 the last the dig to click on the 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.380

 black but you can not you 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.470
 to press flat is not ugly 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.759
 here at the foot there you supported a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.010
 once you have made known how to return in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.170

 orange support you that will you launch the 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.020
 full chance normally 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.970
 here you have a little trick on the right 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.640
 it's a little ugly rush why you 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.100
 move them where it works only when 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.260
 you are at the base in the village like that 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.480
 there like that and that when you 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.860
 are not without the village so you 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.350
 click on it so pique on see 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.340
 a bit the thing but you click on it 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.870
 you have some little things that 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 appear below a little lower 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.120
 you click on that one from the top and the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.860
 down it is useless then click on this 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410
 duo where david fouquet aof 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.670
 so we're interested stuff all the way down 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.220
 you go down to the bottom on top 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.780
 the very last you activate it you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.780
 do you press the structure 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.800
 home often top left for 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.420
 go down to go out I had you 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.200
 do it you are good then you 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.990
 can go in in the war when 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.700
 of an exodus 15 years takes the pif 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:04.770

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.730
 yeah good I 've never prepared I've 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.910
 tried to do kind but it does not 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.140

 attack it satisfies as an attack 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.120
 so there after me I judge that a sub 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.489

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.019

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:40.480
 kill at 400 will take 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:46.710

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.810
 yeah well here I kill them I killed I 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.940
 killed the archers like that and when on 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.230
 photos retracing the resources that 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.610
 you use you do not use them 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.750
 really it had six virtually 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.640
 that is to say that I will do that I 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.650
 want it to be quick and easy 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.480
 has found that I will attack as 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.250
 a shit but it's just a story of 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 show here I see it like that 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:23.670
 is called like a lightning spell it's going 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.400
 so attack well in the same place as 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.620
 that's going to be very fast 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.990
 aulas and bombs and where I knew 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.840
 I had already tried 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:39.230
 that's where you go have you all and 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.230
 papers there it's okay do not you fuck 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.230
 buy 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.669
 you have there you have psg amassed 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:51.280
 game for mine but his chips shows 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:55.430
 an example thieves go beyond this 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.800
 I just did the 50% I think what 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.280
 I hope I'm going to do that should the 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.280
 do now 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.389
 I have 50% 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.250
 and if you fi ne finished 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.840
 bottle are you going a little bit 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.930
 that a little it will spit that the 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.060
 plan heater but that's why you 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.570
 can do again you have kept your 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.570
 troops 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:24.889
 I will I do that here in November 57% here 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:27.229
 I finished the trick maybe this is it 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:29.509
 spit on me the game what is 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:31.970
 completely normal because it's the 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.199
 register no lens was going there sorry room 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.880
 do not save so that's what you do 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.680
 that's for sure it's back to you on the 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.729
 little trick so I find myself so the 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.910
 Jov Clan Here's Returning His Fashion 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:45.949
 here and the tooth you will see that I 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.630
 did not lose any enemy troops on 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.180
 fate mg we see who is still in 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.940
 form normally so that's the little 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:59.539
 quite fast loading or the bear to 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:06:02.530
 banks so here it is extremely 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.970
 weird that dance before it was weird 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.919
 these barbarians that his charge 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:11.030
 so here you are just going to see 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:12.229
 that the troops is this still a good there 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.240
 it's really annoying because I 'm 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:17.570
 not what to say 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.930
 so here you can see that the 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.599
 troops 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.789
 they are seven are there he raised and all 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.520
 the archers at 200 archers age have 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:28.490
 shown that boom and the e3 will be two 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.759
 night of rage one on lightning we see 

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.500
 good king no king and here they are 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:37.539
 the right front the days fit and 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.539
 here we go out is playing the lease and more
