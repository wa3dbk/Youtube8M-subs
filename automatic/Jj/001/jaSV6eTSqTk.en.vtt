00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.790
 welcome to made in venezuela today 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.740
 I have for you the traditional bread of 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.599
 Venezuelan ham that always is 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.200
 accompanying in all our novelties 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.180
 to us here in Venezuela for 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.080
 make this bread what we need is 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.680
 have the yeast hydrated in a cup 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.550
 of warm water 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.430
 this is going to be added in a single 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.190
 hit the flour so that it leaves 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.120
 integrating what we are going to integrate little 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.120
 to little 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 once this is done once it has 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.440
 integrated, let's go adding the three 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 eggs 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.199
 and we should also have warm the 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.010
 milk with sugar and pinch of salt 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:05.579
 to then add the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.579
 let's also add the butter 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.930
 you have to try to integrate it as much as possible 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.690
 we can and with that we are going to help 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:25.330
 with warm milk ok it has to be 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:28.190
 warm mixed with sugar and salt 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.890
 we are going to integrate the little by little 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.010
 until we have a mass like this 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.650
 We have chiclosa here but that's not 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.310
 matter because after with the kneading 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.500
 she is going to be different if she is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.900
 necessary to add more flour 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.780
 we add a little more once 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.369
 this is ready that is no longer chiclosa 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.369
 we are going to knead it 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.770
 always moving forward with our dolls 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 from the inside out 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.070
 as it still follows a little cheese close 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.350
 There is hard to handle but I am 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.840
 adding a little more flour but 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.970
 always in small quantities and in shape 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.940
 of rain so that it is not disturbed in 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.700
 our recipe 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.370
 once ready then what we are going to do 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.080
 is to give it a ball shape and we are going to 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.840
 place in the bowl where previously 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.290
 we were making our dough we're going 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.540
 to cover with a damp cloth and let 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.660
 keep in a warm place in this case 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.390
 I'm going to store it in my oven which 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.160
 well obviously it 's off once 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.950
 done this, we're going to take it out of the 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.910
 oven we are going to stretch it for 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.140
 degassing get the gas that has 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.010
 so that when baking is not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:53.450
 break and we will give around 100 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.450
 blows on the table 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.739
 let's divide our mass into four 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.560
 equal parts even though in this 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.510
 recipe I realized that I got six 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.700
 breads 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.159
 now if you want to be great 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.010
 so you can get up to four loaves 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.829
 great then let's stretch our 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.019
 dough like a floured rolling pin and 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:24.220
 also our floured table so that 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:25.640
 the dough does not stick to us from the table and so 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:28.430
 power 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.120
 bring our bread to the oven once 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.819
 the dough is stretched let's cut them 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.860
 let's give it a pretty shape so that 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.860
 our bread is perfect 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.780
 when it is ready we ready the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.489
 surface and good this is my touch 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.719
 staff I put butter 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.269
 around so it has a more flavor 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:02.420
 nice as you can also 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:05.299
 place in the microwave two 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.639
 minutes the bacon and the fat 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:11.269
 you can impregnate the here in the 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:13.370
 mass this is good a personal touch if 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.889
 like you can if or if not 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.019
 directly go placing the slices of 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.500
 ham as I am doing in this 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.190
 moment 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.259
 this is smoked ham that is very 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.020
 It is necessary that the smoked monkeys 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:30.530
 what gives that nice flavor to 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:35.110
 our Venezuelan ham bread also 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.110
 we are going to place smoked bacon 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.310
 We are going to place you in several rows to 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.870
 that when it comes to chopping the bread 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.550
 in several parts that remain parts 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.169
 same 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.590
 equally then we are going to add the 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:54.259
 olives you have to try not to be a clue 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.440
 of not serving and closing with her denouncing 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:01.150
 stingy with the ingredients so that 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.910
 let's have a ham bread 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.980
 of our taste now if it is to sell 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.100
 Well, if we have what 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.760
 try not to put as many ingredients 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.410
 but save a little more 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.510
 we add the raisins there are also people 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 who do not like raisins but 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.410
 can move in this case I am 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.200
 doing as such as should be the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.250
 Venezuelan bread with amounts and net steps 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.620
 and olives stuffed with paprika once 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.100
 done this what we are going to do is 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:36.700
 go folding it and giving shape to 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.700
 our bread 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:44.530
 like in this moment and once this 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:49.090
 be ready we will let it rest in 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:51.880
 a warm place for half an hour once 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.510
 After the half hour because we will 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.970
 take to the oven as you see here here I am 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.030
 placing a little egg around 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.260
 of the bread so that it does not open and 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.260
 completely sealed 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.040
 when it is ready then as I said 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:16.670
 we cover it again with a damp cloth and 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:21.520
 we take it to the oven 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:21.520
 obviously turned off so they grow 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.150
 half an hour can be half an hour 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.330
 well he mentioned the video record that 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:34.170
 part I put it in the oven and what I 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:37.729
 placed the paper with the egg with which 

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:41.529
 we will give color to our bread 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.999
 and well he also placed sesame 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:45.680
 sesame seed as well as you 

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:50.210
 you can skip it and just add 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.069
 egg and take it to the oven and that's how 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.199
 it remains I do it in this way of 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.499
 I really hope that this recipe like it 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:07:00.849
 that serves them and see you in the next 

00:06:57.499 --> 00:07:00.849
 video until next time
