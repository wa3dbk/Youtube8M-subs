00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.120
 and how to take advantage of these peculiarities and the charming ones 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.650

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.539
 First and foremost, this closet is the right to travel 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.489
 USD 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.599
 I've done a lot here and I'm starting to catch 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.930
 one can subsequently hold the group in court 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.850
 often pull 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.030

 Without a word, the word can be seen from high in the cinema 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.550
 5 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.910
 if you have the profiling 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.910
 he gets himself directed more 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.470
 the 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 it is 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.500

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.700

 Rendezvous get love 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.570
 in this mill have a small area there 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 nowhere else 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.540
 if the group is in tow 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.190
 the safest place even here "behind the wall" and for protection from the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.190
 shops 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 in Kandern directly afterwards 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.680
 also SteinbrÃ¼cks 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.259
 Now it goes on to the next important point

 Now there is a fighter 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:54.609
 Test match opponents 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.459
 maybe could 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.539
 After that you can directly join the group 

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:00.609
