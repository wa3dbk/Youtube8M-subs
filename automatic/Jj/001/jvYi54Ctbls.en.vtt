00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
effect at the Trop bench so first of all

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.430 
effect at the Trop bench so first of all
we'll<00:01:12.850> just<00:01:12.970> start<00:01:13.210> with<00:01:13.420> our<00:01:13.539> white<00:01:14.020> cabbage

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
we'll just start with our white cabbage

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.010 
we'll just start with our white cabbage
and<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:15.729> don't<00:01:16.000> need<00:01:16.149> to<00:01:16.210> lose<00:01:16.539> all<00:01:16.720> of<00:01:16.869> this

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
and you don't need to lose all of this

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.499 
and you don't need to lose all of this
this<00:01:17.289> will<00:01:17.470> go<00:01:17.590> a<00:01:17.619> long<00:01:17.830> way<00:01:18.100> we're<00:01:18.820> gonna<00:01:18.910> make

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
this will go a long way we're gonna make

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.590 
this will go a long way we're gonna make
the<00:01:19.660> recipe<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.920> it<00:01:21.070> slips<00:01:21.280> rx-8<00:01:21.910> sure<00:01:22.479> you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
the recipe and it slips rx-8 sure you

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.169 
the recipe and it slips rx-8 sure you
already<00:01:22.720> have<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.520> if<00:01:24.640> we<00:01:24.759> don't<00:01:24.880> need<00:01:25.030> to

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
already have so if we don't need to

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.749 
already have so if we don't need to
slice<00:01:25.450> it<00:01:25.630> up<00:01:25.690> too<00:01:26.020> small<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:27.130> can<00:01:27.310> what<00:01:27.460> using

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
slice it up too small you can what using

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.300 
slice it up too small you can what using
a<00:01:27.850> quiz<00:01:28.060> not<00:01:28.330> any<00:01:28.659> fun<00:01:28.899> you<00:01:29.020> go<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> bit<00:01:29.890> finer

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
a quiz not any fun you go a bit finer

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.430 
a quiz not any fun you go a bit finer
than<00:01:30.550> I'm<00:01:30.729> doing<00:01:31.090> because<00:01:31.300> your<00:01:32.200> food

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
than I'm doing because your food

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.919 
than I'm doing because your food
processor<00:01:32.709> probably<00:01:33.459> will<00:01:33.640> have<00:01:33.880> less<00:01:34.599> power

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
processor probably will have less power

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.830 
processor probably will have less power
than<00:01:35.229> this<00:01:35.440> so<00:01:36.130> just<00:01:36.340> do<00:01:37.090> what<00:01:37.119> you<00:01:37.450> need<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.720> do

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
than this so just do what you need to do

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.880 
than this so just do what you need to do
is<00:01:38.140> take<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.560> machine<00:01:39.569> okay<00:01:40.569> so<00:01:40.630> this<00:01:40.959> both

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
is take the machine okay so this both

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.490 
is take the machine okay so this both
small<00:01:42.610> little<00:01:43.090> chance<00:01:43.450> but<00:01:43.690> not<00:01:43.780> too<00:01:43.989> tiny

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
small little chance but not too tiny

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:58.740 
small little chance but not too tiny
this<00:01:44.770> can<00:01:45.039> handle<00:01:45.239> much<00:01:46.239> anything<00:01:56.429> so<00:01:57.750> that's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
this can handle much anything so that's

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.210 
this can handle much anything so that's
the<00:01:58.899> cabbage<00:01:59.229> taking<00:01:59.590> careful

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the cabbage taking careful

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.910 
the cabbage taking careful
I'm<00:02:01.090> actually<00:02:01.270> gonna<00:02:01.629> do<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.440> pulse<00:02:02.679> it

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
I'm actually gonna do is just pulse it

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:21.149 
I'm actually gonna do is just pulse it
just<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.379> set<00:02:08.379> it<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.709> polls

with<00:02:36.920> a<00:02:37.010> smaller<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:39.040> resized<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:41.239> when<00:02:41.359> it

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
with a smaller and resized so when it

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.360 
with a smaller and resized so when it
comes<00:02:41.659> to<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:41.930> character<00:02:42.349> similar<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.220> know

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
comes to the character similar you know

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.460 
comes to the character similar you know
do<00:02:43.609> you<00:02:43.819> have<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.180> know<00:02:44.329> what<00:02:44.599> the<00:02:44.870> process<00:02:45.109> of

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
do you have to know what the process of

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.770 
do you have to know what the process of
smell<00:02:45.709> of<00:02:46.040> sleeve<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.879> fairly<00:02:47.329> decent

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
smell of sleeve the fairly decent

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.199 
smell of sleeve the fairly decent
science<00:02:48.049> channels<00:02:48.609> course<00:02:49.609> it<00:02:49.730> saves<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.180> much

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
science channels course it saves so much

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.559 
science channels course it saves so much
time<00:02:50.420> making<00:02:50.930> get<00:02:51.680> away<00:02:51.920> with<00:02:52.099> doing<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:53.269> size

is<00:03:49.950> we've<00:03:50.670> not<00:03:50.819> won<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:51.090> really<00:03:51.299> fine<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
is we've not won it really fine that

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.300 
is we've not won it really fine that
I've<00:03:51.989> made<00:03:52.200> it<00:03:52.379> so<00:03:52.409> that<00:03:52.590> it's<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.069> same<00:03:53.250> as

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
I've made it so that it's the same as

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.149 
I've made it so that it's the same as
last<00:03:53.519> look<00:03:53.909> garbage<00:03:54.780> I'm<00:03:55.530> just<00:03:55.769> gonna<00:03:55.950> pull

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
last look garbage I'm just gonna pull

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:06.860 
last look garbage I'm just gonna pull
that<00:03:56.310> one<00:03:56.459> in<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:04.109> side<00:04:05.420> but<00:04:06.420> then<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.689> can

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
that one in the side but then you can

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.690 
that one in the side but then you can
absolutely<00:04:07.349> use<00:04:07.590> your<00:04:07.859> hands<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.250> mix<00:04:08.280> in<00:04:08.669> some

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
absolutely use your hands to mix in some

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.699 
absolutely use your hands to mix in some
hold<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.419> bit<00:04:09.599> more<00:04:09.720> effectively<00:04:10.260> using

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
hold it's a bit more effectively using

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.289 
hold it's a bit more effectively using
spoon<00:04:11.040> in<00:04:11.250> actual<00:04:11.549> fat<00:04:11.730> because<00:04:12.000> you<00:04:12.120> just

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
spoon in actual fat because you just

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.279 
spoon in actual fat because you just
have<00:04:12.480> more<00:04:12.659> control

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:15.289 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.599 

it's<00:04:16.289> the<00:04:16.380> perfect<00:04:16.560> way<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.889> actually<00:04:17.220> don't

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
it's the perfect way to actually don't

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.550 
it's the perfect way to actually don't
need<00:04:17.759> too<00:04:17.880> much<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.389> their<00:04:18.930> walls<00:04:19.259> and

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
need too much on their walls and

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.700 
need too much on their walls and
overpowering<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:21.019> they<00:04:22.019> don't<00:04:22.199> any<00:04:22.410> only

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
overpowering so they don't any only

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.279 
overpowering so they don't any only
seeing<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.190> cabbage<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:23.880> carrot<00:04:24.330> all<00:04:24.930> right

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
seeing the cabbage and carrot all right

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:27.950 
seeing the cabbage and carrot all right
so<00:04:25.919> that's<00:04:26.009> actually<00:04:26.220> great<00:04:26.669> as<00:04:26.910> it<00:04:27.060> is<00:04:27.300> but<00:04:27.599> of

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
so that's actually great as it is but of

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.839 
so that's actually great as it is but of
course<00:04:28.169> what<00:04:28.440> we're<00:04:28.530> gonna<00:04:28.650> be<00:04:28.770> using<00:04:28.800> here<00:04:29.370> is

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
course what we're gonna be using here is

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.310 
course what we're gonna be using here is
the<00:04:30.030> Mayo<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:31.199> coat<00:04:31.410> it<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.830> is<00:04:34.889> where<00:04:35.190> we

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
the Mayo to coat it so this is where we

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.540 
the Mayo to coat it so this is where we
put<00:04:37.320> all<00:04:37.349> in<00:04:37.650> here<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:37.949> you<00:04:38.099> might<00:04:38.310> want<00:04:38.520> to

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
put all in here and you might want to

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:39.860 
put all in here and you might want to
make<00:04:38.699> you<00:04:38.880> may<00:04:39.030> know<00:04:39.210> one<00:04:39.419> year<00:04:39.599> because<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
make you may know one year because the

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:41.899 
make you may know one year because the
thing<00:04:40.080> that<00:04:40.260> was<00:04:40.440> just<00:04:40.650> ah<00:04:41.159> sticking<00:04:41.610> up<00:04:41.699> all

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
thing that was just ah sticking up all

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.029 
thing that was just ah sticking up all
the<00:04:42.000> time<00:04:42.240> so<00:04:43.020> just<00:04:43.229> before<00:04:43.349> we<00:04:43.560> come<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.770> make

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:44.039 
the time so just before we come to make

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.159 
the time so just before we come to make
this<00:04:44.220> might<00:04:44.550> actually<00:04:44.760> may<00:04:45.659> have<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.900> little

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
this might actually may have a little

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.920 
this might actually may have a little
bit<00:04:46.289> more<00:04:46.409> water<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:47.520> start<00:04:47.760> backing<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.360> out<00:04:48.510> I

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
bit more water to start backing it out I

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.110 
bit more water to start backing it out I
mean<00:04:49.289> the<00:04:49.470> same<00:04:49.680> thing<00:04:50.070> you<00:04:50.460> can<00:04:50.729> do<00:04:50.909> it<00:04:50.940> by

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
mean the same thing you can do it by

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.779 
mean the same thing you can do it by
hand<00:04:51.419> you<00:04:51.570> can<00:04:51.659> use<00:04:51.810> a<00:04:51.960> spoon<00:04:52.320> Brown<00:04:53.190> works<00:04:53.550> for

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:53.789 
hand you can use a spoon Brown works for

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.089 
hand you can use a spoon Brown works for
you<00:04:53.940> but<00:04:54.750> this<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.020> actually<00:04:55.199> pretty<00:04:55.560> step<00:04:55.830> you

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
you but this is actually pretty step you

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.850 
you but this is actually pretty step you
take<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.699> now<00:04:57.419> what<00:04:57.930> really<00:04:58.080> loves<00:04:58.380> do<00:04:58.680> it<00:04:58.740> this

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
take so now what really loves do it this

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.879 
take so now what really loves do it this
way<00:04:59.180> and<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.840> course<00:05:01.020> you<00:05:01.199> ensure<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:01.740> get

way and of course you ensure you get
more<00:05:02.090> even<00:05:03.090> coverage<00:05:04.280> now<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.669> other<00:05:05.820> thing

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
more even coverage now the other thing

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.029 
more even coverage now the other thing
that<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.539> do<00:05:06.659> this<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.380> recipe<00:05:07.650> is

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:08.039 
that you can do this this recipe is

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:10.159 
that you can do this this recipe is
gorgeous<00:05:08.550> upon<00:05:08.909> itself<00:05:09.240> so<00:05:09.570> it<00:05:09.720> doesn't<00:05:10.050> need

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
gorgeous upon itself so it doesn't need

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.920 
gorgeous upon itself so it doesn't need
that<00:05:10.229> positions<00:05:10.979> but<00:05:11.250> if<00:05:11.340> you<00:05:11.430> wanted<00:05:11.849> to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
that positions but if you wanted to

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.360 
that positions but if you wanted to
there's<00:05:12.930> nothing<00:05:13.169> at<00:05:13.470> all<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.889> stop<00:05:14.099> to<00:05:14.280> you
