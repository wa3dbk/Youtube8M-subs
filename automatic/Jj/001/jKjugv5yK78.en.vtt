 then there are big big teams 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.920
 that we are going to tackle fast facts such as in 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.659
 famous aa pyro gen millenium this is it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.759
 it's really the big stables but 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.689
 after knowing that there are plenty 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.280
 others there is a little more 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.990
 oriented ps4 what am I going to tell you 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.749
 but there are as many even more 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.700
 maybe on xbox one so here we have 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:28.090
 the oxmoze the flights to the poles 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.429
 gaming 70 gaming arsenic valium ea 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.859
 sports what is I still not going 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:35.799
 forget them eureka gaming ko and six

 doors garret six doors utopia gaming he 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:41.619
 there are obviously online experiences 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:44.049
 lg dr hiss wears mga gaming overdose and 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.780
 so that's it I play the player I 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:48.460
 know, I'm taking all this head off 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.289
 knowing that this is not a list 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.819
 exhaustive and who has plenty of others 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.780
 that exists and that I do not have that I have not 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:54.399
 cited by the way I apologize 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 that's because I have a whole 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.969
 little head if I forgot them we're going 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.079
 talk about the structures you're going 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.280
 able to meet because there 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:01.689
 several teams in teams there are 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.490
 different structures in this case 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.920
 the first structure will be a little bit 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.479
 This will be a little unofficial bin 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.860
 who will not be legally represented 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.119
 it's just not the grouping 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.610
 friends of friends who have been playing for 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.370
 little moment 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.160
 who if that's your case I invite you to 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.270
 participate in tournaments like hugh 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.290
 laurie fort gay but years to see a 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.390
 little bit what you're worth 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.310
 it will allow to see your number 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.680
 then after your level for your 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.200
 number and apply well how tank 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.910
 roster in a team he wears here 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.560
 after you have found more 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.730
 in addition to the association law of 1901 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.820
 so it's just teams 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.740
 which are governed by the law of association 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.450
 1901 which allows among other things to have a 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.130
 president a treasurer etc 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.390
 who says treasurer who says he has a 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.709
 bank account a cash that so 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.450
 it just allows you 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.739
 to have sponsors that allows you to 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.270
 finance moors that allows you to 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.630
 fund equipment jerseys 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.670
 etc. 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.070
 so it's really interesting to be 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.390
 in a law association 1901 note 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.280
 that it's not because you're not 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.540
 years in the 1901 law association that 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.920
 the teams are not seriously 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.020
 more June it means nothing at all 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.300
 Finally, there are very good teams 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.150
 exist and who are not souloy 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.860
 association 1901 and then there exists 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.690
 last the last call that is really 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.250
 the professional structure but then 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.390
 there at this moment and I do not want to say of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.549
 nonsense but I think it's very 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.720
 very rare in France of head like that I 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.970
 think that there is that millennium that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.140
 are recognized who are registered in 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.030
 trade register which are a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.350
 company if you want it to be there so 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.000
 it's not the same thing at all 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.620
 so do not hesitate to correct me if I 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 say nonsense Thursday a little bit everything 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.890
 that of head and as I do not know no 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.700
 plus all the sporting medium parker must 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.320
 not hesitate to correct me 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.920
 that's it for the different structures 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.049
 which then exist this video 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.970
 obviously the panels dean I you in 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:43.290
 speak today because like you 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.560
 know it's been around for a while 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.380
 that the private servers are out 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.670
 finally go where does it come from now 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.290
 the competition will take another 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.370
 turn because it will reinvigorate the 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 competition it's going to be a lot more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.959
 easy to organize competitions 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.250
 to train and 3 to be on a more 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.510
 attractive because so far this 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.830
 which allowed us to do some 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.260
 compet it was just the way 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.250
 broadcasts 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.540
 diffuse branch that was the problem 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.890
 is that the mode diffuses when one is 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.500
 beginner is sometimes a little difficult 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.180
 because it is a lot of his braine 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.200
 share really does not give the wrong way 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.030
 diffuse so here it is not necessarily 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.590
 very dynamic very pleasant to watch 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.630
 so for the moment we will go into 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.380
 domination finally I say that it's not 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.000
 still done but there are big 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.230
 chances and I do not see why that does not 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.090
 would not go into domination since that 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.740
 currently works like that on pc 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.040
 so be high chances that the 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.470
 xbox console community one and ps4 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.210
 follow and layer on pc mode 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.250
 so it will be mainly from the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.810
 domination coming so his bike that is 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.330
 more dynamic that is more attractive 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.460
 to see and that's so I invite you to 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.290
 lead you into domination if for 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:49.130
 wash yourself red if you have not played 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.919
 no team are going for the moment 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.030
 the last thing is a little bit of 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.680
 questions we ask is regularly 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.840
 it's when you know nobody and 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.820
 that you do not dare it really does not take 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.650
 to be afraid ok there are plenty of equipped who 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.840
 are currently recruiting there really is a 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.250
 lack of players so do not hesitate 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.840
 so maybe you do not have the 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.890
 level 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.140
 I'm a player myself 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.789
 intermediate is average I am a young 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.669
 player and sport I do not necessarily have to 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.690
 personal high-performance title and that's it 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:16.229
 do not stop me from finding a team 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.810
 bis door 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:20.160
 it depends what the team expects from me 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.810
 I am rather a fun mode I do a 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.669
 little bit of competition I would like 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.750
 lan make a player but after that 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.950
 remains to be seen according to others 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.950
 levels I know I can not 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.120
 to have great pretensions either 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.650
 so you have to find a little 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.910
 team ea sports corresponding to you 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.470
 there is really everything there are young people 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.690
 carrick teams who want to recruit 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.130
 players not necessarily exceptional and 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.860
 after if you want to make millenium 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.030
 from the famous hymn of pyro gen yujia to that 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.960
 is going to be actually a lot more 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.060
 complicated because we are going to ask you 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.070
 to have good stats to be a good 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.570
 game of a good teammate and so it's 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.669
 here we are going to ask you to have 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.750
 experience then necessarily it's 

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.940
 difficult when we have never played 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.169
 so actually your ratio is going 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.300
 enter your number of points 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.320
 minutes will come into play when we go 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.580
 ask you to prove yourself 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.070
 know that when you integrate a 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.539
 general team usually the tradition 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.160
 is that you are tested during a 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:06.870
 week or two to see what you 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.740
 you want to accept 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:10.599
 after being tested it's not 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.940
 but it is something necessary 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.620
 it allows teams to see if their 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:15.699
 expectations are validated or not 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.039
 I hope I have given you all the 

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:19.720
 little info needed to make 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.750
 the competition is exporting I have not done 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.580
 I have not seen everything while the games I have 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.310
 not addressed the whole thing about 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.650
 the ispor dyed I am sorry do not hesitate 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.039
 not to send me messages on my on 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.599
 the channel on on my twitter account etc
