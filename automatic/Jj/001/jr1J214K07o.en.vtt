weekly wage butcher is 21,000 as well

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.920 
weekly wage butcher is 21,000 as well

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
and when you've got 18,000 taken away

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.140 
and when you've got 18,000 taken away
you're<00:01:25.110> left<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.680> two<00:01:26.130> three<00:01:26.460> thousand<00:01:27.000> bleh

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.679 
you're left with two three thousand bleh
and<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> it's<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:28.950> good<00:01:29.220> it's<00:01:29.640> not<00:01:29.909> easy<00:01:30.270> but

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and so it's not good it's not easy but

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.410 
and so it's not good it's not easy but
we're<00:01:30.869> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.470> anyway<00:01:32.420> i'm

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we're going to do it and anyway i'm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.450 
we're going to do it and anyway i'm
going<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> replay<00:01:33.810> non-professional<00:01:34.560> that's

going to replay non-professional that's

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.590 
going to replay non-professional that's
probably<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.210> quite<00:01:36.450> hard

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
