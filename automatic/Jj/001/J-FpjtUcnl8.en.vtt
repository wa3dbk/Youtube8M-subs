00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.480
 pistol round cortado inferno now 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.070
 let's consider the attack or 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.080
 I have n't played terrorists for about a year 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.980
 sandy level but looked 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.830
 many many different games friends and why 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 I personally came to your vaping for example 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.000
 I'm running the following diagram of a portion 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 my teammates send both the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 scared the bot kick him and start more precisely 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.370
 I continue accordingly that I 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.460
 it turned out to run on a banana 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 friends hold fast columns here 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 shoot the defense player who 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.449
 tried to go out the same principle 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.640
 shot with me so here not 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.680
 always worked but basically if you 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.360
 expect your opponent and do here 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.109
 such sharp fics, respectively, not 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 give 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.870
 player protection immediately tell you head 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.640
 you can immediately ruin it for him 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:10.130
 because you have a block, in principle, you can 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.720
 shoot almost stanzas almost 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.920
 on the run 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.960
 if no one can act 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.909
 further very often there is a player 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.240
 protection in such an interesting position 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.520
 breakwater outside the car 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.189
 non-standard in the gap and here here 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.990
 near the window, respectively, expect it 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.030
 because you can immediately get a headshot 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.640
 Well, if there is no one here right away 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
 some 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.409
 on the standard position the so-called 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.649
 with fire 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.539
 fate ahead of the curve well and all if you 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.490
 drove away what protection means 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.100
 most likely we have two players 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.780
 at least it is on the b plente possible 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 you can take your knife 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.979
 team mates check your team mates 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.939
 while doing the following things 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.979
 occupy carpets 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.069
 two players can bear two carpets 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.429
 players can stand close to home 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:04.039
 well and everything on 1 2 3 4 you approached that is 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:06.079
 how do i do again i say go out i 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.579
 immediately jump out take the left corner in 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.220
 this moment people take the right corner 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.569
 in general, this element is friends on the map 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.250
 inferno it is very important regardless of your 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:20.120
 weapons like pistol round 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.459
 whether it is a collage and the exit to the shooting when 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.170
 one immediately takes the left corner 1 right 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.329
 he is very effective the fact is that very 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.940
 often the players defense repel from 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.489
 ribs and the case here is an ambush of 2-3 people 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.410
 and this is an ambush 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:34.970
 extremely effective but also 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.450
 inefficient if it is a sheet and goes 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:41.150
 wisely whether the output under the flash drive whether 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.220
 without a flash drive is good because 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.109
 players can go blind but if they 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.450
 go blind then receive information and 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.560
 focus immediately on the center so 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.900
 fire exit 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.849
 also effective because you are players 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.579
 defenses don't always know at what point 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.829
 time you leave and accordingly you 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.109
 go out immediately take the left corner 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.419
 someone takes the right corner do the exchange 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.639
 respectively killed two three players 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:06.440
 on the center, but if two understand 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.690
 mean one of the big drives on board 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.400
 already being three of you and the two of you 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.650
 kill put a bomb playing 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:17.389
 round 2 in two or three in three well here already 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.280
 I understand the game on the exchange so to speak 

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:22.340
 the most important thing to be in 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:25.080
 counter-strike of this that concerns 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.640
 guns at the head 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.470
 generally can be just as well for rashit 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:33.050
 carpets friends it all depends on shooting and 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.430
 you understand the main audience 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.770
 probably some big stars 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.050
 little silver 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.000
 if you are a global elite, then of course our 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.530
 until you have a good idea because 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.390
 that they play good against you too 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.050
 guys who are ready to take rashi and 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.330
 which very cool shoots sus peaks 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.010
 there will be from here will be from here but from where 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.640
 I have already released wealth 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.150
 sacred pistol on the inferno closed 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.910
 but friends if the level is weak then you 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.280
 just meat can crush any point 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.500
 because these positions are 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:10.470
 minority of defense players i.e. one 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.330
 maximum two and these two are unlikely to fall 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 you immediately to the head so you just 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.799
 go make tequila make exchange 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.220
 occupy the main big sands on a and 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.480
 take a round as far as friends are still 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.970
 single pistol 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.510
 it is possible in principle to walk together on b 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:31.650
 again hold a b banana like me this 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.700
 did it himself further up to that of course 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.169
 your teammates should have bought 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.330
 any poppies 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:39.090
 Well, the standard signs on the flask on 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.900
 coil and in principle you can go in and 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.460
 take a round so could good it 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.070
 by the way could not the best because 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.070
 here the defense player may take this 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.260
 position and kill you in the side therefore 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.260
 always try to get clear 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.380
 Again, I already showed this make 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:03.380
 true inferno changed those times 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:05.780
 maybe worth updating so to speak 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:10.400
 make a new layer 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:12.200
 straighten died the exit coils died not the most 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.750
 the best but not the worst 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.280
 overlaps the church on while players 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.600
 which are on coils can 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.090
 still do your strength another 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.490
 hand it could be good when you already 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:25.100
 went to the pent go to the pent and exactly 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.080
 killed the guys so the man who 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.470
 Help this he accordingly will 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.780
 deactivated here is such a guy expensive 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.600
 friends guns on the map de inferno 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.240
 in principle, you can still sweat so 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.130
 seriously sweat and scatter for example 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:45.560
 The same Smokey in the car could under the smoking room and 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.169
 so on but the main rule of pistols 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:50.480
 probably remember that it is best to go 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.510
 after all meat by the majority on some 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:56.690
 point because defo will often do 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.210
 default and on default you are in five 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.640
 come for two three people 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.010
 respectively, your chances to do 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.110
 positive exchange is much more but 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.840
 due to this due to the following 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.450
 draw situation you can take 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.580
 round here was such a guide with you 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:17.260
 Arseny Senya put your fingers up 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.260
 thank you very much for watching
