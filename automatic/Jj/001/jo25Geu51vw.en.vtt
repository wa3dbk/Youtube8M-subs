00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
she's stretching in my opinion as well

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.610

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.319 
have chocolaty skin there you go look at
this<00:00:47.280> so<00:00:47.520> maybe<00:00:47.700> maybe<00:00:48.120> she<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> stretch<00:00:50.329> no

but I think what they're really making a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.500 
but I think what they're really making a
reference<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> fact<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> Naomi
