00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
in the middle like not right in the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.620 
in the middle like not right in the
middle<00:00:34.640> but<00:00:34.850> like<00:00:35.000> right<00:00:35.150> on<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.420> side<00:00:35.600> of

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
middle but like right on the side of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.960 
middle but like right on the side of
campus<00:00:36.140> so<00:00:36.470> if<00:00:37.100> we<00:00:37.280> wanted<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.670> get<00:00:37.730> to<00:00:37.850> the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
campus so if we wanted to get to the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.760 
campus so if we wanted to get to the
Union<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.420> maybe<00:00:38.690> takes<00:00:38.930> like<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.140> six<00:00:39.559> minute

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
Union it maybe takes like a six minute

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.270 
Union it maybe takes like a six minute
walk<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.460> is<00:00:40.640> right<00:00:40.850> across<00:00:41.030> campus<00:00:41.660> so<00:00:42.280> our

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
walk which is right across campus so our

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.860 
walk which is right across campus so our
far<00:00:43.550> this<00:00:43.730> class<00:00:43.940> would<00:00:44.120> probably<00:00:44.510> take<00:00:44.690> us

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
far this class would probably take us

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.750 
far this class would probably take us
about<00:00:45.050> like<00:00:45.200> eight<00:00:45.949> minutes<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.520> walk<00:00:46.670> there

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.140 

this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.420> part<00:02:23.840> of<00:02:23.960> the<00:02:24.110> house<00:02:24.290> too<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.150> there's

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
this is part of the house too so there's

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.120 
this is part of the house too so there's
different<00:02:26.330> Suites<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:27.110> are<00:02:27.230> attached<00:02:27.530> to

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
different Suites that are attached to

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.570 
different Suites that are attached to
this<00:02:28.280> common<00:02:28.700> area<00:02:28.850> and<00:02:29.800> then<00:02:30.800> are<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.070> houses

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
this common area and then are the houses

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.180 
this common area and then are the houses
co-ed<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:32.690> how<00:02:32.840> does<00:02:33.020> that<00:02:33.050> work<00:02:33.260> I<00:02:33.770> mean<00:02:34.070> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
co-ed or how does that work I mean the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.400 
co-ed or how does that work I mean the
houses<00:02:34.550> each<00:02:34.760> suite<00:02:35.180> is<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.570> gender<00:02:36.290> specific

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
houses each suite is a gender specific

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.680 
houses each suite is a gender specific
so<00:02:37.130> they'll<00:02:37.310> be<00:02:37.460> an<00:02:37.520> all-girl<00:02:37.970> room<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:38.390> then

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
so they'll be an all-girl room and then

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.150 
so they'll be an all-girl room and then
