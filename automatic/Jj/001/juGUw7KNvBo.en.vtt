the twos well it's a question that many

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.960 
the twos well it's a question that many
of<00:00:03.870> us<00:00:04.230> may<00:00:04.290> be<00:00:04.620> asking<00:00:05.220> why<00:00:05.400> does<00:00:05.580> some<00:00:05.730> people

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
of us may be asking why does some people

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.120 
of us may be asking why does some people
become<00:00:06.120> overweight<00:00:06.870> and<00:00:07.080> others<00:00:07.379> remain<00:00:07.799> thin

and<00:00:08.400> they<00:00:08.490> eat<00:00:08.639> basically<00:00:09.150> the<00:00:09.240> same<00:00:09.389> thing<00:00:09.660> we

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
and they eat basically the same thing we

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.810 
and they eat basically the same thing we
may<00:00:10.469> have<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.710> few<00:00:10.950> answers<00:00:11.130> for<00:00:11.519> you<00:00:11.670> this

give<00:00:26.340> us<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> basics<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.269> why<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.900> why<00:00:28.140> we

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
give us the basics of why we can why we

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.779 
give us the basics of why we can why we
get<00:00:28.410> fat<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:28.980> we<00:00:29.070> can<00:00:29.220> do<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.699> well

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
get fat and what we can do about it well

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.429 
get fat and what we can do about it well
the<00:00:29.849> basics<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.019> is<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> point

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the basics of this and this is the point

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.530 
the basics of this and this is the point
I<00:00:31.560> make<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.890> book<00:00:32.070> we<00:00:32.189> don't<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.460> fat<00:00:32.700> even

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
I make in the book we don't get fat even

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060 
I make in the book we don't get fat even
though<00:00:33.630> it<00:00:33.719> seems<00:00:34.020> obvious<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.710> idea<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
though it seems obvious this idea that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.560 
though it seems obvious this idea that
we<00:00:35.190> eat<00:00:35.309> too<00:00:35.430> much<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:35.820> exercise<00:00:36.270> too

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we eat too much and we exercise too

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.049 
we eat too much and we exercise too
little<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.410> actually<00:00:37.890> nonsensical<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
little it's actually nonsensical and I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.360 
little it's actually nonsensical and I
explain<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.719> great<00:00:39.989> depth<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.590> what

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
explain that in great depth and what

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.740 
explain that in great depth and what
really<00:00:41.550> happens<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.390> theory<00:00:42.719> that

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
really happens this is a theory that

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.900 
really happens this is a theory that
pre-world<00:00:43.440> War<00:00:43.620> two<00:00:43.770> Europeans<00:00:44.340> had<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.820> it's

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
pre-world War two Europeans had and it's

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.569 
pre-world War two Europeans had and it's
almost<00:00:45.450> assuredly<00:00:45.930> true<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.890> get<00:00:47.010> fat<00:00:47.250> because

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
almost assuredly true we get fat because

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.150 
almost assuredly true we get fat because
certain<00:00:47.910> foods<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.570> our<00:00:48.660> diet<00:00:48.719> dis<00:00:49.680> regulate

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
certain foods in our diet dis regulate

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
certain foods in our diet dis regulate
our<00:00:50.309> fat<00:00:50.520> tissue<00:00:50.550> they<00:00:51.059> basically<00:00:51.360> make<00:00:51.809> us

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
our fat tissue they basically make us

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.680 
our fat tissue they basically make us
secrete<00:00:52.320> hormones<00:00:52.789> insulin<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:54.090> particular

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
secrete hormones insulin in particular

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.439 
secrete hormones insulin in particular
and<00:00:54.899> insulin<00:00:55.590> stores<00:00:55.920> calories<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.760> fat<00:00:57.059> and

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and insulin stores calories is fat and

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
and insulin stores calories is fat and
so<00:00:58.199> some<00:00:58.440> foods<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:58.949> literally<00:00:59.460> fattening

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so some foods are literally fattening

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
so some foods are literally fattening
whatever<00:01:00.750> those<00:01:00.899> aren't<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.410> unfortunately

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
whatever those aren't and unfortunately

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
whatever those aren't and unfortunately
again<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.670> an<00:01:02.789> old<00:01:02.969> story<00:01:03.329> they're<00:01:03.539> there

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
again it's an old story they're there

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.780 
again it's an old story they're there
the<00:01:04.019> carbohydrates<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.070> eat<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> bread

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the carbohydrates that we eat that bread

sweets has send sodas and fruit juices

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.410 
sweets has send sodas and fruit juices
and<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:14.130> know<00:01:14.220> 20<00:01:14.520> foods<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.909> my<00:01:15.060> mother's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
and you know 20 foods that my mother's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.060 
and you know 20 foods that my mother's
generation<00:01:16.080> grew<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.380> believing<00:01:16.560> we're

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
generation grew up believing we're

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.620 
generation grew up believing we're
fattening<00:01:17.549> mm-hmm<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> actually

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
fattening mm-hmm and if you actually

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.420 
fattening mm-hmm and if you actually
look<00:01:18.810> at<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.200> underlying<00:01:19.530> science<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
look at the underlying science the

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.060 
look at the underlying science the
biochemistry<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> hormone<00:01:22.170> hormonal

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
biochemistry and the hormone hormonal

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.590 
biochemistry and the hormone hormonal
regulation<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.670> fat<00:01:23.820> tissue<00:01:24.000> they<00:01:24.420> are

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
regulation of fat tissue they are

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
regulation of fat tissue they are
fattening<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.860> what<00:01:26.159> could<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.369> eat<00:01:26.640> that

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
fattening so what could we eat that

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.730 
fattening so what could we eat that
would<00:01:27.000> help<00:01:27.240> alleviate<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:27.990> problem<00:01:28.200> well

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
would help alleviate this problem well

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.200 
would help alleviate this problem well
this<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> thing<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.670> mean<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:29.970> rid<00:01:30.180> of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
this is the thing I mean you get rid of

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.660 
this is the thing I mean you get rid of
the<00:01:30.509> base<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.350> food<00:01:31.530> guide<00:01:31.829> pyramid<00:01:31.860> which

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the base of the food guide pyramid which

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.539 
the base of the food guide pyramid which
is<00:01:32.850> what's<00:01:33.060> making<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.659> fat<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:35.220> end<00:01:35.400> up

fattening<00:03:22.320> carbohydrate<00:03:22.620> okay<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.489> when<00:03:23.790> you

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
fattening carbohydrate okay so when you

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.000 
fattening carbohydrate okay so when you
I'm<00:03:24.150> certain<00:03:24.450> you're<00:03:25.140> into<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:25.470> science<00:03:25.860> of

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
I'm certain you're into the science of

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.680 
I'm certain you're into the science of
this<00:03:26.130> did<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.550> believe<00:03:26.880> did<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.209> know<00:03:27.450> this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
this did you believe did you know this

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.890 
this did you believe did you know this
before<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.140> started<00:03:28.530> no<00:03:29.600> I<00:03:30.600> started

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
before you started no I started

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.509 
before you started no I started
researching<00:03:31.560> this<00:03:31.860> I<00:03:32.040> was<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.190> hardcore

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
researching this I was a hardcore

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.280 
researching this I was a hardcore
science<00:03:32.970> right<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.390> wrote<00:03:33.630> about<00:03:33.720> high<00:03:33.989> energy

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
science right I wrote about high energy

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.590 
science right I wrote about high energy
physics<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.010> nuclear<00:03:35.100> engineering<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:36.150> got

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
physics and nuclear engineering I got

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.810 
physics and nuclear engineering I got
into<00:03:36.810> public<00:03:37.140> health<00:03:37.290> in<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.620> early<00:03:38.340> 90s

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
into public health in the early 90s

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.430 
into public health in the early 90s
because<00:03:39.090> some<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.360> my<00:03:39.480> physics<00:03:39.930> friends<00:03:40.260> said

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
because some of my physics friends said

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.900 
because some of my physics friends said
you<00:03:40.470> should<00:03:40.709> see<00:03:40.739> how<00:03:40.890> bad<00:03:41.130> the<00:03:41.280> science<00:03:41.700> is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you should see how bad the science is

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.910 
you should see how bad the science is
there<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.300> fascinating<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.350> I've<00:03:43.769> just

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
there it's fascinating and I've just

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.710 
there it's fascinating and I've just
been<00:03:44.070> winding<00:03:44.550> my<00:03:44.670> way<00:03:44.850> through<00:03:45.209> it<00:03:45.390> and<00:03:45.510> for

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
been winding my way through it and for

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
been winding my way through it and for
the<00:03:45.810> past<00:03:46.019> 10<00:03:46.260> years<00:03:46.290> I've<00:03:46.680> been<00:03:46.709> working<00:03:47.160> on

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
the past 10 years I've been working on

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.160 
the past 10 years I've been working on
this<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.610> I<00:03:47.640> had<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.880> opportunity<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:49.019> do

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
this and I had the opportunity to do

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.500 
this and I had the opportunity to do
more<00:03:49.410> research<00:03:49.820> probably<00:03:50.820> than<00:03:51.000> anyone<00:03:51.390> alive

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
more research probably than anyone alive

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.580 
more research probably than anyone alive
Wow

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
Wow

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.560 
Wow
and<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.400> do<00:03:53.580> that<00:03:53.730> research<00:03:54.180> when<00:03:54.480> you

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
and when you do that research when you

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.870 
and when you do that research when you
find<00:03:54.810> out<00:03:55.050> is<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.950> actually<00:03:56.340> solved<00:03:56.790> the

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
find out is that we actually solved the

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.810 
find out is that we actually solved the
obesity<00:03:57.180> problem<00:03:57.450> of<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:57.989> 1960s<00:03:58.860> by<00:03:59.459> cutting

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
obesity problem of the 1960s by cutting

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.880 
obesity problem of the 1960s by cutting
out<00:03:59.910> that<00:03:59.940> they<00:04:00.269> said<00:04:00.720> those<00:04:00.900> carbs<00:04:01.350> were<00:04:01.590> fat

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:01.890 
out that they said those carbs were fat

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.220 
out that they said those carbs were fat
by<00:04:02.070> establishing<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:02.940> know<00:04:03.000> what<00:04:03.230> regulates

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
by establishing you know what regulates

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.800 
by establishing you know what regulates
our<00:04:04.500> fat<00:04:04.769> tissue<00:04:04.970> you<00:04:05.970> know<00:04:06.090> which<00:04:06.269> hormones

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
our fat tissue you know which hormones

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.390 
our fat tissue you know which hormones
and<00:04:07.019> enzymes<00:04:07.140> regular<00:04:07.739> and<00:04:07.830> when<00:04:07.920> you<00:04:08.010> look<00:04:08.250> at

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
and enzymes regular and when you look at

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.170 
and enzymes regular and when you look at
that<00:04:08.700> alone

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
that alone

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.940 
that alone
you<00:04:09.269> realize<00:04:09.659> it's<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> carbohydrates<00:04:10.799> but

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
you realize it's the carbohydrates but

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.979 
you realize it's the carbohydrates but
the<00:04:11.040> problem<00:04:11.370> is<00:04:11.519> people<00:04:11.700> like<00:04:12.269> Atkins<00:04:12.750> read

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
the problem is people like Atkins read

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.249 
the problem is people like Atkins read
this<00:04:13.140> research<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.069> started<00:04:14.730> recommending

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:15.259 
this research and started recommending

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:18.170 
this research and started recommending
low-carb<00:04:16.259> diets<00:04:16.680> which<00:04:16.859> are<00:04:17.009> high<00:04:17.220> in<00:04:17.400> fat<00:04:17.729> and

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
low-carb diets which are high in fat and

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.479 
low-carb diets which are high in fat and
we<00:04:19.019> became<00:04:19.470> to<00:04:19.650> believe<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:19.979> fat<00:04:20.190> caused

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
we became to believe that fat caused

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.090 
we became to believe that fat caused
heart<00:04:20.579> disease<00:04:20.789> it<00:04:21.150> doesn't<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:22.410> science<00:04:22.889> is

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
heart disease it doesn't that science is

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.770 
heart disease it doesn't that science is
terrible<00:04:23.610> yeah<00:04:23.759> I<00:04:23.820> read<00:04:24.060> about<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.479> in<00:04:24.539> here

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
terrible yeah I read about that in here

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.710 
terrible yeah I read about that in here
