00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:32.249 
just shown you in diminished licks a B C
and<00:06:29.859> D<00:06:29.979> ascending<00:06:30.699> and<00:06:30.909> descending<00:06:31.169> can<00:06:32.169> be

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
and D ascending and descending can be

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:34.859 
and D ascending and descending can be
applied<00:06:32.529> to<00:06:32.559> other<00:06:32.769> scales<00:06:33.519> as<00:06:33.789> well<00:06:33.969> you<00:06:34.749> know

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:34.869 
applied to other scales as well you know

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:39.119 
applied to other scales as well you know
it's<00:06:35.079> the<00:06:35.139> same<00:06:35.439> little<00:06:35.679> note<00:06:36.099> pad<00:06:38.039> but<00:06:39.039> I'll

00:06:39.119 --> 00:06:39.129 
it's the same little note pad but I'll

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.389 
it's the same little note pad but I'll
show<00:06:39.369> ya<00:06:39.639> a<00:06:39.939> harmonic<00:06:40.569> minor<00:06:40.809> version<00:06:41.469> of<00:06:41.649> it's

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.399 
show ya a harmonic minor version of it's

00:06:42.399 --> 00:07:01.999 
show ya a harmonic minor version of it's
like<00:06:42.610> this<00:06:57.089> little<00:06:58.089> faster<00:06:58.629> a<00:06:58.809> lot<00:06:59.110> faster

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:03.299 

alright

00:07:03.299 --> 00:07:03.309 
alright

00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:08.369 
alright
that's<00:07:04.149> the<00:07:04.329> ascending<00:07:04.899> harmonic<00:07:05.859> minor<00:07:07.379> I'll

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:08.379 
that's the ascending harmonic minor I'll

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:10.589 
that's the ascending harmonic minor I'll
show<00:07:08.559> you<00:07:08.619> a<00:07:08.739> descending<00:07:09.399> run<00:07:09.669> you<00:07:09.849> can<00:07:10.059> use

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
show you a descending run you can use

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:13.859 
show you a descending run you can use
with<00:07:10.899> the<00:07:11.309> the<00:07:12.309> ascending<00:07:13.119> run<00:07:13.329> but<00:07:13.539> I'm<00:07:13.689> you

00:07:13.859 --> 00:07:13.869 
with the the ascending run but I'm you

00:07:13.869 --> 00:07:15.689 
with the the ascending run but I'm you
can<00:07:14.049> make<00:07:14.169> up<00:07:14.319> your<00:07:14.349> own<00:07:14.499> you<00:07:14.709> know<00:07:14.829> let's<00:07:14.949> you

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
can make up your own you know let's you

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:16.979 
can make up your own you know let's you
should<00:07:15.909> get<00:07:16.119> the<00:07:16.239> drift<00:07:16.509> now<00:07:16.689> what<00:07:16.899> I'm

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:16.989 
should get the drift now what I'm

00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:19.739 
should get the drift now what I'm
talking<00:07:17.349> about<00:07:17.409> here<00:07:17.709> so<00:07:18.119> the<00:07:19.119> descending<00:07:19.569> one

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:19.749 
talking about here so the descending one

00:07:19.749 --> 00:07:21.370 
talking about here so the descending one
I<00:07:19.899> have<00:07:20.139> for<00:07:20.409> years<00:07:20.589> like<00:07:20.769> this

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:21.380 
I have for years like this

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.790 
I have for years like this
[Music]

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
[Music]

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:32.109 
[Music]
okay<00:07:24.800> I'll<00:07:25.580> play<00:07:25.729> it<00:07:25.819> a<00:07:25.879> little<00:07:26.029> slower<00:07:31.119> once

00:07:32.109 --> 00:07:32.119 
okay I'll play it a little slower once

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:33.189 
okay I'll play it a little slower once
again<00:07:32.209> it's<00:07:32.449> one<00:07:32.569> of<00:07:32.629> those<00:07:32.719> one<00:07:32.869> it's<00:07:33.020> kind<00:07:33.169> of

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 
again it's one of those one it's kind of

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.899 
again it's one of those one it's kind of
hard<00:07:33.379> for<00:07:33.499> me<00:07:33.559> to<00:07:33.649> play<00:07:33.830> really<00:07:34.159> slow<00:07:34.459> it's

00:07:34.899 --> 00:07:34.909 
hard for me to play really slow it's

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:37.419 
hard for me to play really slow it's
easier<00:07:35.209> fast<00:07:35.479> I<00:07:35.809> get<00:07:36.199> confused<00:07:36.679> and<00:07:36.949> lost<00:07:37.129> and

00:07:37.419 --> 00:07:37.429 
easier fast I get confused and lost and

00:07:37.429 --> 00:07:38.799 
easier fast I get confused and lost and
don't<00:07:37.520> know<00:07:37.699> what<00:07:37.849> I'm<00:07:37.999> doing<00:07:38.419> when<00:07:38.569> I<00:07:38.629> play

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:38.809 
don't know what I'm doing when I play

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:52.570 
don't know what I'm doing when I play
slow<00:07:39.110> I'll<00:07:39.830> try<00:07:40.129> for<00:07:40.159> you<00:07:40.520> here<00:07:40.939> we<00:07:41.029> go<00:07:51.580> there

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:52.580 
slow I'll try for you here we go there

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:54.129 
slow I'll try for you here we go there
you<00:07:52.699> go<00:07:52.879> probably<00:07:53.389> a<00:07:53.509> little<00:07:53.659> different<00:07:54.050> than

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:54.139 
you go probably a little different than

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.419 
you go probably a little different than
the<00:07:54.199> first<00:07:54.439> one<00:07:54.559> I<00:07:54.649> played<00:07:54.709> once<00:07:55.219> again

00:07:55.419 --> 00:07:55.429 
the first one I played once again

00:07:55.429 --> 00:07:57.459 
the first one I played once again
playing<00:07:55.639> it<00:07:55.789> slow<00:07:55.999> tougher<00:07:56.659> every<00:07:56.779> bet<00:07:56.899> you

00:07:57.459 --> 00:07:57.469 
playing it slow tougher every bet you

00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:59.170 
playing it slow tougher every bet you
know<00:07:57.559> you<00:07:57.649> could<00:07:57.860> mix<00:07:58.490> it<00:07:58.669> up<00:07:58.789> any<00:07:58.999> way<00:07:59.149> you

00:07:59.170 --> 00:07:59.180 
know you could mix it up any way you

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:06.070 
know you could mix it up any way you
want<00:07:59.300> just<00:08:01.809> slide<00:08:02.809> do<00:08:03.469> whatever<00:08:03.740> and<00:08:04.990> tear<00:08:05.990> it

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.080 
want just slide do whatever and tear it

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.529 
want just slide do whatever and tear it
up<00:08:06.199> you<00:08:06.409> know
