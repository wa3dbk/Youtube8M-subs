the descent of chapman's peak goes from

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.379 
the descent of chapman's peak goes from
the<00:00:02.480> 33.7<00:00:03.480> km/h<00:00:05.569> 38.2<00:00:06.569> km/h<00:00:08.000> idle<00:00:09.000> length<00:00:09.179> of

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
the 33.7 km/h 38.2 km/h idle length of

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.540 
the 33.7 km/h 38.2 km/h idle length of
roughly<00:00:09.690> 5<00:00:09.990> kilometers<00:00:10.679> I'm<00:00:11.340> gonna

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
roughly 5 kilometers I'm gonna

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.669 
roughly 5 kilometers I'm gonna
fast-forward<00:00:12.000> through<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.929> first<00:00:13.170> 3<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.620> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
fast-forward through the first 3 and a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.289 
fast-forward through the first 3 and a
half<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.040> those<00:00:14.190> kilometers<00:00:14.790> because<00:00:15.000> there's

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
half of those kilometers because there's

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.870 
half of those kilometers because there's
really<00:00:15.450> not<00:00:15.660> too<00:00:15.719> much<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.410> say<00:00:16.619> yeah<00:00:16.890> it's<00:00:17.670> at

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
really not too much to say yeah it's at

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.269 
really not too much to say yeah it's at
the<00:00:18.000> bottom<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> final<00:00:19.289> K<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:20.039> gets

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the bottom in the final K but gets

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.769 
the bottom in the final K but gets
especially<00:00:20.520> steep<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.270> so<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.539> where<00:00:21.689> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
especially steep and so that's where the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.320 
especially steep and so that's where the
important<00:00:22.289> parts<00:00:22.590> will<00:00:22.769> come<00:00:23.000> that's<00:00:24.000> not<00:00:24.210> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
important parts will come that's not to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.849 
important parts will come that's not to
say<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> what<00:00:24.810> you're<00:00:24.990> watching<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.680> not

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
say that what you're watching now is not

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.800 
say that what you're watching now is not
important<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:27.000> there<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.510> real

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
important because there is this real

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.169 
important because there is this real
temptation<00:00:28.349> perhaps<00:00:28.920> spurred<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:29.880> by<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
temptation perhaps spurred on by the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.880 
temptation perhaps spurred on by the
view<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> amazing<00:00:31.230> scenery<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
view and the amazing scenery and the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.500 
view and the amazing scenery and the
fact<00:00:32.160> that<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.399> gradient<00:00:32.669> has<00:00:33.000> changed<00:00:33.420> from

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
fact that the gradient has changed from

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.319 
fact that the gradient has changed from
up<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.960> down<00:00:34.010> that<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.160> will<00:00:35.340> charge<00:00:35.760> down<00:00:36.030> on

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
up to down that you will charge down on

up to down that you will charge down on
into<00:00:36.660> heart<00:00:36.870> bear<00:00:37.110> my<00:00:38.070> suggestion<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
into heart bear my suggestion here is

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.630 
into heart bear my suggestion here is
that<00:00:39.090> if<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> feel<00:00:39.570> good<00:00:39.840> you<00:00:40.230> hold<00:00:40.500> back<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
that if you feel good you hold back that

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.479 
that if you feel good you hold back that
feeling<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.270> often<00:00:42.899> artificial<00:00:43.559> created<00:00:44.340> by

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
feeling is often artificial created by

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.880 
feeling is often artificial created by
all<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.940> factors<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.690> mentioned<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.350> you

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
all the factors I just mentioned and you

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.619 
all the factors I just mentioned and you
can<00:00:47.039> easily<00:00:47.250> pound<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.879> energy<00:00:48.210> out<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.390> your

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
can easily pound the energy out of your

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.260 
can easily pound the energy out of your
legs<00:00:48.840> if<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.110> go<00:00:49.469> too<00:00:49.530> fast<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:51.030> therefore

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
legs if you go too fast it's therefore

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.500 
legs if you go too fast it's therefore
much<00:00:51.629> better<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.320> conservative<00:00:52.770> here

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
much better to be conservative here

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
much better to be conservative here
conservative<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.809> point<00:00:55.110> I'd<00:00:55.410> say<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
conservative to the point I'd say that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.979 
conservative to the point I'd say that
whatever<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.730> goal<00:00:56.940> pace<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.780> race

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
whatever your goal pace is for the race

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.020 
whatever your goal pace is for the race
should<00:00:58.260> also<00:00:58.469> be<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.980> target<00:00:59.250> pace<00:00:59.609> on<00:00:59.910> these

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
should also be your target pace on these

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.790 
should also be your target pace on these
first<00:01:00.359> three<00:01:00.660> or<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.930> kilometers<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
first three or so kilometers of the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
first three or so kilometers of the
descent<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:03.030> other<00:01:03.180> words<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.600> planned<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
descent in other words if you planned to

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.770 
descent in other words if you planned to
run<00:01:04.260> six<00:01:04.830> minutes<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.280> kilometer<00:01:05.820> overall<00:01:06.270> then

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
run six minutes a kilometer overall then

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.539 
run six minutes a kilometer overall then
this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.140> not<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.500> time<00:01:07.710> to<00:01:07.740> charge<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.400> at

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
this is not the time to charge down at

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.480 
this is not the time to charge down at
5:20<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.780> rather<00:01:09.990> aim<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.500> run<00:01:10.680> fairly<00:01:11.100> close

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
5:20 but rather aim to run fairly close

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
5:20 but rather aim to run fairly close
to<00:01:11.729> 6<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.270> realize<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.350> is<00:01:13.530> quite

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
to 6 I realize this is quite

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
to 6 I realize this is quite
conservative<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.090> think<00:01:15.360> you're<00:01:15.479> better

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
conservative but I think you're better

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.749 
conservative but I think you're better
off<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.350> rein<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:16.860> here<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.340> protect

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
off if you rein it in here and protect

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.330 
off if you rein it in here and protect
those<00:01:17.939> legs<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.720> come<00:01:19.409> Constantia<00:01:20.130> mink

you'll be grateful the section can also

be exposed to the wind and just be

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
line down towards heart bear it's only

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.080 
line down towards heart bear it's only
once<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.740> are<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.159> payment<00:01:32.579> stations

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
once you are with the payment stations

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.090 
once you are with the payment stations
with<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.780> over<00:01:34.049> one<00:01:34.200> kilometer<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.770> go<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
with just over one kilometer to go to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.460 
with just over one kilometer to go to
the<00:01:35.310> bottom<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.270> starts<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> become<00:01:36.930> even

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the bottom that it starts to become even

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.140 
the bottom that it starts to become even
more<00:01:37.500> important<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.310> manage<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.759> efforts

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.420 

so<00:01:43.080> here<00:01:43.260> we<00:01:43.380> are<00:01:43.410> just<00:01:43.800> after<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.280> pay

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
so here we are just after the pay

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
so here we are just after the pay
station<00:01:44.730> and<00:01:45.120> I'm<00:01:45.210> gonna<00:01:45.300> slow<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.660> down<00:01:45.810> to

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
station and I'm gonna slow it down to

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.810 
station and I'm gonna slow it down to
normal<00:01:46.590> speed<00:01:46.830> again<00:01:47.190> because<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.640> is<00:01:47.700> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
normal speed again because this is a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.280 
normal speed again because this is a
really<00:01:48.240> important<00:01:48.720> part<00:01:48.870> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> race

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
really important part of the race

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.960 
really important part of the race
because<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.190> road<00:01:50.340> does<00:01:50.580> get<00:01:50.790> quite

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
because the road does get quite

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.420 
because the road does get quite
significantly<00:01:51.690> steeper<00:01:52.200> downhill<00:01:52.680> that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
significantly steeper downhill that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.760 
significantly steeper downhill that
steep<00:01:53.820> section<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.570> begins<00:01:55.020> on<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
steep section really begins on this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.100 
steep section really begins on this
concrete<00:01:56.190> part<00:01:56.580> of<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.850> red<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.300> I<00:01:57.570> apologize

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
concrete part of the red and I apologize

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.530 
concrete part of the red and I apologize
for<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> sudden<00:01:58.620> camera<00:01:59.070> shake<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
for the sudden camera shake so this

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.150 
for the sudden camera shake so this
might<00:02:00.720> only<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.050> about<00:02:01.290> one<00:02:01.530> kilometer<00:02:02.100> of

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
might only be about one kilometer of

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.620 
might only be about one kilometer of
descent<00:02:02.610> but<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.970> reason<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.330> can<00:02:03.360> be

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
descent but the reason it can be

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.960 
descent but the reason it can be
make-or-break<00:02:04.050> is<00:02:04.590> because<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.520> let<00:02:05.700> go

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:05.970 
make-or-break is because if you let go

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.930 
make-or-break is because if you let go
too<00:02:06.240> much<00:02:06.480> here<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.990> go<00:02:07.320> too<00:02:07.380> quickly<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.700> kind

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
too much here and go too quickly it kind

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.700 
too much here and go too quickly it kind
of<00:02:09.000> implications<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:09.990> you'll<00:02:10.140> only<00:02:10.290> really

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
of implications that you'll only really

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.470 
of implications that you'll only really
feel<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.070> about<00:02:11.280> seven<00:02:11.610> or<00:02:11.700> eight<00:02:11.730> kilometers

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
feel in about seven or eight kilometers

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.240 
feel in about seven or eight kilometers
when<00:02:13.080> you<00:02:13.200> suddenly<00:02:13.410> find<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.160> have

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
when you suddenly find that you have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.940 
when you suddenly find that you have
empty<00:02:14.610> legs<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.030> Constantia<00:02:15.570> neck<00:02:15.950> again

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
empty legs and Constantia neck again

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.800 
empty legs and Constantia neck again
that's<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.340> say<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.330> first<00:02:18.600> three

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
that's not to say that the first three

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.780 
that's not to say that the first three
kilometers<00:02:19.440> of<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.680> Chapmans<00:02:20.100> descent<00:02:20.490> can't

kilometers of the Chapmans descent can't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.240 
kilometers of the Chapmans descent can't
see<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.120> same<00:02:21.360> thing<00:02:21.660> happen<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.140> I<00:02:22.170> said<00:02:22.620> but

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
see the same thing happen as I said but

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.410 
see the same thing happen as I said but
now<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.580> you've<00:02:23.730> recovered<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.360> your

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
now that you've recovered from your

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.020 
now that you've recovered from your
exertions<00:02:24.990> on<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> climb<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.950> because<00:02:26.910> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
exertions on the climb and because the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
exertions on the climb and because the
road<00:02:27.210> suddenly<00:02:27.630> drops<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:28.110> it's<00:02:28.620> very<00:02:28.710> easy

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
road suddenly drops down it's very easy

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
road suddenly drops down it's very easy
to<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.550> pulled<00:02:29.850> along<00:02:30.150> by<00:02:30.180> gravity<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.870> other

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
to get pulled along by gravity and other

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.450 
to get pulled along by gravity and other
runners<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.540> fact<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.810> suspect<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.190> lot<00:02:35.220> of

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
runners in fact I suspect that a lot of

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.340 
runners in fact I suspect that a lot of
people<00:02:35.790> who<00:02:35.910> fail<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.240> achieve<00:02:36.480> their<00:02:36.960> target

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
people who fail to achieve their target

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.590 
people who fail to achieve their target
time<00:02:37.560> who<00:02:37.830> unfortunately<00:02:38.130> have<00:02:38.670> bad<00:02:38.940> days<00:02:39.210> do

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
time who unfortunately have bad days do

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.660 
time who unfortunately have bad days do
so<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> what<00:02:40.800> happens<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.310> this<00:02:41.400> ten

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
so because of what happens in this ten

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.970 
so because of what happens in this ten
to<00:02:41.880> fifteen<00:02:42.270> minute<00:02:42.540> period<00:02:42.980> particularly

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to fifteen minute period particularly

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
to fifteen minute period particularly
this<00:02:44.130> final<00:02:44.580> five<00:02:44.820> minutes<00:02:45.210> they<00:02:46.110> may<00:02:46.290> look

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
this final five minutes they may look

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.590 
this final five minutes they may look
back<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.950> identify<00:02:47.120> Constantia<00:02:48.120> neck<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.480> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
back and identify Constantia neck as the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.600 
back and identify Constantia neck as the
moment<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.050> they<00:02:49.140> lost<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.560> pace<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.489> it

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
moment where they lost the pace but it

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.370 
moment where they lost the pace but it
could<00:02:50.730> equally<00:02:51.180> be<00:02:51.330> this<00:02:51.570> section<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:52.020> cost

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
could equally be this section that cost

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.710 
could equally be this section that cost
them<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.680> leg<00:02:52.830> strength<00:02:53.100> for<00:02:53.370> that<00:02:53.489> climb<00:02:53.790> it

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
them the leg strength for that climb it

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.420 
them the leg strength for that climb it
does<00:02:54.959> get<00:02:55.170> around<00:02:55.410> seven<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.070> nine<00:02:56.220> percent

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
does get around seven to nine percent

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.940 
does get around seven to nine percent
here<00:02:56.880> and<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.270> times<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:58.350> is<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.650> kind<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
here and at times it is that kind of

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.080 
here and at times it is that kind of
steepness<00:02:59.250> where<00:02:59.640> you<00:02:59.730> find<00:02:59.970> yourself

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
steepness where you find yourself

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.030 
steepness where you find yourself
leaning<00:03:00.630> backwards<00:03:01.110> just<00:03:01.320> to<00:03:01.410> control<00:03:01.860> your

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
leaning backwards just to control your

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.460 
leaning backwards just to control your
speed<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:03.270> obviously<00:03:03.630> puts<00:03:03.840> great<00:03:04.050> strain

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
speed that obviously puts great strain

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.960 
speed that obviously puts great strain
on<00:03:04.650> your<00:03:04.739> quads<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.370> they'll<00:03:05.489> talk<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.790> you

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
on your quads and they'll talk to you

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.300 
on your quads and they'll talk to you
later<00:03:06.209> if<00:03:06.390> you're<00:03:06.540> not<00:03:06.630> careful<00:03:06.890> so<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:08.010> advice

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
later if you're not careful so my advice

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.650 
later if you're not careful so my advice
here<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:08.760> same<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.360> early<00:03:09.630> part

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
here is the same as for the early part

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.570 
here is the same as for the early part
of<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.050> descent<00:03:10.380> if<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:10.680> feel<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.100> flying

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
of the descent if you feel like flying

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.270 
of the descent if you feel like flying
don't<00:03:11.900> rather<00:03:12.900> lose<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> few<00:03:13.500> seconds<00:03:13.980> here<00:03:14.190> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
don't rather lose a few seconds here and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.060 
don't rather lose a few seconds here and
gain<00:03:14.790> them<00:03:14.970> back<00:03:15.120> later<00:03:15.440> also<00:03:16.440> try<00:03:16.770> not<00:03:16.800> to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
gain them back later also try not to

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.590 
gain them back later also try not to
lean<00:03:17.190> back<00:03:17.430> two<00:03:17.730> months<00:03:18.030> because<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.360> that

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
lean back two months because of that

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.780 
lean back two months because of that
braking<00:03:19.110> effect<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:20.100> way<00:03:20.220> to<00:03:20.280> run<00:03:20.610> this

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
braking effect the way to run this

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.880 
braking effect the way to run this
technically<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.989> drop<00:03:22.230> your<00:03:22.380> hips<00:03:22.620> lower

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
technically is to drop your hips lower

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.729 
technically is to drop your hips lower
to<00:03:23.790> try<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.120> sit<00:03:24.390> down<00:03:24.630> so<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.019> speak<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:25.620> then

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
to try and sit down so to speak and then

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.940 
to try and sit down so to speak and then
lean<00:03:25.950> very<00:03:26.280> slightly<00:03:26.640> forward<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.769> that

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
lean very slightly forward and that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.530 
lean very slightly forward and that
brings<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.400> to<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.670> end<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:30.000> the<00:03:30.120> descent<00:03:30.420> of

brings you to the end of the descent of
chapman's<00:03:30.959> peak<00:03:31.019> hopefully<00:03:31.739> feeling<00:03:32.100> strong

cost yourself time later on you don't
make<00:04:08.489> time<00:04:08.519> up<00:04:09.170> obviously<00:04:10.170> if<00:04:10.230> you're<00:04:10.349> feeling

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
make time up obviously if you're feeling

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.860 
make time up obviously if you're feeling
fantastic<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.879> at<00:04:12.000> that<00:04:12.150> point<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.629> need<00:04:12.750> to

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
fantastic then at that point you need to

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.030 
fantastic then at that point you need to
make<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.200> decision<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:13.650> you're<00:04:13.829> going<00:04:13.950> to

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
make the decision that you're going to

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.349 
make the decision that you're going to
go<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.489> it<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.670> you're<00:04:14.760> going<00:04:14.879> to<00:04:14.909> push<00:04:15.150> on

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
go for it and you're going to push on

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.719 
go for it and you're going to push on
but<00:04:16.079> if<00:04:16.169> you<00:04:16.259> overdo<00:04:16.769> that<00:04:16.919> push<00:04:17.220> then<00:04:17.609> you

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
but if you overdo that push then you

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.370 
but if you overdo that push then you
really<00:04:18.030> really<00:04:18.180> will<00:04:18.419> pay<00:04:18.660> on<00:04:18.810> constantia

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
really really will pay on constantia

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.379 
really really will pay on constantia
neck<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:19.709> I<00:04:19.919> think<00:04:20.190> your<00:04:20.489> mental<00:04:20.880> approach<00:04:21.120> as

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
