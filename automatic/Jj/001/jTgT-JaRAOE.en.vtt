00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
but there's plenty of space around it so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.080 
but there's plenty of space around it so
just<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.290> less<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.829> problem<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.880> rest

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
just this is less of a problem the rest

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.980 
just this is less of a problem the rest
of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.630> unit<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> of<00:01:49.229> course<00:01:49.470> identical

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
of the right unit is of course identical

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.240
