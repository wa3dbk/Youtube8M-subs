two ways first by getting more safety

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.019 
two ways first by getting more safety
evidence<00:05:30.729> and<00:05:32.159> responding<00:05:33.159> to<00:05:33.339> the<00:05:33.460> specific

evidence and responding to the specific

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:36.390 
evidence and responding to the specific
points<00:05:34.599> for<00:05:34.900> instance<00:05:35.259> about<00:05:35.560> neuropathic
