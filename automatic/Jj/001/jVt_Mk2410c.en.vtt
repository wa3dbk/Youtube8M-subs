00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello and welcome compact 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.660
 Windows 8.1 tablets is developing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.110
 trend 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.980
 we still have the dell venue pro here 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.230
 that we presented last week 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.750
 including the next model 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.300
 namely acers iconia w4 these tablets 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 have common advantages they are 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.400
 Compact they are relatively lightweight 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.109
 They are cheap and cost around 300 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.399
 Euro 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:38.809
 and they offer full windows 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:41.129
 8.1 experience even with a equipment 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.469
 There are many similarities that 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.480
 So we are only marginally different 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.120
 want the video still the iconia as 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.980
 Introduce four in more detail and then 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.829
 at the same time something 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.829
 compare with the dell tablet 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:23.649
 acer delivers his iconia w4 in one 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.920
 colorful cardboard out of the scope of delivery 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.270
 the super screwdriver 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.030
 Documentation material so set up lite 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.549
 and of course we have with you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.390
 there 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:40.600
 There is even a classic here 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.369
 recovery dvd the course directly on 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.369
 tablet can not be used 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:51.250
 We also have the combined one 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:55.750
 data load cable and a power adapter 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:02:00.429
 Positive is that this is usb 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.459
 adapter also gives the acer tablet has 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.259
 just a micro-usb connection that is 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.399
 USB devices can not work directly 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.860
 be connected 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.890
 with such an adapter but it is 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.720
 no problem for example a usb stick 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.569
 keyboard mouse printer whatever with 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.340
 to connect to the tray 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.420
 and yes clearly an advantage over 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.540
 the other devices 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:30.519
 because you have this adapter yourself 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:33.510
 organize the tablet comes in this 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.510
 protective film 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:45.569
 as well as the competitive models for one 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.150
 portrait format use and can 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:55.130
 Let's put the venue 8 next to it 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:58.700
 Conspicuous the iconia w4 is a 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.730
 but noticeable piece thicker the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:07.200
 back made of smooth plastic with 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.180
 a brushed look but that is 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.930
 not a car but really 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.160
 plastic smooth and accordingly 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.120
 not quite as handy as now here 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:25.200
 this device back at the dell camera 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.269
 There is also the same way back 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.200
 even with a resolution of five 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:30.600
 mega pixels 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.330
 which aces definitely makes it better 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.819
 is the connection equipment we have 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.700
 actually a micro hdmi 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.680
 port can thus output the image signal 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.950
 Of course, reading cards is as well 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.370
 ahead to the memory extension positive 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.769
 but it is noticeable that the iconia w4 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.609
 factory with both 32 and 64 gb 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.620
 is offered at the 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.910
 bottom then of course the standard 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.630
 connections that means you the 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.910
 headphone jack here and the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.910
 micro-usb connection the speakers 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.230
 By the way, the rays also down 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.910
 yes at the top there are 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:15.510
 Of course , the on off switch 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:18.320
 apropos switch at the value 8 per has 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.239
 you can miss the windows button 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.410
 which was shifted up here 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.979
 Accordingly, something difficult too 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.360
 to reach 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.430
 at the acer there is a well attainable 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.620
 windows button here below the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.920
 also displays on the iconia like four 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.310
 is windows off and 1 installed 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.950
 conspicuous but when you are eight 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.940
 pro barely additional apps pre-installed 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:46.780
 So here is a lot 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.380
 Yes, also included with 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:54.110
 different use of access to the 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:05:02.030
 esa cloud is possible here as well 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:10.460
 access to various information about 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:20.690
 In addition, Acer gets apps like Fresh 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:23.270
 paint a drawing program so spotify 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:26.450
 yes then everyone must end only for 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:30.950
 Decide if he has the extra 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:34.610
 apps rather than would and as annoying or 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:36.170
 was then felt as an enrichment 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.690
 it will be shown in any case 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.690
 should be is the desktop 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:46.850
 also here one has already to 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.970
 for example the ebay inc and the reference 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:53.540
 on notes online backup that's easy 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:55.760
 just something a little bloodless loaded as for 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.880
 example, the dell device but can be 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:02.240
 of course, adjust relatively quickly 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:05.300
 disadvantage of this pre-installed 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:08.120
 Of course, program is a reduction 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.510
 Free space at the moment 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.610
 32 gigabyte model but as I said it 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:16.160
 gives a micro sd card slot and it 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.660
 Of course, there is also optional 64 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.190
 to acquire gbyte model 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.810
 from the performance at first 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.480
 Of course, there is no one here 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.610
 noticeable differences for this is the 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:34.419
 equipment too similar too 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:39.410
 the display 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:41.810
 yes is also comparable resolution 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:43.130
 identical ips panel in both devices 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:50.300
 des hais for my high 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:52.760
 viewing angle stability and we have something 

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:56.240
 the software side is still concerned 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.760
 also adds on the iconia b4 1 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.620
 microsoft office home and jews 20 13 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.090
 preinstalled, they can also be productive 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.630
 get started right away 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:08.030
 We will now get the equipment through 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.710
 testparcours years just us that 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.840
 display and performance again 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.090
 take a closer look at the battery life 

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:16.580
 and then there will be soon 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:20.139
 detailed test report on acers 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:20.139
 iconia w4
