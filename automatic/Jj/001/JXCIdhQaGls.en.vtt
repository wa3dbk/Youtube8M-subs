00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:08.730
 what's up with people zero tv with one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.340
 new video to destiny in this video 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.330
 I'm doing the first phase of the new board 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.400
 So quotas end solo without help so 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.930
 you also imitate the whole thing yourself 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 I will let you step for 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.109
 step everything necessary to explain though if 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.070
 Hunters or times is not important here 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.170
 everyone can 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.570
 It is not necessary of yours 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.740
 agility strength or otherwise 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.930
 To change settings 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.390
 you can enter the raid so far 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.770
 You can do it the same way 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.800
 imitate and start 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.590
 the higher your level the better but it 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.629
 also goes solo with level 27 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.420
 this variant is for all those 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.579
 who can not find five other players 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.739
 to make phase one as a group 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.140
 You should also if you this 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.510
 still uses solo variant is on the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.520
 normal way try for the raid 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.670
 without creating tricks is harder 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.530
 But the experience of success is a lot 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.939
 better 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.189
 By the way, I have the raid to red 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.900
 even completely solo made the second 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 phase will be online in the next few days 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.070
 and the second box is solo 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.290
 Already online the videos you can find 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.680
 also in the description there is 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.780
 it does not matter if bullock hunter or titan ok 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.670
 let's go we do not use a game 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.159
 error in itself we only use here 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.060
 the programmed game physics for each 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.380
 game has certain internal checkpoints 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.009
 be deactivated once you have certain 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.840
 has reached ranges ok I will that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 I will comment live on the whole live 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.490
 talk to fate here 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.130
 that's fast as precise as running 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.119
 So for the first lamp we immediately continue 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.479
 dont stay here and watch out now 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.970
 all the exploding types here 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.250
 immediately zigzagging and now that comes 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.040
 big covers her big secret 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.170
 jump on this rock 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.080
 sit down on your knees and then 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.340
 he looks purposefully with the weapon 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.590
 this stone here 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.030
 that is very important world now 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.280
 See why that's you 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.440
 So orange because the lamp is close 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.500
 explode and use the whole thing like 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.780
 from what looks like the pressure wave 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.010
 a level moves in this 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.360
 entire lab door 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.520
 You can see it now if you go there 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
 left there because you can see the 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.840
 spot on the lamps so we want now 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.010
 catapulted high 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.350
 now it is a bit slower it 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.300
 see weight of the darkness is ten times 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.160
 active is not bad you follow 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.890
 now just this way 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.780
 the advantage of this whole is here 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.300
 in that we are the other lamps 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.310
 so far will not have activated 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.590
 the other opponents are not activated 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.510
 important is therefore away from the lamps too 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.610
 stay as close as possible to the edge 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.830
 based on how we do this here 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.860
 then you follow the whole you can do 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:54.770
 but let's see the whole front up to 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:57.680
 corner and ultimately that is actually 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.209
 already the secret or the big one 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.420
 work if you have the jump 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.640
 then you have only one left 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.250
 small obstacle in parenthesis small 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.739
 are either one or two or else 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.910
 you'll see that later after that 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.269
 Let's get to point 2 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:15.769
 you have to duck here a bit like that 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.030
 move close as possible to the column the 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.070
 her weight goes dark 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.989
 back down they are not allowed anymore 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.170
 go because there is a knight as soon as possible 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.030
 the isi also lamented you when it did 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.799
 now times two is we give already 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.450
 up again and now against rehme go 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.950
 Do not touch the knight quite clearly and 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.780
 Watch out now friends puts yours 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.269
 screen brightness quiet to maximum 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.650
 so you see everything fits here because 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.080
 there are many holes on the ground and then 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.640
 you have to turn left again 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.600
 not to the next lamp that is allowed 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.780
 not be activated so that would be 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.980
 actually part two of three members 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.980
 on the sides and long 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.250
 Now at the corner when we get that 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.250
 Watch as we already see the bridge 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.000
 just have to go there a little bit now 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.040
 that cripple the lamp and 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.960
 as you can see on the top left of the radar 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.950
 There are currently no opponents because the 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:14.120
 lamps have not yet been activated 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.830
 as well as not going up yet 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.120
 the platform because if is disabled 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.459
 come already adversary as we go 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.780
 put a little refreshment here first 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.510
 take the lamp, the weight of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.140
 darkness as good as 12 goes well 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.630
 to zero 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.680
 in the best case , once the lamp 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.000
 it also has to be activated 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.030
 Go faster because of this 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.950
 ready to run directly to platforms 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.190
 so to zero and points to the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.620
 platform now we activate this 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.820
 activated immediately and now watch it 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.470
 the player can get an explosion 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.910
 and you have to steal behind this 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.950
 so you will not be hit and 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.740
 then really is very important 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.100
 this stone only after the explosion 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.540
 otherwise you will be killed and 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.980
 important is also you have to get up fast 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.290
 this little stone where I'm on it 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.810
 I'll jump if you make it too late 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.400
 have you set the darkness too high 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.710
 so weight the dark then comes the 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.810
 then no longer high with your jump so 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.350
 there we see the first or is 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.810
 come 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.490
 sometimes it's just an oger sometimes 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.120
 that's why it takes two on each 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.910
 fall rockets with and that would actually be 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.290
 the big trick like a small adversary here 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.250
 will not attack you since he's up 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.250
 this stone stands here 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.900
 sometimes very many sometimes spawn there 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.279
 a few sometimes spawn several or that 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.770
 We had already sometimes only existed 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.689
 a like you see the bridge is on 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.580
 always look to the left to see if 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:36.349
 then my supreme and you know 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.120
 never 

00:05:36.349 --> 00:05:41.460
 because if you like level 27 or 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.080
 so be it a bit 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.849
 dangerous if it shoots at you 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:46.860
 then you can possibly one 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:48.870
 but apparently we have shot 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:55.379
 good luck here that no 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:56.580
 Yoga nearby is waiting for that 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:05:58.379
 Sounds activated now we see 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.789
 just the bridge is activated the way 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:01.080
 forward is clear 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.759
 that's what we're talking about now 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:06.089
 now watch here too 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:08.729
 still on the bridge jumper of 

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:10.110
 just go straight ahead on the left and right 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:11.819
 to run forward 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.069
 As I said it is not important if the 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.039
 Agility was full if the strength was full 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:18.719
 you just have to start 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.189
 reasonably fix you not 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:22.830
 meet at first big 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.729
 stone go the little tip of 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.939
 pigs activate in the crouched state 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.770
 focus 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:30.419
 yes and that is also if you then 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.319
 are high on the next plane would 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.000
 actually do not do much more besides 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:35.639
 to follow the path and here we see 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.080
 right now the death of the singer was attacked 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:38.580
 I got here but I already had 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.370
 but it does not matter that's it 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.379
 again two fragments okay people phase 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.229
 One would be done solo now 

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:48.120
 comes phase 2 but then the next 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:49.949
 Just video in the description 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.270
 watch if the link is there then it 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.069

 it's gonna be somewhere 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:58.110
 We also have the second box solo 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:00.300
 also made the third phase with the 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.710
 Witches we did solo check this 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.689
