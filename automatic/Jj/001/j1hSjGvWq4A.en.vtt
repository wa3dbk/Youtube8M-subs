do<00:03:31.700> just<00:03:31.940> keep<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.210> out<00:03:32.300> positive<00:03:36.250> up<00:03:37.250> close

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
do just keep you out positive up close

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.590 
do just keep you out positive up close
to<00:03:38.180> 11<00:03:38.690> scenario<00:03:39.520> instead<00:03:40.520> of<00:03:40.550> beating<00:03:41.390> him

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
to 11 scenario instead of beating him

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.360 
to 11 scenario instead of beating him
down<00:03:41.810> I<00:03:41.840> might<00:03:42.260> have<00:03:42.380> dropped<00:03:42.590> an<00:03:42.800> aide<00:03:42.980> just

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
down I might have dropped an aide just

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.800 
down I might have dropped an aide just
trying<00:03:43.610> to<00:03:43.700> get<00:03:43.820> both<00:03:43.970> them<00:03:44.180> down<00:03:44.360> to<00:03:44.450> one<00:03:44.600> shot

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
trying to get both them down to one shot

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.470 
trying to get both them down to one shot
instead<00:03:44.960> of<00:03:45.200> one<00:03:45.670> and<00:03:46.670> his<00:03:46.970> teammates<00:03:47.300> could

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
instead of one and his teammates could

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.610 
instead of one and his teammates could
have<00:03:47.600> cleaned<00:03:47.750> mumps<00:03:48.080> that's<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.410> only

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
have cleaned mumps that's the only

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.170 
have cleaned mumps that's the only
criticism<00:03:48.830> I<00:03:49.310> have<00:03:49.340> for<00:03:49.730> that<00:03:49.850> play<00:03:50.120> in

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
criticism I have for that play in

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.540 
criticism I have for that play in
particular<00:03:50.810> he<00:03:51.590> does<00:03:51.710> a<00:03:51.740> nice<00:03:51.920> job<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.220> being

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
particular he does a nice job of being

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.780 
particular he does a nice job of being
stealthy<00:03:53.090> here<00:03:53.480> dropping<00:03:54.020> over<00:03:54.110> to<00:03:54.350> our<00:03:54.440> one

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
stealthy here dropping over to our one

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.370 
stealthy here dropping over to our one
hopefully<00:03:55.790> pick<00:03:55.910> up<00:03:56.090> the<00:03:56.210> back<00:03:56.390> smack<00:03:56.780> which

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
hopefully pick up the back smack which

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.590 
hopefully pick up the back smack which
he<00:03:57.530> does<00:03:57.800> from<00:03:58.610> here<00:03:58.760> he<00:03:58.820> just<00:03:58.970> needs<00:03:59.270> to<00:03:59.390> watch

00:03:59.590 --> 00:03:59.600 
he does from here he just needs to watch

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.490 
he does from here he just needs to watch
lobby<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:01.450> really<00:04:02.450> nice<00:04:02.600> to<00:04:02.750> be<00:04:02.810> our<00:04:02.990> great

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
lobby and really nice to be our great

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.230 
lobby and really nice to be our great
decision<00:04:03.920> to<00:04:04.010> back<00:04:04.190> off<00:04:04.430> they're<00:04:04.700> not<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.090> risk

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
decision to back off they're not to risk

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.640 
decision to back off they're not to risk
that<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:08.120> he<00:04:08.270> sees<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.630> got<00:04:08.810> our<00:04:09.020> one<00:04:09.260> again

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
that so he sees that got our one again

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.920 
that so he sees that got our one again
nice<00:04:09.920> awareness<00:04:10.520> he<00:04:11.030> and<00:04:11.150> act<00:04:11.330> old<00:04:11.570> working

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
nice awareness he and act old working

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.550 
nice awareness he and act old working
world<00:04:12.110> together<00:04:13.270> and<00:04:14.270> he<00:04:14.930> gets<00:04:15.110> nated

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
world together and he gets nated

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.949 
world together and he gets nated
unfortunately<00:04:16.430> this<00:04:16.970> awareness<00:04:17.209> again<00:04:17.720> could

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
unfortunately this awareness again could

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.210 
unfortunately this awareness again could
have<00:04:18.049> been<00:04:18.170> just<00:04:18.200> a<00:04:18.470> bit<00:04:18.739> better<00:04:18.919> there

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
have been just a bit better there

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.699 
have been just a bit better there
because<00:04:19.489> those<00:04:19.669> guys<00:04:19.850> came<00:04:20.090> from<00:04:20.150> our<00:04:20.510> one<00:04:20.780> but

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
because those guys came from our one but

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.680 
because those guys came from our one but
it's<00:04:22.010> also<00:04:22.190> kind<00:04:22.940> of<00:04:23.000> his<00:04:23.120> teammates<00:04:23.480> fault

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
it's also kind of his teammates fault

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.160 
it's also kind of his teammates fault
for<00:04:23.960> not<00:04:24.080> calling<00:04:24.320> them<00:04:24.560> out

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
for not calling them out

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.720 
for not calling them out
position<00:04:25.830> in<00:04:25.920> the<00:04:26.010> map<00:04:26.220> where<00:04:26.430> they<00:04:26.550> should

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
position in the map where they should

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.720 
position in the map where they should
have<00:04:26.850> been<00:04:26.880> able<00:04:27.090> to<00:04:27.270> see<00:04:27.480> that<00:04:28.100> picks<00:04:29.100> up<00:04:29.280> in<00:04:29.430> a

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
have been able to see that picks up in a

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.270 
have been able to see that picks up in a
FK<00:04:30.150> kill<00:04:30.780> here<00:04:31.110> that's<00:04:31.740> always<00:04:32.130> nice

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
FK kill here that's always nice

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
gameplay from not light that was a

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.219 
gameplay from not light that was a
little<00:06:55.560> 50<00:06:55.889> ml<00:06:56.160> g<00:06:56.370> guys<00:06:56.580> and<00:06:56.910> his<00:06:57.090> team<00:06:57.360> ended

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.620 
little 50 ml g guys and his team ended
up<00:06:58.410> with<00:06:58.560> the<00:06:58.590> six-point<00:06:59.190> lead<00:06:59.400> you<00:06:59.790> might<00:06:59.970> be

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
up with the six-point lead you might be

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.510 
up with the six-point lead you might be
saying<00:07:00.870> you<00:07:01.050> know<00:07:01.260> oh<00:07:01.590> they<00:07:01.889> were<00:07:01.949> up<00:07:02.160> a<00:07:02.280> player

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:02.520 
saying you know oh they were up a player

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.219 
saying you know oh they were up a player
but<00:07:02.880> the<00:07:03.210> play<00:07:03.389> that<00:07:03.540> quit<00:07:03.750> out<00:07:03.840> was<00:07:03.960> a<00:07:03.990> bit

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
but the play that quit out was a bit

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.400 
but the play that quit out was a bit
weaker<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.949> that's<00:07:05.910> how<00:07:06.060> it<00:07:06.210> goes<00:07:06.410> anyway

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:07.410 
weaker so that's how it goes anyway

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.290 
weaker so that's how it goes anyway
