00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
rightfully so when I first got this hair

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.720 
rightfully so when I first got this hair
from<00:00:29.210> our<00:00:29.480> PG<00:00:29.840> show<00:00:30.079> I<00:00:30.380> was<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.099> little<00:00:31.520> hesitant

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
from our PG show I was a little hesitant

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.120 
from our PG show I was a little hesitant
about<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.360> color<00:00:32.570> but<00:00:33.230> when<00:00:33.380> I<00:00:33.410> put<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.800> on<00:00:33.950> my

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 
about the color but when I put it on my

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.880 
about the color but when I put it on my
scalp<00:00:34.640> I<00:00:34.880> was<00:00:35.239> like<00:00:35.450> yes<00:00:36.050> I<00:00:36.350> needed<00:00:36.680> something

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
scalp I was like yes I needed something

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.940 
scalp I was like yes I needed something
I<00:00:37.100> was<00:00:37.250> gonna<00:00:37.399> just<00:00:38.000> make<00:00:38.300> my<00:00:38.540> skintone<00:00:39.260> sing

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
I was gonna just make my skintone sing

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.070 
I was gonna just make my skintone sing
and<00:00:40.220> I<00:00:40.280> think<00:00:40.310> it<00:00:40.730> does<00:00:41.030> that<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:41.690> this<00:00:41.840> is<00:00:42.050> a

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
and I think it does that so this is a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.710 
and I think it does that so this is a
newest<00:00:42.620> unit<00:00:42.950> that<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.100> got<00:00:43.400> from<00:00:43.700> our<00:00:44.090> PG<00:00:44.480> show
