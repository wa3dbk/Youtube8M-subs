color<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.530> convenient<00:01:52.920> because

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
color and it's really convenient because

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.780 
color and it's really convenient because

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.060 
instead of one slot like furnace this
has<00:01:57.090> 8<00:01:57.570> slot<00:01:57.870> so<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.229> cooks<00:01:58.380> them<00:01:58.530> like<00:01:58.650> all<00:01:58.860> at

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
