00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
at some of the changes to the DMR

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.480 
at some of the changes to the DMR
category<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.330> the<00:00:09.719> recent<00:00:10.110> spring<00:00:10.410> patch<00:00:10.679> not

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
category in the recent spring patch not

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.280 
category in the recent spring patch not
that<00:00:11.700> many<00:00:11.910> youtubers<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.630> been<00:00:12.840> talking

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
that many youtubers have been talking

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.049 
that many youtubers have been talking
about<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.710> topic<00:00:13.980> but<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.250> really<00:00:14.639> love<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
about this topic but I really love the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.939 
about this topic but I really love the
DMR<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> thought<00:00:15.990> I'd<00:00:16.139> let<00:00:16.289> you<00:00:16.410> guys<00:00:16.619> know

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
DMR so I thought I'd let you guys know

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.370 
DMR so I thought I'd let you guys know
how<00:00:17.279> they've<00:00:17.520> changed<00:00:18.109> personally<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.140> think

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
how they've changed personally I think

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.230 
how they've changed personally I think
this<00:00:19.619> category<00:00:20.070> was<00:00:20.250> fine<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.670> way<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> was

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
this category was fine the way it was

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.840 
this category was fine the way it was
but<00:00:21.930> clearly<00:00:22.260> dice<00:00:22.590> didn't<00:00:23.010> agree<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.580> so

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
but clearly dice didn't agree and so

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.519 
but clearly dice didn't agree and so
they've<00:00:24.060> rolled<00:00:24.210> out<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> bunch<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.930> buffs<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
they've rolled out a bunch of buffs and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.160 
they've rolled out a bunch of buffs and
quite<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> few<00:00:26.099> nerves<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:27.420> problem<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.900> is

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
quite a few nerves the problem is is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.900 
quite a few nerves the problem is is
that<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.470> nerves<00:00:28.710> probably<00:00:29.279> outweigh<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that the nerves probably outweigh the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.790 
that the nerves probably outweigh the
buffs<00:00:30.150> at<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.510> point<00:00:30.810> which<00:00:31.320> seems<00:00:31.590> pretty

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
buffs at this point which seems pretty

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.590 
buffs at this point which seems pretty
stupid<00:00:32.219> considering<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.969> DMR's<00:00:33.390> were

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
stupid considering the DMR's were

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.209 
stupid considering the DMR's were
already<00:00:33.899> one<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.440> least<00:00:34.649> popular

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
already one of the least popular

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
already one of the least popular
categories<00:00:36.020> admittedly<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.140> don't<00:00:37.500> think<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
categories admittedly I don't think the

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.410 
categories admittedly I don't think the
nerves<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.879> bad

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
nerves are all that bad

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
nerves are all that bad
but<00:00:39.750> still<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> just<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.530> quite<00:00:40.770> understand

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
but still I just don't quite understand

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.459 
but still I just don't quite understand
why<00:00:41.520> dice<00:00:41.820> even<00:00:42.300> thought<00:00:42.510> this<00:00:42.660> was<00:00:42.870> necessary

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
why dice even thought this was necessary

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.560 
why dice even thought this was necessary
I<00:00:43.800> mean<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> other<00:00:44.730> hand<00:00:45.180> they've<00:00:45.329> buffed

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
I mean on the other hand they've buffed

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.690 
I mean on the other hand they've buffed
the<00:00:45.750> shotguns<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:46.559> compared<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> DMR's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the shotguns which compared to the DMR's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
the shotguns which compared to the DMR's
weren't<00:00:48.149> all<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.360> bad<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:49.140> unpopular<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
weren't all that bad or unpopular to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.520 
weren't all that bad or unpopular to
begin<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:51.420> hard<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> say<00:00:51.960> whether<00:00:52.260> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
begin with it's hard to say whether the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
begin with it's hard to say whether the
balancing<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.370> spring<00:00:53.640> patch<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.180> good

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
balancing in the spring patch was good

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
balancing in the spring patch was good
or<00:00:54.629> bad<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:55.260> general<00:00:55.530> but<00:00:55.829> there's<00:00:56.039> definitely

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
or bad in general but there's definitely

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.430 
or bad in general but there's definitely
been<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> lot<00:00:57.120> of<00:00:57.149> fixing<00:00:57.539> stuff<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.050> wasn't

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
been a lot of fixing stuff that wasn't

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.010 
been a lot of fixing stuff that wasn't
broken<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.520> DMR's<00:01:00.000> definitely<00:01:00.539> fit<00:01:00.780> into

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
broken the DMR's definitely fit into

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.990 
broken the DMR's definitely fit into
this<00:01:01.230> category<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.219> you're<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.430> fan<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
this category so if you're a fan of the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.030 
this category so if you're a fan of the
DMR's<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.110> should<00:01:04.290> be<00:01:04.439> aware<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> they

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
DMR's then you should be aware that they

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
DMR's then you should be aware that they
might<00:01:05.309> not<00:01:05.489> be<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> same<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.570> remember<00:01:07.049> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
might not be the same as you remember so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
might not be the same as you remember so
what's<00:01:08.430> happened<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> DMR<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.600> well<00:01:09.810> to

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
what's happened to the DMR as well to

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.840 
what's happened to the DMR as well to
begin<00:01:10.170> with<00:01:10.350> spread<00:01:11.159> decrease<00:01:11.280> has<00:01:11.670> been

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
begin with spread decrease has been

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.760 
begin with spread decrease has been
reduced<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:12.540> most<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.049> weapons<00:01:13.200> in-game

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
reduced for most of the weapons in-game

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
reduced for most of the weapons in-game
which<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> big<00:01:14.670> deal<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:14.909> semi-auto

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
which is a big deal for semi-auto

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.800 
which is a big deal for semi-auto
weapons<00:01:16.340> DMR's<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.640> always<00:01:17.880> been<00:01:18.210> precision

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
weapons DMR's have always been precision

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
weapons DMR's have always been precision
weapons<00:01:19.140> though<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.979> should<00:01:20.130> really

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
weapons though and this should really

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
weapons though and this should really
only<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.820> an<00:01:21.119> issue<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.750> spam<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> trigger

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
only be an issue if you spam the trigger

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
only be an issue if you spam the trigger
so<00:01:22.860> Pacey<00:01:23.250> shots<00:01:23.640> out<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.180> should<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
so Pacey shots out and you should be

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.380 
so Pacey shots out and you should be
fine<00:01:24.780> also<00:01:25.590> quite<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> few<00:01:26.580> DMR's<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.240> had<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
fine also quite a few DMR's have had a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.359 
fine also quite a few DMR's have had a
reduction<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> horizontal<00:01:28.650> recoil<00:01:28.860> which

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
reduction to horizontal recoil which

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
reduction to horizontal recoil which
isn't<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.970> huge<00:01:30.180> buff<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> worth

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
isn't a huge buff but it is worth

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.560 
isn't a huge buff but it is worth
mentioning<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.520> trade-off<00:01:32.939> though<00:01:33.270> pretty

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
mentioning as a trade-off though pretty

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.420 
mentioning as a trade-off though pretty
much<00:01:33.720> all<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.200> DMR's<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.799> had<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.950> nerve<00:01:35.220> to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
much all the DMR's have had a nerve to

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.520 
much all the DMR's have had a nerve to
80s<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.240> some<00:01:36.479> guns<00:01:36.720> now<00:01:36.960> twice<00:01:37.350> as

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
80s with some guns now twice as

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.640 
80s with some guns now twice as
inaccurate<00:01:37.829> as<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.430> were<00:01:38.640> before<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.210> patch

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
inaccurate as they were before the patch

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
inaccurate as they were before the patch
now<00:01:40.650> another<00:01:41.040> interesting<00:01:41.310> change<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
now another interesting change to the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
now another interesting change to the
DMR's<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.020> been<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> rebalance<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.159> first

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
DMR's has been a rebalance of the first

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.850 
DMR's has been a rebalance of the first
shot<00:01:44.670> recoil<00:01:44.909> multiplier<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.990> vertical

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
shot recoil multiplier and vertical

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.490 
shot recoil multiplier and vertical
recoil<00:01:47.360> basically<00:01:48.360> all<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.899> DMR's<00:01:49.320> have

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
recoil basically all of the DMR's have

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.230 
recoil basically all of the DMR's have
had<00:01:49.649> their<00:01:49.799> first<00:01:50.070> shot<00:01:50.280> multiplier<00:01:50.460> cut<00:01:51.119> in

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
had their first shot multiplier cut in

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.270 
had their first shot multiplier cut in
half<00:01:51.450> but<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> trade-off<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.890> vertical

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
half but as a trade-off the vertical

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.910 
half but as a trade-off the vertical
recoil<00:01:53.430> has<00:01:53.880> also<00:01:54.119> been<00:01:54.540> doubled<00:01:55.049> I've<00:01:55.680> heard

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
recoil has also been doubled I've heard

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.200 
recoil has also been doubled I've heard
a<00:01:55.950> lot<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.130> people<00:01:56.430> say<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
a lot of people say that this was to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
a lot of people say that this was to
prevent<00:01:57.479> spamming<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.380> far<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:58.799> can

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
prevent spamming but as far as I can

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.679 
prevent spamming but as far as I can
tell<00:01:59.340> no<00:01:59.850> matter<00:02:00.030> how<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.299> do<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
tell no matter how you do the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.569 
tell no matter how you do the
calculations<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.560> vertical<00:02:01.950> recoil<00:02:02.100> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
calculations the vertical recoil is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.060 
calculations the vertical recoil is
still<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.060> same<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:04.110> also<00:02:04.320> factors<00:02:04.920> in

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
still the same this also factors in

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.679 
still the same this also factors in
attachments<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:05.909> far<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.210> I<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
attachments and as far as I know the

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.359 
attachments and as far as I know the
multiplier<00:02:07.140> doesn't<00:02:07.560> affect<00:02:07.799> horizontal

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
multiplier doesn't affect horizontal

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
multiplier doesn't affect horizontal
recoil<00:02:08.550> so<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.509> seems<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.959> token<00:02:10.410> change

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
recoil so this seems like a token change

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.570 
recoil so this seems like a token change
more<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.099> consistency<00:02:11.700> rather<00:02:11.940> than

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
more for consistency rather than

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.850 
more for consistency rather than
you<00:02:12.640> think<00:02:12.820> hell's<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:14.140> last<00:02:14.380> really

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
you think hell's the last really

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.410 
you think hell's the last really
important<00:02:15.340> change<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.790> the<00:02:15.880> category<00:02:16.270> though

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
important change to the category though

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.210 
important change to the category though
has<00:02:16.660> been<00:02:16.690> the<00:02:16.990> headshot<00:02:17.380> multiplier<00:02:17.560> buff

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
has been the headshot multiplier buff

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.400 
has been the headshot multiplier buff
which<00:02:18.460> applies<00:02:19.150> to<00:02:19.330> everything<00:02:19.690> except<00:02:20.320> the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
which applies to everything except the

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.920 
which applies to everything except the
DMR's<00:02:20.890> pretty<00:02:21.700> much<00:02:21.880> every<00:02:22.360> other<00:02:22.510> weapon

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
DMR's pretty much every other weapon

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.990 
DMR's pretty much every other weapon
category<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.590> game<00:02:23.890> now<00:02:24.130> has<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.430> multiplier<00:02:24.970> of

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
category in game now has a multiplier of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.030 
category in game now has a multiplier of
more<00:02:25.450> than<00:02:25.630> two<00:02:25.780> point<00:02:26.080> one<00:02:26.260> three<00:02:26.650> while<00:02:26.890> the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
more than two point one three while the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.180 
more than two point one three while the
DMR's<00:02:27.490> are<00:02:27.850> still<00:02:28.270> stuck<00:02:28.570> at<00:02:28.750> two<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.500> can't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
DMR's are still stuck at two I can't

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.710 
DMR's are still stuck at two I can't
understand<00:02:30.670> why<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:31.000> didn't<00:02:31.270> change<00:02:31.420> this

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
understand why they didn't change this

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.150 
understand why they didn't change this
for<00:02:31.930> DMR's<00:02:32.320> though<00:02:32.560> because<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> two<00:02:33.130> shot

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
for DMR's though because a two shot

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.700 
for DMR's though because a two shot
headshot<00:02:33.820> at<00:02:34.030> all<00:02:34.180> ranges<00:02:34.600> is<00:02:34.780> kind<00:02:35.260> of<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.560> bit

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
headshot at all ranges is kind of a bit

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.980 
headshot at all ranges is kind of a bit
ridiculous<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:37.060> being<00:02:37.330> said<00:02:37.570> though<00:02:37.780> this

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
ridiculous that being said though this

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.720 
ridiculous that being said though this
is<00:02:38.200> still<00:02:38.440> effectively<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.070> nerf<00:02:39.310> which<00:02:39.550> now

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
is still effectively a nerf which now

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.300 
is still effectively a nerf which now
makes<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.210> DMR's<00:02:40.660> less<00:02:40.990> effective<00:02:41.530> compared

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
makes the DMR's less effective compared

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.090 
makes the DMR's less effective compared
to<00:02:42.400> other<00:02:42.580> guns<00:02:42.850> than<00:02:43.120> they<00:02:43.210> previously<00:02:43.480> were

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
to other guns than they previously were

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.680 
to other guns than they previously were
now<00:02:45.100> barring<00:02:45.610> all<00:02:45.700> of<00:02:45.820> this<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.150> mind<00:02:46.330> are<00:02:46.630> the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
now barring all of this in mind are the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.320 
now barring all of this in mind are the
DMR<00:02:47.260> still<00:02:47.650> good<00:02:47.920> weapons<00:02:48.340> well<00:02:48.880> as<00:02:49.090> you<00:02:49.210> can

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
DMR still good weapons well as you can

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.480 
DMR still good weapons well as you can
see<00:02:49.480> in<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:49.720> gameplay<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.410> SKS<00:02:50.890> is<00:02:51.190> still<00:02:51.459> a

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490 
see in this gameplay the SKS is still a

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.020 
see in this gameplay the SKS is still a
beast

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
beast

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.850 
beast
I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> first<00:02:52.990> game<00:02:53.290> I<00:02:53.440> played<00:02:53.680> with

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
I think the first game I played with

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.310 
I think the first game I played with
this<00:02:53.980> gun<00:02:54.190> after<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.760> patch<00:02:55.000> I<00:02:55.240> went<00:02:55.450> 24<00:02:55.959> and<00:02:56.110> 3

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
this gun after the patch I went 24 and 3

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.290 
this gun after the patch I went 24 and 3
which<00:02:56.500> just<00:02:56.770> goes<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.130> show<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.820> they<00:02:58.000> still

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
which just goes to show that they still

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:59.790 
which just goes to show that they still
can<00:02:58.570> be<00:02:58.750> viable<00:02:59.080> weapons

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
can be viable weapons

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.680 
can be viable weapons
I<00:02:59.830> think<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.520> SKS<00:03:00.940> has<00:03:01.090> probably<00:03:01.480> come

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
I think the SKS has probably come

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.120 
I think the SKS has probably come
through<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.080> patch<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.530> bit<00:03:02.740> better<00:03:02.920> than

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
through this patch a bit better than

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.010 
through this patch a bit better than
most<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.640> DMR's<00:03:04.090> though<00:03:04.360> because<00:03:04.810> they

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
most of the DMR's though because they

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.750 
most of the DMR's though because they
finally<00:03:05.560> buffed<00:03:05.800> its<00:03:06.010> bullet<00:03:06.280> drop<00:03:06.459> stats

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
finally buffed its bullet drop stats

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.680 
finally buffed its bullet drop stats
were<00:03:06.940> realistic<00:03:07.740> 9.81<00:03:08.740> the<00:03:09.459> m39<00:03:09.970> is<00:03:10.300> probably

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
were realistic 9.81 the m39 is probably

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.540 
were realistic 9.81 the m39 is probably
still<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.080> best<00:03:11.290> all-round<00:03:11.830> DMR<00:03:12.310> though

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
still the best all-round DMR though

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.340 
still the best all-round DMR though
because<00:03:13.150> with<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.360> new<00:03:13.390> accuracy<00:03:14.110> model

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
because with the new accuracy model

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.020 
because with the new accuracy model
across<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:14.800> category<00:03:15.250> it's<00:03:15.459> now<00:03:15.640> only

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
across the category it's now only

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.250 
across the category it's now only
slightly<00:03:16.330> less<00:03:16.570> accurate<00:03:17.019> than<00:03:17.050> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
slightly less accurate than the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.009 
slightly less accurate than the
competition<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.310> general<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.209> DMR<00:03:19.540> category

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
competition in general the DMR category

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.080 
competition in general the DMR category
is<00:03:20.230> still<00:03:20.440> pretty<00:03:20.769> decent<00:03:20.980> but<00:03:21.700> like<00:03:21.850> I<00:03:22.030> said

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
is still pretty decent but like I said

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.420 
is still pretty decent but like I said
before<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.570> never<00:03:22.780> expected<00:03:23.410> any<00:03:23.709> changes<00:03:24.280> as

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
before I never expected any changes as

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.270 
before I never expected any changes as
drastic<00:03:24.970> as<00:03:25.090> this<00:03:25.380> DMR<00:03:26.380> started<00:03:26.920> out<00:03:27.040> as

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
drastic as this DMR started out as

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.100 
drastic as this DMR started out as
probably<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:27.940> least<00:03:28.120> effective<00:03:28.660> category

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
probably the least effective category

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.810 
probably the least effective category
and<00:03:29.320> it's<00:03:29.650> sad<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:30.010> see<00:03:30.160> them<00:03:30.310> nerfed<00:03:30.519> when

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
and it's sad to see them nerfed when

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.190 
and it's sad to see them nerfed when
they<00:03:30.940> were<00:03:31.000> finally<00:03:31.360> a<00:03:31.540> decent<00:03:31.810> alternative

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
they were finally a decent alternative

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.780 
they were finally a decent alternative
to<00:03:32.769> automatic<00:03:33.250> weapons

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
to automatic weapons

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.000 
to automatic weapons
I<00:03:33.940> really<00:03:34.690> hope<00:03:34.870> dice<00:03:35.170> reverse<00:03:35.620> what<00:03:35.860> they've

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
I really hope dice reverse what they've

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.830 
I really hope dice reverse what they've
done<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.310> the<00:03:36.459> accuracy<00:03:37.000> of<00:03:37.030> these<00:03:37.209> guns<00:03:37.540> in

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
done to the accuracy of these guns in

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.780 
done to the accuracy of these guns in
particular<00:03:38.200> because<00:03:39.070> although<00:03:39.310> it's<00:03:39.610> not<00:03:39.760> a

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
particular because although it's not a

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.000 
particular because although it's not a
huge<00:03:40.090> problem<00:03:40.390> it's<00:03:40.750> still<00:03:41.050> an<00:03:41.260> unnecessary

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
huge problem it's still an unnecessary

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.370 
huge problem it's still an unnecessary
change<00:03:42.400> I'm<00:03:42.790> all<00:03:43.330> fine<00:03:43.570> with<00:03:43.600> patching<00:03:44.200> what

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
change I'm all fine with patching what

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.990 
change I'm all fine with patching what
needs<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.739> be<00:03:44.920> patched<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.550> DMR's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
needs to be patched but the DMR's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.790 
needs to be patched but the DMR's
weren't<00:03:46.300> really<00:03:46.690> bothering<00:03:47.050> anyone

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
weren't really bothering anyone
