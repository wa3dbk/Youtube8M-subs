00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.530
 we are going to vote once about disney movies 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.640
 it is this video are all in english and we often make it there 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.029
 the netherlands dutch videos with dutch voices 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:12.959
 there, the actors come to the studio that sound exactly as happens there 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.759
 and if halved and coincidental, there are now a few children who sound exactly like that 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.759
 let out mercury and kwak as mercury 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.319
 one not 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:23.819
 Hey 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.199
 a price 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.960
 it can be a client plan of approach well I think you can really do the thing 

00:00:31.479 --> 00:00:35.280
 is the sign of the tu delft was of course a lot more time must first 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.899
 If the American Wyeth is to be translated then the actors must be sought 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.250
 for the Dutch votes 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.990
 and only then can it be recorded in a sound studio 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.400
 I went to take a look at Yemen's Dutch 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.400
 protagonists of the thirty 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.840
 because our readers who are the girl 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.840
 this service is 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.980
 unfortunately 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.690
 he did that romero 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.660
 57 girls 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.860
 turned 57 years old 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 18 11 4 9 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.370
 cost my parents live 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.260
 American Oath in recent months 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.680
 9 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.170
 yes this is top end of November wholeheartedly that the voices of i looked in 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.810
 qatar 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.810
 that is actually the difference between the mercury kwak and kwak 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.620
 that is of course triplets 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.870
 as you can see they look alike but the voices also seem whole 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.070
 much alike that is also such an original version 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.210
 but I try to make them a little different and there 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.760
 want to tell about the on the colors of the jackets and the caps green blue 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.170
 and so she always tries to disassemble me 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.610
 and max 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.479
 what then 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.469
 presumably it is about being behind that they will soon be rating 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:18.759
 by catching up for the train when you get addicted are the suspects 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.469
 lower closed doors on Monday 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.469
 consoles 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.629
 that's a good thing too 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.959
 if you do everything 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.959
 midway through the past year 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.009
 I have one 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.389
 curator 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:50.770
 it has been forgotten 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.669
 already an advance 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.619
 just panda just combine bob 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:03:02.169
 Alkmaar in a caravan could make Almere the world Japan therefore in Almere 

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:04.449
 preah vihear stop that time 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:08.079
 not everyone can do it wisely that was also nice but it succeeds 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:08.459
 not 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.079
 with some figures from intel general electric and moon side in the spring 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.079
 dutch team of honda municipality in english 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.959
 for this after the girl stands out that we have a system exactly like that 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.309
 happened today 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.529
 but would rather have said today was in the center 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:29.849
 reportedly even it is therefore worked on there though 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.619
 unfortunately not in 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:34.979
 I have so much money to earn I don't know but I would 

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:39.239
 I will not just have to deal with what you think there 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:39.730
 happens 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.019
 after the summer the man in this gentleman is only friends who go this summer 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.849
 they fly 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.799
 and year to see it is a currant buns 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.329
 money for that is all for me except that that is quite what you think about it 

00:03:55.729 --> 00:04:00.209
 from disney that I think is so great mention filming like the monsters 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.669
 I have nothing so required this have nothing to do good for the 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:07.159
 summer it's never real 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.190
 that happened after taste in your mouth 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.409
 those videos of course bonus 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.849
 We are waiting man what do you think I am for too long 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.989
 You are the best servants I have ever had 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:21.459
 and it cannot be often enough 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.070
 and so a lot of work has to be done before it is partly on television 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:25.699
 broadcast
