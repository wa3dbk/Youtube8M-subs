from wheel and engineering of course if

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.740 
from wheel and engineering of course if
you're<00:00:08.099> around<00:00:08.309> in<00:00:08.519> the<00:00:08.550> 80s<00:00:08.639> this<00:00:09.510> would<00:00:09.660> have

you're around in the 80s this would have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.910 
you're around in the 80s this would have
been<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.960> exact<00:00:10.320> thing<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.559> you<00:00:10.710> would<00:00:10.830> have

been the exact thing that you would have

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.280 
been the exact thing that you would have
put<00:00:11.070> on<00:00:11.219> top<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.460> your<00:00:11.780> chevy<00:00:12.780> caprice

Insight<00:00:17.340> if<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.850> was<00:00:17.940> around<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.390> time

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
Insight if it was around at the time

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:19.370 
Insight if it was around at the time
which<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> wasn't

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
which it wasn't

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.300 
which it wasn't
but<00:00:20.010> of<00:00:20.340> course<00:00:21.020> 1999<00:00:22.050> has<00:00:22.529> come<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:22.920> gone<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
but of course 1999 has come and gone and

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.300 
but of course 1999 has come and gone and
alas<00:00:23.939> so<00:00:24.150> has<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> 99<00:00:24.990> series<00:00:25.439> beacon<00:00:25.830> which

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
alas so has the 99 series beacon which

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.970 
alas so has the 99 series beacon which
Whelan<00:00:26.670> used<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.510> fact<00:00:27.990> I<00:00:28.320> sold<00:00:28.619> one

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
Whelan used to make in fact I sold one

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.279 
Whelan used to make in fact I sold one
of<00:00:29.010> these<00:00:29.130> fact<00:00:29.820> quite<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.060> few<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.359> these<00:00:30.449> back

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
of these fact quite a few of these back

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.130 
of these fact quite a few of these back
in<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.859> late<00:00:32.279> 80s<00:00:32.669> great<00:00:33.329> product<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.899> said

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
in the late 80s great product as I said

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
in the late 80s great product as I said
but<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> world<00:00:34.770> advances<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.640> as<00:00:35.969> advances

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
but the world advances and as advances

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.260 
but the world advances and as advances
it<00:00:36.690> moves<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.800> modern<00:00:38.219> world<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.640> LED

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
it moves into the modern world of LED

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
it moves into the modern world of LED
technology<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> go<00:00:40.800> from<00:00:41.010> something<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
technology so you go from something this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.569 
technology so you go from something this
size<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:43.110> something<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.649> little<00:00:43.920> bit<00:00:44.190> smaller

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
size to something a little bit smaller

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.270 
size to something a little bit smaller
so<00:00:44.910> I'm<00:00:45.329> going<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.510> put<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.899> on<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.800> floor<00:00:46.950> at

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
so I'm going to put this on the floor at

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.069 
so I'm going to put this on the floor at
least<00:00:47.460> over<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.149> shop<00:00:48.539> for<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.780> second

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
least over here out of shop for a second

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
least over here out of shop for a second
it's<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> probably<00:00:49.770> still<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.250> shop<00:00:50.460> but

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
it's kind of probably still in shop but

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.130 
it's kind of probably still in shop but
nevertheless<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.420> worry<00:00:51.539> about<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.899> look

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
nevertheless don't worry about that look

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.139 
nevertheless don't worry about that look
at<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:53.250> I'm<00:00:53.340> holding<00:00:53.610> here<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.820> my<00:00:53.910> hand

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
at this what I'm holding here in my hand

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.660 
at this what I'm holding here in my hand
is<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> brand<00:00:55.020> new<00:00:55.530> beacon<00:00:56.010> from<00:00:56.309> Whelan

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is a brand new beacon from Whelan

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.160 
is a brand new beacon from Whelan
engineering<00:00:57.180> out<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.329> Chester<00:00:57.719> Connecticut

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
engineering out of Chester Connecticut

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.810 
engineering out of Chester Connecticut
it's<00:00:58.680> known<00:00:58.890> as<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.449> r31<00:01:00.449> 6<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> or<00:01:01.820> 316

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
it's known as the r31 6 or the or 316

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.490 
it's known as the r31 6 or the or 316
whichever<00:01:03.480> way<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.690> want<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> put<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> but

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
whichever way you want to put it but

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.890 
whichever way you want to put it but
it's<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:05.159> brand<00:01:05.519> new<00:01:05.670> beacon<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.299> it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it's a brand new beacon and it's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.010 
it's a brand new beacon and it's
designed<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.040> Rhoda<00:01:08.640> beam<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.540> the

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
designed to be a Rhoda beam so the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.700 
designed to be a Rhoda beam so the
concept<00:01:10.650> here<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.100> that<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.659> LED<00:01:13.260> product

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
concept here is that we have LED product

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
concept here is that we have LED product
out<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.159> about<00:01:14.670> all<00:01:14.939> over<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.390> world<00:01:15.600> but

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
out and about all over the world but

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.609 
out and about all over the world but
essentially<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.979> flashes<00:01:18.170> mimicking<00:01:19.170> strobe

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
essentially it flashes mimicking strobe

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.530 
essentially it flashes mimicking strobe
to<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:19.890> degree<00:01:20.040> or<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> halogen<00:01:20.820> blinking<00:01:21.360> light

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
to a degree or a halogen blinking light

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.910 
to a degree or a halogen blinking light
to<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.110> degree<00:01:22.380> as<00:01:22.530> well

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
to a degree as well

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.770 
to a degree as well
Wheelan<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.000> lot<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> other<00:01:24.330> manufacturers

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
Wheelan and a lot of other manufacturers

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.270 
Wheelan and a lot of other manufacturers
have<00:01:24.930> been<00:01:25.110> looking<00:01:25.439> at<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> fact<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
have been looking at the fact that is

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.330 
have been looking at the fact that is
time<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> go<00:01:26.729> retro<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.960> let's<00:01:28.920> go<00:01:29.130> from

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
time to go retro so let's go from

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
time to go retro so let's go from
something<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.150> size<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:31.170> something<00:01:31.380> this

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
something this size to something this

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.190 
something this size to something this
size<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.850> retro<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.960> I'm<00:01:34.049> going

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
size that pretty is retro so I'm going

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.929 
size that pretty is retro so I'm going
to<00:01:34.259> turn<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.590> beacon<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.520> you'll<00:01:35.610> see<00:01:35.850> in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
to turn this beacon on and you'll see in

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.399 
to turn this beacon on and you'll see in
a<00:01:36.000> second<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.689> does<00:01:36.900> actually

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
a second here that it does actually

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.580 
a second here that it does actually
rotate<00:01:37.920> I've<00:01:38.159> got<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.850> cruise<00:01:39.180> light<00:01:39.600> feature

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
rotate I've got the cruise light feature

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.100 
rotate I've got the cruise light feature
on<00:01:40.920> right<00:01:41.280> now<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.659> see<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
on right now you can kind of see that

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
on right now you can kind of see that
there<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.560> move<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.829> around<00:01:44.899> I'm<00:01:45.899> going<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
there as I move it around I'm going to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.550 
there as I move it around I'm going to
turn<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> on<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.689> you'll<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.840> able<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
turn it on and you'll be able to see it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.850 
turn it on and you'll be able to see it
rotate<00:01:50.840> maybe<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.020> let's<00:01:52.229> put<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.619> there

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
rotate maybe a let's put that on there

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
rotate maybe a let's put that on there
just<00:01:53.430> like<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.090> while<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.479> rotating

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
just like that so while that's rotating

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
just like that so while that's rotating
I'm<00:01:55.170> gonna<00:01:55.290> put<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.740> down<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.729> floor

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I'm gonna put this down on the floor

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.730 
I'm gonna put this down on the floor
over<00:01:57.180> here<00:01:59.329> live<00:02:00.329> television<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:01.469> we<00:02:01.590> go

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
over here live television there we go

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.709 
over here live television there we go
you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.040> see<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.820> beacon<00:02:03.180> definitely

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you can see here the beacon definitely

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.410 
you can see here the beacon definitely
flashes<00:02:04.320> around<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> very<00:02:05.490> nice<00:02:05.759> particular

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
flashes around in a very nice particular

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.600 
flashes around in a very nice particular
flash<00:02:06.600> pattern<00:02:06.899> there<00:02:07.200> is<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.380> total<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.920> 31

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
flash pattern there is a total of 31

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.309 
flash pattern there is a total of 31
different<00:02:09.179> flash<00:02:09.569> patterns<00:02:09.929> by<00:02:10.050> the<00:02:10.110> way

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
different flash patterns by the way

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.880 
different flash patterns by the way
available<00:02:11.220> with<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.849> particular<00:02:12.360> light

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
available with this particular light

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
available with this particular light
all<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.310> flash<00:02:14.520> patterns<00:02:14.910> by<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.120> way<00:02:15.330> are

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
all the flash patterns by the way are

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.510 
all the flash patterns by the way are
going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:16.110> be<00:02:16.230> rotating<00:02:16.860> with<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> exception

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
going to be rotating with the exception

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.130 
going to be rotating with the exception
of<00:02:17.610> cruise<00:02:17.880> control<00:02:18.270> so<00:02:18.750> I'm<00:02:18.840> going<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.050> go

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of cruise control so I'm going to go

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.809 
of cruise control so I'm going to go
ahead<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.500> change<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.190> pattern<00:02:20.520> here<00:02:20.700> you

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
ahead and change the pattern here you

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.699 
ahead and change the pattern here you
also<00:02:21.150> saw<00:02:21.330> that<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.630> switches<00:02:21.840> from<00:02:22.260> left<00:02:22.590> to

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
also saw that it switches from left to

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.170 
also saw that it switches from left to
right<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.190> you<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> ability<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.880> rotate

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
right so you have the ability to rotate

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.140 
right so you have the ability to rotate
right<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.290> rotate<00:02:25.770> left<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.580> get<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:26.970> side

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
right or rotate left you get to the side

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.730 
right or rotate left you get to the side
how<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.360> want<00:02:27.660> to<00:02:27.720> do<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.319> set<00:02:28.500> it<00:02:28.620> up

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
how you want to do that and set it up

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.070 
how you want to do that and set it up
you<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.250> also<00:02:29.400> sync<00:02:29.790> these<00:02:30.030> as<00:02:30.270> well<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:30.690> again

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
you can also sync these as well so again

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.570 
you can also sync these as well so again
I'm<00:02:31.260> kind<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.470> messing<00:02:32.070> around<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.310> little<00:02:32.490> bit

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
I'm kind of messing around a little bit

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.190 
I'm kind of messing around a little bit
about<00:02:32.730> or<00:02:33.300> changing<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.780> different<00:02:34.050> flash

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
about or changing the different flash

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.540 
about or changing the different flash
patterns<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.680> kind<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.920> speed<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.280> up<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.490> slow

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
patterns to kind of speed it up and slow

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.730 
patterns to kind of speed it up and slow
it<00:02:36.209> down<00:02:36.240> depending<00:02:36.840> how<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.290> want<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:37.620> look

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
it down depending how you want to look

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.500 
it down depending how you want to look
at<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:38.010> let<00:02:38.520> me<00:02:38.640> take<00:02:38.820> a<00:02:38.850> look<00:02:39.090> at<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> tech

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
at it let me take a look at the tech

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.210 
at it let me take a look at the tech
specs<00:02:39.870> but<00:02:40.410> first<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.739> all<00:02:40.800> let<00:02:40.890> me<00:02:40.950> turn<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
specs but first of all let me turn the

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.710 
specs but first of all let me turn the
light<00:02:41.370> off<00:02:41.400> here<00:02:41.700> for<00:02:41.730> second<00:02:42.090> kind<00:02:42.360> of<00:02:42.420> help<00:02:42.660> a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
light off here for second kind of help a

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.380 
light off here for second kind of help a
little<00:02:42.810> bit<00:02:43.020> so<00:02:43.709> the<00:02:43.860> camera<00:02:44.280> can<00:02:44.310> focus<00:02:44.819> as

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
little bit so the camera can focus as

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.270 
little bit so the camera can focus as
you<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.170> see<00:02:46.350> here<00:02:46.530> there's<00:02:46.680> an<00:02:46.770> aluminum

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you can see here there's an aluminum

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.380 
you can see here there's an aluminum
base<00:02:47.489> on<00:02:48.200> the<00:02:49.200> bottom<00:02:49.560> here<00:02:50.000> now<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.150> has<00:02:51.360> a

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
base on the bottom here now this has a

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.570 
base on the bottom here now this has a
very<00:02:51.780> close<00:02:52.140> similarity<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.130> wheel<00:02:53.550> and

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
very close similarity to the wheel and

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.090 
very close similarity to the wheel and
31<00:02:54.269> Series<00:02:54.780> light<00:02:55.230> head<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.650> essentially

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
31 Series light head and essentially

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.979 
31 Series light head and essentially
it's<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:56.550> in<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.880> same<00:02:57.090> family<00:02:57.420> of<00:02:57.630> course

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
it's it's in the same family of course

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.550 
it's it's in the same family of course
but<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:58.650> called<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> r3<00:03:00.090> 1/6<00:03:00.750> so<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.260> is<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
but it is called the r3 1/6 so it is a

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
but it is called the r3 1/6 so it is a
different<00:03:02.130> light<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.820> as<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.090> said

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
different light in that as I said

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.600 
different light in that as I said
earlier<00:03:03.269> it<00:03:03.780> will<00:03:04.019> only<00:03:04.380> rotate<00:03:04.860> it<00:03:05.220> won't<00:03:05.489> go

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
earlier it will only rotate it won't go

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.780 
earlier it will only rotate it won't go
into<00:03:05.850> any<00:03:06.000> other<00:03:06.120> type<00:03:06.450> of<00:03:06.600> flash<00:03:06.900> patterns

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
into any other type of flash patterns

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:09.890 
into any other type of flash patterns
but<00:03:08.790> based<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.360> fact<00:03:09.570> that<00:03:09.720> it's<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
but based on the fact that it's a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.390 
but based on the fact that it's a
similarity<00:03:10.320> product<00:03:10.920> you've<00:03:11.070> got<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
similarity product you've got the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.550 
similarity product you've got the
ability<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.760> pipe<00:03:12.150> mount<00:03:12.390> this<00:03:12.690> or<00:03:12.930> permanent

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
ability to pipe mount this or permanent

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.040 
ability to pipe mount this or permanent
mounted<00:03:13.860> it<00:03:14.010> has<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> cast<00:03:14.790> base<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.870> what

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
mounted it has a cast base that's what

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
mounted it has a cast base that's what
I'm<00:03:16.140> showing<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.470> here<00:03:16.680> right<00:03:16.860> now

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.380 
you'll be able to get all of that wiring
to<00:03:22.380> function<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:23.340> can<00:03:23.489> also<00:03:23.640> get<00:03:23.850> this<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.180> a

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
to function you can also get this in a

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.600 
to function you can also get this in a
magnetic<00:03:24.840> version<00:03:25.350> but<00:03:25.560> again<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.040> flash

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
magnetic version but again the flash

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.810 
magnetic version but again the flash
pattern<00:03:27.000> in<00:03:27.209> magnetic<00:03:27.570> will<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.200> preset<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
pattern in magnetic will be preset the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.500 
pattern in magnetic will be preset the
light<00:03:30.000> itself<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.630> class<00:03:31.260> 1<00:03:32.070> beacon<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.329> that

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
that requires class 1 certification this

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.699 
that requires class 1 certification this
is<00:03:41.370> going<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.670> meet<00:03:41.880> your<00:03:42.269> requirement<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.680> a

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
is going to meet your requirement so a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.680 
is going to meet your requirement so a
really<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.430> nice<00:03:44.610> light<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.180> can<00:03:45.360> see<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
really really nice light you can see the

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.930 
really really nice light you can see the
diffuser<00:03:46.200> here<00:03:47.010> which<00:03:47.190> allows<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.730> light<00:03:47.910> to

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
diffuser here which allows the light to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.630 
diffuser here which allows the light to
spread<00:03:48.600> out<00:03:48.810> as<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.470> rotates<00:03:49.890> around<00:03:50.130> and

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
spread out as it rotates around and

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.660 
spread out as it rotates around and
again<00:03:51.390> you<00:03:52.079> can<00:03:52.230> see<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> actual<00:03:52.890> diodes<00:03:53.430> to<00:03:53.640> a

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
again you can see the actual diodes to a

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.370 
again you can see the actual diodes to a
degree<00:03:53.790> in<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.150> top<00:03:54.390> here<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.810> the<00:03:55.140> reason

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
degree in the top here and the reason

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.930 
degree in the top here and the reason
why<00:03:55.470> this<00:03:55.530> area<00:03:55.769> here<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.160> frosted<00:03:56.700> with<00:03:56.850> the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
why this area here is frosted with the

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.060 
why this area here is frosted with the
big<00:03:57.060> nice<00:03:57.209> wheel<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:57.750> sign<00:03:57.930> allows<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.890> light

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
big nice wheel and sign allows the light

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.630 
big nice wheel and sign allows the light
to<00:03:59.100> be<00:03:59.340> bounced<00:03:59.700> back<00:04:00.000> inside<00:04:01.130> now<00:04:02.130> I'm<00:04:02.400> not

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
to be bounced back inside now I'm not

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.039 
to be bounced back inside now I'm not
going<00:04:02.730> to<00:04:02.790> disassemble<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.540> unit<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:03.900> what

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
going to disassemble this unit but what

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.990 
going to disassemble this unit but what
I<00:04:04.079> will<00:04:04.170> briefly<00:04:04.590> do<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:04.950> reach<00:04:05.130> across<00:04:05.489> here

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
I will briefly do is reach across here

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.620 
I will briefly do is reach across here
and<00:04:06.230> show<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.290> what<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.430> internal<00:04:08.970> modules

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
and show you what the internal modules

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.410 
and show you what the internal modules
look<00:04:10.049> like<00:04:10.350> and<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.640> see<00:04:11.820> them<00:04:12.000> there<00:04:12.180> now

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 
look like and you can see them there now

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.729 
look like and you can see them there now
this<00:04:12.570> is<00:04:12.690> a<00:04:12.720> slightly<00:04:12.989> different<00:04:13.140> unit<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:13.709> I

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
this is a slightly different unit and I

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.770 
this is a slightly different unit and I
explain<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.910> a<00:04:15.090> different<00:04:15.450> video<00:04:15.600> but

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
explain that in a different video but

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.800 
explain that in a different video but
basically<00:04:16.350> this<00:04:16.979> area<00:04:17.220> here<00:04:18.150> is<00:04:18.329> what<00:04:18.690> we're

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
basically this area here is what we're

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.199 
basically this area here is what we're
looking<00:04:18.840> at<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.380> that's<00:04:19.829> what's<00:04:20.160> inside<00:04:20.400> this

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
looking at and that's what's inside this

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.120 
looking at and that's what's inside this
particular<00:04:21.419> light<00:04:21.989> and<00:04:22.229> obviously<00:04:22.710> it<00:04:22.890> does<00:04:23.099> a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
particular light and obviously it does a

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.460 
particular light and obviously it does a
complete<00:04:23.550> 360<00:04:24.120> degrees<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.020> one<00:04:25.200> doesn't

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
complete 360 degrees this one doesn't

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.740 
complete 360 degrees this one doesn't
but<00:04:25.800> again<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.550> just<00:04:27.000> showing<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.450> forward

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
but again and just showing it forward

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.960 
but again and just showing it forward
demonstration<00:04:28.470> purposes<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:29.670> you<00:04:29.790> can

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
demonstration purposes but you can

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.450 
demonstration purposes but you can
clearly<00:04:30.180> see<00:04:30.510> there<00:04:30.720> the<00:04:31.290> functionality<00:04:32.010> with

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
clearly see there the functionality with

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.190 
clearly see there the functionality with
the<00:04:32.490> diodes<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.180> dyes<00:04:33.360> themselves<00:04:33.930> actually

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
the diodes the dyes themselves actually

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.400 
the diodes the dyes themselves actually
have<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.590> patented<00:04:35.370> unique<00:04:35.900> reflector<00:04:36.900> which

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
have a patented unique reflector which

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.130 
have a patented unique reflector which
is<00:04:37.590> being<00:04:37.770> placed<00:04:38.070> on<00:04:38.280> top<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.390> diodes<00:04:39.750> you

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
is being placed on top of the diodes you

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.660 
is being placed on top of the diodes you
can<00:04:40.260> see<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.470> reflector<00:04:40.890> area<00:04:41.190> there<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
can see the reflector area there and

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.790 
can see the reflector area there and
that<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.390> turn<00:04:42.660> gives<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:43.080> unique<00:04:43.500> flash

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
that in turn gives that unique flash

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.320 
that in turn gives that unique flash
pattern<00:04:44.250> and<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.700> intensity<00:04:45.120> that's

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
pattern and the intensity that's

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.540 
pattern and the intensity that's
required<00:04:45.750> to<00:04:45.930> make<00:04:46.110> this<00:04:46.290> work<00:04:46.830> for<00:04:46.860> class<00:04:47.280> 1
