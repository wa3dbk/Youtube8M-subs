resistance make you fat certain fats do
that<00:00:36.719> not<00:00:37.170> because<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.590> calories<00:00:38.010> not

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that not because of the calories not

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.130 
that not because of the calories not
because<00:00:38.460> they're<00:00:38.610> fat<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.329> because<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
because they're fat but because of the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.319 
because they're fat but because of the
inflammatory<00:00:40.500> nature<00:00:40.890> of<00:00:41.280> expensing<00:00:41.940> other

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
inflammatory nature of expensing other

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.020 
inflammatory nature of expensing other
fats<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> exact<00:00:43.379> opposite<00:00:44.010> they're<00:00:44.520> anti

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
fats do the exact opposite they're anti

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.330 
fats do the exact opposite they're anti
inflammatory<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.260> reverse<00:00:46.680> leptin<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
inflammatory they reverse leptin and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.069 
inflammatory they reverse leptin and
insulin<00:00:47.610> resistance<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.750> they<00:00:48.870> cause<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
insulin resistance and they cause a

hormonal situation in your body that

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.819 
hormonal situation in your body that
makes<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> infinitely<00:00:51.750> easier<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.680> lose

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
makes it infinitely easier to lose

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.950 
makes it infinitely easier to lose
weight<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.850> talk<00:00:53.969> about<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> worst<00:00:54.390> fat<00:00:54.750> so

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
weight just talk about the worst fat so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.160 
weight just talk about the worst fat so
the<00:00:55.079> worst<00:00:55.320> fats<00:00:55.649> they<00:00:55.800> have<00:00:55.980> unrefined

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
the worst fats they have unrefined

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
the worst fats they have unrefined
vegetable<00:00:58.170> oils<00:00:58.670> unfortunately<00:00:59.670> those<00:00:59.820> fats

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
vegetable oils unfortunately those fats

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
vegetable oils unfortunately those fats
are<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> most<00:01:00.570> common<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.109> all<00:01:01.230> processed

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
are the most common in all processed

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.709 
are the most common in all processed
foods<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.370> most<00:01:02.699> restaurant<00:01:03.239> foods<00:01:03.480> and

foods and most restaurant foods and

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.240 
foods and most restaurant foods and
they're<00:01:04.080> usually<00:01:04.229> probably<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.949> foods<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
they're usually probably the foods that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.550 
they're usually probably the foods that
you<00:01:05.400> buy<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.030> store<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:07.080> cook<00:01:07.350> with

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
you buy at the store to cook with

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.740 
you buy at the store to cook with
because<00:01:07.799> they're<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> cheapest<00:01:08.600> instead<00:01:09.600> of

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
because they're the cheapest instead of

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
because they're the cheapest instead of
refined<00:01:10.290> vegetable<00:01:10.950> oils<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.090> want<00:01:12.390> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
refined vegetable oils what you want are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.700 
refined vegetable oils what you want are
cold<00:01:13.049> pressed

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
cold pressed

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.280 
cold pressed
nut<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.430> seed<00:01:14.760> oils<00:01:15.150> but<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> don't<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
nut and seed oils but you don't want to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960 
nut and seed oils but you don't want to
cook<00:01:16.530> with<00:01:16.590> cold<00:01:17.070> pressed<00:01:17.340> nuts<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.790> seed

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cook with cold pressed nuts and seed

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
cook with cold pressed nuts and seed
oils<00:01:18.240> because<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:19.020> corrupted<00:01:19.229> at<00:01:19.530> high

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
oils because they get corrupted at high

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.130 
oils because they get corrupted at high
temperatures<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.580> become<00:01:20.880> rancid<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.659> then

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
temperatures they become rancid and then

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.899 
temperatures they become rancid and then
it<00:01:22.470> causes<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.830> problem<00:01:23.009> also<00:01:23.549> so<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.700> never

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it causes a problem also so you never

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.570 
it causes a problem also so you never
want<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.240> cook<00:01:24.630> with<00:01:24.960> nightly<00:01:25.799> seed<00:01:26.189> oils<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
want to cook with nightly seed oils you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.730 
want to cook with nightly seed oils you
want<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> serve<00:01:27.030> them<00:01:27.270> cold<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> salad

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
want to serve them cold like a salad

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.440 
want to serve them cold like a salad
dressings<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.310> things<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.299> let's

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
dressings and things like that so let's

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
dressings and things like that so let's
first<00:01:30.840> talk<00:01:31.049> about<00:01:31.110> healthy<00:01:31.950> fats<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.310> cook

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
first talk about healthy fats to cook

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
first talk about healthy fats to cook
with<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.479> healthy<00:01:33.810> fats<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.140> cook<00:01:34.320> with

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
with so the healthy fats to cook with

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520 
with so the healthy fats to cook with
are<00:01:34.740> usually<00:01:35.100> stabilized<00:01:36.259> saturated<00:01:37.259> fats

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
are usually stabilized saturated fats

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
are usually stabilized saturated fats
because<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:37.950> don't<00:01:38.100> get<00:01:38.189> corrupted<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.700> high

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
because they don't get corrupted at high

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.100 
because they don't get corrupted at high
temperatures<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.420> that's<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.720> real<00:01:39.900> main

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
temperatures and that's the real main

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.140 
temperatures and that's the real main
issue<00:01:40.350> when<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.009> cooking<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> fat<00:01:41.759> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
issue when you're cooking with a fat you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.880 
issue when you're cooking with a fat you
don't<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.630> corrupted<00:01:43.229> by<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
don't want it to get corrupted by the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
don't want it to get corrupted by the
key<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.670> want<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.210> fact<00:01:45.450> that's<00:01:45.659> stable

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
key so you want the fact that's stable

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.160 
key so you want the fact that's stable
at<00:01:46.409> high<00:01:46.560> temperature

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
at high temperature

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.620 
at high temperature
the<00:01:47.500> best<00:01:47.770> one<00:01:48.040> is<00:01:48.280> cold-pressed<00:01:48.880> coconut<00:01:49.180> oil

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:49.630 
the best one is cold-pressed coconut oil

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.680 
the best one is cold-pressed coconut oil
so<00:01:50.310> that's<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:51.520> best<00:01:51.700> cooking<00:01:52.000> oil<00:01:52.420> it

so that's the best cooking oil it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.820 
so that's the best cooking oil it
doesn't<00:01:52.990> get<00:01:53.200> corrupted<00:01:53.620> at<00:01:53.710> high

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
doesn't get corrupted at high

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.020 
doesn't get corrupted at high
temperature<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.760> has<00:01:54.820> some

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
temperature it has some

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.850 
temperature it has some
anti-inflammatory<00:01:55.330> benefits<00:01:55.990> makes<00:01:56.680> it<00:01:56.800> a

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
anti-inflammatory benefits makes it a

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.290 
anti-inflammatory benefits makes it a
really<00:01:57.010> good<00:01:57.310> orell<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.760> cook<00:01:57.909> but<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.150> does

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
really good orell to cook but it does

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.359 
really good orell to cook but it does
have<00:01:58.450> a<00:01:58.510> distinctive<00:01:59.080> taste<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.979> not

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
have a distinctive taste so not

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.670 
have a distinctive taste so not
everybody<00:02:00.729> likes<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.600> cook<00:02:01.930> with<00:02:02.200> coconut<00:02:02.590> oil

everybody likes to cook with coconut oil
so<00:02:02.979> let's<00:02:03.460> look<00:02:03.550> at<00:02:03.700> some<00:02:03.820> other<00:02:04.000> fats<00:02:04.479> that

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so let's look at some other fats that

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.660 
so let's look at some other fats that
are<00:02:04.750> stable<00:02:05.200> and<00:02:05.530> high<00:02:05.920> temperatures<00:02:06.460> and

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
are stable and high temperatures and

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.260 
are stable and high temperatures and
therefore<00:02:06.910> they're<00:02:07.330> good<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.720> cook<00:02:07.930> with<00:02:09.270> so
