00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.810 
find it tomorrow high pressure will
build<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.380> that'll<00:02:16.830> give<00:02:16.950> us<00:02:17.010> a<00:02:17.190> nice<00:02:17.400> day<00:02:17.760> but

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
build in that'll give us a nice day but

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.150 
build in that'll give us a nice day but
as<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.300> high<00:02:18.510> eventually<00:02:19.110> gives<00:02:19.740> ground

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
as the high eventually gives ground

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.550 
as the high eventually gives ground
later<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> day<00:02:21.210> tomorrow<00:02:21.380> clouds<00:02:22.380> are

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
later in the day tomorrow clouds are

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.170 
later in the day tomorrow clouds are
going<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.710> start<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.130> increase<00:02:23.490> and<00:02:23.760> this

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
going to start to increase and this

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.760 
going to start to increase and this
whole<00:02:24.390> frontal<00:02:24.780> system<00:02:25.140> is<00:02:25.230> eventually<00:02:25.530> going

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
whole frontal system is eventually going

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.490 
whole frontal system is eventually going
to<00:02:25.860> come<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.310> north<00:02:26.730> pushing<00:02:27.540> moisture<00:02:27.780> into

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
to come back north pushing moisture into

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.230 
to come back north pushing moisture into
the<00:02:28.530> area<00:02:28.800> over<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.550> weekend<00:02:30.000> and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
the area over the weekend and

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.450 
the area over the weekend and
unfortunately<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.410> slow-moving<00:02:32.010> system

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
unfortunately it is a slow-moving system

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.790 
unfortunately it is a slow-moving system
so<00:02:32.880> it<00:02:32.940> looks<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.210> several<00:02:34.200> days<00:02:34.380> Saturday

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
so it looks like several days Saturday

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.430 
so it looks like several days Saturday
Sunday<00:02:35.250> Monday<00:02:35.550> probably<00:02:36.120> even<00:02:36.270> Tuesday<00:02:36.900> when

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
we would like to see clouds and the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.120

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
opportunity for rain showers so overall

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.700 
opportunity for rain showers so overall
the<00:02:41.400> weekend<00:02:41.790> not<00:02:42.780> looking<00:02:43.110> all<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.440> great

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
the weekend not looking all that great
