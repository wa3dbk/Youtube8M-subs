00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
introduction but I think you're probably

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.869 
introduction but I think you're probably
the<00:00:33.140> best<00:00:33.199> place<00:00:33.530> person<00:00:33.949> to<00:00:34.040> explain<00:00:34.399> what<00:00:34.730> it

00:00:34.869 --> 00:00:34.879 
the best place person to explain what it

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:37.630 
the best place person to explain what it
is<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.300> do<00:00:35.800> horses<00:00:36.800> inside<00:00:37.129> out<00:00:37.370> well

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
anatomy and biomechanics of horses but

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.360 
anatomy and biomechanics of horses but
in<00:00:50.540> an<00:00:50.659> interesting<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:51.559> slightly<00:00:51.710> different

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
in an interesting and slightly different

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.670 
in an interesting and slightly different
way<00:00:52.519> for<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.089> sake<00:00:53.329> of<00:00:53.360> clarity<00:00:53.720> should<00:00:54.620> we

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
way for the sake of clarity should we

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.960 
way for the sake of clarity should we
just<00:00:54.860> have<00:00:54.979> a<00:00:55.010> look<00:00:55.159> at<00:00:55.250> a<00:00:55.280> clip<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:55.760> that<00:00:55.790> we

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
just have a look at a clip so that we

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.329 
just have a look at a clip so that we
can<00:00:56.120> see<00:00:56.239> exactly<00:00:56.540> what<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.899> is<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.199> mean<00:00:57.409> so

00:00:58.329 --> 00:00:58.339 
can see exactly what it is you mean so

00:00:58.339 --> 00:00:59.890 
can see exactly what it is you mean so
this<00:00:58.549> is<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.699> horse<00:00:58.970> with<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.299> skeleton

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
this is a horse with the skeleton

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.259 
this is a horse with the skeleton
painted<00:01:00.290> on<00:01:00.409> his<00:01:00.530> side<00:01:01.030> cantering<00:01:02.030> down<00:01:02.239> a

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
painted on his side cantering down a

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.109 
painted on his side cantering down a
line<00:01:02.570> of<00:01:02.750> jumps<00:01:03.049> and<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.320> really<00:01:03.619> good

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
line of jumps and it's a really good

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.580 
line of jumps and it's a really good
demonstration<00:01:05.119> of<00:01:05.750> seeing<00:01:06.020> the<00:01:06.200> horse's

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
demonstration of seeing the horse's

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.740 
demonstration of seeing the horse's
skeleton<00:01:07.130> moving<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.150> wonderful<00:01:08.600> way<00:01:08.720> of

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
skeleton moving it's a wonderful way of

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.510 
skeleton moving it's a wonderful way of
seeing<00:01:09.110> what's<00:01:09.290> going<00:01:09.500> on<00:01:09.650> inside<00:01:09.799> because

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
seeing what's going on inside because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.350 
seeing what's going on inside because
there's<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:10.729> rule<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.000> don't<00:01:11.180> think<00:01:11.299> we

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
there's a rule I don't think we

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.030 
there's a rule I don't think we
particularly<00:01:11.960> like<00:01:12.229> being<00:01:12.439> reminded<00:01:12.560> what

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
particularly like being reminded what

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.429 
particularly like being reminded what
goes<00:01:13.220> on<00:01:13.400> inside<00:01:13.750> how<00:01:14.750> long<00:01:14.930> does<00:01:15.049> it<00:01:15.140> take<00:01:15.350> you

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
goes on inside how long does it take you

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:17.740 
goes on inside how long does it take you
to<00:01:15.560> put<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.970> painting<00:01:16.970> on<00:01:17.090> the<00:01:17.119> horse<00:01:17.360> well<00:01:17.659> it

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
to put the painting on the horse well it

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.359 
to put the painting on the horse well it
depends<00:01:18.079> on<00:01:18.140> the<00:01:18.259> design<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.829> painting<00:01:19.220> that

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369

the idea appointed with his skeleton on
as<00:01:56.119> well<00:01:56.359> so<00:01:56.569> the<00:01:57.109> idea<00:01:57.139> is<00:01:57.829> really<00:01:58.069> we<00:01:58.609> can

look at the horse's skeleton and compare

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.379 
look at the horse's skeleton and compare
it<00:02:00.829> to<00:02:00.859> the<00:02:01.069> human<00:02:01.369> and<00:02:01.520> there's<00:02:01.639> a<00:02:01.729> few<00:02:01.999> things

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:02.389

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:04.629 
it to the human and there's a few things
about<00:02:02.749> the<00:02:03.350> horse's<00:02:03.740> skeleton<00:02:04.159> which<00:02:04.280> willing

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
about the horse's skeleton which willing

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:06.669 
about the horse's skeleton which willing
to<00:02:04.789> strike<00:02:05.209> you<00:02:05.450> as<00:02:05.539> a<00:02:05.569> little<00:02:05.810> bit<00:02:06.289> strange

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
to strike you as a little bit strange

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.969 
to strike you as a little bit strange
first<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.759> all<00:02:07.909> the<00:02:08.090> horse's<00:02:08.539> neck<00:02:08.869> runs<00:02:09.649> right

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
first of all the horse's neck runs right

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.010 
first of all the horse's neck runs right
down<00:02:10.009> quite<00:02:10.610> low<00:02:10.880> at<00:02:11.060> this<00:02:11.240> level<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:11.930> I

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
down quite low at this level here and I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.199 
down quite low at this level here and I
think<00:02:12.260> most<00:02:12.500> people<00:02:12.950> think<00:02:13.220> that<00:02:13.490> the<00:02:13.850> horse's

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
think most people think that the horse's

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.780 
think most people think that the horse's
neck<00:02:14.510> runs<00:02:14.870> right<00:02:15.200> along<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> top<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.040> top

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
neck runs right along the top of the top

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.940 
neck runs right along the top of the top
of<00:02:16.970> his<00:02:17.060> neck<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:18.440> fact<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> whole

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
of his neck here and in fact the whole

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.470 
of his neck here and in fact the whole
of<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.160> spine<00:02:19.400> runs<00:02:19.700> all<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.880> way<00:02:20.090> along<00:02:20.330> the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
of the spine runs all the way along the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.720 
of the spine runs all the way along the
top<00:02:20.690> of<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:21.020> back<00:02:21.260> that's<00:02:21.860> not<00:02:22.130> actually<00:02:22.370> the

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
top of this back that's not actually the

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.270 
top of this back that's not actually the
case<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.209> neck<00:02:23.420> is<00:02:23.599> much<00:02:23.870> lower<00:02:24.170> down<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.830> think

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
case the neck is much lower down I think

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.010 
case the neck is much lower down I think
the<00:02:25.370> reason<00:02:25.730> we<00:02:25.880> we<00:02:26.300> think<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.750> as<00:02:26.780> being

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
the reason we we think of it as being

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.660 
the reason we we think of it as being
higher<00:02:27.349> up<00:02:27.470> is<00:02:27.800> because<00:02:28.010> if<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:28.310> look<00:02:28.459> at<00:02:28.550> our

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
higher up is because if you look at our

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.880 
higher up is because if you look at our
own<00:02:28.849> spine<00:02:29.300> if<00:02:29.510> we<00:02:29.599> look<00:02:29.720> at<00:02:29.810> our<00:02:29.930> own<00:02:29.990> neck<00:02:30.470> you

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
own spine if we look at our own neck you

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.770 
own spine if we look at our own neck you
can<00:02:31.069> feel<00:02:31.280> your<00:02:31.490> neck<00:02:31.670> vertebrae<00:02:32.330> at<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.569> back

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
can feel your neck vertebrae at the back

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.360 
can feel your neck vertebrae at the back
of<00:02:32.810> your<00:02:33.110> neck<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.560> close<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.100> surface

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
of your neck right close to the surface

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.850 
of your neck right close to the surface
but<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.820> is<00:02:35.030> different<00:02:35.570> with<00:02:35.870> horses<00:02:36.230> why<00:02:36.830> I

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
but it is different with horses why I

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.290 
but it is different with horses why I
guess<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.190> is<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.460> that<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.880> because<00:02:38.120> they're

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
guess it is is that just because they're

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.340 
guess it is is that just because they're
on<00:02:38.420> all<00:02:38.570> fours<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
on all fours and

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.890 
on all fours and
and<00:02:39.470> need<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.160> just<00:02:40.610> sort<00:02:40.730> of<00:02:40.820> balance<00:02:41.690> their

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and need to just sort of balance their

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.420 
and need to just sort of balance their
weight<00:02:42.110> if<00:02:42.320> you<00:02:42.440> like<00:02:42.590> yes<00:02:42.860> and<00:02:43.100> as<00:02:43.250> well

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
weight if you like yes and as well

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.070 
weight if you like yes and as well
because<00:02:43.760> horse<00:02:43.940> has<00:02:44.090> got<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.240> very<00:02:44.480> heavy<00:02:44.780> head

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
because horse has got a very heavy head

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.590 
because horse has got a very heavy head
a<00:02:45.320> very<00:02:45.830> long<00:02:46.130> neck<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.910> need<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.210> be<00:02:47.270> able<00:02:47.390> to

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
a very long neck you need to be able to

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.450 
a very long neck you need to be able to
lower<00:02:47.810> his<00:02:47.990> head<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.440> graze<00:02:48.800> and<00:02:49.070> lift<00:02:49.280> it

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.460 
lower his head down to graze and lift it

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.700 
lower his head down to graze and lift it
up<00:02:49.640> so<00:02:50.090> all<00:02:50.270> of<00:02:50.420> this<00:02:50.600> muscle<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.290> area

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
up so all of this muscle in this area

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.010 
up so all of this muscle in this area
here<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.040> actually<00:02:52.460> working<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:53.570> help<00:02:53.810> to

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
here is actually working to help to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.900 
here is actually working to help to
raise<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.650> horse's<00:02:55.010> head<00:02:55.160> up<00:02:55.340> so<00:02:55.550> the<00:02:55.670> fact

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
raise the horse's head up so the fact

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.670 
raise the horse's head up so the fact
that<00:02:56.030> the<00:02:56.240> the<00:02:56.600> neck<00:02:56.810> vertebrae<00:02:57.350> are<00:02:57.470> lower

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
that the the neck vertebrae are lower

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.140 
that the the neck vertebrae are lower
down<00:02:57.800> just<00:02:58.280> means<00:02:58.430> he<00:02:58.550> can<00:02:58.640> get<00:02:58.760> a<00:02:58.820> little<00:02:59.060> bit

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
down just means he can get a little bit

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.690 
down just means he can get a little bit
more<00:02:59.360> leverage<00:02:59.570> to<00:03:00.170> bring<00:03:00.650> him<00:03:00.830> back<00:03:01.010> up<00:03:01.220> now

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
more leverage to bring him back up now

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.300 
more leverage to bring him back up now
I'm<00:03:02.000> interested<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.930> ribs<00:03:03.740> because<00:03:04.220> I

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
I'm interested in the ribs because I

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.710 
I'm interested in the ribs because I
thought<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:04.940> ribs<00:03:05.120> would<00:03:05.300> have<00:03:05.420> started

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
thought that the ribs would have started

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.820 
thought that the ribs would have started
more<00:03:06.230> where<00:03:07.100> I'd<00:03:07.280> supposed<00:03:07.970> his<00:03:08.330> spine<00:03:08.690> is

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
more where I'd supposed his spine is

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.230 
more where I'd supposed his spine is
absolutely<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:09.920> that's<00:03:10.070> so<00:03:10.310> interesting<00:03:10.640> so

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
absolutely and that's so interesting so

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.330 
absolutely and that's so interesting so
there<00:03:11.660> are<00:03:11.750> these<00:03:11.840> very<00:03:12.200> long<00:03:12.620> bony

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
there are these very long bony

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.730 
there are these very long bony
projections<00:03:14.150> which<00:03:14.660> come<00:03:14.930> out<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.200> top<00:03:15.500> of

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
projections which come out the top of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.430 
projections which come out the top of
the<00:03:16.280> vertebrae<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.330> reach<00:03:17.540> up<00:03:17.810> to<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:17.990> top<00:03:18.080> of

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
the vertebrae and reach up to the top of

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.350 
the vertebrae and reach up to the top of
the<00:03:18.530> midline<00:03:18.920> of<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.160> horse<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:19.550> when<00:03:19.670> you<00:03:19.820> run

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
the midline of the horse so when you run

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.640 
the midline of the horse so when you run
your<00:03:20.540> fingers<00:03:20.870> down<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.170> midline<00:03:21.470> of<00:03:21.500> the

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
your fingers down the midline of the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.380 
your fingers down the midline of the
horse<00:03:21.890> and<00:03:22.040> feel<00:03:22.190> those<00:03:22.400> bony<00:03:22.700> lumps<00:03:23.210> you're

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
horse and feel those bony lumps you're

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.180 
horse and feel those bony lumps you're
not<00:03:23.480> actually<00:03:23.840> feeling<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.740> the<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
not actually feeling the the the

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.580 
not actually feeling the the the
vertebrae<00:03:25.880> themselves<00:03:26.480> but<00:03:26.630> these<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:27.290> tops

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
vertebrae themselves but these the tops

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
vertebrae themselves but these the tops
of<00:03:27.860> these<00:03:27.950> very<00:03:28.280> long<00:03:28.610> spinous<00:03:29.210> processes

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
of these very long spinous processes

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.600 
of these very long spinous processes
these<00:03:29.930> very<00:03:30.170> long<00:03:30.380> bony<00:03:30.830> projections<00:03:31.430> which

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
these very long bony projections which

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.730 
these very long bony projections which
come<00:03:31.850> out<00:03:31.940> of<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.270> vertebrae<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.500> ribs

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:33.740
