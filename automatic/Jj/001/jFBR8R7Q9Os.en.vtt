00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
masterpiece so let's take a closer look

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.000 
masterpiece so let's take a closer look
at<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.540> too<00:04:09.870> much<00:04:10.049> detail<00:04:10.440> on<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.620> face<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:10.919> be

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
at it too much detail on the face to be

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.319 
at it too much detail on the face to be
honest<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.340> you<00:04:11.430> for<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:11.639> most<00:04:11.819> part<00:04:12.030> it

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
honest with you for the most part it

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.909 
honest with you for the most part it
could<00:04:12.510> have<00:04:12.599> probably<00:04:12.870> done<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.349> little<00:04:13.680> bit<00:04:13.859> of

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
could have probably done a little bit of

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.159 
could have probably done a little bit of
a<00:04:14.040> better<00:04:14.190> job<00:04:14.459> but<00:04:14.970> it's<00:04:15.209> close<00:04:15.569> enough<00:04:15.599> i

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
a better job but it's close enough i

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.289 
a better job but it's close enough i
guess<00:04:16.199> for<00:04:16.620> what<00:04:17.160> they<00:04:17.310> did<00:04:17.370> I<00:04:17.579> think<00:04:17.880> they

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
guess for what they did I think they

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.210 
guess for what they did I think they
could<00:04:18.449> have<00:04:18.539> put<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> little<00:04:18.959> bit<00:04:19.289> more<00:04:19.500> detail

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
could have put a little bit more detail

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.150 
could have put a little bit more detail
as<00:04:20.370> far<00:04:20.549> as<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.699> face<00:04:20.880> goes<00:04:21.150> but<00:04:21.419> everything

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
as far as the face goes but everything

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.130 
as far as the face goes but everything
there's<00:04:22.670> just<00:04:22.880> so<00:04:23.030> much<00:04:23.210> detail<00:04:23.690> here<00:04:23.720> that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
there's just so much detail here that

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.600 
there's just so much detail here that
I'm<00:04:24.380> sure<00:04:24.710> that's<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.070> reason<00:04:25.340> why<00:04:25.370> they

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
I'm sure that's the reason why they

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.770 
I'm sure that's the reason why they
probably<00:04:25.850> lacked<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.270> little<00:04:26.540> bit<00:04:26.660> on<00:04:26.750> that

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
probably lacked a little bit on that

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.570 
probably lacked a little bit on that
generally<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.440> looks<00:04:27.590> pretty<00:04:27.890> much<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.400> like

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
generally it looks pretty much just like

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.370 
generally it looks pretty much just like
the<00:04:28.730> character<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.450> also<00:04:29.570> got<00:04:29.780> the<00:04:29.960> nice<00:04:30.110> hat

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
the character you also got the nice hat

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.570 
the character you also got the nice hat
but<00:04:30.590> do<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.770> ruffles<00:04:31.070> on<00:04:31.160> the<00:04:31.250> Hat<00:04:31.430> right

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
but do the ruffles on the Hat right

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.670 
but do the ruffles on the Hat right
there<00:04:31.820> just<00:04:32.270> looks<00:04:32.450> phenomenal<00:04:32.840> like<00:04:33.560> they

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
there just looks phenomenal like they

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.710 
there just looks phenomenal like they
put<00:04:33.920> so<00:04:34.160> much<00:04:34.370> work<00:04:34.580> into<00:04:34.790> these<00:04:34.970> figures<00:04:35.330> like

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
put so much work into these figures like

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.360 
put so much work into these figures like
I<00:04:35.810> said<00:04:36.020> they<00:04:36.170> can<00:04:36.380> be<00:04:36.500> expensive<00:04:36.830> but<00:04:37.280> you

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
I said they can be expensive but you

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.330 
I said they can be expensive but you
gotta<00:04:37.520> bang<00:04:37.790> for<00:04:38.420> your<00:04:38.840> buck<00:04:39.070> overall<00:04:40.070> this
