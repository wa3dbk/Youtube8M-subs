00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
person and it probably a couple other

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740

team player members that were like still
down<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.700> don't<00:01:05.880> know<00:01:05.970> if<00:01:06.150> he<00:01:06.270> either

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
killed himself or he fled and what I

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.380 
killed himself or he fled and what I
think<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:10.979> happened<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.460> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
think what I think happened is actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.000 
think what I think happened is actually
a<00:01:12.450> couple<00:01:12.630> things<00:01:12.900> they've<00:01:13.409> been<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.770> course

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
a couple things they've been of course

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.410 
a couple things they've been of course
things<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.549> been<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.820> oh<00:01:15.030> he<00:01:15.270> has

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
things that have been like oh he has

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.780 
things that have been like oh he has
died<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.259> think<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:17.189> he<00:01:17.369> has<00:01:17.490> lived

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
died and then I think that he has lived

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
died and then I think that he has lived
and<00:01:18.030> not<00:01:18.240> only<00:01:18.479> live<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.960> also<00:01:19.259> think<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.680> he's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
and not only live I also think that he's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.640 
and not only live I also think that he's
possibly<00:01:20.310> immortal<00:01:21.240> now<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.320> probably

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
possibly immortal now this is probably

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.740 
possibly immortal now this is probably
one<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> dumbest<00:01:23.790> things<00:01:23.850> will<00:01:24.210> ever<00:01:24.390> hear

are<00:01:49.350> young<00:01:49.560> girls<00:01:49.710> I<00:01:49.770> think<00:01:49.799> he<00:01:50.490> probably<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
are young girls I think he probably the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.050 
are young girls I think he probably the
plug<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.659> boat

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
plug on a boat

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.380 
plug on a boat
didn't<00:01:52.270> say<00:01:52.390> like<00:01:52.570> oh<00:01:52.750> he<00:01:53.470> if<00:01:54.369> you're<00:01:55.149> playing

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
didn't say like oh he if you're playing

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.389 
didn't say like oh he if you're playing
x<00:01:55.689> you<00:01:56.140> you'll<00:01:56.439> realize<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.829> with<00:01:57.100> ultimate

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:57.399 
x you you'll realize that with ultimate

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.179 
x you you'll realize that with ultimate
weapon<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.850> need<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.530> sarnia<00:01:59.530> sincerness<00:01:59.890> is

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
weapon you need a sarnia sincerness is

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.460 
weapon you need a sarnia sincerness is
basically<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.880> person<00:02:01.450> with<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.600> power<00:02:01.720> the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
basically the person with the power the

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.350 
basically the person with the power the
power<00:02:02.649> of<00:02:02.860> life<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.340> know<00:02:03.460> so<00:02:03.939> basically

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
power of life you know so basically

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.660 
power of life you know so basically
maybe<00:02:04.810> with<00:02:04.960> ultimate<00:02:05.350> weapon<00:02:05.680> he<00:02:06.130> shoots<00:02:06.399> he

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
maybe with ultimate weapon he shoots he

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.150 
maybe with ultimate weapon he shoots he
shoots<00:02:07.119> the<00:02:07.390> power<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.170> life<00:02:08.349> up<00:02:08.590> into<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.920> sky

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
shoots the power of life up into the sky

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.820 
shoots the power of life up into the sky
and<00:02:09.190> it<00:02:09.489> crashes<00:02:09.729> back<00:02:10.060> down<00:02:10.330> and<00:02:10.599> I<00:02:11.410> guess

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
and it crashes back down and I guess

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.920 
and it crashes back down and I guess
with<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:12.310> energy<00:02:12.760> from<00:02:13.060> life<00:02:13.450> was<00:02:13.780> so

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
with the energy from life was so

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
with the energy from life was so
powerful<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.530> polynomial<00:02:14.950> memorial<00:02:15.489> that

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
powerful in polynomial memorial that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.850 
powerful in polynomial memorial that
it's<00:02:16.030> one<00:02:16.209> of<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> things<00:02:16.599> that<00:02:16.690> i<00:02:17.140> can<00:02:17.830> think

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's one of the things that i can think

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.229 
it's one of the things that i can think
of<00:02:18.160> then<00:02:18.489> of<00:02:18.610> course<00:02:18.819> if<00:02:18.970> you're<00:02:19.120> playing

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
of then of course if you're playing

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.780 
of then of course if you're playing
pokemon<00:02:19.750> y<00:02:20.019> you<00:02:20.739> can<00:02:20.920> also<00:02:21.069> say<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.400> i<00:02:21.610> guess

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
pokemon y you can also say that i guess

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.580 
pokemon y you can also say that i guess
when<00:02:22.000> he<00:02:22.090> when<00:02:22.390> he<00:02:22.480> goes<00:02:22.630> up<00:02:22.870> into<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> sky<00:02:23.560> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
when he when he goes up into the sky and

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.350 
when he when he goes up into the sky and
crashes<00:02:23.950> back<00:02:24.280> down<00:02:24.489> he<00:02:24.700> gets<00:02:24.819> the<00:02:24.970> power<00:02:25.150> of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
crashes back down he gets the power of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.830 
crashes back down he gets the power of
death<00:02:25.540> which<00:02:26.049> is<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.470> mean<00:02:27.310> he's<00:02:28.090> probably<00:02:28.510> dead

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
death which is I mean he's probably dead

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.580 
death which is I mean he's probably dead
but<00:02:29.140> I'm<00:02:30.150> not<00:02:31.150> cleared<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.600> talking<00:02:31.930> about<00:02:32.080> but

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
but I'm not cleared of talking about but

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.320 
but I'm not cleared of talking about but
I<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.860> don't<00:02:33.069> think<00:02:33.250> he's<00:02:33.519> gonna<00:02:33.640> die<00:02:33.880> do<00:02:34.269> you

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
I just don't think he's gonna die do you

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.030 
I just don't think he's gonna die do you
think<00:02:34.540> he's<00:02:34.690> either<00:02:34.840> immortal<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:35.709> still

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
think he's either immortal or still

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
think he's either immortal or still
alive<00:02:36.280> may<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.549> trapped<00:02:36.910> inside<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.599> or

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
alive may be trapped inside there or

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.539 
alive may be trapped inside there or
something<00:02:37.900> like<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.019> but<00:02:38.709> when<00:02:38.920> Pokemon<00:02:39.370> Z

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
something like that but when Pokemon Z

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:41.880 
something like that but when Pokemon Z
or<00:02:39.970> pokemon<00:02:40.420> X&amp;Y<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.959> whatever<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.620> want<00:02:41.830> to

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
or pokemon X&amp;Y to whatever you want to

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.309 
or pokemon X&amp;Y to whatever you want to
call<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.069> comes<00:02:42.670> back<00:02:42.880> around<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.420> probably

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
call it comes back around is probably

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.690 
call it comes back around is probably
he's<00:02:44.530> probably<00:02:44.560> be<00:02:44.980> alive<00:02:45.220> maybe<00:02:45.519> you<00:02:45.610> have

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
he's probably be alive maybe you have

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.910 
he's probably be alive maybe you have
like<00:02:45.849> Pokemon<00:02:46.330> X<00:02:46.540> he's<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.170> immortal

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
like Pokemon X he's like I'm immortal

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.370 
like Pokemon X he's like I'm immortal
with<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.700> he<00:02:49.209> never<00:02:49.480> dies<00:02:49.750> because<00:02:49.959> he<00:02:50.290> has

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
with the he never dies because he has

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140 
with the he never dies because he has
the<00:02:50.470> power<00:02:50.620> of<00:02:50.830> life<00:02:50.980> inside<00:02:51.310> him<00:02:51.489> well<00:02:51.880> then

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
the power of life inside him well then

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.610 
the power of life inside him well then
we're<00:02:52.390> talking<00:02:52.660> about<00:02:52.720> why<00:02:52.989> he<00:02:53.019> has<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.470> power

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
we're talking about why he has the power

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.610 
we're talking about why he has the power
death<00:02:53.980> inside<00:02:54.280> him<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.849> he's<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:55.239> I<00:02:55.620> don't

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620

ever think of but I do think he is not
dead<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.079> if<00:03:11.230> he<00:03:11.260> is<00:03:11.380> that<00:03:11.709> does<00:03:11.950> really

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
dead and that if he is that does really

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.940 
dead and that if he is that does really
thats<00:03:13.420> i<00:03:13.600> like<00:03:14.049> i<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.500> fact<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.769> they

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
thats i like i like the fact that they

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.860 
thats i like i like the fact that they
actually<00:03:15.069> like<00:03:15.489> intraday<00:03:16.120> did<00:03:16.359> actually

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
actually like intraday did actually

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.300 
actually like intraday did actually
showed<00:03:17.350> that<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.739> i'm<00:03:17.859> glad<00:03:18.160> they

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
showed that that i'm glad they

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.280 
showed that that i'm glad they
introduced<00:03:18.760> death<00:03:19.060> into<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.390> game<00:03:19.660> but<00:03:19.870> i

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
introduced death into the game but i

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.770 
introduced death into the game but i
just<00:03:20.650> don't<00:03:20.889> think<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.459> is<00:03:21.639> for<00:03:21.850> people<00:03:22.750> that
