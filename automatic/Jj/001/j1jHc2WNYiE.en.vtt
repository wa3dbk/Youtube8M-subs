for<00:00:02.010> some<00:00:02.220> reason<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:03.060> bottom<00:00:03.449> thread<00:00:03.990> coming

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
for some reason the bottom thread coming

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.800 
for some reason the bottom thread coming
off<00:00:04.740> of<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:05.040> bottom<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.520> tangling<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.660> I

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
off of the bottom is tangling and I

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.200 
off of the bottom is tangling and I
don't<00:00:06.870> know<00:00:07.230> why<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.370> bobbin<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.849> loaded

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
don't know why the bobbin is loaded

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.530 
don't know why the bobbin is loaded
correctly<00:00:09.599> just<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.620> it<00:00:10.769> was<00:00:10.889> yesterday

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:11.540 
correctly just as it was yesterday

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.959 
correctly just as it was yesterday
thread<00:00:12.540> has<00:00:12.840> been<00:00:13.110> wound<00:00:13.710> around<00:00:14.160> and<00:00:14.490> pulled

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
thread has been wound around and pulled

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.109 
thread has been wound around and pulled
so<00:00:15.299> it's<00:00:15.480> cut<00:00:15.949> like<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> book<00:00:17.369> says<00:00:17.730> I<00:00:18.060> don't

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
so it's cut like the book says I don't

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.870 
so it's cut like the book says I don't
have<00:00:18.330> to<00:00:18.510> pull<00:00:18.840> it<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.160> through<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> feed<00:00:20.550> dogs

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
have to pull it up through the feed dogs

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.259 
have to pull it up through the feed dogs

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
can see it's tangling right away for

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
can see it's tangling right away for
some<00:00:55.170> reason<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> bobbin<00:00:56.100> is<00:00:56.250> not<00:00:56.489> turning<00:00:57.059> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
some reason the bobbin is not turning it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.229 
some reason the bobbin is not turning it
worked<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.170> fine<00:00:58.289> yesterday<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.789> clean

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
worked just fine yesterday it's clean

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.849 
worked just fine yesterday it's clean
the<00:01:00.660> bobbin<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> loaded<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.559> correct

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the bobbin is loaded the correct

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.250 
the bobbin is loaded the correct
direction<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:03.059> thread<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> same<00:01:04.080> as

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
direction the thread is the same as

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.469 
direction the thread is the same as
yesterday<00:01:04.549> but<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:05.580> some<00:01:05.939> reason<00:01:06.270> now<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
yesterday but for some reason now the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
yesterday but for some reason now the
bobbin<00:01:06.960> is<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.229> turning<00:01:07.770> and<00:01:07.920> therefore<00:01:08.549> the

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
bobbin is not turning and therefore the

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.840 
bobbin is not turning and therefore the
thread<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> tangling<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.520> raise

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
thread is tangling so that when I raise

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.440 
thread is tangling so that when I raise
the<00:01:12.150> presser<00:01:12.360> foot<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:14.030> attempt<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.180> get<00:01:15.299> this

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450
