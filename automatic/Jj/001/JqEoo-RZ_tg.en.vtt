00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.139 
let's get started
your<00:00:45.960> basic<00:00:46.200> tools<00:00:46.820> are<00:00:47.820> gonna<00:00:47.910> be<00:00:48.120> a

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
your basic tools are gonna be a

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
your basic tools are gonna be a
paintbrush<00:00:48.750> any<00:00:49.289> kind<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> quality<00:00:50.250> usually

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the kids ones are even better because

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.380 
the kids ones are even better because
the<00:00:52.800> nylon<00:00:54.110> bristles<00:00:55.110> are<00:00:55.320> good<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.860> glue

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
the nylon bristles are good for the glue

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.430 
the nylon bristles are good for the glue
you're<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> decoupage<00:00:58.140> medium

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
you're going to use a decoupage medium

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.549 
you're going to use a decoupage medium
or<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.129> clear<00:00:59.520> drying<00:00:59.820> glue<00:01:00.140> thinned<00:01:01.140> out<00:01:01.320> just

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
or a clear drying glue thinned out just

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.670 
or a clear drying glue thinned out just
a<00:01:01.680> little<00:01:01.710> bit<00:01:02.359> decoupage<00:01:03.359> medium<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:04.199> already

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
a little bit decoupage medium is already

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.710 
a little bit decoupage medium is already
thinned<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.850> you<00:01:05.970> can<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.210> use<00:01:06.360> it<00:01:06.390> straight

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
thinned so you can just use it straight

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.230 
thinned so you can just use it straight
out<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.470> jar<00:01:07.710> or<00:01:07.740> bottle<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.460> then

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
out of the the jar or bottle and then

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160 
out of the the jar or bottle and then
you're<00:01:09.930> blown<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.350> Easter<00:01:10.950> egg<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:12.170> tissue

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
you're blown out Easter egg and tissue

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
you're blown out Easter egg and tissue
paper<00:01:13.470> or<00:01:13.820> magazine<00:01:14.820> clippings<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.479> different

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
paper or magazine clippings of different

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.249 
paper or magazine clippings of different
colors<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.680> type<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.890> thing<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:18.259> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
colors and that type of thing and to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.370 
colors and that type of thing and to
start<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.549> tissue<00:01:21.180> paper<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.869> probably<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
start the tissue paper is probably the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.469 
start the tissue paper is probably the
easier<00:01:22.710> kind<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:23.580> probably<00:01:23.820> recommend<00:01:24.180> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
easier kind so I probably recommend to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.640 
easier kind so I probably recommend to
do<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:25.549> with<00:01:26.549> young<00:01:26.759> children<00:01:27.650> you

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
do that with with young children you

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.370 
do that with with young children you
know<00:01:28.770> probably<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.520> as<00:01:29.850> young<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.270> three<00:01:30.479> can

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
know probably as as young as three can

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.550 
know probably as as young as three can
do<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.680> crafts<00:01:32.040> pretty<00:01:32.280> easily<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.780> you're

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
do this crafts pretty easily and you're

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.690 
do this crafts pretty easily and you're
just<00:01:34.890> basically<00:01:35.189> going<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.460> cut<00:01:35.610> out<00:01:36.200> squares

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
just basically going to cut out squares

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.520 
just basically going to cut out squares
of<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.180> tissue<00:01:39.360> paper<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.900> different<00:01:40.200> colors

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
of the tissue paper in different colors

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.160 
of the tissue paper in different colors
and<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:41.329> can<00:01:42.329> also<00:01:42.509> cut<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.780> different

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
and you can also cut out different

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.760 
and you can also cut out different
shapes<00:01:43.790> but<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.850> found<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.270> squares<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
shapes but I found that squares have the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.950 
shapes but I found that squares have the
best<00:01:46.950> coverage<00:01:47.369> for<00:01:49.340> for<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> Easter<00:01:50.790> egg

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
best coverage for for the Easter egg

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740 
best coverage for for the Easter egg
shape<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:53.939> always<00:01:54.210> add<00:01:54.479> on

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
shape and you can always add on

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.889 
shape and you can always add on
different<00:01:55.290> different<00:01:56.189> shapes<00:01:56.689> like<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.810> you

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
different different shapes like if you

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.990 
different different shapes like if you
wanted<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.200> cut<00:01:58.409> out<00:01:58.530> maybe<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.189> tiny<00:01:59.790> little

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
wanted to cut out maybe a tiny little

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.980 
wanted to cut out maybe a tiny little
flower<00:02:00.119> or<00:02:01.670> you<00:02:02.670> know<00:02:02.790> maybe<00:02:02.939> some<00:02:03.299> circles<00:02:03.810> or

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
flower or you know maybe some circles or

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
flower or you know maybe some circles or
dots<00:02:04.280> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.340> always<00:02:05.579> add<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:06.000> on<00:02:06.180> later

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
dots you can always add those on later

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.169 
dots you can always add those on later
after<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.380> squares<00:02:07.979> are<00:02:08.310> put<00:02:08.670> onto<00:02:08.819> your<00:02:09.030> egg

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179

after your squares are put onto your egg
and<00:02:10.430> after<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:11.940> course<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.239> washed<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.280 
and it's been dried overnight and you're
just<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.800> to<00:02:16.890> take<00:02:17.099> your<00:02:17.250> decoupage<00:02:17.670> medium

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
just going to take your decoupage medium

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.199 
just going to take your decoupage medium
and<00:02:19.430> put<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.459> little<00:02:20.670> bit<00:02:21.470> onto<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:23.180> onto<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and put a little bit onto the onto the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.330 
and put a little bit onto the onto the
shell<00:02:24.560> about<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> size<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> one<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.250> these

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
shell about the size of one of these

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.020 
shell about the size of one of these
pieces<00:02:26.610> of<00:02:26.790> tissue<00:02:27.270> paper<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:32.000> you're<00:02:33.000> going

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
pieces of tissue paper and you're going

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.740 
pieces of tissue paper and you're going
to<00:02:33.450> smooth<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.470> tissue<00:02:34.680> paper<00:02:34.769> onto<00:02:35.220> it<00:02:35.750> it'll

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
to smooth the tissue paper onto it it'll

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.540 
to smooth the tissue paper onto it it'll
wrinkle<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.200> on<00:02:37.349> the<00:02:37.410> edges<00:02:37.800> because<00:02:38.430> of

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
wrinkle up on the edges because of

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.830 
wrinkle up on the edges because of
course<00:02:38.760> you're<00:02:38.910> putting<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.209> flat<00:02:39.480> piece<00:02:39.780> of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
course you're putting a flat piece of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.470 
course you're putting a flat piece of
tissue<00:02:40.410> paper<00:02:40.530> onto<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.130> round<00:02:41.400> surface<00:02:41.849> so

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
tissue paper onto a round surface so

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.580 
tissue paper onto a round surface so
there's<00:02:42.660> always<00:02:42.780> going<00:02:42.989> to<00:02:43.019> be<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.380> bit

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
there's always going to be a little bit

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.949 
there's always going to be a little bit
of<00:02:43.709> overlap<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.519> little<00:02:44.730> bit<00:02:44.880> of<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.480> little

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
of overlap and a little bit of a little

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.070 
of overlap and a little bit of a little
bit<00:02:46.080> of<00:02:46.170> creasing<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:48.209> as<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.569> see<00:02:48.630> from

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
bit of creasing but as you can see from

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.470 
bit of creasing but as you can see from
from<00:02:49.530> this<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.160> kind<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.459> makes<00:02:50.640> it<00:02:50.850> more

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
from this one it kind of makes it more

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.150 
from this one it kind of makes it more
interesting<00:02:51.840> because<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.500> color<00:02:52.709> then

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
interesting because the color then

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.630 
interesting because the color then
changes<00:02:54.090> with<00:02:54.269> each<00:02:54.299> crease<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.640> you're

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
changes with each crease and you're

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.280 
changes with each crease and you're
gonna<00:02:56.760> continue<00:02:57.239> doing<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.630> overlapping

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
gonna continue doing that overlapping

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.530 
gonna continue doing that overlapping
all<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> pieces<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.730> there's<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.180> full

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
all the pieces so there's a full

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.380 
all the pieces so there's a full
coverage<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:04.410> you're<00:03:04.680> gonna<00:03:04.940> cover<00:03:05.940> over

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
coverage and so you're gonna cover over

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:08.240 
coverage and so you're gonna cover over
a<00:03:06.630> little<00:03:07.019> bit<00:03:07.230> of<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.410> side<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.950> piece

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
a little bit of the side of the piece

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.400 
a little bit of the side of the piece
that<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.519> just<00:03:08.700> did<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.150> well<00:03:09.780> as<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.140> shell

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
that you just did as well as the shell

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.820 
that you just did as well as the shell
and<00:03:12.049> then<00:03:13.049> you're<00:03:13.200> gonna<00:03:13.290> put<00:03:13.530> your<00:03:13.650> next

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
and then you're gonna put your next

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.509 
and then you're gonna put your next
piece<00:03:14.040> on<00:03:14.220> and<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.220> great<00:03:17.400> thing

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
piece on and you can and the great thing

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.949 
piece on and you can and the great thing
about<00:03:17.579> tissue<00:03:17.910> paper<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.510> that<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.750> color

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
about tissue paper is that the color

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.530 
about tissue paper is that the color
shows<00:03:19.290> through<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.359> piece

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
shows through and of the piece

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.819 
shows through and of the piece
underneath<00:03:21.989> it<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.890> you<00:03:22.950> can<00:03:23.930> really<00:03:24.930> really

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
underneath it so you can really really

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.610 
underneath it so you can really really
make<00:03:26.010> some<00:03:26.220> cool<00:03:26.430> colors<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> mix<00:03:28.290> the

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
make some cool colors as you mix the

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.360 
make some cool colors as you mix the
different<00:03:29.340> ones<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.620> like<00:03:31.620> there<00:03:31.859> is<00:03:32.010> purple

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
different ones so like there is purple

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
different ones so like there is purple
and<00:03:32.489> green<00:03:32.700> together<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.359> you<00:03:34.290> know<00:03:34.350> just

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
and green together and you know just

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.360 
and green together and you know just
makes<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.799> cool<00:03:35.010> funky<00:03:35.370> color<00:03:35.579> and<00:03:37.370> after

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
makes a cool funky color and after

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.340 
makes a cool funky color and after
you've<00:03:38.519> put<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.819> a<00:03:38.910> couple<00:03:39.000> pieces<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:40.230> want

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
you've put on a couple pieces you want

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.819 
you've put on a couple pieces you want
to<00:03:40.440> go<00:03:40.560> back<00:03:40.769> and<00:03:41.180> smooth<00:03:42.180> down<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:43.380> creases

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
to go back and smooth down the creases

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:46.280 
to go back and smooth down the creases
by<00:03:44.489> painting<00:03:44.940> more<00:03:45.420> of<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> decoupage<00:03:46.109> medium

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
by painting more of the decoupage medium

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.050 
by painting more of the decoupage medium
on<00:03:46.980> top<00:03:47.040> of<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.840> this<00:03:49.019> helps<00:03:49.380> seal<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
on top of it and this helps seal the the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.629 
on top of it and this helps seal the the
decoration<00:03:51.569> as<00:03:51.690> well<00:03:51.889> as<00:03:52.889> well<00:03:53.130> as<00:03:53.220> give<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.519> a

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
decoration as well as well as give it a

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.840 
decoration as well as well as give it a
nice<00:03:53.819> glossy<00:03:54.150> coat<00:03:55.340> which<00:03:56.340> will<00:03:56.549> help<00:03:56.639> protect

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
nice glossy coat which will help protect

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.360 
nice glossy coat which will help protect
it<00:03:57.209> through<00:03:57.840> the<00:03:57.959> years<00:03:58.230> after<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.920> know<00:03:59.040> you

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
it through the years after you know you

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.729 
it through the years after you know you
put<00:03:59.579> it<00:03:59.670> on<00:03:59.790> your<00:03:59.910> table<00:04:00.090> this<00:04:00.690> year<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.170> put
