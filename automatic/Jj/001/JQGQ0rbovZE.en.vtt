water is really one of the central
challenges<00:00:05.980> of<00:00:06.130> Agriculture<00:00:06.730> and<00:00:06.970> it's<00:00:07.780> an

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:07.900 
challenges of Agriculture and it's an

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.360 
challenges of Agriculture and it's an
increasing<00:00:08.410> challenge<00:00:08.740> because<00:00:09.040> of<00:00:09.160> growing

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.040 
people are consuming more food and so we

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.279 
people are consuming more food and so we
need<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.309> produce<00:00:15.490> more<00:00:15.700> food<00:00:16.119> for<00:00:16.960> the<00:00:17.050> same

it's<00:00:32.680> a<00:00:32.829> question<00:00:33.220> of<00:00:33.340> how<00:00:33.940> can<00:00:34.000> we<00:00:34.390> help<00:00:34.750> to

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
it's a question of how can we help to

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.069 
it's a question of how can we help to
develop<00:00:35.559> practices<00:00:36.460> and<00:00:36.760> develop<00:00:37.510> technology

and there's chemical technology that we

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.590 
and there's chemical technology that we
called<00:01:38.799> C<00:01:39.009> treatment<00:01:39.250> which<00:01:40.149> basically

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
called C treatment which basically

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.260 
called C treatment which basically
called<00:01:41.409> secede<00:01:41.890> from<00:01:42.130> the<00:01:42.399> very<00:01:42.729> very<00:01:43.000> first

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
called secede from the very very first

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.510 
called secede from the very very first
day<00:01:43.509> of<00:01:43.689> existence<00:01:44.229> and<00:01:44.439> helps<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.219> to<00:01:45.340> grow

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
day of existence and helps it to grow

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.370 
day of existence and helps it to grow
they're<00:01:45.729> very<00:01:45.939> vigorously<00:01:46.450> and<00:01:46.750> to<00:01:47.109> build<00:01:47.229> a

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
they're very vigorously and to build a

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.559 
they're very vigorously and to build a
very<00:01:47.560> long<00:01:47.950> routing<00:01:48.429> system<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
very long routing system and the

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.719 
very long routing system and the
stronger<00:01:50.020> the<00:01:50.140> roots<00:01:50.350> are<00:01:50.530> the<00:01:51.250> more<00:01:51.490> they<00:01:51.670> can

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
stronger the roots are the more they can

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.999 
stronger the roots are the more they can
basically<00:01:52.240> draw<00:01:52.719> the<00:01:52.780> water<00:01:53.110> into<00:01:53.709> the<00:01:53.829> seed

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
basically draw the water into the seed

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.190 
basically draw the water into the seed
and<00:01:54.189> helped<00:01:54.490> pepper<00:01:54.729> to<00:01:54.939> grow<00:01:55.119> there's<00:01:55.899> a<00:01:55.990> very

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
and helped pepper to grow there's a very

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.809 
and helped pepper to grow there's a very
interesting<00:01:56.289> technology<00:01:57.219> which<00:01:57.369> we<00:01:57.610> call

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
interesting technology which we call

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:00.770 
interesting technology which we call
invincea<00:01:58.299> that<00:01:58.780> is<00:01:58.899> applied<00:01:59.229> normally<00:01:59.799> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
invincea that is applied normally to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.230 
invincea that is applied normally to
crops<00:02:01.780> after<00:02:02.259> harvest<00:02:02.709> and<00:02:02.920> people<00:02:03.729> recognize

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
crops after harvest and people recognize

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.719 
crops after harvest and people recognize
when<00:02:04.509> they<00:02:04.600> did<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:04.869> they<00:02:05.109> saw<00:02:05.950> that<00:02:06.340> the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
when they did that they saw that the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.449 
when they did that they saw that the
crops<00:02:07.000> were<00:02:07.470> withstanding<00:02:08.470> drought<00:02:09.009> periods
