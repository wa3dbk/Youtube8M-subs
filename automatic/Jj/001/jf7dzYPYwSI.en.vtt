 a genius of super globe in the gate and me 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.930
 Show yourself today how to get the new one 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.930
 summer trend tiebreaks 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.090
 Let my colleague Arianna and her 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.980
 hair are perfect concerning the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.380
 to produce and now we lay once 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 good with the department 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.590
 We should be aware of that in advance 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.600
 be clear in which direction we the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.830
 put crest and in which direction 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.320
 the waves should go 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.780
 in the most important case always or in the best 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.879
 Always fall the waves off your face 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 Let's leave the crest as they do 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.770
 They have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.199
 she has her hair last night 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.430
 washed and nothing made clean that no 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.190
 consolidate or something else in it 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.199
 for the waves namely the ghtc according to the 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.750
 is perfect for any kind of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.170
 There are curls and waves to make 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.119
 no limits with this device for one 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.490
 even at home is super simple the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 to lure yourself 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.240
 show again how we or how 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.660
 They are the fastest ones at home 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.660
 created 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.950
 that's important before we start 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.020
 the heat protection then applied 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 by title song a spray that is 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.900
 especially good for this fine hair 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.940
 ensures that the pointed closed 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.870
 there will be no new and the hair 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.550
 beautiful shines is important when 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.110
 you should be clear before here 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.610
 bigger the department is the bigger 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.930
 the wave here becomes smaller the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.840
 Department is the smaller the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.010
 mill for that happened or the gfg 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.280
 lay style 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.160
 diagonal to the hair turn on the strands 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.780
 180 degrees and a lot of lightly 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.980
 downward 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.960
 which is now so must that has no 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.660
 this is really only an impact 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.800
 the heat protection 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.200
 because of that we later one 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.060
 symmetrical wave want to see 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.370
 we too that we get these waves from the 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.660
 Turn right side down to the left 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.410
 and that we see the waves from the left 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:11.810
 turn right side down so maria 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.060
 now shows how to wave at home 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.710
 can manufacture or create best 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.010
 can 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.540
 she shares a strand where the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.810
 investors best always catch you down 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.340
 on 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.230
 there one becomes the top one lures the one 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.220
 did not break or make 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.220
 pulls apart again 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.000
 important is she is fighting the strand 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.510
 before that, the one divides 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.600
 camp by when you start is the 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
 thumb always first then clicks behind 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.050
 the strand 1 turns the strand around 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.540
 180 degrees forward that the thumb to 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.209
 mirror shows and goes in very slowly 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.260
 even movement down the way 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.850
 you make now strand by strand 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.530
 It is important that one strand 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.950
 created that leaves you alone 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.270
 not immediately combed with it directly 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.920
 can cool and so I loose too 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.920
 stays elastic 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.540
 Now we have those on the whole head 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.400
 curls created or created the waves 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 and so they do not stay focused 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.530
 the home would come through nicely with it 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.700
 Nice result you need 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.220
 Also do not be afraid if you are with 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.600
 choose or lure the jet skis tyler 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.150
 You can do it here so often 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.110
 know how you want to stay away from 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.520
 the wave received 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.590
 even after two three nights on it 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.200
 sleep the perfect festival hairstyle 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.700
 By the way , we are completely wearing now 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.700
 a little bit of shine spray on 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.260
 we created the beach boys like you 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.270
 See , it is super fast and 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.740
 super nice creates one quickly 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.630
 to be able to gain new ones with the wave 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.460
 be like e-mail that within 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.080
 seconds could be high for that 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.750
 we need a babble in wissel 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.960
 They are fantastically good for the hair 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.250
 to make braid without having to afterwards 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.350
 put or knot but otherwise 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.700
 Something you can do anytime 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:08.280
 make it out without the balance 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:11.220
 destroy the individual now so always 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.110
 strÃ¤hnchen something thicker bundled would come 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.130
 maybe stick it down to the 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:20.270
 beaches and pull the whole year 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.270
 Fold it up slightly 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.930
 as you can see, it is all completely 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.840
 fast within seconds you have 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.170
 one of a brisk hippie hairstyle 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.460
 directly conjured a hairstyle if you 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.340
 we would love to come by 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.660
 Show everything again in peace and quiet 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.660
 have fun
