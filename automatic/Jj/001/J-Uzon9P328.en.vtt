00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.630 

and<00:00:31.570> there<00:00:32.020> it<00:00:32.140> is

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.520 

this<00:00:40.640> is<00:00:40.760> not<00:00:40.910> very<00:00:40.940> stable<00:00:41.480> on<00:00:41.810> my<00:00:41.960> computer

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
this is not very stable on my computer

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.010 
this is not very stable on my computer
you're<00:00:42.980> about<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.090> see<00:00:44.300> it<00:00:44.450> crash<00:00:45.520> right<00:00:46.520> here

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
you're about to see it crash right here

00:00:47.020 --> 00:01:01.260 
you're about to see it crash right here
there's<00:00:48.020> no<00:00:48.170> response

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.180 

but<00:01:01.930> nevertheless<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.740> better<00:01:02.980> than

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
but nevertheless it's better than

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.660 
but nevertheless it's better than
nothing

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.300 

this<00:01:12.299> control-c<00:01:13.049> out<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:32.370 

and<00:01:16.880> close<00:01:17.570> out<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.200> X<00:01:18.409> server

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.530 

there<00:01:33.040> we<00:01:33.219> go

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
there we go

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.440 
there we go
this<00:01:35.110> next<00:01:35.440> one<00:01:35.710> is<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:36.280> little<00:01:36.670> more<00:01:36.880> practical

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
this next one is a little more practical

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.230 
this next one is a little more practical
it's<00:01:37.960> using<00:01:38.350> Explorer<00:01:39.070> as<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.940> window

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
it's using Explorer as the window

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's using Explorer as the window
manager<00:01:40.510> so<00:01:41.290> they're<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.440> gonna<00:01:41.560> be<00:01:41.710> running

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
manager so they're just gonna be running

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.070 
manager so they're just gonna be running
individual<00:01:42.700> programs<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.510> individual

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
individual programs and individual

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.400 
individual programs and individual
windows<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.120> Start<00:01:46.540> conquerer

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
windows and the Start conquerer

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.030 
windows and the Start conquerer
and<00:01:48.990> you'll<00:01:49.990> see<00:01:50.230> what<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.470> looks<00:01:50.650> like<00:01:50.740> and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
and you'll see what it looks like and

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.790 
and you'll see what it looks like and
couple<00:01:51.400> minutes<00:01:54.060> here<00:01:55.060> it<00:01:55.210> is<00:01:55.360> just<00:01:56.350> popped<00:01:56.620> up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
couple minutes here it is just popped up

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.570 
couple minutes here it is just popped up
underneath<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:59.500> shows<00:01:59.740> up<00:01:59.979> in<00:02:00.070> a<00:02:00.190> Vista

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
underneath and it shows up in a Vista

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.100 
underneath and it shows up in a Vista
window<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.410> it's<00:02:02.410> completely<00:02:03.780> it's<00:02:04.780> just<00:02:05.020> a

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
window and it's completely it's just a

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.190 
window and it's completely it's just a
regular<00:02:05.500> window<00:02:05.830> on<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.100> desktop<00:02:10.200> another

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
regular window on the desktop another

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.260 
regular window on the desktop another
solution<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:12.820> what<00:02:13.150> you're

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
solution to this this is what you're

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.160 
solution to this this is what you're
looking<00:02:13.390> to<00:02:13.600> do<00:02:13.870> is<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:15.600> windows<00:02:16.600> version<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
looking to do is a windows version of

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.560 
looking to do is a windows version of
KDE<00:02:17.590> which<00:02:17.920> is<00:02:18.100> just<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.459> applications<00:02:19.209> it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
KDE which is just the applications it's

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.530 
KDE which is just the applications it's
not<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.900> menu<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.590> everything<00:02:20.770> like<00:02:21.190> that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
not the menu and everything like that

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:29.830 
not the menu and everything like that
but<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.840> only<00:02:23.020> available<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:24.160> XP<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.880> under

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.800 

this<00:02:30.500> is<00:02:30.940> technically<00:02:31.940> running<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.450> Linux

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
this is technically running a Linux

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.540 
this is technically running a Linux
system<00:02:32.989> so<00:02:33.440> that's<00:02:33.769> why<00:02:33.890> we<00:02:34.040> have<00:02:34.190> Linux

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
system so that's why we have Linux

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.000 
system so that's why we have Linux
folders
