00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.819
 now a new procedure 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.190
 see for yourself which will give us double 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.970
 effect well protocol implies two 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:22.790
 The effect is not only strengthening the forest 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.870
 properties of facial tissue 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:29.510
 well, no fat pack face and for 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.880
 two they dose dependent the more 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.579
 the number of flashes especially banana 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.600
 clinical effect and many scooter these 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:43.039
 areas that need more correction 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.239
 his case is first and foremost greatest 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:50.480
 the number of flashes of course 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:55.399
 effect immediately this procedure altera rarely 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.420
 done every two to three years and its effect 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.760
 clinically he's on cumulative first 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.449
 the effect is visible immediately after the procedure, he 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.110
 expressed as a decrease in tissue 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:12.790
 soft lifting moving fabric 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.710
 at the same time goes in the impact zone and 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.320
 gradual cumulative effect 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.969
 which are expressed in three months and 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.670
 evaluated procedures there through 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:24.520
 three to four months due to what 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.369
 effect occurs 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.200
 this is not a wall lipolysis ultrasonic 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.359
 sensor 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.520
 working at different depths work with 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.009
 different tissues are from the masses 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.009
 level is fat packs or 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:43.359
 moving and cutting with mass 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.729
 axillary layer so the alter procedure 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:49.159
 registered in the category of people like 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.140
 the only non operational risk 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:57.289
 hardware impact have such 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.109
 Certification of course the procedure is comfortable 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.590
 and not left three meditation procedures not 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.600
 got out of the day she doesn't require falling out 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.410
 small society 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.420
 slight redness after the procedure 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.120
 comparable to the mask and 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.530
 to the patient 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 these developments at some events 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 because the main principle here is the printer 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.209
 and take to the deepest layers of fabric 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.090
 wherever it goes 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.159
 no radio frequency exposure by these 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.010
 the deepest skin exposure 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.459
 intact skin was prompted before 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.000
 with her conversion therefore here 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.769
 no rehabilitation required 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.930
 we personally do the markup according to this 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.989
 to the patient there case we want to process 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.180
 the camp specified first of all this pizza 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.190
 michel jarre packages and discuss 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.980
 moving midface also 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:59.290
 then antirate gear in order to 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.019
 make no mistake on the number of flashes 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.599
 there is a chance a clear line which 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.190
 allows us or the patient to be sure 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:09.209
 what we are moving 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.209
 proper management 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.239
 the procedure itself requires prior 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:23.920
 markup in order to clearly highlight 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:25.959
 zones which before processing before 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:34.329
 applying news ultrasonic gay 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:36.870
 for collecting is very hamburg my 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.480
 good and 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.480
 sufficiently portable patents 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:22.210
 they don't expect packages like face oval and 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:28.200
 himself from the fabric of the middle and upper parts 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:32.260
 century and if the problem is for the patient 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.450
 the most relevant dry parts we 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:37.380
 We want to hear as much as possible move 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.240
 on the bottom third if the problem 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.810
 move to and up and fat packs 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.110
 this is not such an important complaint 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:52.540
 patient accordingly we me and 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:54.940
 methodology and protocol desire of the patent itself 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.510
 the procedure I have said absolutely 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.130
 comfortably accompany the hatch before emma 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.730
 which leaves after twenty-thirty 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.330
 captive after the procedure we recommend to 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:09.310
 center 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:10.840
 three days to avoid insolation I will not allow not 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.310
 do with no other 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.820
 trim or 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.190
 and we invite for an inspection in a month 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.630
 control and then after 2 months for 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.630
 final zoo score
