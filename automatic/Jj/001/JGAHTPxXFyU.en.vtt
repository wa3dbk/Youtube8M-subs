clean<00:04:30.900> out<00:04:30.990> the<00:04:31.230> floor<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> carpet<00:04:32.100> put

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
clean out the floor of the carpet put

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.620 
clean out the floor of the carpet put
the<00:04:32.370> rear<00:04:32.520> section<00:04:32.880> and<00:04:33.000> then<00:04:33.090> I<00:04:33.210> can<00:04:33.390> put<00:04:33.570> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
the rear section and then I can put the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.740 
the rear section and then I can put the
Sikhs<00:04:33.900> back<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.350> with<00:04:35.190> all<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.000> fasteners

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
Sikhs back in with all the fasteners

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.090 
Sikhs back in with all the fasteners
because<00:04:37.170> some<00:04:37.410> of<00:04:37.440> them<00:04:37.560> were<00:04:37.710> missing<00:04:38.040> I

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
because some of them were missing I

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.050 
because some of them were missing I
couldn't<00:04:38.430> find<00:04:38.880> all<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.090> them<00:04:39.300> but<00:04:39.420> I<00:04:39.480> have<00:04:39.720> now

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
couldn't find all of them but I have now

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.060 
couldn't find all of them but I have now
now<00:04:42.060> onto<00:04:42.330> the<00:04:42.450> engine<00:04:42.690> which<00:04:43.230> still<00:04:43.710> hasn't

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
now onto the engine which still hasn't

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.680 
now onto the engine which still hasn't
spin<00:04:44.490> it<00:04:44.580> I<00:04:44.700> sort<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:44.940> know<00:04:45.060> how<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.240> fire<00:04:45.450> it<00:04:45.480> up

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
spin it I sort of know how to fire it up

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.510 
spin it I sort of know how to fire it up
but<00:04:46.560> I<00:04:46.860> remember<00:04:47.610> yesterday<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.390> mentioned<00:04:48.930> the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
but I remember yesterday I mentioned the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.510 
but I remember yesterday I mentioned the
starter<00:04:50.520> motor<00:04:50.550> solenoids<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:53.100> little<00:04:53.340> wire

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
starter motor solenoids the little wire

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.670 
starter motor solenoids the little wire
was<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.000> wrong<00:04:54.120> type<00:04:54.420> so<00:04:54.690> I<00:04:54.720> actually<00:04:55.050> you're

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
was the wrong type so I actually you're

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.230 
was the wrong type so I actually you're
probably<00:04:56.100> won't<00:04:56.370> be<00:04:56.430> NC<00:04:56.640> that<00:04:56.790> tool<00:04:56.940> but<00:04:57.120> those

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
probably won't be NC that tool but those

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.260 
probably won't be NC that tool but those
little<00:04:57.510> those<00:04:57.720> two<00:04:58.020> little<00:04:58.140> blue<00:04:58.470> tabs<00:04:58.860> down

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
little those two little blue tabs down

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.580 
little those two little blue tabs down
there<00:05:00.270> they're<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.930> male<00:05:01.920> and<00:05:02.160> female

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
there they're the male and female

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.580 
there they're the male and female
clothes<00:05:04.590> what<00:05:04.770> I<00:05:04.800> did<00:05:05.630> I've<00:05:06.630> got<00:05:06.810> this<00:05:06.960> spare

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
clothes what I did I've got this spare

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.100 
clothes what I did I've got this spare
room<00:05:07.800> out<00:05:07.920> of<00:05:07.950> a<00:05:08.040> TG<00:05:08.510> wreck<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:09.660> I<00:05:09.720> had<00:05:09.870> last

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
room out of a TG wreck that I had last

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.480 
room out of a TG wreck that I had last
year<00:05:10.260> i<00:05:11.480> used<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.690> original<00:05:13.490> starter

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:14.490 
year i used the original starter

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.940 
year i used the original starter
solenoid<00:05:14.670> wire<00:05:15.200> that<00:05:16.200> was<00:05:16.320> on<00:05:16.470> the<00:05:16.590> learned

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
solenoid wire that was on the learned

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.010 
solenoid wire that was on the learned
that<00:05:17.100> of<00:05:17.280> obviously<00:05:17.820> was<00:05:18.030> on<00:05:18.180> this<00:05:18.780> one

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
that of obviously was on this one

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.880 
that of obviously was on this one
because<00:05:19.140> it's<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:20.190> complete<00:05:20.580> one<00:05:21.470> so<00:05:22.470> i<00:05:22.500> just

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:22.890 
because it's a complete one so i just

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.610 
because it's a complete one so i just
cut<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.310> one<00:05:23.460> off<00:05:23.670> and<00:05:23.940> crimped<00:05:24.660> on<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.990> male

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
cut that one off and crimped on a male

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.620 
cut that one off and crimped on a male
plug<00:05:28.620> to<00:05:29.340> connect<00:05:29.610> to<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.850> female<00:05:30.090> one<00:05:30.450> which

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
plug to connect to the female one which

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.940 
plug to connect to the female one which
was<00:05:30.870> already<00:05:31.500> on<00:05:31.800> this<00:05:31.980> loom<00:05:32.250> on<00:05:32.520> this<00:05:32.910> car<00:05:33.150> so

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
was already on this loom on this car so

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.100 
was already on this loom on this car so
hopefully<00:05:34.950> that<00:05:35.130> will<00:05:36.120> be<00:05:36.180> good<00:05:36.690> enough<00:05:36.900> I

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
hopefully that will be good enough I

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.640 
hopefully that will be good enough I
still<00:05:37.410> got<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.560> screw<00:05:37.860> down<00:05:38.100> the<00:05:38.970> solenoid

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
still got a screw down the solenoid

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.670 
still got a screw down the solenoid
terminal<00:05:40.650> but<00:05:40.830> um<00:05:42.200> alright<00:05:43.200> can<00:05:43.440> that<00:05:43.560> all

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
terminal but um alright can that all

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.400 
terminal but um alright can that all
that<00:05:44.220> will<00:05:44.310> do<00:05:44.460> it's<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.940> bit<00:05:45.090> dodgy<00:05:45.300> but<00:05:45.510> as

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:46.410 
that will do it's a bit dodgy but as

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.750 
that will do it's a bit dodgy but as
long<00:05:46.590> as<00:05:46.620> it's<00:05:46.830> wrapped<00:05:47.040> up<00:05:47.190> with<00:05:47.340> electrical

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
long as it's wrapped up with electrical

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.360 
long as it's wrapped up with electrical
tape<00:05:47.790> I'm<00:05:48.060> sure<00:05:48.240> we'll<00:05:48.360> be<00:05:48.390> fine<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:49.830> did

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
tape I'm sure we'll be fine I did

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.250 
tape I'm sure we'll be fine I did
actually<00:05:50.490> tried<00:05:50.880> turning<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.900> over<00:05:52.020> before

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
actually tried turning it over before

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.780 
actually tried turning it over before
about<00:05:52.650> some<00:05:52.950> I<00:05:53.100> think<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.340> battery's<00:05:53.640> gone

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
about some I think the battery's gone

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.590 
about some I think the battery's gone
dead<00:05:53.910> so<00:05:54.630> I've<00:05:54.720> got<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.960> charge<00:05:55.170> it<00:05:55.290> up<00:05:56.600> apart

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 
dead so I've got to charge it up apart

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.060 
dead so I've got to charge it up apart
from<00:05:57.660> now<00:05:57.810> I<00:05:57.840> think<00:05:57.990> it's<00:05:58.290> ready<00:05:58.470> to<00:05:58.590> fire<00:05:58.770> to

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
from now I think it's ready to fire to

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.070 
from now I think it's ready to fire to
be<00:05:59.160> honest<00:05:59.400> I<00:05:59.640> die<00:06:00.330> I<00:06:00.480> can't<00:06:00.810> think<00:06:00.960> of

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
be honest I die I can't think of

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.780 
be honest I die I can't think of
anything<00:06:01.260> else<00:06:01.470> that<00:06:01.710> I<00:06:01.830> need<00:06:01.890> to<00:06:02.190> do<00:06:02.340> I've<00:06:02.550> got

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
anything else that I need to do I've got

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.870 
anything else that I need to do I've got
everything<00:06:03.180> hooked<00:06:03.510> up<00:06:03.780> fuel<00:06:04.140> spark<00:06:04.800> I<00:06:05.190> can

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
everything hooked up fuel spark I can

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.420 
everything hooked up fuel spark I can
now<00:06:06.000> turn<00:06:06.060> over<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.540> engine<00:06:06.660> by<00:06:06.930> hands<00:06:07.430> this

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
now turn over the engine by hands this

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.040 
now turn over the engine by hands this
is<00:06:08.550> this<00:06:08.730> is<00:06:08.850> how<00:06:08.940> you<00:06:09.000> tell<00:06:09.240> it's<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.690> Gemini

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050 
is this is how you tell it's a Gemini

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.510 
is this is how you tell it's a Gemini
standard<00:06:10.740> compression<00:06:11.130> it's<00:06:11.220> because<00:06:11.430> you

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
standard compression it's because you

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:15.470 
standard compression it's because you
can<00:06:11.610> turn<00:06:11.760> over<00:06:12.000> on<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.570> fan<00:06:12.870> belt<00:06:14.240> but<00:06:15.240> actually

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:15.480 
can turn over on a fan belt but actually

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:17.090 
can turn over on a fan belt but actually
no<00:06:15.540> that's<00:06:15.690> slipping<00:06:16.110> let's<00:06:16.860> be<00:06:16.950> on<00:06:17.040> a
