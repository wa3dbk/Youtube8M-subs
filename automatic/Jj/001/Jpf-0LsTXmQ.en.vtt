00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
pretty tough run offenses be able to

make plays like that and also getting
after<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.049> quarterback<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.650> think<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
after the quarterback I think you get a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.710 
after the quarterback I think you get a
very<00:01:41.520> well-rounded<00:01:41.880> outside<00:01:42.299> linebacker

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
very well-rounded outside linebacker

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that is not just a pure pass rusher but

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.190 
that is not just a pure pass rusher but
could<00:01:45.090> also<00:01:45.210> contribute<00:01:45.509> stopping<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.079> run

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
could also contribute stopping the run

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050
