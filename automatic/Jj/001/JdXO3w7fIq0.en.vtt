00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.920
 what to make and what to look out for if you want a plasma television 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.579
 to buy 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.090
 in this video 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 the tub refrigerators and televisions work 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.270
 what benefits they offer afterwards did they have and why being a greasy like 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.270
 a plasma TV 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.929
 television screens create images with the help of minuscule pixels 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.680
 pixels are taken 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.800
 each picsel consists of the colors red green and blue 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.510
 in a plasma tv channels pixels filled with a kind of grass 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.670
 that gas focuses on when an electric current flows through it 

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.819
 the texel then emits a red green and blue light or a combination 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.510
 thereof the 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.960
 for example, if the pixo emits red green and blue light at the same time, then it becomes 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.960
 that this together 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.310
 compared to the other imaging techniques LCD and submit 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.070
 plasma televisions over three claims 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.450
 this first advantage of plasma is that it achieves high contrast 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.420
 That means that compared to LCD and just the difference between the dark parts 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.210
 and the lights were distributed large is cost that makes for a nicer picture 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.050
 the second form of plasma is that it has fewer problems with motion blur 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.970
 means that fast-moving images on a plasma TV become sharper 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.330
 displayed on an LCD or touched right 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.690
 Coo in displaying a game's fast is sending sports competitions and action film 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.300
 difference clearly visible bah 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.990
 the third advantage of plasma is that the bridget price is more favorable than half 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.020
 we are very bold in other words the larger plasma screens are more favorable 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.570
 Priced show LCD and especially on a screen of the same size 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.520
 compared to the other imaging techniques lcd touch screen the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.750
 plasma televisions to make a number 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.440
 the first disadvantage of plasma televisions is the weight 

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:16.049
 Plasma televisions can also be heavy and therefore not easy 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:17.440
 topper 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.170
 6 Due to the technology used, laying televisions can become extremely slippery 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.110
 made no plasma televisions that were not possible at the time 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.859
 Plasma TVs often have a slightly lower validity that means it 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.859
 image is giving a whole lot less light than LCD 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.030
 the difference is limited, but is still very visible in a dense environment 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.449
 and although plasma televisions create moving images, they display in still 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:47.730
 image on a plasma TV is usually less sharp enough and dalseweg 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.930
 This difference is important to a new TV chef often like 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.930
 computer monitor 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.869
 the techniques used cannot make the plasma screen smaller 

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:04.609
 is then 32 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.650
 if you want to purchase a plasma TV choose a screen that is not too 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.909
 small but also not too big 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:15.329
 it assumes the place from which the viewing distance must be viewed 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.709
 between one and a half and three times the share amount to 4 dollars 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.709
 this does not apply to 3d televisions 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:30.749
 plasma TVs and available as HD ready or full HD addressed 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.980
 The last week's device is able to deliver a sharper image than the 

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:37.949
 device disadvantages 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.629
 until recently, both devices were really cheaper than full HD 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.859
 appliances the price difference is nowadays minimal avoided choice 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.859
 for a full hd plasma television is obvious 

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:57.189
 a bit of a weird thing that i first touched on the resolution of it 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.589
 screen 

00:03:58.589 --> 00:04:02.299
 The also display is made up of newsgroups pixels that are pixels 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.529
 are called 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:06.529
 The more pixels a TV has to get sharper images 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.869
 the pixels are arranged horizontally and vertically 

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:16.009
 and then sometimes I have to get a picture a tv is called hd ready 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:20.029
 if it has 720 pixels in a vertical image 

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:25.649
 A full HD TV also has 1080 pixels in the vertical image 

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:29.469
 full hd device has a lot more pixels and therefore gives a lot 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:32.469
 sharper image 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.110
 if you need the sound from how tv transfer digital image to for example one 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.919
 home cinema set 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:46.289
 Professor insists that the PVV must have the right type of digital audio 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:47.779
 outputs 

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:51.689
 for a week there exist a kind of the exits colak ciao herman cross 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:56.580
 Go to which needs to connect your TV had been an option 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.620
 You can also digitally transfer audio from your TV with an HDMI cable we do 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.369
 home cinemaset then needs available HDMI inputs 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.900
 televisions can make different types of connections with the others 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.139
 devices and with the internet 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.759
 the tour therefore does that of the peat is suitable for the connections that 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:23.319
 ours is important 

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:28.289
 if you want image from a pc to be displayed on your tv internet tv a 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:34.240
 tendon win needed so if sound from the PC to play has the TV 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.400
 a PC audio inputs 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.050
 if you want your tv can connect to the internet then the tv has it 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.280
 Dutchman who connects 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.720
 He rather thinks that the available online services are on a TV 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.620
 are determined by the manufacturer 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.620
 for the possibilities may differ 

00:05:55.509 --> 00:06:00.110
 in addition to the regular plasma TVs, the tray 2 should provide a dimensional image 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.240
 A 3D TV is also available 

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.169
 The 3D TV can display the same 2D images as a normal one 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.020
 Plasma television but as soon as a 3D TV 3 3 rights in the book the TV trumpets 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.799
 three-dimensional images 

00:06:13.799 --> 00:06:17.519
 some models also have software that is normal 2D 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:22.069
 can provide images with at least three citizens for all models that applies 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.369
 Always wear special glasses at concerts to view images in 3D 

00:06:26.049 --> 00:06:30.329
 the price difference between 3D TV and regular TVs in the same segment 

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:33.759
 is limited which makes the choice for 3d attractive 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:36.939
