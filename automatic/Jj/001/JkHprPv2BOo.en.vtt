the only reason i think bethesda would
do<00:05:09.190> this<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.490> because<00:05:09.639> it<00:05:09.880> seems<00:05:10.090> like<00:05:10.180> that's

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:10.449 
do this is because it seems like that's

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.939 
do this is because it seems like that's
kind<00:05:10.539> of<00:05:10.690> about<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.020> business<00:05:11.260> strategy<00:05:11.590> of

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949
