what<00:03:04.480> everyone<00:03:04.870> had<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.190> overall<00:03:06.910> slow<00:03:07.330> play

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
what everyone had but overall slow play

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.910 
what everyone had but overall slow play
was<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.989> was<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.260> thing<00:03:08.440> with<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.709> the<00:03:08.800> guys

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
was that was the thing with all the guys

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.340 
was that was the thing with all the guys
behind<00:03:09.190> an<00:03:09.520> unnecessarily<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.570> would<00:03:11.140> just

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
generally lead there I think that you

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.900 
generally lead there I think that you
can<00:03:13.660> start<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:14.280> look<00:03:15.280> a<00:03:15.370> little<00:03:15.489> suspicious

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
can start to look a little suspicious

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.140 
can start to look a little suspicious
when<00:03:16.239> you're<00:03:16.420> popping<00:03:17.380> everybody<00:03:17.769> preflop<00:03:18.340> I

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
stick 36,000 in well does he I think

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.930
