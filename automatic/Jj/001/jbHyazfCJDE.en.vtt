00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.220
 Hi, I 'm here again and today I'm with 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:12.179
 A Makeup Makeup Tip Not In The 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.960
 truth is a button tip in the make 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.910
 Yourself Your Winter Rose Lipstick 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:23.460
 so I was looking for pink lipstick 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.460
 of those more closed darker so 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 Winter even I did not have but I 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.059
 I was crazy to use it so I kind of 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.399
 of a mixture of yale and find out how 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.010
 make a rose lipstick from those in hell 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.010
 and it's just a little quick and 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 I was saying this is really a tip 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.760
 Sorry you 're fond of the bar. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.860
 some noise that has construction by 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.360
 all sides here has a building in 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.340
 construction here on the side to which they are 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.480
 reforming so you must have heard 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.930
 a boring noise but do what right 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.760
 So it 's a really quick tip to 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.880
 You 're at the beginning. 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.080
 first you will need a lipstick 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.549
 This one I 'm going to use is from the hillside and 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.670
 coast 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.860
 I do not know how to pronounce it. 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:21.570
 peeling it is a rose of those well 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.400
 open even know those good pinks 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.350
 you will be wide open and you will use 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.049
 basically a lipstick that you have on 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:36.509
 your pink house and a red that's here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.509
 red I'm going to use the vult I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:48.619
 Loved this lipstick it's very very beautiful and 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:48.619
 he is the 0 1 0 1 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.270
 so you'll only think about it 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.720
 first you will pass the lipstick 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.720
 rosinha 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:22.750
 still well pink well open 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:25.300
 the pink chewing gum really is what you 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.740
 They will need to do is take some of the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.060
 red lipstick with the same finger and pass 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.060
 over that rose 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.750
 I'll do just below first 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.750
 for you to see the difference 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.760
 also of the difference it gives it becomes a 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.760
 pink more closed pink more winter 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:10.260
 Look what I do up there. 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.710

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.730
 You're seeing with a lot closer pink. 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.880
