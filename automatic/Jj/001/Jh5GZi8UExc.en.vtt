00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.180 
our cited by tool and just make this a
little<00:00:30.630> easier<00:00:30.840> let's<00:00:31.850> maximize<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:33.210> guy

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.910 

all<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.579> across<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.530> cited<00:00:40.800> by

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
all the way across so what the cited by

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
all the way across so what the cited by
tool<00:00:41.219> is<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.989> follows<00:00:42.989> my<00:00:43.200> active

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
tool is it actually follows my active

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.770 
tool is it actually follows my active
reference<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.219> searches<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:45.420> in<00:00:45.570> this

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
reference and it searches here in this

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.630 
reference and it searches here in this
case<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.260> entire<00:00:46.590> library<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.280> places<00:00:47.610> where

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
case the entire library for places where

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
case the entire library for places where
my<00:00:48.059> active<00:00:48.600> reference<00:00:49.110> matthew<00:00:49.590> 28<00:00:49.890> person

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
my active reference matthew 28 person

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.250 
my active reference matthew 28 person
one<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> cited<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.420> here<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.809> listing<00:00:52.140> all

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
one is cited so here it's listing all

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
one is cited so here it's listing all
sorts<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.770> hits<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.129> Matthew<00:00:53.399> 28<00:00:53.670> one<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
sorts of hits where Matthew 28 one is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.939 
sorts of hits where Matthew 28 one is
cited<00:00:54.390> now<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.289> thing<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> can<00:00:55.620> do<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
cited now one thing you can do with the

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.920 
cited now one thing you can do with the
cited<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.309> tool<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.820> mean<00:00:56.969> I've<00:00:57.329> got<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:57.870> or

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
cited by tool I mean I've got two or

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.180 
cited by tool I mean I've got two or
three<00:00:58.050> thousand<00:00:58.379> resources<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.949> probably

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
three thousand resources here probably

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.770 
three thousand resources here probably
so<00:00:59.460> that's<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.120> lot<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> resources

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
so that's all that's a lot of resources

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.810 
so that's all that's a lot of resources
I<00:01:01.199> can<00:01:01.620> narrow<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.309> collection

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I can narrow it down by collection

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.240 
I can narrow it down by collection
before<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.780> started<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.530> video<00:01:04.890> i<00:01:04.920> made<00:01:05.189> a

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
before I started this video i made a

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.630 
before I started this video i made a
collection<00:01:05.729> called<00:01:06.350> matthew<00:01:07.640> commentaries

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
right here because i figured that

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
right here because i figured that
Matthew<00:01:11.100> commentaries<00:01:11.610> might<00:01:11.790> be<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> fun

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
Matthew commentaries might be a fun

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.080 
Matthew commentaries might be a fun
thing<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.390> search<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.700> I've<00:01:14.820> selected

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
thing to search so here I've selected

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.270 
thing to search so here I've selected
that<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> doing<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> it's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that and what this is doing is it's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.380 
that and what this is doing is it's
searching<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:17.700> list<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.060> Matthew

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
searching my list of Matthew

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.300 
searching my list of Matthew
commentaries<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.560> all<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> places<00:01:20.009> where

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
commentaries for all the places where

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.690
