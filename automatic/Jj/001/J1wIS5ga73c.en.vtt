00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.050 
one flies right over the tomato well go
ahead<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.120> start<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.870> match

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.999 

I<00:01:09.119> do<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.810> part<00:01:10.079> it's<00:01:10.320> kind<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.560> tricky<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.860> keep

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
I do a part it's kind of tricky to keep

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:13.969 
I do a part it's kind of tricky to keep
both<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.759> these<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.479> screen<00:01:13.049> but<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:13.439> will<00:01:13.680> do<00:01:13.799> my

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
both of these in screen but I will do my

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.420 
both of these in screen but I will do my
best<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:16.140> synchronization<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.100> just

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
best and the synchronization is just

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.819 
best and the synchronization is just
fine<00:01:17.729> with<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> game<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:18.990> both

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829 
fine with the game as you can see both

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.490 
fine with the game as you can see both
show<00:01:20.159> hit<00:01:20.460> running<00:01:20.789> around<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:21.390> fine<00:01:21.600> here

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
show hit running around just fine here

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.109 
show hit running around just fine here
we<00:01:22.590> have<00:01:22.740> our<00:01:22.829> first<00:01:23.070> tomato<00:01:23.340> drop<00:01:23.700> on<00:01:23.970> the

and try one more time this time we will

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:58.820 
and try one more time this time we will

have the 2ds host to the group and we'll

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.010

synchronizing<00:02:12.239> issues<00:02:12.510> will<00:02:12.780> occur<00:02:13.109> fairly

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
synchronizing issues will occur fairly

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.580 
synchronizing issues will occur fairly
frequently<00:02:14.579> just<00:02:15.239> because<00:02:15.600> on<00:02:15.930> one<00:02:16.140> game<00:02:16.380> it

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
frequently just because on one game it

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.380 
frequently just because on one game it
sees<00:02:16.829> the<00:02:17.280> item<00:02:17.519> as<00:02:17.609> a<00:02:17.640> tomato<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.180> on<00:02:18.299> the

exactly<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:24.540> character<00:02:25.079> gets<00:02:25.290> injured

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
exactly and one character gets injured

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.770 
exactly and one character gets injured
earlier<00:02:26.220> than<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.489> should<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.359> causes<00:02:27.750> a

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
earlier than it should it causes a

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.650 
earlier than it should it causes a
desync<00:02:28.170> in<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.470> game<00:02:28.850> so<00:02:29.850> here<00:02:30.120> we<00:02:30.239> have<00:02:30.329> Mega

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
desync in the game so here we have Mega

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.870 
desync in the game so here we have Mega
Man<00:02:30.840> vs<00:02:31.200> Jigglypuff<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.040> as<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.310> can<00:02:32.400> see<00:02:32.579> his

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
Man vs Jigglypuff and as you can see his

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.449 
Man vs Jigglypuff and as you can see his
metal<00:02:33.870> blades<00:02:34.079> spawn<00:02:34.350> as<00:02:34.530> tomatoes<00:02:34.980> and<00:02:35.220> the

metal blades spawn as tomatoes and the

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.970 
metal blades spawn as tomatoes and the
change<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.850> hitbox<00:02:36.440> causes<00:02:37.440> an<00:02:37.560> error<00:02:39.980> go

you will see that the tomato grows in

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.140 
you will see that the tomato grows in
size<00:04:06.860> just<00:04:07.370> as<00:04:08.240> the<00:04:08.360> beam<00:04:08.510> sword<00:04:08.780> does<00:04:10.150> but

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
size just as the beam sword does but

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:12.400 
size just as the beam sword does but
you'll<00:04:11.240> notice<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.750> beam<00:04:12.050> sword

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410

extends<00:04:12.950> all<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.250> way<00:04:13.460> past<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:14.810> gust

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:15.140 
extends all the way past the gust

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.440 
extends all the way past the gust
bellows<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.830> tomato<00:04:16.130> does<00:04:16.370> not<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:17.000> hitbox

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
bellows the tomato does not the hitbox

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.870 
bellows the tomato does not the hitbox
has<00:04:17.720> been<00:04:17.750> reduced<00:04:18.410> to<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:19.400> size<00:04:19.580> of<00:04:19.760> the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
has been reduced to the size of the

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.840 
has been reduced to the size of the
tomato<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.720> if<00:04:20.900> I<00:04:21.049> were<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.230> hit<00:04:21.500> Rob<00:04:21.739> with<00:04:22.070> the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
tomato so if I were to hit Rob with the

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.450 
tomato so if I were to hit Rob with the
beam<00:04:23.450> sword<00:04:23.810> he<00:04:24.470> would<00:04:24.590> be<00:04:24.710> hit<00:04:24.860> much<00:04:25.040> earlier

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
beam sword he would be hit much earlier

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.280
