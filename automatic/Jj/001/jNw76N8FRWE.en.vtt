find<00:00:12.420> on<00:00:13.080> moon<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.340> basically<00:00:14.820> to<00:00:14.969> get<00:00:15.120> on

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
find on moon this is basically to get on

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.200 
find on moon this is basically to get on
top<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.690> sky<00:00:15.900> barrier<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.710> walk<00:00:16.980> around

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
top of the sky barrier and walk around

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.250 
top of the sky barrier and walk around
infinitely<00:00:18.210> wherever<00:00:18.810> you<00:00:18.960> want<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.199> go

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
infinitely wherever you want to go

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.340 
infinitely wherever you want to go
really<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.150> what<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> need<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> do<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.260> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
really so what you need to do is do the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.470 
really so what you need to do is do the
knife<00:00:22.529> lunge<00:00:22.740> glitch<00:00:23.060> I've<00:00:24.060> explained<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
knife lunge glitch I've explained that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.050 
knife lunge glitch I've explained that
in<00:00:24.600> many<00:00:24.720> other<00:00:25.019> videos<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.880> should<00:00:27.029> know

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
in many other videos so you should know

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.519 
in many other videos so you should know
how<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.269> do<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.449> at<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.599> point<00:00:27.869> if<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.140> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
how to do it at this point if not just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.620 
how to do it at this point if not just
look<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:29.010> should<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.279> easy<00:00:29.400> enough<00:00:29.630> come

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
look it up it should be easy enough come

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.200 
look it up it should be easy enough come
over<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.019> lunar<00:00:31.380> lander<00:00:31.710> with

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
over to this lunar lander with

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.319 
over to this lunar lander with
decompression<00:00:33.210> in<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.870> still<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.739> so<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:36.180> low

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
decompression in the still on so not low

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.810 
decompression in the still on so not low
gravity<00:00:36.770> have<00:00:37.770> flopper<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.579> you'll<00:00:38.670> do

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
gravity have flopper and then you'll do

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.310 
gravity have flopper and then you'll do
the<00:00:38.940> glitch<00:00:39.030> where<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.570> flying<00:00:39.989> up<00:00:40.200> and

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
the glitch where you go flying up and

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.690 
the glitch where you go flying up and
what<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.590> want<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> do<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.309> he<00:00:41.489> does

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
what you want to do is one where he does

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.549 
what you want to do is one where he does
and<00:00:41.969> aim<00:00:42.450> right<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.110> corner<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
and aim right for this corner of the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.470 
and aim right for this corner of the
biodome<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.700> slide<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:44.969> but<00:00:45.329> keep

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
biodome and just slide down but keep

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.930 
biodome and just slide down but keep
pulling<00:00:46.050> back<00:00:46.289> basically<00:00:46.879> eventually<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
pulling back basically eventually the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
pulling back basically eventually the
slide<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.329> corner<00:00:48.690> gets<00:00:48.840> stuck<00:00:49.110> from<00:00:49.320> here

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
slide this corner gets stuck from here

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.549 
slide this corner gets stuck from here
all<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.700> crouched<00:00:51.199> stand<00:00:52.199> up<00:00:52.350> and

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
all you can do is crouched stand up and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090 
all you can do is crouched stand up and
look<00:00:52.800> around<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> do<00:00:56.070> is

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
look around so what you need to do is

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
look around so what you need to do is
wait<00:00:56.640> now<00:00:56.910> until<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:58.910> excavator<00:01:00.410> comes<00:01:01.410> over

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
wait now until the excavator comes over

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.770 
wait now until the excavator comes over
and<00:01:01.770> breaches<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> biodome<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.629> does

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
and breaches the biodome when it does

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
and breaches the biodome when it does
that<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.260> some<00:01:04.530> reason<00:01:04.559> it'll<00:01:05.070> free<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.339> of

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that for some reason it'll free you of

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.910 
that for some reason it'll free you of
being<00:01:05.909> stuck<00:01:06.390> you'll<00:01:06.780> basically<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.590> able<00:01:07.860> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
being stuck you'll basically be able to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.469 
being stuck you'll basically be able to
move<00:01:08.040> around<00:01:08.189> then<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> wait<00:01:09.330> we

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
move around then but you have to wait we

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
move around then but you have to wait we
got<00:01:09.630> lucky<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.200> came<00:01:10.380> pretty<00:01:11.159> much<00:01:11.310> as

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
got lucky and it came pretty much as

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.670 
got lucky and it came pretty much as
soon<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.700> he<00:01:11.790> did<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> glitch<00:01:12.409> so<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.590> it

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
soon as he did the glitch so what it

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.320 
soon as he did the glitch so what it
does<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.040> comes<00:01:14.220> up<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.670> breaches<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
does it comes up and it breaches it and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.520 
does it comes up and it breaches it and
instantly<00:01:15.659> you'll<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> able<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.350> move

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
instantly you'll be able to move

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.690 
instantly you'll be able to move
basically<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.100> if<00:01:20.100> you're<00:01:20.430> not<00:01:20.549> already

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
basically but then if you're not already

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
basically but then if you're not already
up<00:01:20.939> here<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.630> reaches<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.170> won't<00:01:22.380> be

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
up here and it reaches it you won't be

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
up here and it reaches it you won't be
able<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> do<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.920> anymore<00:01:23.100> because<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.939> gets

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
able to do it anymore because it gets

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
able to do it anymore because it gets
rid<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.600> this<00:01:24.689> big<00:01:25.110> sis<00:01:25.259> barrier<00:01:25.680> basically<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
rid of this big sis barrier basically it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.850 
rid of this big sis barrier basically it
makes<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> high<00:01:26.700> barrier<00:01:27.500> once<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.590> reaches

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
makes the high barrier once it reaches

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.289 
makes the high barrier once it reaches
that<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.040> going<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> walk<00:01:29.369> around<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.090> try

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that you're going to walk around and try

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
that you're going to walk around and try
and<00:01:30.450> wiggle<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.840> way<00:01:30.990> out<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.500> being<00:01:31.979> stuck

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
and wiggle your way out of being stuck

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.560 
and wiggle your way out of being stuck
in<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> wall<00:01:32.670> once<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.000> do<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.299> heat<00:01:33.450> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
in the wall once you do like heat is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.490 
in the wall once you do like heat is
right<00:01:33.720> here<00:01:33.900> you're<00:01:33.990> gonna<00:01:34.079> walk<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> little

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
right here you're gonna walk a little

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.380 
right here you're gonna walk a little
bit<00:01:34.650> forward<00:01:35.009> just<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:35.640> walk<00:01:35.850> off<00:01:36.060> because

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
bit forward just don't walk off because

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
bit forward just don't walk off because
there<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> death<00:01:36.810> bear<00:01:37.020> down<00:01:37.170> there<00:01:37.409> sprint

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
there is a death bear down there sprint

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.590 
there is a death bear down there sprint
and<00:01:38.460> jump<00:01:38.640> forward<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.150> then<00:01:39.329> you'll<00:01:39.479> be<00:01:39.509> able

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
and jump forward and then you'll be able

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.289 
and jump forward and then you'll be able
to<00:01:39.780> walk<00:01:39.930> up<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.290> dome<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.030> then<00:01:42.030> from<00:01:42.210> here

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
to walk up the dome and then from here

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.880 
to walk up the dome and then from here
you'll<00:01:42.750> eventually<00:01:43.020> just<00:01:43.409> breach<00:01:43.649> right

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you'll eventually just breach right

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
you'll eventually just breach right
through<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> dome<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.820> land<00:01:45.119> on<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.329> little

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
through the dome and land on a little

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.109 
through the dome and land on a little
high<00:01:45.689> barrier<00:01:46.399> from<00:01:47.399> here<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.909> want<00:01:48.090> to

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
high barrier from here you want to

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.609 
high barrier from here you want to
probably<00:01:48.299> stick<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.930> walking<00:01:49.140> along<00:01:49.500> the

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
probably stick to walking along the

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
probably stick to walking along the
pathway<00:01:49.979> because<00:01:50.159> there<00:01:50.250> are<00:01:50.369> death<00:01:50.579> barriers

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
pathway because there are death barriers

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
pathway because there are death barriers
randomly<00:01:51.299> outside<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.960> map<00:01:52.340> but<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.399> can

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
randomly outside the map but you can

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.270 
randomly outside the map but you can
really<00:01:53.610> go<00:01:53.820> anywhere<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> let's<00:01:55.860> about<00:01:56.070> at<00:01:56.189> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
really go anywhere so let's about at the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.410 
really go anywhere so let's about at the
