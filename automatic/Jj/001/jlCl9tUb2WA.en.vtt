 or people this time I'm 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.339
 presenting the classic overdrive of mx 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.620
 be a super pedal to color the 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.710
 signal to give a bit of sustain to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.030
 the xolos to give you some gain 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.690
 Cochinaditas the clean signal of your

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.100
 to use I had 33 knobs is the crazy 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.590
 that the amount of signal mix of your 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
 pedal the tone that is the way the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 qualy zas and the yen that is a quantity 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.100
 of distortion or the amount of dirt 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 to put it another way that you're going to 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.350
 give your signal 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.500
 it's a pedal that is powered by 9 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 volts or so with an adapter almost 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 ordinary and with a battery 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.950
 anyone 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.059
 well then I'll explain 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.530
 how is equipment connected this time to the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.540
 guitar signal goes directly to the pedal 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.390
 mx r 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.280
 which in turn goes to the marched to jmp 1 that 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.610
 It is an amplifier with clean channel 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.370
 of the marshall comes directly from 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.950
 Cabinet simulator from back and goes 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:15.190
 towards the focusrite towards the channel 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:17.290
 my card and computer input 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.160
 I'm using a guitar added them 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.650
 paul with ropes and 1046 of the mark of 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.690
 working 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.250
 any query anything that 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.710
 want to know can write it 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.640
 directly in the video and I'll answer what 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.640
 fastest possible 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.869
