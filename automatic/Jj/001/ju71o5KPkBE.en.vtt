game with 10 hours played most of that
being<00:01:29.159> story<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.670> only<00:01:29.790> eleven<00:01:30.180> percent

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
being story I was only eleven percent

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.969 
being story I was only eleven percent
through<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.810> game<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.619> there's<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.860> lot<00:01:31.920> of

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
through the game so there's a lot of

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
through the game so there's a lot of
content<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.060> amount<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
content there and just the the amount of

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
content there and just the the amount of
stuff<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.320> do<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.770> not<00:01:37.979> even

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
stuff you can do that's not even

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.300 
stuff you can do that's not even
relevant<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.570> anything<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.229> pretty<00:01:40.680> crazy<00:01:40.950> so

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.320 
read off the hard drive because the game
looks<00:05:12.840> really<00:05:13.410> good<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.890> is<00:05:14.520> 720p<00:05:15.090> for

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
looks really good it is 720p for

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.660 
looks really good it is 720p for
consoles<00:05:15.810> but<00:05:16.470> there<00:05:16.620> is<00:05:16.740> no<00:05:16.920> frame<00:05:17.220> rate<00:05:17.400> dips

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
consoles but there is no frame rate dips

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.280 
consoles but there is no frame rate dips
the<00:05:17.880> frame<00:05:18.120> rate<00:05:18.300> seems<00:05:18.570> to<00:05:18.750> be<00:05:18.840> just<00:05:19.050> based

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
the frame rate seems to be just based

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.070 
the frame rate seems to be just based
off<00:05:19.470> my<00:05:19.530> eyes<00:05:19.950> it's<00:05:20.460> probably<00:05:20.970> not<00:05:21.090> 60<00:05:21.690> but

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
off my eyes it's probably not 60 but

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.190 
off my eyes it's probably not 60 but
it's<00:05:22.200> probably<00:05:22.650> good<00:05:22.890> 45<00:05:23.880> to<00:05:24.210> 50<00:05:24.660> frames<00:05:24.900> per

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
it's probably good 45 to 50 frames per

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.010 
it's probably good 45 to 50 frames per
second<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.650> looks<00:05:25.830> good<00:05:26.010> and<00:05:26.130> there's<00:05:26.280> no<00:05:26.430> real

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
second it looks good and there's no real

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.300 
second it looks good and there's no real
stuttering<00:05:28.020> I<00:05:28.200> haven't<00:05:28.680> noticed<00:05:28.920> it<00:05:29.040> I've<00:05:29.130> got

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
stuttering I haven't noticed it I've got

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.680 
stuttering I haven't noticed it I've got
a<00:05:29.340> pretty<00:05:29.490> good<00:05:29.670> eye<00:05:29.730> for<00:05:29.850> that<00:05:30.150> stuff<00:05:30.390> since<00:05:30.570> I

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
frame rates and stuff a lot but there's

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.750 
frame rates and stuff a lot but there's
really<00:05:37.320> no<00:05:38.480> dips<00:05:39.480> not<00:05:40.290> that<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.530> can<00:05:40.740> notice<00:05:41.040> so
