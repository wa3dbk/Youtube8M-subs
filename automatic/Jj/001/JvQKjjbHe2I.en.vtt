and rest it for around 10 to 15 minutes

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.210 
and rest it for around 10 to 15 minutes
after<00:02:24.910> which<00:02:25.480> we'll<00:02:25.840> roll<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.380> tape<00:02:26.620> last<00:02:26.830> so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
after which we'll roll the tape last so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.830 
after which we'll roll the tape last so
we<00:02:27.340> have<00:02:27.460> rested<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> dough<00:02:28.180> for<00:02:28.420> around<00:02:28.570> 10

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
we have rested the dough for around 10

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.770 
we have rested the dough for around 10
to<00:02:28.990> 15<00:02:29.320> minutes<00:02:29.680> let's<00:02:30.280> take<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.330> dough<00:02:31.540> and

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
to 15 minutes let's take the dough and

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.560 
to 15 minutes let's take the dough and
divide<00:02:31.810> into<00:02:32.560> small<00:02:33.490> portions<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:37.300> we<00:02:37.420> have

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
divide into small portions so we have

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.540 
divide into small portions so we have
divided<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.110> dough<00:02:38.350> into<00:02:38.709> small<00:02:38.920> portions

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
divided the dough into small portions

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.060 
divided the dough into small portions
now<00:02:40.000> let's<00:02:40.360> take<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.050> portion<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.890> dough

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
now let's take a portion of the dough

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.120 
now let's take a portion of the dough
dip<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.730> in<00:02:42.880> dry<00:02:43.240> flour<00:02:43.540> so<00:02:44.380> that<00:02:44.410> it<00:02:44.830> does<00:02:45.100> not

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
dip it in dry flour so that it does not

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.090 
dip it in dry flour so that it does not
stick<00:02:45.520> to<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.209> chopping<00:02:46.959> board<00:02:47.170> or<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.980> the

stick to the chopping board or to the

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.500 
stick to the chopping board or to the
surface<00:02:48.550> on<00:02:48.700> which<00:02:48.850> you're<00:02:49.060> going<00:02:49.209> to<00:02:49.300> roll

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
surface on which you're going to roll

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.220 
surface on which you're going to roll
the<00:02:49.810> thepla<00:02:50.650> okay<00:02:51.640> we'll<00:02:52.239> take<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.480> rolling<00:02:52.959> pin

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
the thepla okay we'll take a rolling pin

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.699 
the thepla okay we'll take a rolling pin
or<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.530> beylin<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.160> roll<00:02:54.610> it<00:02:54.790> out<00:02:54.940> into<00:02:55.120> a<00:02:55.300> thin

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
or a beylin and roll it out into a thin

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
or a beylin and roll it out into a thin
rounded<00:02:56.709> if<00:02:56.980> you<00:02:57.100> feel<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.700> your<00:02:57.850> dough<00:02:58.060> it's

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
rounded if you feel that your dough it's

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.050 
rounded if you feel that your dough it's
sticking<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.830> bottom<00:03:00.130> of<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.520> surface

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
sticking to the bottom of the surface

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.680 
sticking to the bottom of the surface
you<00:03:01.570> can<00:03:01.750> dust<00:03:02.530> some<00:03:02.950> more<00:03:03.160> flour<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.790> roll<00:03:04.570> it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
you can dust some more flour and roll it

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.960 
you can dust some more flour and roll it
out<00:03:04.810> evenly<00:03:07.770> so<00:03:08.770> tape<00:03:09.070> line<00:03:09.310> is<00:03:09.430> now<00:03:09.550> ready<00:03:09.850> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
out evenly so tape line is now ready and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.970 
out evenly so tape line is now ready and
roll<00:03:10.330> let's<00:03:10.750> prepare<00:03:11.140> some<00:03:11.350> more<00:03:11.530> tape<00:03:11.799> lies

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
roll let's prepare some more tape lies

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.800 
roll let's prepare some more tape lies
in<00:03:12.130> the<00:03:12.250> similar<00:03:12.640> way<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.030> we<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.330> rolled<00:03:13.630> out

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
in the similar way so we have rolled out

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.350 
in the similar way so we have rolled out
some<00:03:14.080> of<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.380> tape<00:03:14.560> last<00:03:14.799> and<00:03:15.130> I've<00:03:15.700> also<00:03:15.940> put

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
some of the tape last and I've also put

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.550 
some of the tape last and I've also put
a<00:03:16.570> nonstick<00:03:17.080> pan<00:03:17.140> on<00:03:17.560> heat<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.640> let's<00:03:18.880> place

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
a nonstick pan on heat so let's place

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.320 
a nonstick pan on heat so let's place
this<00:03:20.560> tape<00:03:20.920> 'la<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.370> we'll<00:03:21.820> cook<00:03:22.060> the

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
this tape 'la and we'll cook the

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.090 
this tape 'la and we'll cook the
underside<00:03:22.870> after<00:03:23.290> which<00:03:23.470> we'll<00:03:23.709> flip<00:03:24.040> it

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
underside after which we'll flip it

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.130 
underside after which we'll flip it
drizzle<00:03:24.790> some<00:03:24.970> oil<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.540> cook<00:03:25.750> the<00:03:25.900> other<00:03:25.930> side

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
drizzle some oil and cook the other side

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.430 
drizzle some oil and cook the other side
also<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:26.980> let's<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.489> one<00:03:28.120> side<00:03:28.450> cooked<00:03:28.900> nicely

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
also so let's get one side cooked nicely

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.460 
also so let's get one side cooked nicely
you<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.070> see<00:03:30.489> the<00:03:30.730> specs<00:03:31.299> on<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.930> surface<00:03:32.320> of

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
you can see the specs on the surface of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.590 
you can see the specs on the surface of
the<00:03:32.620> tape<00:03:32.860> lock<00:03:33.070> I<00:03:33.220> think<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:34.030> will<00:03:34.150> take<00:03:34.360> some

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
the tape lock I think it will take some

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.509 
the tape lock I think it will take some
more<00:03:34.630> time<00:03:34.840> to<00:03:35.440> get<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.799> underside<00:03:36.220> cooked

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
more time to get the underside cooked

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.910 
more time to get the underside cooked
let's<00:03:36.970> flip<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.660> check<00:03:37.930> if<00:03:38.140> one<00:03:38.470> side<00:03:38.709> of<00:03:38.830> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
let's flip and check if one side of the

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.070 
let's flip and check if one side of the
tape<00:03:39.100> lies<00:03:39.310> done<00:03:39.549> yes<00:03:39.820> you<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.239> see<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.840> brown

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
tape lies done yes you can see the brown

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.960 
tape lies done yes you can see the brown
specks<00:03:41.530> on<00:03:41.769> top<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.190> surface<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.790> means

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
specks on top of the surface that means

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.940 
specks on top of the surface that means
one<00:03:43.480> side<00:03:43.750> is<00:03:43.900> cooked<00:03:44.140> we'll<00:03:44.530> cook<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.920> other

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
one side is cooked we'll cook the other

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.770 
one side is cooked we'll cook the other
side<00:03:45.160> also<00:03:45.489> but<00:03:45.820> before<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.299> we'll<00:03:46.540> drizzle

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
side also but before that we'll drizzle

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.710 
side also but before that we'll drizzle
some<00:03:47.650> oil<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.310> top<00:03:48.760> of<00:03:48.910> the<00:03:49.060> tape<00:03:49.269> lock<00:03:49.510> and

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
some oil on top of the tape lock and

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.780 
some oil on top of the tape lock and
we'll<00:03:50.049> cook<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.470> other<00:03:50.500> side<00:03:50.739> bread<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.610> oil

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
we'll cook the other side bread the oil

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.729 
we'll cook the other side bread the oil
evenly<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.630> flip<00:03:53.290> once<00:03:53.769> again<00:03:55.590> drizzle<00:03:56.590> some
