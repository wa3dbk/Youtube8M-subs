00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.100 
just not there if you know what I mean
he's<00:02:10.950> just<00:02:11.009> not<00:02:11.489> doing<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.270> thought<00:02:12.959> he

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
he's just not doing it I thought he

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
he's just not doing it I thought he
would<00:02:13.230> do<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.410> lot

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
would do a lot

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.130 
would do a lot
better<00:02:13.980> than<00:02:14.190> he<00:02:14.400> did<00:02:14.880> last<00:02:14.940> game<00:02:15.360> but<00:02:15.780> i'll

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
better than he did last game but i'll

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.870 
better than he did last game but i'll
give<00:02:16.380> him<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> couple<00:02:16.800> more<00:02:17.010> games<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.460> see

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
give him a couple more games to see

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.750 
give him a couple more games to see
what's<00:02:18.090> going<00:02:18.300> on<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:19.140> he<00:02:19.350> keeps<00:02:19.890> on<00:02:20.100> slacking

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
what's going on if he keeps on slacking

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
what's going on if he keeps on slacking
and<00:02:20.910> not<00:02:21.180> doing<00:02:21.510> anything<00:02:21.950> then<00:02:22.950> i<00:02:22.980> will

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
and not doing anything then i will

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.860 
and not doing anything then i will
probably<00:02:23.640> go<00:02:23.940> ahead<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.240> train<00:02:24.630> them<00:02:24.750> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
probably go ahead and train them and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.200 
probably go ahead and train them and
look<00:02:25.080> for<00:02:25.290> another<00:02:25.440> center<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:26.940> trying

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
look for another center and I'm trying

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.090 
look for another center and I'm trying
to<00:02:27.270> make<00:02:27.420> this<00:02:27.570> kind<00:02:27.960> of<00:02:28.080> realistic<00:02:28.440> my<00:02:28.770> bench

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
to make this kind of realistic my bench

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.730 
to make this kind of realistic my bench
is<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.400> whole<00:02:29.550> Toronto<00:02:29.940> Raptors<00:02:30.390> bench<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.710> I

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
is the whole Toronto Raptors bench so I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.410 
is the whole Toronto Raptors bench so I
didn't<00:02:32.010> really<00:02:32.040> mess<00:02:32.430> with<00:02:32.460> a<00:02:32.640> bench<00:02:33.000> too<00:02:33.240> much

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
didn't really mess with a bench too much

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.870 
didn't really mess with a bench too much
but<00:02:34.290> we're<00:02:34.470> under<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:34.950> salary<00:02:35.190> cap<00:02:35.400> we're
