00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
most of them aren't spin butters but

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.850

and you know what's the worst part

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.950 
and you know what's the worst part
hackers<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:26.009> always<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:27.000> banned<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.659> if

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
hackers don't always get banned and if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.050 
hackers don't always get banned and if
they<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.799> usually<00:01:29.130> takes<00:01:29.430> quite<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060

time<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.329> them<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.659> get<00:01:30.869> banned<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.500> by<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
time for them to get banned and by the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.999 
time for them to get banned and by the
time<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.670> are<00:01:32.909> banned<00:01:33.470> they<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> ruined

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
time they are banned they have ruined

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and was the most interesting thing is

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.190 
and was the most interesting thing is
that<00:02:08.520> they<00:02:08.819> actually<00:02:08.940> started<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.599> vote<00:02:09.929> to
