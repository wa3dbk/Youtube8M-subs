00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
developers seem to really understand

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.400 
developers seem to really understand
that<00:02:15.489> this<00:02:15.610> is<00:02:15.849> still<00:02:16.209> a<00:02:16.269> game<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.870> it<00:02:17.140> has<00:02:17.290> to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
that this is still a game and it has to

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.870 
that this is still a game and it has to
be<00:02:17.500> fun<00:02:17.709> if<00:02:17.860> people<00:02:18.069> are<00:02:18.160> going<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.430> buy<00:02:18.579> it<00:02:18.610> or

be fun if people are going to buy it or

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.720 

now<00:02:33.319> one<00:02:33.620> of<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.800> problems<00:02:33.920> of<00:02:34.250> gotcha<00:02:34.430> force

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
now one of the problems of gotcha force

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.220 
now one of the problems of gotcha force
that<00:02:35.060> it<00:02:35.150> does<00:02:35.330> tend<00:02:35.599> to<00:02:35.629> get<00:02:35.750> a<00:02:35.810> little<00:02:36.019> bit

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that it does tend to get a little bit

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.080 
that it does tend to get a little bit
repetitive<00:02:36.530> you'll<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.340> fighting<00:02:37.549> wave<00:02:37.879> after

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
repetitive you'll be fighting wave after

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.699 
repetitive you'll be fighting wave after
wave<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.540> enemies<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> then<00:02:39.319> you'll<00:02:39.440> be<00:02:39.590> doing

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
wave of enemies and then you'll be doing

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:41.440 
wave of enemies and then you'll be doing
a<00:02:39.890> similar<00:02:40.099> task<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> next<00:02:40.909> level<00:02:41.180> if

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
a similar task on the next level if

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.059 
a similar task on the next level if
you're<00:02:41.750> in<00:02:41.840> love<00:02:42.019> with<00:02:42.170> this<00:02:42.260> idea<00:02:42.440> this<00:02:42.860> might

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
you're in love with this idea this might

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.220 
you're in love with this idea this might
not<00:02:43.099> even<00:02:43.250> be<00:02:43.549> an<00:02:43.670> issue<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.360> the<00:02:44.540> goals<00:02:44.750> don't

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
not even be an issue but the goals don't

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.530 
not even be an issue but the goals don't
really<00:02:45.650> seem<00:02:45.860> to<00:02:45.950> change<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.790> course<00:02:47.120> how<00:02:47.480> you

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
really seem to change of course how you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.089 
really seem to change of course how you
have<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.959> complete<00:02:48.290> each<00:02:48.409> task<00:02:48.650> varies

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
have to complete each task varies

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:50.320 
have to complete each task varies
depending<00:02:49.430> on<00:02:49.489> what<00:02:49.640> enemy<00:02:50.000> you're<00:02:50.120> facing

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
depending on what enemy you're facing

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.300 
depending on what enemy you're facing
but<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:51.019> end<00:02:51.170> goal<00:02:51.379> doesn't<00:02:51.620> just<00:02:52.129> kill

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
but the end goal doesn't just kill

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.280 
but the end goal doesn't just kill
everything<00:02:52.610> sure<00:02:53.390> other<00:02:53.690> games<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.170> be<00:02:54.260> a

everything sure other games can be a

everything sure other games can be a
little<00:02:54.440> bit<00:02:54.620> repetitive<00:02:54.920> -<00:02:55.280> but<00:02:55.790> gotcha<00:02:56.030> force

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
little bit repetitive - but gotcha force

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.759 
little bit repetitive - but gotcha force
doesn't<00:02:56.569> really<00:02:56.780> mask<00:02:57.049> it<00:02:57.260> as<00:02:57.379> well<00:02:57.560> as<00:02:57.650> it

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769 
doesn't really mask it as well as it

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.559 
doesn't really mask it as well as it
could<00:02:57.950> a<00:02:58.190> little<00:02:58.519> change<00:02:58.879> in<00:02:59.000> setting<00:02:59.420> or

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
could a little change in setting or

could a little change in setting or
style<00:02:59.840> will<00:03:00.049> really<00:03:00.260> go<00:03:00.379> a<00:03:00.410> long<00:03:00.620> way<00:03:00.799> with

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
style will really go a long way with

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:01.569 
style will really go a long way with
this<00:03:01.099> game

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
this game

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.670 
this game
gotcha<00:03:02.299> force<00:03:02.510> is<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.720> strange<00:03:03.079> game<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.500> judge

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
gotcha force is a strange game to judge

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.410 
gotcha force is a strange game to judge
with<00:03:03.890> its<00:03:04.010> visuals<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.879> looks<00:03:05.150> fairly

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
with its visuals it looks fairly

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.210 
with its visuals it looks fairly
primitive<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.260> GameCube<00:03:06.650> game<00:03:06.829> but<00:03:07.099> this

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
primitive for a GameCube game but this

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.920 
primitive for a GameCube game but this
also<00:03:07.430> comes<00:03:07.730> down<00:03:07.819> to<00:03:08.030> its<00:03:08.150> animation<00:03:08.660> style

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
also comes down to its animation style

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.780 
also comes down to its animation style
which<00:03:09.319> is<00:03:09.470> just<00:03:09.709> not<00:03:09.829> as<00:03:10.010> sophisticated<00:03:10.190> as

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
which is just not as sophisticated as

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.670 
which is just not as sophisticated as
more<00:03:10.940> modern<00:03:11.090> animation<00:03:11.629> however<00:03:12.440> what

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
more modern animation however what

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.589 
more modern animation however what
really<00:03:12.920> cannot<00:03:13.489> be<00:03:13.670> excused<00:03:14.180> is<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.450> voice

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
really cannot be excused is the voice

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.509 
really cannot be excused is the voice
acting<00:03:15.049> I'm<00:03:15.500> not<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.920> to<00:03:16.010> sugarcoat<00:03:16.310> it

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
acting I'm not going to sugarcoat it

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.490 
acting I'm not going to sugarcoat it
this<00:03:16.760> is<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.239> worst<00:03:17.599> voice<00:03:17.810> acting<00:03:18.290> I<00:03:18.470> have

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
this is the worst voice acting I have

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.930 
this is the worst voice acting I have
ever<00:03:18.739> heard<00:03:19.160> in<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.400> video<00:03:19.640> game

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
ever heard in a video game

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.819 
ever heard in a video game
the<00:03:20.390> narrator<00:03:20.840> sounds<00:03:21.109> like<00:03:21.319> he<00:03:21.440> got<00:03:21.560> pulled

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
the narrator sounds like he got pulled

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:23.650 
the narrator sounds like he got pulled
off<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.099> street<00:03:22.370> to<00:03:22.519> read<00:03:22.640> a<00:03:22.670> few<00:03:22.849> lines<00:03:22.910> it's

off the street to read a few lines it's

gotcha force is not a great game but it
