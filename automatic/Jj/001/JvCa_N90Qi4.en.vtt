hello<00:00:03.600> this<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.780> maker<00:00:04.080> J<00:00:04.290> 101<00:00:04.650> and<00:00:04.859> today<00:00:05.279> I'm

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
hello this is maker J 101 and today I'm

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.610 
hello this is maker J 101 and today I'm
gonna<00:00:05.549> hydrostatically<00:00:06.450> test<00:00:06.810> this<00:00:07.049> boiler

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
gonna hydrostatically test this boiler

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.220 
gonna hydrostatically test this boiler
that<00:00:07.770> I<00:00:07.830> just<00:00:07.980> made<00:00:08.240> so<00:00:09.240> yeah<00:00:09.900> I'm<00:00:09.960> gonna<00:00:10.080> see

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
that I just made so yeah I'm gonna see

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.570 
that I just made so yeah I'm gonna see
how<00:00:10.320> many<00:00:10.380> psi<00:00:10.830> it<00:00:10.889> can<00:00:11.070> withstand

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
how many psi it can withstand

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.009 
how many psi it can withstand
I'm<00:00:11.730> guessing<00:00:12.389> it's<00:00:12.509> probably<00:00:12.599> not<00:00:12.900> gonna

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
I'm guessing it's probably not gonna

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.049 
I'm guessing it's probably not gonna
withstand<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.530> lot<00:00:13.679> because<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.130> just<00:00:14.700> flat

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
withstand a lot because it's just flat

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.680 
withstand a lot because it's just flat
on<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> ends<00:00:15.599> it's<00:00:15.719> just<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.100> tomato<00:00:17.100> sauce<00:00:17.369> can

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:17.690 
on the ends it's just a tomato sauce can

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.140 
on the ends it's just a tomato sauce can
and<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:18.930> was<00:00:19.050> paste<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> just<00:00:20.070> poked<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.029> hole

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
and it was paste so I just poked a hole

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
and it was paste so I just poked a hole
in<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.510> with<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.140> nail<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.859> poured<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
in it with a nail and then I poured the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.310 
in it with a nail and then I poured the
tomato<00:00:23.490> sauce<00:00:23.699> out<00:00:23.970> well<00:00:24.449> two<00:00:24.660> holes<00:00:24.869> one<00:00:25.109> for

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
tomato sauce out well two holes one for

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.230 
tomato sauce out well two holes one for
the<00:00:25.380> air<00:00:25.500> one<00:00:25.769> for<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> tomato<00:00:26.760> sauce<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> come

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
the air one for the tomato sauce to come

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.349 
the air one for the tomato sauce to come
out<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.470> ends<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.039> not<00:00:29.359> soldered

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
out so I so the ends are not soldered

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.540 
out so I so the ends are not soldered
back<00:00:30.599> on<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> think<00:00:31.080> it's<00:00:31.320> pretty<00:00:31.830> much<00:00:31.949> all

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
back on I think it's pretty much all

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.110 
back on I think it's pretty much all
intact

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
intact

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.930 
intact
except<00:00:33.360> for<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.660> two<00:00:34.260> holes<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.620> put<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
except for the two holes I put in it so

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
except for the two holes I put in it so
I<00:00:36.000> soldered<00:00:36.360> on<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.770> place<00:00:37.770> where<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.010> could<00:00:38.160> fill

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
I soldered on a place where I could fill

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.190 
I soldered on a place where I could fill
up<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> water<00:00:38.579> if<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.660> it<00:00:39.840> lasted<00:00:40.140> that

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
up the water if it if it lasted that

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.430 
up the water if it if it lasted that
long<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> pressure<00:00:42.239> gauge<00:00:42.480> goes<00:00:43.290> up

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
long and I have a pressure gauge goes up

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.510 
long and I have a pressure gauge goes up
to<00:00:43.530> 100<00:00:43.829> psi

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to 100 psi

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.000 
to 100 psi
and<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.809> some<00:00:45.960> random<00:00:46.140> valves<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.829> things

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
and just some random valves and things

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.319 
and just some random valves and things
well<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.340> valve<00:00:47.550> doesn't<00:00:47.879> need<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.180> there

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
well this valve doesn't need to be there

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.940 
well this valve doesn't need to be there
but<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.260> there<00:00:49.379> because<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> couldn't

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
but I have it there because I couldn't

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
but I have it there because I couldn't
connect<00:00:50.190> two<00:00:50.489> pipes<00:00:50.700> together<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:52.020> using

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
connect two pipes together so I'm using

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
connect two pipes together so I'm using
as<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> connector<00:00:52.860> there's<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:53.940> water<00:00:54.270> valve

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
as a connector there's my water valve

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.470 
as a connector there's my water valve
and<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.079> connects<00:00:55.590> up<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.860> hose<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
and then it connects up to the hose and

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.930 
and then it connects up to the hose and
I'm<00:00:57.480> planning<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.199> run<00:00:58.800> my<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.820> take

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I'm planning to run my or not to take

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.340 
I'm planning to run my or not to take
this<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.980> like<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.899> pressure<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.110> want

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
this up to like the pressure that I want

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.740 
this up to like the pressure that I want
to<00:01:04.439> run<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> out<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> maximum<00:01:05.640> 30<00:01:05.880> psi<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.570> I'm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
to run it out is maximum 30 psi so I'm

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.320 
to run it out is maximum 30 psi so I'm
gonna<00:01:06.960> see<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.890> test<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.460> 60<00:01:09.119> psi

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
gonna see if I can test this to 60 psi

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.550 
gonna see if I can test this to 60 psi
if<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.950> withstands<00:01:10.950> up<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.189> 50<00:01:11.490> or<00:01:11.520> 60<00:01:11.970> then

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
if it withstands up to 50 or 60 then

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560 
if it withstands up to 50 or 60 then
I'll<00:01:13.560> keep<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.430> use<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.060> boiler<00:01:15.330> but<00:01:15.479> if

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I'll keep it and use as a boiler but if

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.719 
I'll keep it and use as a boiler but if
it<00:01:15.659> doesn't<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.140> oh<00:01:16.470> well<00:01:16.920> I'll<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.520> use

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it doesn't then oh well I'll just use

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.370 
it doesn't then oh well I'll just use
this<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.360> it'll<00:01:18.630> just<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.960> junk<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:21.720> our

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
this or it'll just be junk but so our

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640 
this or it'll just be junk but so our
water<00:01:22.560> psi<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.549> about<00:01:23.790> 70<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.750> there'll<00:01:25.590> be

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
water psi is on about 70 so there'll be

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
water psi is on about 70 so there'll be
plenty<00:01:25.860> enough<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.340> test<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.240> give

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
plenty enough to test it so let's give

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.950 
plenty enough to test it so let's give
it<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.600> test

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
it a test

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 
it a test
alright<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.740> no<00:01:28.979> so<00:01:29.729> hydrostatic<00:01:30.390> testing<00:01:30.689> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
alright so no so hydrostatic testing is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.630 
alright so no so hydrostatic testing is
basically<00:01:31.110> just<00:01:31.229> fill<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.920> whatever<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.430> want

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
basically just fill up whatever you want

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.289 
basically just fill up whatever you want
to<00:01:33.200> test<00:01:34.200> with<00:01:34.500> water<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> just

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
to test with water and then you just

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.620 
to test with water and then you just
pump<00:01:36.450> water<00:01:36.659> into<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> so<00:01:38.360> because<00:01:39.360> water

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pump water into it so because water

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.090 
pump water into it so because water
doesn't<00:01:39.930> compress<00:01:40.909> when<00:01:42.079> you<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.590> can<00:01:43.770> get<00:01:43.979> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
doesn't compress when you you can get it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.770 
doesn't compress when you you can get it
up<00:01:44.189> to<00:01:44.220> really<00:01:44.549> high<00:01:44.670> pressure<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.689> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
up to really high pressure and if it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.630 
up to really high pressure and if it
blows<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.350> just<00:01:46.500> kind<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.680> pops<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.220> over

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
blows up it just kind of pops it over

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.130 
blows up it just kind of pops it over
water<00:01:47.790> leaks<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.299> doesn't<00:01:48.600> explode

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
water leaks out it doesn't explode

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
water leaks out it doesn't explode
because<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.220> air<00:01:50.520> does<00:01:50.729> there<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> water

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
because the air does there the water

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.359 
because the air does there the water
doesn't<00:01:51.540> compress<00:01:51.720> if<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.290> compress<00:01:53.040> this<00:01:53.189> up

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
doesn't compress if you compress this up

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.370 
doesn't compress if you compress this up
with<00:01:53.520> air<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:54.420> guys<00:01:54.600> created<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.960> small<00:01:55.170> bomb

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
with air you guys created a small bomb

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.590 
with air you guys created a small bomb
because<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.860> would<00:01:55.979> blow<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.909> because<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> air

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
because it would blow up because the air

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
because it would blow up because the air
would<00:01:57.719> expand<00:01:58.310> because<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.369> get<00:01:59.520> up<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.759> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
would expand because you get up to like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
would expand because you get up to like
60<00:02:00.270> psi<00:02:00.659> would<00:02:00.840> explode<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.649> have<00:02:01.829> all

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
60 psi would explode and you have all

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.219 
60 psi would explode and you have all
that<00:02:02.159> air<00:02:02.460> pushing<00:02:03.270> the<00:02:03.390> shrapnel<00:02:04.110> everywhere

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that air pushing the shrapnel everywhere

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.740 
that air pushing the shrapnel everywhere
and<00:02:04.740> it'll<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:04.979> be<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.310> huge<00:02:05.460> mess<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.479> water

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
and it'll just be a huge mess with water

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.749 
and it'll just be a huge mess with water
it<00:02:06.990> doesn't<00:02:07.140> do<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.740> pops<00:02:08.160> out<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.580> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it doesn't do that just pops out and a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.660 
it doesn't do that just pops out and a
tiny<00:02:09.119> little<00:02:09.270> leak<00:02:09.539> all<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> water<00:02:10.170> leaks<00:02:10.379> out

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
tiny little leak all the water leaks out

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.610 
tiny little leak all the water leaks out
so<00:02:11.670> that's

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
so that's

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.520 
so that's
so<00:02:12.890> this<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.310> safe<00:02:13.880> way<00:02:14.060> to<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.330> it<00:02:14.530> so

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
so this is really safe way to do it so

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.520 
so this is really safe way to do it so
yeah<00:02:16.400> I<00:02:16.580> filled<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.940> up<00:02:16.970> with<00:02:17.030> water<00:02:17.380> it's<00:02:18.380> all

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
yeah I filled it up with water it's all

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.870 
yeah I filled it up with water it's all
the<00:02:18.620> way<00:02:18.709> full<00:02:18.920> water<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.610> I'm<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.730> gonna

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the way full water and I'm just gonna

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.000 
the way full water and I'm just gonna
put<00:02:20.090> some<00:02:20.120> water<00:02:20.330> into<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:20.840> let's<00:02:21.290> go

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
put some water into it so let's go

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.110 
put some water into it so let's go
got<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> face<00:02:22.400> mask<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.530> we<00:02:24.530> go<00:02:24.800> I<00:02:27.790> can<00:02:28.790> see

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
got a face mask on so we go I can see

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.970 
got a face mask on so we go I can see
the<00:02:29.239> fans<00:02:29.870> are<00:02:30.050> starting<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.349> bulge<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.800> little

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
the fans are starting to bulge a little

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:39.170 
the fans are starting to bulge a little
bit<00:02:33.250> we're<00:02:34.250> up<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.610> 20

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.250 

looks<00:02:39.660> like<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.959> gonna<00:02:40.110> bust<00:02:40.349> soon

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.760 

up

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
up

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.840 
up
there<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.430> go<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.290> belt<00:02:50.680> thirty<00:02:50.950> this

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
there you go it's a belt thirty this

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:03.830 
there you go it's a belt thirty this
ends<00:02:52.240> are<00:02:52.360> starting<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.780> really<00:02:52.930> bulge

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.559 

yeah<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.590> ends<00:03:04.800> are<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:05.100> evolved<00:03:05.610> in<00:03:05.700> here

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.900 

so<00:03:09.569> it's<00:03:09.720> 40<00:03:10.200> already<00:03:10.350> it's<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:11.010> handling

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
so it's 40 already it's really handling

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:25.410 
so it's 40 already it's really handling
the<00:03:12.030> pressure<00:03:12.240> very<00:03:12.690> well<00:03:12.870> so<00:03:13.110> far

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.449 

50

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
50

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.819 
50
well<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.319> actually<00:03:29.319> working<00:03:29.469> quite<00:03:29.620> well

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
well it's actually working quite well

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:37.350 
well it's actually working quite well
you<00:03:30.129> can<00:03:30.250> know<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> ends<00:03:30.819> are<00:03:30.909> bulging<00:03:31.150> out

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.860 

time<00:03:38.360> to<00:03:38.510> water<00:03:39.050> up<00:03:39.230> a<00:03:39.320> little<00:03:39.440> bit<00:03:39.620> higher

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
time to water up a little bit higher

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.770 
time to water up a little bit higher
we're<00:03:41.870> almost<00:03:42.500> to<00:03:42.830> 60<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.120> if<00:03:44.210> it<00:03:44.300> makes<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.630> to

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
we're almost to 60 so if it makes it to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.170 
we're almost to 60 so if it makes it to
60<00:03:45.140> then<00:03:45.290> I'm<00:03:45.350> going<00:03:45.500> to<00:03:45.560> use<00:03:45.650> this<00:03:45.770> boiler<00:03:49.180> all

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
60 then I'm going to use this boiler all

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.930 
60 then I'm going to use this boiler all
right<00:03:50.300> it's<00:03:50.420> at<00:03:50.510> 60<00:03:50.870> I<00:03:51.520> think<00:03:52.520> it's<00:03:52.670> probably

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
right it's at 60 I think it's probably

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.900 
right it's at 60 I think it's probably
safe<00:03:53.390> bang<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:55.280> they're<00:03:55.670> a<00:03:55.700> little<00:03:55.790> bit

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
safe bang and they're a little bit

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.570 
safe bang and they're a little bit
bulged<00:03:56.330> but<00:03:56.860> it's<00:03:57.860> going<00:03:58.070> to<00:03:58.220> serve<00:03:58.430> its

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
bulged but it's going to serve its

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.210 
bulged but it's going to serve its
purpose<00:03:59.060> I<00:04:00.580> mean<00:04:02.290> yeah<00:04:03.290> that's<00:04:03.590> kind<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.890> what

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
purpose I mean yeah that's kind of what

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.160 
purpose I mean yeah that's kind of what
I<00:04:04.250> think<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.640> might<00:04:04.820> happen<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.480> might<00:04:06.020> I

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
I think it might happen I might I

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.380 
I think it might happen I might I
thought<00:04:06.440> it<00:04:06.560> might<00:04:06.820> fall<00:04:07.820> down<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.090> little<00:04:08.240> bit

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
thought it might fall down a little bit

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.720 
thought it might fall down a little bit
more<00:04:08.570> and<00:04:08.630> then<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.840> would<00:04:08.930> pop<00:04:09.110> off<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:09.730> it

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
more and then it would pop off but it

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.800 
more and then it would pop off but it
must<00:04:10.910> be<00:04:10.940> crimped<00:04:11.270> on<00:04:11.420> there<00:04:11.600> pretty<00:04:11.720> well

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
must be crimped on there pretty well

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.340 
must be crimped on there pretty well
done

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
done

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.760 
done
so<00:04:13.270> yeah<00:04:14.270> I'll<00:04:14.780> test<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.140> one<00:04:15.260> more<00:04:15.410> time<00:04:15.530> just

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
so yeah I'll test it one more time just

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:26.480 
so yeah I'll test it one more time just
take<00:04:16.100> it<00:04:16.250> up<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.459> 60<00:04:16.790> again<00:04:18.130> just<00:04:19.130> double-check

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.029 

yeah<00:04:27.120> that's<00:04:27.360> 60<00:04:27.780> again<00:04:28.050> it<00:04:28.440> seems<00:04:28.800> to<00:04:28.919> be

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 
yeah that's 60 again it seems to be

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.100 
yeah that's 60 again it seems to be
holding<00:04:30.979> so<00:04:31.979> that's<00:04:32.160> good

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.719 

I<00:04:35.139> don't<00:04:35.770> know<00:04:35.830> if<00:04:35.889> I<00:04:35.949> should<00:04:36.129> try<00:04:36.280> whacking

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
I don't know if I should try whacking

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.560 
I don't know if I should try whacking
something<00:04:37.150> make<00:04:37.629> sure

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:45.970 

so<00:04:42.140> looks<00:04:43.040> fine<00:04:43.870> cuz<00:04:44.870> I'm<00:04:44.990> just<00:04:45.140> gonna<00:04:45.260> operate

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:45.980 
so looks fine cuz I'm just gonna operate

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.030 
so looks fine cuz I'm just gonna operate
it<00:04:46.130> at<00:04:46.420> 30<00:04:47.420> psi<00:04:47.930> is<00:04:47.990> the<00:04:48.110> maximum<00:04:48.680> I<00:04:48.800> really

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
it at 30 psi is the maximum I really

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.040 
it at 30 psi is the maximum I really
want<00:04:49.220> to<00:04:49.310> take<00:04:49.460> it<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.790> cuz<00:04:50.570> I<00:04:50.630> have<00:04:50.750> a<00:04:50.810> smaller

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
want to take it to cuz I have a smaller

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.960 
want to take it to cuz I have a smaller
pressure<00:04:51.290> gauge<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.620> that's<00:04:51.890> all<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.160> other

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:52.970 
pressure gauge and that's all the other

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.030 
pressure gauge and that's all the other
pressure<00:04:53.300> gauge<00:04:53.540> goes<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.050> 30<00:04:54.350> psi<00:04:54.800> so<00:04:54.980> I

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
pressure gauge goes to a 30 psi so I

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.670 
pressure gauge goes to a 30 psi so I
don't<00:04:55.190> want<00:04:55.310> to<00:04:55.370> take<00:04:55.520> it<00:04:55.550> over<00:04:55.700> 30<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.470> think

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
don't want to take it over 30 so I think

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.700 
don't want to take it over 30 so I think
this<00:04:57.980> is<00:04:58.040> gonna<00:04:58.280> work<00:04:58.490> very<00:04:58.670> well<00:04:58.790> then<00:04:59.710> all

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
this is gonna work very well then all

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.560 
this is gonna work very well then all
right<00:05:00.830> that<00:05:01.430> was<00:05:01.520> some<00:05:01.670> hydrostatic<00:05:02.270> testing

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570 
right that was some hydrostatic testing

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.720 
right that was some hydrostatic testing
with<00:05:02.690> my<00:05:02.840> new<00:05:03.260> boiler<00:05:03.650> that's<00:05:04.310> about<00:05:04.550> it

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
with my new boiler that's about it

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.140 
with my new boiler that's about it
thanks<00:05:05.720> for<00:05:05.870> watching
