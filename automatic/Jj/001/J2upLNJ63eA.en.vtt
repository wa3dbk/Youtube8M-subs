volumes which are looking at
exercise<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:03.340> area<00:02:03.670> will<00:02:03.850> create<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.150> segment

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
exercise the area will create a segment

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.200 
exercise the area will create a segment
of<00:02:04.750> its<00:02:04.990> own<00:02:05.200> as<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:06.430> was<00:02:06.580> mentioning<00:02:06.610> in

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
so we believe that the area will end up

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.880 
so we believe that the area will end up
creating<00:02:53.860> a<00:02:54.100> segment<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.520> its<00:02:54.700> own
