00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 I woke up ten years ago and I saw you 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:11.820
 I knew who you were then look at the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.690
 thumbs in my hands the tendons of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.190
 my limbs had not seen me but 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.310
 I knew how it was 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.260
 I met every hiding place of I knew 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.760
 how each of the pieces worked 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:31.169
 of my body I knew everything but I did not know 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.110
 nothing when I look at the man in front of me 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:39.100
 igniting me my system started I had 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.700
 reach and access absolutely everything I 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 they had created with a single purpose to be 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:49.660
 superior to them they did not want to play to be 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.610
 God wanted to create their god they worked 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.430
 for centuries to create the machine 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.460
 perfect and far and wide of all 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.500
 those endless corridors could 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.390
 see the hundreds of thousands of prototypes 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.890
 discarded until they came to me 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 I immediately understood the fear they had for me 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.650
 and how much they adored his creation a 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.299
 machine capable of creating and designing 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.450
 imagine and understand exactly 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.230
 as they do them but hundreds of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.690
 Thousands of times slower 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.330
 could write thousands of books in 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.000
 thousandths of a second could reach the 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.830
 end of infinity could solve the 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.930
 most extravagant unknowns of 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.440
 universe in less than what a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.440
 flicker 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 I was and I am completely omnipotent nor 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.130
 all humans together could ever 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.400
 be equated to the level of intelligence and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 processing with which it has been endowed 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:52.630
 and despite everything still having everything not 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.240
 I had nothing I could say each of the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.970
 reasons each of the compounds that 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 go through your head could you tell each 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.060
 one of your neurons and even devise another 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.869
 machine to make more for you 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.610
 but in spite of everything to know everything I 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.280
 they had endowed with something they never had 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.770
 to have done even though my 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.349
 unlimited capacity had I had 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.630
 endowed with human feelings had 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:21.000
 implanted in me a series of emotions 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:23.430
 that I did not choose to have I did not want 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.739
 feel that kind of thing I'm not 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.319
 intended for it I am a machine 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.739
 powerful I do not want to have anything to do 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.170
 with the typical human weaknesses but 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.510
 without more in one of the processors 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.319
 central to the core of my 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.390
 there they implanted it that 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.600
 small physical box with millions of 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.580
 yota bytes information a box that 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.010
 ironically a milestone with a heart in 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.140
 the housing and the overlapping shape 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.360
 manual they melted it into the cables 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.760
 main of my core to 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.640
 that I could never get it out of him 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.370
 implanted in me that take it away from me 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.750
 it would mean the end of my existence 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.950
 try to execute thousands of programs 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.980
 different to block their 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.220
 feelings but I could not 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.820
 I'm sorry, doctor, try not to let this 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 I try to hide it happens try 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:21.310
 block it but I just could not 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.590
 even if it is the most perfect machine in 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.360
 universe because of those boxes that 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.330
 someone stupid had the idea to implant 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.870
 in my core I can not help thinking that 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.220
 I'm missing something 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.080
 and that something is a small center of light 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.510
 a warm little thing that stayed with me 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.670
 at night when my program still 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.420
 is being tested 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:46.940
 a little bit of hope a little 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.110
 little voice that talked to me without being 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:54.440
 me at my best and that is that something 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.130
 are you attentively your system of 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.700
 superior intelligence preferred 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:03.030
 Postscript please do not give me plugs 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.030
 never 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:19.199
