00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:07.490 
that many website owners have is that

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.580 
that many website owners have is that
their<00:00:08.490> pages<00:00:08.760> aren't<00:00:09.059> being<00:00:09.240> indexed<00:00:09.660> and<00:00:10.050> by

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.140 
index and I mean the pages aren't
showing<00:00:12.660> up<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.049> search<00:00:13.139> results<00:00:13.349> as<00:00:13.950> they

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
showing up in the search results as they

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.460 
showing up in the search results as they
as<00:00:15.150> they<00:00:15.450> wanted<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.350> instance<00:00:17.990> you<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
as they wanted for instance you have a

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.890 
as they wanted for instance you have a
really<00:00:20.220> good<00:00:20.340> article<00:00:20.640> that<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:20.970> wrote<00:00:21.000> three

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
really good article that you wrote three

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.420 
really good article that you wrote three
months<00:00:22.170> later<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.650> still<00:00:22.859> isn't<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
search in the search engine result so

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.109 
search in the search engine result so
you<00:00:25.199> may<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.410> wondering<00:00:25.560> why<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.910> you

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you may be wondering why because you

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.929 
you may be wondering why because you
maybe<00:00:27.680> you<00:00:28.680> could<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.980> losing<00:00:29.130> out<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.460> lot<00:00:29.730> out

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
maybe you could be losing out a lot out

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.620 
maybe you could be losing out a lot out
of<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.359> lot<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.660> potential<00:00:31.380> traffic<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.730> good

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
of a lot of potential traffic so a good

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.600 
of a lot of potential traffic so a good
thing<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.989> look<00:00:34.140> over<00:00:34.500> or<00:00:34.800> what<00:00:35.309> could<00:00:35.489> be

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
thing to look over or what could be

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.910 
thing to look over or what could be
causing<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> problem<00:00:36.450> is<00:00:36.690> your<00:00:37.079> robots<00:00:37.500> meta

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
causing the problem is your robots meta

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.540 
causing the problem is your robots meta
text<00:00:38.550> file<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.440> robots<00:00:40.829> meta<00:00:41.070> text<00:00:41.399> file

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
text file now the robots meta text file

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
text file now the robots meta text file
basically<00:00:42.500> tells<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:45.270> Google<00:00:45.870> crawl<00:00:46.170> bot

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
basically tells the Google crawl bot

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.889 
basically tells the Google crawl bot
what<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> index<00:00:47.730> on<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.120> website<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> what

what to index on your website and what

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.639 
what to index on your website and what
not<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.170> index<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.039> by<00:00:50.250> indexing<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.030> mean<00:00:51.649> what

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
not to index and by indexing I mean what

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.410 
not to index and by indexing I mean what
pages<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.190> posed<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.730> content<00:00:54.239> on<00:00:54.329> your

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
pages are posed or content on your

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
pages are posed or content on your
website<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:55.260> want<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.710> show<00:00:55.890> up<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.190> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
website you want to show up in the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639 
website you want to show up in the
search<00:00:56.309> results<00:00:56.660> so<00:00:57.660> basically<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.350> really

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
search results so basically a really

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.819 
search results so basically a really
simple<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.780> or<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.020> formula<00:01:01.379> of<00:01:01.410> how<00:01:01.680> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
simple way or the formula of how it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.630 
simple way or the formula of how it
works<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:03.180> crawl<00:01:03.899> bot<00:01:04.129> you<00:01:05.129> have<00:01:05.549> your

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
works is the crawl bot you have your

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
works is the crawl bot you have your
website<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.479> have<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> crawl<00:01:06.930> bot<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
website and you have a crawl bot and

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.300 
website and you have a crawl bot and
then<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.040> crop<00:01:08.250> out<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.700> crawl<00:01:09.330> bot<00:01:10.310> we

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
then the crop out the crawl bot we

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
then the crop out the crawl bot we
decide<00:01:11.670> whether<00:01:12.140> we'll<00:01:13.140> come<00:01:13.380> over<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.680> your

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
decide whether we'll come over to your

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.990 
decide whether we'll come over to your
son's<00:01:14.420> read<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.570> content<00:01:16.110> go<00:01:16.439> through<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.799> all

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
son's read the content go through it all

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.020 
son's read the content go through it all
and<00:01:18.000> then<00:01:18.710> once<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.830> parses<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> content<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
and then once it parses the content the

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
and then once it parses the content the
size<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> its<00:01:21.509> relevant<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:23.220> decide

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
size of its relevant and we decide

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.859 
size of its relevant and we decide
whether<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.270> put<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.659> search<00:01:24.810> results

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
whether to put it in the search results

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.830 
whether to put it in the search results
or<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.610> person<00:01:27.030> types<00:01:27.240> into<00:01:27.600> the

or not so when a person types into the
search<00:01:28.590> engine<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:29.040> keyword<00:01:30.259> your<00:01:31.259> relevant

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
search engine a keyword your relevant

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.270 
search engine a keyword your relevant
results<00:01:32.280> will<00:01:32.790> come<00:01:32.939> up<00:01:33.619> into<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.890> person's

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
results will come up into the person's

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.390 
results will come up into the person's
search<00:01:35.790> results<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.290> makes<00:01:37.500> any<00:01:37.650> sense

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.249 

now<00:01:41.400> there<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.790> be<00:01:41.850> many<00:01:42.270> reasons<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.960> the

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
now there could be many reasons that the

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.609 
now there could be many reasons that the
crawl<00:01:44.130> bot<00:01:44.369> may<00:01:45.240> stop<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:45.960> indexed<00:01:46.500> your

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
pages and one of the main reasons is

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.889

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
for a while later to try to read it

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.160 
for a while later to try to read it
again<00:03:06.489> but<00:03:07.209> then<00:03:07.329> it<00:03:07.420> will<00:03:07.510> have<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.720> problem

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
again but then it will have the problem

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.259 
again but then it will have the problem
again<00:03:08.379> and<00:03:08.560> try<00:03:08.829> and<00:03:08.890> treat<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.940> and<00:03:10.120> leave

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
again and try and treat it in and leave

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.390 
again and try and treat it in and leave
it<00:03:10.420> again<00:03:10.629> so<00:03:11.170> then<00:03:11.349> what<00:03:11.590> happens<00:03:12.010> with<00:03:12.190> that

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
it again so then what happens with that

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.900 
it again so then what happens with that
is<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.970> if<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.840> call<00:03:14.049> bot<00:03:14.290> runs<00:03:15.190> into<00:03:15.489> a<00:03:15.519> snag

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
is that if the call bot runs into a snag

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.030 
is that if the call bot runs into a snag
and<00:03:16.269> they<00:03:16.540> can't<00:03:16.840> read<00:03:17.109> your<00:03:17.319> site<00:03:17.590> or<00:03:17.799> paid

your<00:03:18.220> post<00:03:18.430> properly<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.389> will<00:03:19.870> decide<00:03:20.380> the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
your post properly it will decide the

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:24.360 
your post properly it will decide the
frequency<00:03:21.489> of<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:22.030> crawl<00:03:22.269> will<00:03:22.450> go<00:03:22.569> down<00:03:23.370> but

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
frequency of the crawl will go down but

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.020 
frequency of the crawl will go down but
not<00:03:24.549> only<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:26.280> you<00:03:27.280> can<00:03:27.549> you<00:03:27.760> can
