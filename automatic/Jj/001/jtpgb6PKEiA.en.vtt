 Andrei I would like to start recording 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.140
 a series of videos about topics like 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.119

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:35.540
 say good guns who knives and other 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:38.570
 Top weapons in KSK have a cycle of these rollers 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.430
 I and called from dirt in a knife and we will 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.730

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.750
 you more or less normal weapons 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.300
 which cost 100 rubles 50 rubles 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.980
 I have it already pretty 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.860
 long-amber wine so I do not really 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.120
 sorry to be the goal of each video we 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.790
 must at least be small but plus 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.479
 I have not passed this case I am not some 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.470
 a professional tracker 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.810
 this is a question 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.890
 the only thing I can not understand 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.580
 go into minus 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.420
 never under any circumstances 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.600
 Circumstances first I shove 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.020
 I will try the most expensive weapon that 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:27.710
 I have in all plans this is raha 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.409
 materially so connected with it very much 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.920
 many fights 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:38.420
 this machine has been buying me for exactly a year 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.939
 I have it in early 2000 14 for 50 rubles 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.009
 when prices were a bit normal 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.939
 well-worn and in the pubs it was possible to buy 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.320
 for 200 rubles and if you 're lucky to stand up 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:54.490
 not lucky by the way 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:59.270
 if he does not want to exchange simplicity 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.820
 we will pay extra with any guns 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 I have now 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:09.410
 let's say that p250 supernova is very 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:14.170
 beautiful skin admit i like me with 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:20.120
 im running but for the knife and 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.200
 your dream is nothing sorry so here 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.500
 this is just a gift to me 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:30.160
 so I have not so long ago gave me 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.080
 don't feel sorry for her 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.900
 here actually say so softly not 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.120
 perfect inventory 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.300
 average inventory and say 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.989
 honestly now not very hard i can't 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.750
 find a person with whom I could 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.550
 profitable to exchange well, by the way 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.080
 I wanted to show you this one 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:58.930
 cannon for 700 rubles can solder to from 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.930
 from the pot ultraviolet statrek 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:10.200
 well let's look for a person with 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:15.940
 which both we see here I exchanged for 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.540
 m41 clean water we walked in a very small 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.760
 well , still a plus and we approached on 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.090
 a couple of rubles to your goal 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.920
 Wow, how do we see this m to also with three 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:33.430
 stickers are pretty good for me 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.820
 such a dimple was a long time ago 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.980
 she looks more than worthy for 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.050
 its quality 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 maybe I would leave her run bosnia 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:50.010
 but unfortunately according to the rules of our transmission 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.010
 this is impossible and this is the first
