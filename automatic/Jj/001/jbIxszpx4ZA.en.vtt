00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.600
- YOU CLEARLY ARE HERE
BECAUSE YOU LOVE TELEVISION.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.166
I LOVE TELEVISION.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.000
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,
WE HAD SHOWS LIKE

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.166
"LEAVE IT TO BEAVER," AND
"THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES."

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.000
SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,
THINGS CHANGED.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.333
NOW THE HILLBILLIES ON
TELEVISION ARE REAL.

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.066
THERE ARE SO MANY
REALITY SHOWS NOWADAYS,

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.333
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP UP,
BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD HELP YOU.

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.166
I FOUND A NEW--THESE ARE CLIPS

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.333
FROM A FEW REALITY SHOWS
THAT I STUMBLED UPON.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:28.833
AND AS I ALWAYS SAY, IF I SEE
IT, YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TOO.

00:00:28.833 --> 00:00:31.000
SO HERE'S A SHOW I FOUND
ON THE LEARNING CHANNEL.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
IT'S CALLED "BUYING NAKED."

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.166
IT'S ABOUT NUDISTS
WHO ARE LOOKING...

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.833
[laughter]

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.833
TO BUY REAL ESTATE.

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:39.933
- WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO BUY
NUDIST REAL ESTATE,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.333
THEY COME TO ME.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:44.833
I'VE ALREADY SOLD OVER 25 HOMES
TO NUDISTS THIS YEAR.

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.000
TOP THAT.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.166
OKAY, COME ON, GUYS.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:49.500
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE MASTER SUITE.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.766
- OKAY.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:53.500
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS NICE.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.900
- THIS ROOM
MIGHT BE A LITTLE SMALL,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.266
BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD WORK WITH.

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.333
- YOU WANT TO
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS, HILARY.

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:02.333
- NO WAY.

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.000
- THIS IS FANTASTIC.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.833
IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BIG
CLOSETS BECAUSE I DO GO TO WORK.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.600
MICHAEL GOES TO WORK TOO.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.500
AND I HAVE A LOT OF SHOES.
[laughs]

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.933
[laughter]

00:01:11.933 --> 00:01:12.933
- SHE WEARS SHOES.

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:14.333
THAT'S GOOD.

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:16.000
JUST NOTHING BUT SHOES IN THERE.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.666
[cheers and applause]

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.933
I WAS ALWAYS WONDERING WHERE
THE NUDISTS KEPT THEIR KEYS.

00:01:22.933 --> 00:01:24.133
AND I GUESS IN THEIR SHOES.

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:26.500
SHE JUST PUTS HER SHOES ON
AND GOES TO WORK.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.166
AND THERE'S A SHOW ON TRUTV.

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.633
IT'S CALLED "KILLER KARAOKE."

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.000
HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THIS?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.666
IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE SINGING
IN EXTREME CONDITIONS.

00:01:33.666 --> 00:01:37.433
THIS IS-- THIS IS DONE
FOR A CHANCE TO WIN $10,000

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.200
- PERFORMING
"HOOKED ON A FEELING"

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.833
WHILE WEARING DRUNK GOGGLES,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.666
PLEASE MAKE SOME NOISE
FOR MALICK HANNAH.

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:45.000
- KILLER KARAOKE, START!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.900
[dreamy pop music]

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.166
- [singing]
I CAN'T STOP THIS FEELING

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:53.466
[balloons popping,
people screaming]

00:01:53.466 --> 00:01:55.466
DEEP INSIDE OF ME

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.033
[balloons popping,
screams]

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.333
I CAN'T WAIT--

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:00.433
[screaming, crashing]

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.800
[audience laughing, groaning]

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.300
[dreamy pop music continues]

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.833
- BRUSH IT OFF.

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:07.833
- [singing]
WHEN YOU HOLD ME

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.166
IN YOUR ARMS SO TIGHT

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.000
[laughter]

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.100
- OH.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.100
[applause]

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.333
IF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO DO THAT
FOR $10,000,

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:21.833
I REALIZE I AM PAYING MY STAFF
WAY TOO MUCH MONEY.

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.333
[laughter]

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:24.833
I DON'T EVEN MAKE 'EM SING.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:25.833
HERE'S A SHOW.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.333
THIS IS ON
THE SMITHSONIAN CHANNEL,

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:29.166
AND IT'S CALLED
"AERIAL AMERICA."

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.733
MY DAD TOLD ME ABOUT THIS,
AND I THOUGHT,

00:02:30.733 --> 00:02:31.733
"WELL, I'LL GIVE IT A TRY."

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.666
- THIS RIVER VALLEY WAS ONCE
THE HOME OF THE IROQUOIS PEOPLE.

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.666
WHO CALLED THE MAJESTIC WATERWAY
THAT FLOWED THROUGH THEIR LAND

00:02:39.666 --> 00:02:43.333
"OHI:YO'" OR "GREAT RIVER."

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:48.000
IT WAS FROM "OHI:YO'"
THAT OHIO GOT ITS NAME.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.666
[laughter]

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:50.666
- WHAT'D I MISS?

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:52.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500
WAS IT GOOD?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.333
OKAY.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.333
IT'S THE SAME PLACE
I FELL ASLEEP LAST TIME.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:00.166
DARN IT.

00:03:00.166 --> 00:03:02.966
THIS IS ANOTHER CLIP
FROM "KILLER KARAOKE."

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.333
[jaunty country music]

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:06.800
- [singing]
ON THE ROAD AGAIN

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.433
GOIN' PLACES
THAT I'VE NEVER BEEN

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:14.066
SEEIN' THINGS
THAT I MAY NEVER SEE AGAIN

00:03:14.066 --> 00:03:15.633
COME ON, GIRLS.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:19.233
[singing] I CAN'T WAIT
TO GET ON THE ROAD AGAIN

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:21.166
ON THE ROAD AGAIN

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:24.500
LIKE A BAND OF GYPSIES,
WE GO DOWN THE HIGHWAY

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.666
OH, MAN.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:28.000
[singing]
WE'RE THE BEST OF FRIENDS

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.833
INSISTING THAT THE WORLD KEEP
TURNING OUR WAY

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.500
[screams]
ON THE ROAD

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.600
ON THE ROAD AGAIN

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.366
OW!

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:38.666
JUST CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:40.833
[screams]
THE ROAD AGAIN

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.500
- OH, MAN.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.333
OW!
[cheers and applause]

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.166
GOD.

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:52.833
I WOULD NEVER LET SOMEONE
WAX MY CHEST FOR $10,000.

00:03:52.833 --> 00:03:55.333
PROBABLY WOULDN'T
LET SOMEONE WAX MY CHEST.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.233
I DON'T NEED IT WAXED,
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING.

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:58.566
[laughter]

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:01.000
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ME
TO EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.100
MOVING ON.

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.833
AND FINALLY,
I'M NOT PROUD OF THIS.

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.666
THERE'S A SHOW
THAT I STUMBLED UPON.

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.166
IT'S CALLED
"SEX SENT ME TO THE E.R."

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.833
AND--
[audience groans]

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.800
UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S ABOUT
EXACTLY WHAT THE TITLE SAYS.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.833
- HAPPY ONE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.500
- WELL, I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
WE'D BEEN DATING FOR A WHILE,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.900
SO IT'S LIKE, "YOU KNOW, WHAT?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.566
WHY DON'T WE TRY AND TAKE THIS
TO THE NEXT LEVEL?"

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:24.200
- SO I'M TRYING TO GO AS--
YOU KNOW,

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.900
AS FULL-OUT AS I CAN, YOU KNOW?

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.933
WHEN WHAT HAPPENED WAS,
HER TOP OF HER HEAD

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:29.266
WAS PUSHED AGAINST
THE BACK WALL.

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:30.833
440 POUNDS PUSHED HER--

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:32.666
- [grunts]

00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:37.266
- HER HEAD WENT THROUGH
THE SHEETROCK WALL.

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.933
THERE WAS SHEETROCK KIND OF LIKE
ON THE FRONT OF HER FACE.

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:41.100
HER EYES ARE CLOSED.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.666
HANDS OPEN, NOT MOVING,
KIND OF LIKE, "UGH."

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:46.166
MY INITIAL REACTION IS,
I KILLED HER.

00:04:46.166 --> 00:04:47.533
SHE LOOKS AT ME AND SHE GOES--

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:49.333
- WHY DID YOU STOP?

00:04:49.333 --> 00:04:52.333
[laughter]

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.300
- OH, YOUR FACES, ALL OF YOU,
IN THE AUDIENCE.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.833
THAT WAS A LOT TO TAKE IN.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.666
LET'S TRY TO GET THOSE IMAGES
OUT OF OUR MIND WITH A DANCE.
