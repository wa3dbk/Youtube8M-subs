00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.150 
and what we're going to do is swap
between<00:05:26.889> them<00:05:27.280> without<00:05:27.729> breaking<00:05:28.120> them<00:05:28.240> off

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
between them without breaking them off

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.870 
between them without breaking them off
shoot<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.490> fusion<00:05:31.030> coil<00:05:31.300> they<00:05:32.139> will<00:05:32.880> swap

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
shoot the fusion coil they will swap

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.290 
shoot the fusion coil they will swap
back<00:05:34.180> to<00:05:34.630> the<00:05:35.139> plasma<00:05:35.770> cannon<00:05:36.310> and<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:37.120> time

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
back to the plasma cannon and this time

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.730 
back to the plasma cannon and this time
we're<00:05:37.450> going<00:05:37.539> to<00:05:37.630> break<00:05:37.870> it<00:05:38.020> off<00:05:38.139> switch<00:05:38.470> over

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
we're going to break it off switch over

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.129 
we're going to break it off switch over
to<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:38.950> other<00:05:39.070> one<00:05:39.340> and<00:05:40.300> break<00:05:40.630> it<00:05:40.810> off<00:05:41.130> so

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
to the other one and break it off so

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.529 
to the other one and break it off so
rich<00:05:44.139> demonstrate<00:05:44.710> here<00:05:44.830> for<00:05:45.130> you

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:50.879 

successfully<00:05:49.539> done<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:49.750> without<00:05:50.379> breaking

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
successfully done it without breaking

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:57.990 
successfully done it without breaking
them<00:05:51.039> off<00:05:55.470> there<00:05:56.470> he<00:05:56.620> goes<00:05:56.800> and<00:05:57.280> it's<00:05:57.460> broken

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
them off there he goes and it's broken

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.909 
them off there he goes and it's broken
it<00:05:58.240> off<00:05:58.360> now<00:05:59.520> and<00:06:01.080> break<00:06:02.080> off<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.470> plasma

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 
it off now and break off the plasma

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:06.089 
it off now and break off the plasma
cannon<00:06:03.190> at<00:06:03.280> a<00:06:03.310> shoot<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.770> that<00:06:05.919> was<00:06:06.069> that

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
cannon at a shoot so that was that

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:09.240 
cannon at a shoot so that was that
exercise<00:06:06.729> and<00:06:07.030> now<00:06:07.150> here<00:06:07.599> we<00:06:07.629> have<00:06:08.250> the

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
exercise and now here we have the

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.580 
exercise and now here we have the
warthog<00:06:09.729> and<00:06:10.120> this<00:06:10.750> is<00:06:10.930> actually<00:06:11.319> a<00:06:11.349> goshawk

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
warthog and this is actually a goshawk

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.830 
warthog and this is actually a goshawk
here<00:06:12.129> what<00:06:12.849> we're<00:06:12.970> going<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.150> do<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.569> shoot

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
here what we're going to do is shoot

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.320 
here what we're going to do is shoot
across<00:06:14.139> the<00:06:14.289> room<00:06:14.500> at<00:06:15.039> the<00:06:15.099> fusion<00:06:15.879> coil<00:06:16.060> since

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:16.330 
across the room at the fusion coil since

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.779 
across the room at the fusion coil since
they're<00:06:16.479> flying<00:06:17.400> that'll<00:06:18.400> be<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.490> same

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
they're flying that'll be the same

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.909 
they're flying that'll be the same
fusion<00:06:19.240> coils<00:06:19.509> that<00:06:19.539> we<00:06:19.720> use<00:06:20.020> for<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.530> sniper

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919 
fusion coils that we use for the sniper

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.850 
fusion coils that we use for the sniper
and<00:06:21.780> we're<00:06:22.780> going<00:06:22.930> to<00:06:22.960> try<00:06:23.110> to<00:06:23.169> hit<00:06:23.409> the<00:06:23.530> fusion

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:23.860 
and we're going to try to hit the fusion

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.460 
and we're going to try to hit the fusion
coils<00:06:24.220> as<00:06:24.430> they're<00:06:24.669> in<00:06:24.789> their<00:06:24.940> descent<00:06:25.470> so

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470
