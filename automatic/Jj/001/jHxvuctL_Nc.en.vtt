this<00:01:26.640> first<00:01:26.790> question<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.270> how<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> deal

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
this first question is how do you deal

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.510 
this first question is how do you deal
with<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> reading<00:01:28.530> slump<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.280> definitely

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
with a reading slump and I definitely

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.460 
with a reading slump and I definitely
get<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.000> reading<00:01:30.270> slums<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.689> guess<00:01:30.960> there<00:01:31.409> are

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
get in reading slums I guess there are

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.649 
get in reading slums I guess there are
times<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:31.890> busy<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.450> wouldn't

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
times where I'm just busy so I wouldn't

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.999 
times where I'm just busy so I wouldn't
really<00:01:33.750> consider<00:01:33.930> those<00:01:34.290> readings<00:01:34.619> limbs<00:01:34.829> but

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
really consider those readings limbs but

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.410 
really consider those readings limbs but
there<00:01:35.189> are<00:01:35.250> also<00:01:35.340> times<00:01:35.610> where<00:01:35.909> I'm<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.240> lazy

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
there are also times where I'm just lazy

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.350 
there are also times where I'm just lazy
or<00:01:37.280> more<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.460> than<00:01:38.610> that<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> just<00:01:39.060> don't<00:01:39.210> want

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
or more so than that I just don't want

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.609 
or more so than that I just don't want
to<00:01:39.390> read<00:01:39.540> for<00:01:39.689> some<00:01:39.840> reason<00:01:40.079> either<00:01:40.200> book<00:01:40.470> has

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
to read for some reason either book has

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.870 
to read for some reason either book has
put<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.040> in<00:01:41.070> this<00:01:41.460> kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.409> state<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
put me in this kind of state of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.950 
put me in this kind of state of
neglecting<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:45.000> reading<00:01:45.360> habits<00:01:45.390> or
