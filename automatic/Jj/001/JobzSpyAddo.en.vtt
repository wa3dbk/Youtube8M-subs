bit<00:03:12.460> more<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.760> drink<00:03:12.910> than<00:03:13.000> we<00:03:13.120> normally<00:03:13.240> do<00:03:13.540> I

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
bit more to drink than we normally do I

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.930 
bit more to drink than we normally do I
think<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.200> good<00:03:14.290> idea<00:03:14.440> to<00:03:14.650> take<00:03:15.310> stock<00:03:15.640> in

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
think it's a good idea to take stock in

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.460 
think it's a good idea to take stock in
the<00:03:16.120> New<00:03:16.240> Year<00:03:16.480> is<00:03:16.660> it's<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.990> time<00:03:17.170> when<00:03:17.350> people

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
the New Year is it's a time when people

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.230 
the New Year is it's a time when people
do<00:03:17.710> this<00:03:17.860> is<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.010> psychological<00:03:18.460> step<00:03:18.940> that<00:03:19.120> we

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
do this is a psychological step that we

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.120 
do this is a psychological step that we
take<00:03:19.480> a<00:03:19.510> lot<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.780> us<00:03:19.960> but<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.500> think<00:03:20.590> actually

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
take a lot of us but I think actually

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.850 
take a lot of us but I think actually
for<00:03:21.580> me<00:03:22.000> if<00:03:22.300> as<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:22.930> nutritionist<00:03:23.440> I<00:03:23.530> would<00:03:23.710> say

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
for me if as a nutritionist I would say

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.980 
for me if as a nutritionist I would say
just<00:03:24.790> try<00:03:25.000> and<00:03:25.060> think<00:03:25.150> about<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.600> long<00:03:25.750> term

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
just try and think about the long term

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.020 
just try and think about the long term
take<00:03:26.350> small<00:03:26.650> steps<00:03:26.920> try<00:03:27.220> and<00:03:27.370> try<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:27.850> eat

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
take small steps try and try and eat

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.550

that's<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.770> big<00:03:29.920> step<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.250> itself<00:03:30.460> try<00:03:30.760> and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
that's a big step in itself try and

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.760 
that's a big step in itself try and
switch<00:03:31.090> to<00:03:31.270> whole-grain<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:31.930> try<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.590> just

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
so so I think I come back sorry to

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.450 
so so I think I come back sorry to
disagree<00:04:49.569> with<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:49.960> because<00:04:50.499> because<00:04:51.340> you

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
disagree with that because because you

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.820 
disagree with that because because you
you<00:04:51.819> risk<00:04:52.029> actually<00:04:52.529> reducing<00:04:53.529> some<00:04:53.650> of<00:04:53.740> your

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
you risk actually reducing some of your

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.890 
you risk actually reducing some of your
nutrients<00:04:54.219> therefore<00:04:54.460> give<00:04:54.580> up<00:04:54.729> dairy<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.719> lot

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
nutrients therefore give up dairy a lot

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.999 
nutrients therefore give up dairy a lot
of<00:04:56.020> people<00:04:56.259> will<00:04:56.349> do<00:04:56.439> that<00:04:56.469> without<00:04:56.800> realizing

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:57.009 
of people will do that without realizing

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.379 
of people will do that without realizing
that<00:04:57.310> they<00:04:57.400> have<00:04:57.550> to<00:04:57.639> replace<00:04:57.849> the<00:04:58.000> calcium

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
that they have to replace the calcium

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.999 
that they have to replace the calcium
that<00:04:58.479> they're<00:04:58.629> losing<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.139> if<00:04:59.560> you<00:04:59.680> give<00:04:59.830> up

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:00.009 
that they're losing and if you give up

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.950 
that they're losing and if you give up
gluten<00:05:00.729> and<00:05:00.819> there's<00:05:00.969> no<00:05:01.090> reason<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.449> do<00:05:01.629> so<00:05:01.840> it

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
gluten and there's no reason to do so it

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.570 
gluten and there's no reason to do so it
can<00:05:02.110> be<00:05:02.199> expensive<00:05:02.560> it's<00:05:02.919> difficult<00:05:03.400> for<00:05:03.490> the

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
can be expensive it's difficult for the

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.499 
can be expensive it's difficult for the
family<00:05:03.909> that<00:05:03.939> you<00:05:04.090> know<00:05:04.150> you'll<00:05:04.330> suddenly

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:04.509 
family that you know you'll suddenly

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:05.999 
family that you know you'll suddenly
cutting<00:05:04.900> out<00:05:05.020> bread<00:05:05.229> for<00:05:05.379> example<00:05:05.439> and<00:05:05.919> that

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
cutting out bread for example and that

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.189 
cutting out bread for example and that
affects<00:05:06.310> the<00:05:06.430> whole<00:05:06.610> family<00:05:07.029> so<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.539> pasture

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
affects the whole family so and pasture

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.179 
affects the whole family so and pasture
and<00:05:08.349> things<00:05:08.500> like<00:05:08.560> that<00:05:08.620> and<00:05:08.830> I<00:05:08.860> just<00:05:09.039> think

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
and things like that and I just think

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:11.249 
and things like that and I just think
they're<00:05:09.699> quite<00:05:09.939> they're<00:05:10.569> quite<00:05:10.750> drastic

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
they're quite they're quite drastic

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:12.600 
they're quite they're quite drastic
steps<00:05:11.529> to<00:05:11.680> take<00:05:11.830> when<00:05:11.889> actually<00:05:12.340> what<00:05:12.490> we're

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
steps to take when actually what we're

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.670 
steps to take when actually what we're
trying<00:05:12.849> to<00:05:13.000> achieve<00:05:13.300> is<00:05:13.810> a<00:05:13.870> healthy<00:05:14.349> balanced

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
trying to achieve is a healthy balanced

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.769 
trying to achieve is a healthy balanced
diet<00:05:14.740> over<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.430> long<00:05:15.580> term<00:05:15.879> and<00:05:16.210> I<00:05:16.509> think

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779 
diet over the long term and I think

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:18.959 
diet over the long term and I think
trying<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.169> look<00:05:17.800> at<00:05:17.979> things<00:05:18.159> with<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> lot<00:05:18.639> that

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:18.969 
trying to look at things with a lot that

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:20.610 
trying to look at things with a lot that
have<00:05:19.060> a<00:05:19.089> longevity<00:05:19.659> as<00:05:19.779> much<00:05:19.990> it's<00:05:20.349> a<00:05:20.439> much

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
have a longevity as much it's a much

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.459 
have a longevity as much it's a much
simpler<00:05:21.400> and<00:05:21.580> safer<00:05:21.789> way<00:05:22.029> forward<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.659> think

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:23.469 
simpler and safer way forward I think

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:25.050 
simpler and safer way forward I think
it's<00:05:23.560> really<00:05:23.919> important<00:05:24.669> for<00:05:24.759> you<00:05:24.939> to

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
it's really important for you to

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.730 
it's really important for you to
understand<00:05:25.509> that<00:05:25.659> in<00:05:25.870> fact<00:05:25.900> you<00:05:26.379> are<00:05:26.529> not

understand that in fact you are not

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.189 
understand that in fact you are not
wedded<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.129> bread<00:05:27.430> and<00:05:27.639> that<00:05:28.330> calcium<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:29.080> be

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
wedded to bread and that calcium can be

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.619 
wedded to bread and that calcium can be
taken<00:05:29.770> up<00:05:29.889> from<00:05:30.159> leafy<00:05:30.639> green<00:05:30.849> vegetables<00:05:31.389> and

Janice<00:05:41.710> how<00:05:42.039> many<00:05:42.310> vegetables<00:05:42.969> would<00:05:43.270> you

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
Janice how many vegetables would you

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.450 
Janice how many vegetables would you
have<00:05:43.509> to<00:05:43.659> eat<00:05:43.779> to<00:05:44.529> replace<00:05:44.949> the<00:05:45.099> calcium

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
have to eat to replace the calcium

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.339 
have to eat to replace the calcium
you're<00:05:45.639> not<00:05:45.729> getting<00:05:46.029> through<00:05:46.240> dairy<00:05:46.810> well

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
you're not getting through dairy well

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:48.809 
you're not getting through dairy well
you<00:05:47.469> actually<00:05:47.620> will<00:05:47.949> just<00:05:48.129> need<00:05:48.310> two<00:05:48.550> or<00:05:48.639> three

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819 
you actually will just need two or three

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.760 
you actually will just need two or three
large<00:05:49.029> servings<00:05:49.629> of<00:05:49.750> leafy<00:05:50.080> green<00:05:50.289> vegetables

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
large servings of leafy green vegetables

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.809 
large servings of leafy green vegetables
I<00:05:50.860> mean<00:05:51.009> I'm<00:05:51.159> just<00:05:51.189> lazy

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:51.819 
I mean I'm just lazy

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:53.579 
I mean I'm just lazy
so<00:05:51.939> I<00:05:51.969> blend<00:05:52.330> them<00:05:52.449> similar<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.379> think

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:53.589 
so I blend them similar you think

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:54.420 
so I blend them similar you think
there's<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.740> bit<00:05:53.860> more<00:05:53.979> than<00:05:54.129> that<00:05:54.159> and<00:05:54.339> I<00:05:54.399> think

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
there's a bit more than that and I think

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.829 
there's a bit more than that and I think
that<00:05:54.759> the<00:05:54.879> thing<00:05:55.060> is<00:05:55.180> it's<00:05:55.389> not<00:05:55.509> as<00:05:55.689> or

00:05:55.829 --> 00:05:55.839 
that the thing is it's not as or

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.689 
that the thing is it's not as or
absorbed<00:05:56.319> as<00:05:56.409> well<00:05:56.589> as<00:05:56.710> this<00:05:56.889> from<00:05:57.129> from<00:05:57.460> Dairy

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
Foods be 8 percent of that of the

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.119 
country cannot absorb anything to do
with<00:06:02.050> dairy<00:06:02.409> because<00:06:02.620> they<00:06:02.770> don't<00:06:02.919> have<00:06:02.949> the

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:03.129 
with dairy because they don't have the

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:04.800 
with dairy because they don't have the
