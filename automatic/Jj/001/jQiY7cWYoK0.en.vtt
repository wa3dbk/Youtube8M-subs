the<00:02:02.549> laser<00:02:02.759> following<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:04.380> explosive

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
the laser following you the explosive

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
the laser following you the explosive
tar<00:02:05.130> on<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> ground<00:02:05.719> shock<00:02:06.719> pulses<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
tar on the ground shock pulses and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.089 
tar on the ground shock pulses and
seismic<00:02:08.429> activity<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.140> he'll<00:02:10.349> shoot<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.770> crap

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
seismic activity but he'll shoot a crap

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.820 
seismic activity but he'll shoot a crap
ton<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.580> mortars<00:02:11.940> out<00:02:12.150> there<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.629> avoid

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
ton of mortars out there to avoid

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.740 
ton of mortars out there to avoid
I'll<00:02:14.400> explain<00:02:14.580> our<00:02:14.970> strategy<00:02:15.390> for<00:02:15.600> dealing

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
I'll explain our strategy for dealing

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.320 
I'll explain our strategy for dealing
with<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.170> in<00:02:16.380> more<00:02:16.710> detail<00:02:17.070> later<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
with this in more detail later but the

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.970 
with this in more detail later but the
basic<00:02:18.690> premise<00:02:18.870> will<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.350> to<00:02:19.560> choose<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
basic premise will be to choose the

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.580 
basic premise will be to choose the
mechanic<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.820> bit<00:02:21.000> by<00:02:21.660> being<00:02:21.930> very<00:02:21.990> far

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
mechanic a little bit by being very far

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.670 
mechanic a little bit by being very far
away<00:02:22.710> from<00:02:23.040> him<00:02:23.250> for<00:02:23.550> most<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.000> phase

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
away from him for most of this phase

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.050 
away from him for most of this phase
we'll<00:02:25.680> get<00:02:25.830> more<00:02:26.070> into<00:02:26.130> that<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.550> a<00:02:26.790> little<00:02:26.820> bit

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
we'll get more into that in a little bit

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.510 
we'll get more into that in a little bit
as<00:02:27.390> that<00:02:28.230> feels<00:02:28.500> like<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.950> hardest<00:02:29.250> section

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
as that feels like the hardest section

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.110 
as that feels like the hardest section
of<00:02:29.850> this<00:02:30.120> fight<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.770> first<00:02:32.100> let's<00:02:32.940> at<00:02:33.090> least

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
of this fight but first let's at least

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.990 
of this fight but first let's at least
go<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.570> order<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.470> phases<00:02:34.950> and<00:02:35.130> talk<00:02:35.760> about

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
go in order of the phases and talk about

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.900 
go in order of the phases and talk about
assault<00:02:36.390> phase<00:02:37.190> really<00:02:38.190> there<00:02:38.430> aren't<00:02:38.730> any

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
assault phase really there aren't any

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.730 
assault phase really there aren't any
major<00:02:39.180> changes<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.930> execution<00:02:40.590> or

major changes to the execution or

major changes to the execution or

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
strategy for this phase other than

strategy for this phase other than
avoiding<00:02:43.290> ricochet<00:02:44.060> we<00:02:45.060> try<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.360> relieve<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
avoiding ricochet we try to relieve a

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.630 
avoiding ricochet we try to relieve a
little<00:02:46.110> bit<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.470> pressure<00:02:46.710> from<00:02:47.040> our<00:02:47.220> tanks

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
little bit of pressure from our tanks

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.570 
little bit of pressure from our tanks
and<00:02:47.790> healers<00:02:48.150> by<00:02:48.870> rotating<00:02:49.260> one<00:02:49.650> dps<00:02:50.010> into

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
and healers by rotating one dps into

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.660 
and healers by rotating one dps into
every<00:02:50.910> cycle<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.360> mines<00:02:51.770> so<00:02:52.770> three<00:02:53.100> mines<00:02:53.370> come

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
every cycle of mines so three mines come

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.990 
every cycle of mines so three mines come
out<00:02:53.850> per<00:02:54.120> set<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:55.380> DPS<00:02:55.830> would<00:02:56.070> take<00:02:56.310> one<00:02:56.730> out

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
out per set and a DPS would take one out

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.850 
out per set and a DPS would take one out
of<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.360> set<00:02:57.720> with<00:02:58.020> their<00:02:58.200> major<00:02:58.410> damage

of that set with their major damage
reduction<00:02:59.130> cooldowns<00:02:59.840> so<00:03:00.840> first<00:03:01.080> it<00:03:01.230> was<00:03:01.350> me

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
reduction cooldowns so first it was me

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.360 
reduction cooldowns so first it was me
than<00:03:02.280> our<00:03:02.430> mage<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.510> our<00:03:03.660> warlock<00:03:04.370> the

than our mage and then our warlock the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.550 
than our mage and then our warlock the
off<00:03:05.550> tank<00:03:05.880> at<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.240> time<00:03:06.510> would<00:03:07.050> get<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.380> other

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
off tank at the time would get the other

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.400 
off tank at the time would get the other
two<00:03:07.860> mines<00:03:08.160> per<00:03:08.459> set<00:03:08.760> but<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.780> your<00:03:09.959> tanks<00:03:10.260> are

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
two mines per set but if your tanks are

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.020 
two mines per set but if your tanks are
capable<00:03:10.650> of<00:03:11.040> getting<00:03:11.310> all<00:03:11.520> three<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> row

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
capable of getting all three in a row

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.600 
capable of getting all three in a row
quickly<00:03:12.510> then<00:03:13.500> maybe<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.070> isn't<00:03:14.280> something

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
quickly then maybe this isn't something

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.540 
quickly then maybe this isn't something
you<00:03:14.850> worry<00:03:15.090> about<00:03:15.590> we<00:03:16.590> just<00:03:16.830> like<00:03:16.980> to<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:17.550 
you worry about we just like to have the

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.580 
you worry about we just like to have the
range<00:03:17.790> stay<00:03:18.150> very<00:03:18.510> far<00:03:18.780> back<00:03:19.080> to<00:03:19.290> avoid

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
range stay very far back to avoid

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.400 
range stay very far back to avoid
ricochet<00:03:20.160> so<00:03:21.060> we<00:03:21.300> might<00:03:21.510> end<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:21.840> with<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.050> minor

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
ricochet so we might end up with a minor

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.560 
ricochet so we might end up with a minor
to<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.980> was<00:03:23.130> very<00:03:23.519> far<00:03:23.820> away<00:03:23.970> from<00:03:24.120> the<00:03:24.360> boss

plan for handling all of this we had

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.140 
plan for handling all of this we had
enough<00:03:48.870> dps<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.560> decide<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.220> avoid<00:03:50.640> even

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150

attacking the boss throughout much of
this<00:03:53.100> phase<00:03:53.690> so<00:03:54.690> our<00:03:54.870> strategy<00:03:55.080> revolved

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
this phase so our strategy revolved

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.090 
this phase so our strategy revolved
around<00:03:55.950> out<00:03:56.370> ranging<00:03:56.940> the<00:03:57.120> mortar<00:03:57.420> barrage<00:03:58.100> so

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
around out ranging the mortar barrage so

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.550 
around out ranging the mortar barrage so
here's<00:03:59.430> how<00:03:59.610> it<00:03:59.730> flowed<00:03:59.970> for<00:04:00.239> us<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:01.320> siege

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.979 
here's how it flowed for us the siege
mode<00:04:01.769> phase<00:04:02.010> would<00:04:02.220> begin<00:04:02.550> we<00:04:03.450> wouldn't<00:04:03.840> do

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
mode phase would begin we wouldn't do

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.050 
mode phase would begin we wouldn't do
anything<00:04:04.320> other<00:04:04.739> than<00:04:04.980> our<00:04:05.130> normal<00:04:05.310> DPS<00:04:05.880> and

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
anything other than our normal DPS and

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.420 
anything other than our normal DPS and
healing<00:04:06.290> until<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.410> first<00:04:07.680> shock<00:04:07.920> pulse<00:04:08.190> was

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
healing until the first shock pulse was

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.420 
healing until the first shock pulse was
about<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.850> go<00:04:09.000> out<00:04:09.230> we<00:04:10.230> then<00:04:10.440> all<00:04:10.739> ran<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.280> this

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
about to go out we then all ran to this

biraj never reaches us so it's just a

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
the tar and then we would group back up

and keep healing healing CDs should be

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
the mines here so don't forget about

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.580 
the mines here so don't forget about

those with current gear levels you are

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.620 
those with current gear levels you are
almost<00:05:05.830> guaranteed<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.730> get<00:05:06.880> two<00:05:07.210> of<00:05:07.240> these

almost guaranteed to get two of these
siege<00:05:07.930> mode<00:05:08.170> phases<00:05:08.740> so<00:05:09.490> plan<00:05:09.730> your<00:05:09.760> cooldowns

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:10.270 
siege mode phases so plan your cooldowns

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.810 
siege mode phases so plan your cooldowns
accordingly<00:05:10.780> but<00:05:11.710> three<00:05:12.160> minute<00:05:12.400> cooldowns

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
accordingly but three minute cooldowns

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.600 
accordingly but three minute cooldowns
will<00:05:13.300> be<00:05:13.480> back<00:05:13.690> up<00:05:13.900> for<00:05:14.110> that<00:05:14.230> phase<00:05:14.530> so<00:05:15.310> having

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 
will be back up for that phase so having

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.640 
will be back up for that phase so having
a<00:05:15.670> similar<00:05:16.060> plan<00:05:16.270> for<00:05:16.540> each<00:05:16.660> siege<00:05:17.140> mode<00:05:17.380> phase

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
a similar plan for each siege mode phase

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.400 
a similar plan for each siege mode phase
works<00:05:18.040> just<00:05:18.250> fine<00:05:18.840> once<00:05:19.840> you<00:05:20.020> get<00:05:20.140> through<00:05:20.320> a

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
works just fine once you get through a

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.470 
works just fine once you get through a
second<00:05:20.980> siege<00:05:21.190> mode<00:05:21.460> with<00:05:21.700> everyone<00:05:22.150> alive

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
second siege mode with everyone alive

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.980 
second siege mode with everyone alive
you<00:05:23.290> are<00:05:23.410> pretty<00:05:23.680> much<00:05:23.740> going<00:05:24.130> to<00:05:24.250> win<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.810> in
