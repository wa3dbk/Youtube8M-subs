I<00:02:08.759> think<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:09.060> bank<00:02:09.239> rollback<00:02:09.690> would<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.050> more

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
I think a bank rollback would be more

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.809 
I think a bank rollback would be more
suitable<00:02:10.530> than<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.770> parent<00:02:11.129> ban<00:02:11.280> since<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.730> was

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
suitable than a parent ban since it was

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.670 
suitable than a parent ban since it was
only<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.330> GPA<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:13.110> there<00:02:13.200> was<00:02:13.290> no

XP gain and it was kinda the mistake of
Jagex<00:02:16.620> coding<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.129> the<00:02:18.030> lack<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.209> bug<00:02:18.569> testing

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
