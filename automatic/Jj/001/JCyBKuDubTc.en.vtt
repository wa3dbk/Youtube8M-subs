00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.949
 a few years ago with equipment of all field you of yesterday and quoted the industry that 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:18.099
 they believe in the colony use in the department of the high parana 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.919
 where different types of cheese are made using as milk base 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:26.380
 larra feel introduced in that area 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.859
 once again we were there where we saw with an increase in production and 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.860
 also the incorporation that your sins 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.630
 the production of cheeses 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.640
 even at the wholesale level, it requires craftsmanship 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.320
 This product made from curdled milk and bacteria that take care of 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.160
 make explain that choice 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.510
 it becomes an explicit nor 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.350
 sitting in various flavors 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.380
 the species that experience ripening levels nathan hale 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.740
 breeds used for raw materials 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.440
 and the elaboration process 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.860
 they stop the style and taste of the cheeses 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.370
 what makes in the world there hundreds 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.580
 of varieties of that food 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.570
 Mr. Dominguez 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.260
 started with this activity ten years ago 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.550
 with the installation of the extreme box 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.870
 in the colony 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.680
 right now we are processing according to a report 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.040
 of seed and all are 300 meters although his men and he showed up from all of it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.940
 that end 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.010
 something that fixed and includes everything that souza adding 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.460
 that cement is included in the extradition 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 and we were going to xilxes 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.590
 team that is that is a duo josÃ© mingo who suffered 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.979
 the raw material used milk time the jersey race 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.690
 whose product has ideal characteristics for the cheese industry 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.399
 I have four conduit 

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.719
 what about the four points 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.159
 more than one point efe 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.469
 I will be 

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.569
 anxious oranges 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.309
 what suits me and for the food 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:28.349
 and for the quality of milk dn in milk very very natural 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.999
 who much calcium much neckline and much similarity 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:35.069
 the tibial happens is that 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.319
 this is a mechanism 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.740
 these people maintain with the daily routine of production 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.199
 from Monday to Saturday 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:44.779
 here they also come to do internships 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.879
 some future cheese masters in the framework of a training project 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.269
 for the installation of boxes with other points of the country 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:55.829
 it was necessary from the project 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.509
 sustainable city project 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:00.259
 of student 

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:03.699
 and at the same time a donation of the largest ones and it goes off 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:07.469
 so it's dairy transplant in the field 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.079
 despite home affirmed 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.209
 so takahashi 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.239
 very junior engineer 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.539
 shahzad 

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:21.759
 these cultures the responsible explained said companies 

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:25.789
 they come to train in that place since the end production today is 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.169
 quoted among the main restaurants of the capital 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.669
 in the festival that started the development 

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.679
 of cheeses 

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.459
 with goat's milk 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.459
 instead the offer for the different 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.789
 the little one showing us one hundred percent 

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:44.059
 everything was missing 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.649
 ii then lord father of the colombo child who 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.149
 has a plant in it 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:51.689
 and 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.529
 the bed section 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:58.209
 and company camposol leche and had a lot of mexico so far 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.569
 more or less indicated since they position themselves wins 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.569
 and we are growing 

00:04:05.529 --> 00:04:07.349
 the challenge is accepted in the market 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.109
 but the production volume is still small 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.939
 because the cost is high for the consumer but there are possibilities 

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:17.719
 avoid promotion for some niches 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:22.679
 however an interesting leap for the cheese industry would be the export 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.870
 we had a big eye 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.180
 It was negotiated with Paraguay sells in Curitiba 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.680
 and the ementhal cheese can 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.620
 he was very successful in prices very well 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.930
 very accessible 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.909
 i 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:39.470
 firefighters monterrey nl 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.050
 there are some purchases 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.029
 sidor 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:46.090
 they tell me that he appointed him director of the teams so where I climb 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.699
 then he created 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.909
 and they are very interesting bread 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.590
 to achieve this goal 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.080
 it would be necessary to put in conditions of some documentation requirements 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.599
 and above all 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:04:59.990
 avoid production 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.990
 although it is a great challenge 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.819
 It is not impossible for Mr. Dominguez
