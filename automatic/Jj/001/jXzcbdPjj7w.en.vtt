 and Moses came up from her then said 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 jehova moses extend your hand and take it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.329

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 when he took it out, behold, his hand 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.940

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.940
 He had returned as the other flesh 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.730
 and it will happen that they did not believe you or 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.950
 obeyed the voice of the first signal 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.229
 they will believe the voice of the post era and if still 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.800
 do not believe these two signs and oier 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.930
 in your voice 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.180
 you will take from the waters of the river and 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 he poured on land and change 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.729
 those waters that you will take from the river and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.240
 they will make blood on the earth then he said 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.610

 I am slow in speech and clumsy 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.720
 and jehovah answered him who gave the mouth 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.899
 the man or who made the world and 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.740
 deaf to the one who sees and the blind man is not me 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.240
 jehovah now go and I will be with you 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.740

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.530

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.229
 by means of which you must send then 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.690
 jehovah got angry against bassinet and said no 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.320
 I know your brother Aaron Levite and 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.570

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.210

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.080
 words and I will be with your mouth and with 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.320
 yours and I will show you what you have 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.810
 do and he will speak for you to the people the 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.630
 to be you instead of mouth and you will be 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.459
 for him instead of god and you will take in your 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.270
 hand is the rod with which you will make the 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.550
 signals 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.250

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.290
 father-in-law told him I 'll go now and I'll be back 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.860

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.830

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.430

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.260

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.510
 in your hand but I harden your heart 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.810
 so that he will not let the people go and 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.630
 you will say to pharaoh jehovah has said well 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.640

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.320
 I met and wanted to kill him 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.110

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.660
 aaron sees to receive moses to the desert 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.900

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.880
 God and kissed him then he told Moses 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.280

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.370
