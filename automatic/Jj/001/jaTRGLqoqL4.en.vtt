it<00:05:23.160> still<00:05:23.640> got<00:05:23.850> a<00:05:23.880> lot<00:05:24.060> of<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.300> sort<00:05:24.450> of<00:05:24.510> matte

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.680 
it still got a lot of the sort of matte
texture<00:05:25.790> on<00:05:26.790> the<00:05:26.880> controller<00:05:27.240> and<00:05:27.420> it<00:05:27.510> doesn't

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
texture on the controller and it doesn't

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.350 
texture on the controller and it doesn't
even<00:05:27.750> look<00:05:27.840> used

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
even look used

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.770 
even look used
but<00:05:30.360> yeah<00:05:30.720> so<00:05:31.110> that's<00:05:31.560> the<00:05:31.830> Neo<00:05:31.980> Geo<00:05:32.280> CD<00:05:32.370> z<00:05:33.150> /

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
but yeah so that's the Neo Geo CD z /

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.230

Zed<00:05:34.260> and<00:05:34.440> like<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.860> say<00:05:35.100> hopefully<00:05:35.730> a<00:05:35.910> lot<00:05:36.030> loads

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
Zed and like I say hopefully a lot loads

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.940

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
and finish I've been playing it later on

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.930 
and finish I've been playing it later on
