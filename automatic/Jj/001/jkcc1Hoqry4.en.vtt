00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
actually looks really nice um it looks

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.210 
actually looks really nice um it looks
like<00:02:14.390> Johnny<00:02:14.720> Five<00:02:14.989> if<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.830> know<00:02:15.950> what<00:02:16.099> that

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
like Johnny Five if you know what that

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.180 
like Johnny Five if you know what that
is<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.640> maybe<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:17.330> looks<00:02:17.420> like<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:17.629> robot<00:02:18.190> it's

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190
