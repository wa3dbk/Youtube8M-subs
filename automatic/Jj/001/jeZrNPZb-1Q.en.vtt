of my all-time favorite commentators but

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.570 
of my all-time favorite commentators but
the<00:00:25.019> theory<00:00:25.199> he<00:00:25.380> wanted<00:00:25.619> me<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.769> do<00:00:25.920> or<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.519> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the theory he wanted me to do or one of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.769 
the theory he wanted me to do or one of
the<00:00:26.640> things<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> wanted<00:00:27.060> me<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.210> do<00:00:27.330> was

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
the things you wanted me to do was

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.390 
the things you wanted me to do was
something<00:00:28.050> from<00:00:28.140> his<00:00:28.349> childhood<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.220> because

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
something from his childhood so because

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.849 
something from his childhood so because
all<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.210> series<00:00:31.109> I<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.289> been<00:00:31.500> doing<00:00:31.740> have

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
all of the series I have been doing have

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.350 
all of the series I have been doing have
been<00:00:32.009> more<00:00:32.250> recent<00:00:32.610> cartoons<00:00:32.969> he's<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> little

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
been more recent cartoons he's a little

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.940 
been more recent cartoons he's a little
bit<00:00:33.480> older<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.380> thought<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.590> would<00:00:34.800> do<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
bit older so I thought I would do a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.250 
bit older so I thought I would do a
cartoon<00:00:35.309> from<00:00:35.550> his<00:00:35.700> era<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.239> it's<00:00:36.989> actually<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
cartoon from his era and it's actually a

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.420 
cartoon from his era and it's actually a
really<00:00:37.440> good<00:00:37.620> theory<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.250> really

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
really good theory it's actually really

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.740 
really good theory it's actually really
fun<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.940> makes<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.120> lot<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.300> sense<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.690> it's

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
fun and it makes a lot of sense and it's

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.299 
fun and it makes a lot of sense and it's
actually<00:00:40.110> probably<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.219> better

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
actually probably one of the better

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.979 
actually probably one of the better
things<00:00:41.399> we've<00:00:41.670> done<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.030> far<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.450> this<00:00:42.629> series

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
things we've done so far on this series

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.630 
things we've done so far on this series
the<00:00:43.500> theory<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.950> going<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.309> doing<00:00:44.430> this

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the theory we're going to be doing this

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.229 
the theory we're going to be doing this
time<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.629> Inspector<00:00:46.350> Gadget<00:00:46.680> theory<00:00:47.309> so

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
time is the Inspector Gadget theory so

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.790 
time is the Inspector Gadget theory so
if<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.480> don't<00:00:48.660> quite<00:00:48.899> remember<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.320> cartoon

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
if we don't quite remember this cartoon

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.400 
if we don't quite remember this cartoon
I<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.489> was<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.000> action<00:00:51.840> live-action

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
I know it was a was a action live-action

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
I know it was a was a action live-action
movie<00:00:52.710> made<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.550> too<00:00:54.329> terribly<00:00:54.660> long

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
movie made of it not too terribly long

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.049 
movie made of it not too terribly long
ago<00:00:55.079> but<00:00:55.230> it<00:00:55.320> wasn't<00:00:55.469> exactly<00:00:55.770> recent<00:00:56.430> but

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059

which is dr. claw now into this theory
we're<00:01:18.509> getting<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:19.049> into<00:01:19.380> dr.<00:01:19.710> claw<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> who

we're getting more into dr. claw and who

he is because in this series they never
show<00:01:22.409> his<00:01:22.560> face<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> into<00:01:23.850> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
show his face and we're going into that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
show his face and we're going into that
and<00:01:24.090> just<00:01:24.780> while<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.950> a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and just while they do that in just a

and just while they do that in just a
second<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.520> but<00:01:27.030> first<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.479> little<00:01:27.659> more

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
second here but first a little more

second here but first a little more
backstory<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.590> show<00:01:28.740> itself<00:01:29.040> first<00:01:29.970> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
backstory on the show itself first of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
backstory on the show itself first of
all<00:01:30.180> they<00:01:30.329> don't<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:30.570> tell<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.130> how<00:01:32.130> or

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
all they don't really tell you how or

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.359 
all they don't really tell you how or
why<00:01:32.820> doctor<00:01:33.390> Det<00:01:33.570> Inspector<00:01:34.170> Gadget<00:01:34.320> has<00:01:35.070> all

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
why doctor Det Inspector Gadget has all

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.520 
why doctor Det Inspector Gadget has all
these<00:01:35.520> gadgets<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.180> his<00:01:36.329> like<00:01:36.930> basically<00:01:37.439> an

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
these gadgets and his like basically an

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.859 
these gadgets and his like basically an
Android<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.100> a<00:01:38.159> cyborg<00:01:38.700> or<00:01:38.970> whatever<00:01:39.689> where<00:01:39.810> do

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
Android or a cyborg or whatever where do

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:40.999 
Android or a cyborg or whatever where do
you<00:01:39.930> want<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> use<00:01:40.290> that<00:01:40.530> he's<00:01:40.710> basically

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you want to use that he's basically

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
you want to use that he's basically
half-man<00:01:41.579> half-machine<00:01:42.140> they<00:01:43.140> don't<00:01:43.290> really

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
half-man half-machine they don't really

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.100 
half-man half-machine they don't really
explain<00:01:43.530> why<00:01:44.220> he's<00:01:44.549> like<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.720> he<00:01:45.780> got

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
explain why he's like that or how he got

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.630 
explain why he's like that or how he got
to<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.549> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
to be like that and that's what this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.399 
to be like that and that's what this
theory<00:01:47.880> really<00:01:48.180> centers<00:01:48.509> around<00:01:48.630> was<00:01:48.930> why<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
theory really centers around was why and

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.980 
theory really centers around was why and
how<00:01:49.500> he<00:01:49.530> liked<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.540> basically<00:01:51.540> according<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
how he liked that basically according to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.399 
how he liked that basically according to
this<00:01:52.079> theory<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:53.390> is<00:01:54.390> pretty<00:01:54.990> actually

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
this theory that is pretty actually

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
this theory that is pretty actually
makes<00:01:55.530> pretty<00:01:55.619> good<00:01:55.710> sense<00:01:55.909> there<00:01:56.909> was<00:01:56.969> a

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
makes pretty good sense there was a

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:57.920 
makes pretty good sense there was a
freak<00:01:57.360> accident

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
freak accident

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.560 
freak accident

Inspector Gadget before it became
Inspector<00:02:01.049> Gadget<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.610> normal

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Inspector Gadget was just a normal

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
Inspector Gadget was just a normal
detective<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.439> he<00:02:04.500> was<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:04.770> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.009> field

like that when a terrible explosion
happened<00:02:11.610> he<00:02:11.730> was<00:02:11.819> undercover

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
happened he was undercover

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.600 
happened he was undercover

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
actual human didn't die he was actually

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.979 
actual human didn't die he was actually
alive<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.910> they<00:02:42.030> recreated<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.600> person

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
alive like they recreated this person

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.229 
alive like they recreated this person
and<00:02:43.140> programmed<00:02:43.950> him<00:02:44.220> to<00:02:44.250> have<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.850> exact

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
and programmed him to have the exact

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.590 
and programmed him to have the exact
same<00:02:45.770> mannerisms<00:02:46.770> his<00:02:47.370> thoughts<00:02:47.670> processes

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
same mannerisms his thoughts processes

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.810 
same mannerisms his thoughts processes
and<00:02:49.140> he<00:02:49.230> even<00:02:49.380> looked<00:02:49.530> over<00:02:49.800> his<00:02:49.950> niece<00:02:50.580> and

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
and he even looked over his niece and

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.550 
and he even looked over his niece and
his<00:02:50.910> dog<00:02:51.150> still<00:02:51.450> he<00:02:51.570> still<00:02:51.630> did<00:02:51.930> all<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.230> even

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
his dog still he still did all that even

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.320 
his dog still he still did all that even
though<00:02:52.650> he<00:02:52.769> was<00:02:52.920> no<00:02:53.640> longer<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:54.120> same<00:02:54.269> person

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
though he was no longer the same person

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.680 
though he was no longer the same person
a<00:02:54.720> separate<00:02:55.530> being<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.670> had<00:02:56.820> AI<00:02:57.120> instead

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
a separate being and it had AI instead

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.350 
a separate being and it had AI instead
of<00:02:57.750> an<00:02:57.840> actual<00:02:58.019> person<00:02:58.800> but<00:02:59.340> they<00:03:00.239> did<00:03:00.330> a

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
of an actual person but they did a

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.820 
of an actual person but they did a
pretty<00:03:00.510> good<00:03:00.690> job<00:03:00.750> on<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.350> apparently<00:03:01.739> in

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
pretty good job on the apparently in

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.199 
pretty good job on the apparently in
this<00:03:01.950> alternate<00:03:02.430> universe<00:03:02.459> word<00:03:03.000> they<00:03:03.180> have

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
this alternate universe word they have

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.270 
this alternate universe word they have
this<00:03:03.510> technology<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.170> build<00:03:04.320> someone

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
this technology to build someone

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.000 
this technology to build someone
completely<00:03:05.940> out<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:07.230> know<00:03:07.380> Bionic<00:03:07.800> parts

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
completely out of you know Bionic parts

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.560 
completely out of you know Bionic parts
they<00:03:08.670> did<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.850> pretty<00:03:09.000> good<00:03:09.150> job<00:03:09.209> and

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
they did a pretty good job and

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.620 
they did a pretty good job and
apparently<00:03:10.110> was<00:03:10.290> enough<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.739> him<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.630> to

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
replaced with a robot doppelganger if

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.710 
replaced with a robot doppelganger if
you<00:03:41.730> don't<00:03:41.850> know<00:03:41.910> what<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.030> doppelganger<00:03:42.570> is

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
you don't know what a doppelganger is

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.530 
you don't know what a doppelganger is
it's<00:03:42.959> like<00:03:43.079> a<00:03:43.280> second<00:03:44.280> person<00:03:45.239> that<00:03:45.390> looks

it's like a second person that looks
just<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:46.019> but<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.320> not<00:03:46.410> you<00:03:46.650> basically

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
just like you but it's not you basically

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.250 
just like you but it's not you basically

never see dr. claws face they never show

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:03.980 
never see dr. claws face they never show
his<00:05:02.820> face<00:05:03.030> they<00:05:03.210> just<00:05:03.390> show<00:05:03.510> his<00:05:03.720> arm

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990

sometimes they show his like here the
metal<00:05:05.940> arm<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:06.360> metal<00:05:06.570> fist<00:05:06.810> which<00:05:07.320> goes

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
metal arm and metal fist which goes

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.560 
metal arm and metal fist which goes
perfectly<00:05:08.310> into<00:05:08.880> line<00:05:09.120> with<00:05:09.150> what<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.510> just

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
perfectly into line with what I just

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.830 
perfectly into line with what I just
said<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.200> him<00:05:10.740> being<00:05:11.340> deformed<00:05:12.210> from<00:05:12.660> that

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
said of him being deformed from that

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.590 
said of him being deformed from that
accident<00:05:13.230> and<00:05:13.530> having<00:05:14.160> a<00:05:14.280> false<00:05:14.850> ham<00:05:15.180> a<00:05:15.210> false

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
accident and having a false ham a false

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.800 
accident and having a false ham a false
limb<00:05:15.960> or<00:05:16.110> something<00:05:16.320> like<00:05:16.410> that<00:05:16.730> basically

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
limb or something like that basically

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.690 
limb or something like that basically
they're<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.930> same<00:05:19.080> person<00:05:19.290> one's<00:05:19.710> just<00:05:20.070> a

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
they're the same person one's just a

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.030 
they're the same person one's just a
bionic<00:05:21.300> form<00:05:21.600> of<00:05:21.810> a<00:05:21.900> former<00:05:22.320> self<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:22.860> it's

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
bionic form of a former self and it's

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.160 
bionic form of a former self and it's
really<00:05:23.340> freakin<00:05:24.090> weird<00:05:24.420> they<00:05:24.690> would<00:05:24.840> do<00:05:24.990> this

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.170 
really freakin weird they would do this

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:26.600 
really freakin weird they would do this
it<00:05:25.560> makes<00:05:25.800> so<00:05:25.980> much<00:05:26.130> sense<00:05:26.160> it's<00:05:26.580> really

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
it makes so much sense it's really

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.070 
it makes so much sense it's really
trippy<00:05:27.210> when<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.390> think<00:05:27.570> about<00:05:27.660> it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
trippy when you think about it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.140 
trippy when you think about it
now<00:05:28.410> some<00:05:28.980> little<00:05:29.190> more<00:05:29.490> information<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:30.060> this
