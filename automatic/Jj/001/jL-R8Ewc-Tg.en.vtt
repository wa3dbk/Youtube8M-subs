your needle in very close to where you
came<00:00:55.790> up<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.930> first<00:00:56.960> place<00:00:57.260> right<00:00:57.710> next<00:00:58.070> to

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
came up in the first place right next to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.150 
came up in the first place right next to
it<00:00:58.310> or<00:00:58.580> even<00:00:59.270> on<00:00:59.570> it<00:00:59.720> but<00:00:59.870> not<00:01:00.020> kind<00:01:00.950> of<00:01:01.010> right

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
it or even on it but not kind of right

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.800 
it or even on it but not kind of right
into<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.610> and<00:01:01.790> then<00:01:02.240> you<00:01:02.329> want<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.510> bring<00:01:02.720> your

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:02.810 
into it and then you want to bring your

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.340 
into it and then you want to bring your
needle<00:01:03.020> up<00:01:03.290> a<00:01:03.850> short<00:01:04.850> distance<00:01:05.059> away<00:01:05.479> it's

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
needle up a short distance away it's

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.770 
needle up a short distance away it's
sort<00:01:06.500> of<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.920> chain<00:01:07.490> stitch<00:01:07.880> distance<00:01:08.329> away<00:01:08.600> but

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
sort of a chain stitch distance away but

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940 
sort of a chain stitch distance away but
you'll<00:01:08.930> get<00:01:09.020> the<00:01:09.140> hang<00:01:09.170> of<00:01:09.409> that<00:01:09.530> as<00:01:09.680> you<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.860> it

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
you'll get the hang of that as you do it

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.230 
you'll get the hang of that as you do it
and<00:01:10.100> that<00:01:10.189> thread<00:01:10.549> that<00:01:10.700> you've<00:01:10.850> put<00:01:11.060> in<00:01:11.150> the

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
and that thread that you've put in the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.130 
and that thread that you've put in the
loop<00:01:11.390> should<00:01:11.630> sit<00:01:11.869> behind<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.470> needle<00:01:14.140> and

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
loop should sit behind the needle and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.270 
loop should sit behind the needle and
then<00:01:15.409> you're<00:01:15.590> just<00:01:15.740> going<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.920> pull<00:01:16.130> that

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
then you're just going to pull that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.539 
then you're just going to pull that
through<00:01:16.609> and<00:01:16.850> just<00:01:17.270> gently<00:01:17.950> pull<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:18.979> that<00:01:19.249> and

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
through and just gently pull on that and

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:20.950 
through and just gently pull on that and
that<00:01:19.640> will<00:01:19.789> form<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.270> nice<00:01:20.450> sort<00:01:20.749> of<00:01:20.780> loop

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
that will form a nice sort of loop

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.349 
that will form a nice sort of loop
sitting<00:01:21.380> behind<00:01:21.530> that<00:01:21.920> thread<00:01:22.249> and<00:01:22.969> so<00:01:23.119> to<00:01:23.179> do

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 
sitting behind that thread and so to do

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.469 
sitting behind that thread and so to do
the<00:01:23.479> next<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:24.409> obviously<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:26.090> forming

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
the next one and obviously it's forming

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.969 
the next one and obviously it's forming
a<00:01:26.539> chain<00:01:26.840> which<00:01:27.079> is<00:01:27.109> why<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:27.499> called<00:01:27.649> chain

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
a chain which is why it's called chain

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.969 
a chain which is why it's called chain
stitch<00:01:28.249> again<00:01:28.729> needle<00:01:29.270> down<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.840> very<00:01:30.259> close

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
stitch again needle down and very close

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
stitch again needle down and very close
to<00:01:31.189> where<00:01:31.310> you<00:01:31.490> had<00:01:32.210> come<00:01:32.420> up<00:01:32.539> in<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.749> first

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
to where you had come up in the first

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.770 
to where you had come up in the first
place<00:01:33.579> your<00:01:34.579> thread<00:01:34.850> going<00:01:35.060> around<00:01:35.450> so<00:01:35.749> that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
place your thread going around so that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.629 
place your thread going around so that
it<00:01:35.990> sits<00:01:36.170> behind<00:01:36.649> your<00:01:36.859> needle<00:01:37.159> when<00:01:37.340> you<00:01:37.460> pull

00:01:37.629 --> 00:01:37.639 
it sits behind your needle when you pull

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:41.319 
it sits behind your needle when you pull
it<00:01:37.759> through<00:01:38.109> pull<00:01:39.109> that<00:01:39.319> through<00:01:40.299> and<00:01:41.299> just

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
gently tug on that till it sits

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.179 
gently tug on that till it sits
comfortably<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:47.659> down<00:01:47.869> right<00:01:48.709> next<00:01:48.920> to

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:49.189 
comfortably so just down right next to
