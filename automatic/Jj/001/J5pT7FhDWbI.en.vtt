target

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
target

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
target
you<00:01:04.680> know<00:01:04.769> nowhere<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.640> football<00:01:05.970> field

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
you know nowhere on the football field

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.750 
you know nowhere on the football field
during<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.689> game<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.530> somebody<00:01:08.070> standing<00:01:08.490> still

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
during a game is somebody standing still

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.090 
during a game is somebody standing still
and<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.350> you're<00:01:10.500> always<00:01:10.680> trying<00:01:10.799> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
and and so you're always trying to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.890 
and and so you're always trying to
tackle<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.640> moving<00:01:11.939> target<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.450> guy<00:01:12.570> with<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
tackle a moving target that guy with the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.289 
tackle a moving target that guy with the
ball<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.530> moving<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.610> he's<00:01:14.729> usually<00:01:14.909> moving

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
ball is moving and he's usually moving

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
ball is moving and he's usually moving
really<00:01:15.600> really<00:01:15.720> fast<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.159> Shadow<00:01:17.490> Man

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
really really fast and in a Shadow Man

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.160 
really really fast and in a Shadow Man
what<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.030> like<00:01:18.210> best<00:01:18.390> about<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.960> it

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
what I like best about it is it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.570 
what I like best about it is it
replicates<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> practice

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
replicates that in the practice

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.660 
replicates that in the practice
environment<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.590> also<00:01:22.770> safe<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
environment and that it's also safe that

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.490 
environment and that it's also safe that
you<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.030> have<00:01:24.210> two<00:01:24.750> kids<00:01:25.049> hitting<00:01:25.380> each

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
you don't have two kids hitting each

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.679 
you don't have two kids hitting each
other<00:01:25.710> all<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:25.950> time<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.240> have<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> one

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
other all the time but you have the one

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.030 
other all the time but you have the one
kid<00:01:28.549> practicing<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.700> tackling<00:01:30.420> drills<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and working on the Shadowman and it's a

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.310 
and working on the Shadowman and it's a
moving<00:01:35.759> target<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:37.159> notice<00:01:38.159> right<00:01:38.250> away<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
moving target I notice right away that

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.130 
moving target I notice right away that
just<00:01:40.320> even<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.740> one<00:01:40.950> session<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:42.140> kids

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
just even in one session that kids

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.389 
just even in one session that kids
started<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.890> be<00:01:44.460> able<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.259> tackle<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.860> move

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
started to be able to tackle on the move

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.880 
started to be able to tackle on the move
and<00:01:47.729> follow<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.210> moving<00:01:48.540> target<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> tackle

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and follow that moving target and tackle

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.149 
and follow that moving target and tackle
through<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:51.090> ball<00:01:51.720> carrier<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.320> that's<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
through the ball carrier and that's a

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.420 
through the ball carrier and that's a
big<00:01:53.579> deal<00:01:53.759> usually<00:01:54.060> what<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.869> found<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.470> kids

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
big deal usually what we found is kids

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.999 
big deal usually what we found is kids
will<00:01:56.820> run<00:01:57.390> up<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> really<00:01:58.259> really<00:01:58.409> fast<00:01:58.680> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
will run up and really really fast to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.429 
will run up and really really fast to
the<00:01:59.219> ball<00:01:59.759> carrier<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> stop<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:01.229> try<00:02:01.380> to
