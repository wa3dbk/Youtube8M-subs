there<00:03:34.260> was<00:03:34.350> massive<00:03:34.680> open<00:03:35.430> maps<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.420> think

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
there was massive open maps and I think

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.810 
there was massive open maps and I think
sometimes<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.230> stay<00:03:37.920> won't<00:03:38.160> gameplay<00:03:38.610> can

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
sometimes that stay won't gameplay can

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.510 
sometimes that stay won't gameplay can
get<00:03:38.970> really<00:03:39.209> boring<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.840> mean<00:03:40.320> it<00:03:41.040> needs<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.400> be
