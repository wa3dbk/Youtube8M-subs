00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.390 
program in coincided to the flashing
lights<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:26.720> loud<00:03:26.959> noises<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.680> the<00:03:27.709> fire<00:03:28.010> alarm

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
lights and loud noises of the fire alarm

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.810 
lights and loud noises of the fire alarm
in<00:03:29.030> this<00:03:29.239> facility

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.980 

so<00:03:35.820> I'm<00:03:35.910> just<00:03:36.030> gonna<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.240> a<00:03:36.300> little<00:03:36.420> analysis

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
so I'm just gonna do a little analysis

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.080 
so I'm just gonna do a little analysis
of<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.500> after<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.190> put<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.400> reels<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.940> the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
of the after you put the reels in the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.710 
of the after you put the reels in the
screen<00:03:39.360> changes<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.140> can<00:03:40.290> look<00:03:40.470> at<00:03:40.710> it<00:03:40.740> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
screen changes so you can look at it and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.380 
screen changes so you can look at it and
far<00:03:42.720> away<00:03:42.750> it<00:03:43.560> seems<00:03:43.860> as<00:03:44.040> an<00:03:44.160> eye<00:03:44.460> and<00:03:45.030> another

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
far away it seems as an eye and another

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.080 
far away it seems as an eye and another
I<00:03:45.630> closing<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.500> so<00:03:46.710> let's<00:03:46.860> maybe<00:03:47.070> it's<00:03:47.970> a

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
I closing in so let's maybe it's a

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.240 
I closing in so let's maybe it's a
visual<00:03:48.300> treatment<00:03:49.110> of<00:03:49.260> how<00:03:49.470> they<00:03:49.650> react<00:03:50.040> or

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
visual treatment of how they react or

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.590 
visual treatment of how they react or
something<00:03:50.520> after<00:03:50.730> hitting<00:03:50.970> those<00:03:51.180> radio

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
something after hitting those radio

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.630 
something after hitting those radio
something<00:03:52.080> as<00:03:52.200> you<00:03:52.380> can<00:03:52.500> see<00:03:52.800> when<00:03:53.520> they

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
something as you can see when they

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.850 
something as you can see when they
retract<00:03:54.120> there's<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.480> JD<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.290> middle<00:03:55.620> of

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
retract there's a JD in the middle of

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.850 
retract there's a JD in the middle of
the<00:03:56.130> eye<00:03:56.160> there's<00:03:56.700> a<00:03:56.760> 5<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.330> flashes<00:03:57.990> and<00:03:58.260> a

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the eye there's a 5 that flashes and a

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.520 
the eye there's a 5 that flashes and a
group<00:04:01.860> 935<00:04:02.280> symbol<00:04:03.120> that's<00:04:03.600> a<00:04:03.930> blurred<00:04:04.380> out

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
group 935 symbol that's a blurred out

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.830 
group 935 symbol that's a blurred out
and<00:04:04.740> white<00:04:04.980> now<00:04:05.640> up<00:04:05.850> here<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.270> close<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.570> can

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and white now up here up close you can

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.600 
and white now up here up close you can
see<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.080> 115<00:04:07.650> at<00:04:07.830> the<00:04:07.890> bottom<00:04:08.250> of<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.370> page

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
see the 115 at the bottom of the page

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.449 
see the 115 at the bottom of the page
and<00:04:08.970> there's<00:04:09.750> just<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.320> much<00:04:10.560> to<00:04:10.620> be<00:04:10.980> seen<00:04:11.250> in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and there's just so much to be seen in

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.090 
and there's just so much to be seen in
these<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> seems<00:04:13.200> like<00:04:13.290> a<00:04:13.410> zombie

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
these and it seems like a zombie

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.009 
these and it seems like a zombie
outbreak<00:04:14.550> there<00:04:14.730> now<00:04:15.390> this<00:04:15.600> one<00:04:15.870> is<00:04:15.900> very

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
outbreak there now this one is very

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.720 
outbreak there now this one is very
interesting<00:04:16.769> because<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.070> seems<00:04:17.310> to<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.700> a

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
interesting because it seems to be a

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.970 
interesting because it seems to be a
scientist<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:19.230> the<00:04:19.320> corner<00:04:19.709> when<00:04:19.890> he

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
scientist and in the corner when he

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.760 
scientist and in the corner when he
moves<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.430> seem<00:04:20.669> to<00:04:20.760> see<00:04:21.049> 935<00:04:22.049> so<00:04:22.440> that's<00:04:22.650> the

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
moves you seem to see 935 so that's the

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.830 
moves you seem to see 935 so that's the
group<00:04:22.919> 935<00:04:23.310> that's<00:04:23.850> apparently<00:04:24.330> created<00:04:24.630> the

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
group 935 that's apparently created the

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.510 
group 935 that's apparently created the
super<00:04:25.169> zombies<00:04:25.650> when<00:04:26.100> they<00:04:26.190> were<00:04:26.250> trying<00:04:26.400> to

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
super zombies when they were trying to

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.300 
super zombies when they were trying to
create<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.790> super<00:04:27.060> soldier<00:04:27.480> and<00:04:27.690> time<00:04:28.020> travel

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
create the super soldier and time travel

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.880 
create the super soldier and time travel
also<00:04:29.310> at<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.520> bottom<00:04:29.910> the<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.870> letters<00:04:31.590> EA

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
also at the bottom the the letters EA

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.550 
also at the bottom the the letters EA
are<00:04:32.400> seemed<00:04:32.970> to<00:04:33.150> move<00:04:33.630> around<00:04:33.900> in<00:04:34.290> a<00:04:34.350> certain

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
are seemed to move around in a certain

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.980 
are seemed to move around in a certain
order<00:04:34.800> and<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.760> vials<00:04:36.210> at<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:36.390> bottom<00:04:36.750> move

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
order and the vials at the bottom move

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.190 
order and the vials at the bottom move
so<00:04:37.290> who<00:04:37.500> knows<00:04:37.650> what<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:37.890> could<00:04:38.160> mean<00:04:38.220> and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
so who knows what that could mean and

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.680 
so who knows what that could mean and
the<00:04:40.640> second<00:04:41.640> floor<00:04:41.700> last<00:04:41.850> easter<00:04:42.180> egg<00:04:42.360> is

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
the second floor last easter egg is

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.650 
the second floor last easter egg is
these<00:04:43.410> are<00:04:43.760> monkeys<00:04:44.760> if<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.210> look<00:04:45.360> hard

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.230 
these are monkeys if you look hard
enough<00:04:45.780> you<00:04:46.200> can<00:04:46.229> really<00:04:46.830> tell<00:04:47.100> by<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.910> ones

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240
