00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
right now 23 22 and you know we're

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.000 
right now 23 22 and you know we're
really<00:01:30.010> just<00:01:30.400> tickling<00:01:30.880> this<00:01:31.060> thing<00:01:31.830> it<00:01:32.830> can

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
really just tickling this thing it can

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.980 
really just tickling this thing it can
do<00:01:33.160> a<00:01:33.190> lot<00:01:33.340> more<00:01:33.370> than<00:01:33.580> email<00:01:34.390> bulbs<00:01:34.750> around<00:01:34.840> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
do a lot more than email bulbs around a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.490 
do a lot more than email bulbs around a
little<00:01:35.110> bit<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:38.170> can<00:01:38.320> see<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:40.500> generator

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
little bit you can see the generator

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.390 
little bit you can see the generator
coils<00:01:42.010> here<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.960> a<00:01:44.050> pretty<00:01:44.710> significant<00:01:45.220> gap

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
coils here have a pretty significant gap

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.460 
coils here have a pretty significant gap
so<00:01:45.760> it's<00:01:45.970> not<00:01:46.620> but<00:01:47.620> it<00:01:47.740> does<00:01:47.770> load<00:01:48.220> it<00:01:48.370> down

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
so it's not but it does load it down

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.060 
so it's not but it does load it down
considerably<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:53.070> we're<00:01:54.070> charging<00:01:54.370> up<00:01:56.070> 24

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
considerably but we're charging up 24

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.530 
considerably but we're charging up 24
volts<00:01:57.370> worth<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.820> batteries<00:01:58.240> and<00:01:58.450> we're

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
volts worth the batteries and we're

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.170 
volts worth the batteries and we're
gonna<00:01:58.630> hook<00:01:58.840> up<00:01:59.050> soon<00:02:00.360> these<00:02:01.360> batteries<00:02:01.900> also

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
gonna hook up soon these batteries also

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.610 
gonna hook up soon these batteries also
for<00:02:04.180> 48<00:02:04.570> volts<00:02:04.900> we're<00:02:05.020> going<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.200> charge<00:02:05.380> those

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
for 48 volts we're going to charge those

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.400 
for 48 volts we're going to charge those
at<00:02:05.980> the<00:02:06.040> same<00:02:06.160> time<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:09.990> so<00:02:10.990> we're<00:02:11.140> pushing

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
at the same time and so we're pushing

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
at the same time and so we're pushing
this<00:02:11.650> really<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:12.340> as<00:02:12.700> hard<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.180> John's<00:02:13.600> 10

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
this really is as hard as John's 10

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.890 
this really is as hard as John's 10
coiler<00:02:14.260> was<00:02:14.950> pushing<00:02:15.280> these<00:02:15.370> batteries<00:02:15.900> he

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
coiler was pushing these batteries he

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:23.449 
coiler was pushing these batteries he
ran<00:02:17.140> one<00:02:17.500> side<00:02:18.900> charging<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:20.140> other<00:02:20.260> side

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.530 

when<00:02:24.459> he<00:02:24.580> had<00:02:24.730> this<00:02:24.940> set<00:02:25.390> up<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:27.010> batteries

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
when he had this set up these batteries

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:35.010 
when he had this set up these batteries
so<00:02:30.420> we<00:02:32.100> really<00:02:33.100> want<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.310> charge<00:02:34.120> up<00:02:34.330> 48<00:02:34.690> volts

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
so we really want to charge up 48 volts

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.210 
so we really want to charge up 48 volts
and<00:02:35.140> run<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.500> at<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:37.450> know<00:02:37.540> maybe<00:02:37.720> 48<00:02:38.410> 36<00:02:39.010> at

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
and run this at you know maybe 48 36 at

terminal<00:03:18.920> at<00:03:19.010> the<00:03:19.069> same<00:03:19.250> time<00:03:19.459> that<00:03:19.730> would<00:03:19.819> not

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
terminal at the same time that would not

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.360 
terminal at the same time that would not
be<00:03:20.510> good<00:03:22.030> so<00:03:23.030> these<00:03:23.180> are<00:03:23.420> 24<00:03:24.140> volts<00:03:24.440> two<00:03:24.739> point

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
be good so these are 24 volts two point

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.500 
be good so these are 24 volts two point
one<00:03:25.519> volts<00:03:25.549> each<00:03:26.319> in<00:03:27.319> series<00:03:27.709> and<00:03:28.510> they're

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
one volts each in series and they're

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.330 
one volts each in series and they're
very<00:03:30.170> similar<00:03:30.470> to<00:03:30.590> these<00:03:30.799> other<00:03:30.980> batteries

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
very similar to these other batteries

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.289 
very similar to these other batteries
over<00:03:31.580> here<00:03:31.840> cell<00:03:32.840> phone<00:03:33.080> tower<00:03:33.319> batteries<00:03:34.299> so

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
over here cell phone tower batteries so

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:37.380 
over here cell phone tower batteries so
let's<00:03:35.480> turn<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.780> Machine<00:03:36.080> off

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
let's turn the Machine off

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.309 
let's turn the Machine off
you<00:03:38.390> have<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.599> kill<00:03:38.810> switch<00:03:39.049> here<00:03:41.080> and<00:03:42.080> that

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
you have the kill switch here and that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.949 
you have the kill switch here and that
just<00:03:42.560> turns<00:03:42.769> off<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.819> trigger<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.720> you<00:03:47.810> can

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
just turns off the trigger so you can

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.180 
just turns off the trigger so you can
see<00:03:48.110> these<00:03:48.230> batteries<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.739> been<00:03:48.769> kind<00:03:49.160> of

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
see these batteries have been kind of

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:53.050 
see these batteries have been kind of
drained<00:03:49.459> down<00:03:49.640> now<00:03:49.910> turning<00:03:50.599> up<00:03:50.690> our<00:03:51.640> our<00:03:52.640> 10

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
drained down now turning up our our 10

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.180 
drained down now turning up our our 10
amps<00:03:53.769> 12<00:03:54.769> amps<00:03:55.040> on<00:03:55.190> them<00:03:56.980> they've<00:03:57.980> drained

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
amps 12 amps on them they've drained

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.349 
amps 12 amps on them they've drained
them<00:03:58.340> down<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.519> little<00:03:58.640> bit<00:03:58.820> they're<00:03:59.000> bouncing

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
them down a little bit they're bouncing

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:03.000 
them down a little bit they're bouncing
back<00:03:59.510> hold<00:03:59.780> it<00:03:59.930> up<00:04:00.019> there<00:04:00.320> so<00:04:00.560> you<00:04:01.340> can<00:04:01.579> see

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
back hold it up there so you can see

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.400 
back hold it up there so you can see
hold<00:04:04.010> on<00:04:04.190> a<00:04:04.220> little<00:04:04.400> bit<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:04.579> a<00:04:04.609> charge<00:04:04.850> there

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
hold on a little bit of a charge there

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:12.270 
hold on a little bit of a charge there
25.2<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.989> let's<00:04:09.200> hook<00:04:09.350> it<00:04:09.470> up<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:10.609> can<00:04:11.510> see<00:04:11.720> how

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
25.2 so let's hook it up you can see how

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.559 
25.2 so let's hook it up you can see how
wobbly<00:04:13.280> that<00:04:13.400> is<00:04:13.579> in<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:13.760> back<00:04:13.910> we've<00:04:14.090> all<00:04:14.269> got

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
wobbly that is in the back we've all got

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.530 
wobbly that is in the back we've all got
it<00:04:14.660> all<00:04:14.840> hooked<00:04:15.079> up<00:04:15.290> yet
