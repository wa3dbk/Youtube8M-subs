00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.120
 France Once again, the team changed. 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:15.179

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:18.840
 Get in for juniors 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.380
 The two years ago and now I think it's not the place to be 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.380
 Because it is different 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:31.449
 If you want to talk about it anyway, 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.930
 I do not know how things will change depending on the situation. 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:38.140

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.920

 According to a control panel with the label kicked the ball twice 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:28.210
 If the name tag goes down, you're tagging it. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:30.980
