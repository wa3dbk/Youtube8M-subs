some corsair dominator platinum ddr4 to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.460 
some corsair dominator platinum ddr4 to
show<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.359> now<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> could<00:00:22.020> have<00:00:22.109> shown<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
show you now I could have shown you the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.230 
show you now I could have shown you the
box<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.980> should<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.609> shown<00:00:23.850> you<00:00:23.910> all<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

box and I should have shown you all the
packaging<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> stuff<00:00:25.170> but<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.800> thought<00:00:26.010> I'd

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
packaging and stuff but I thought I'd

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.710 
packaging and stuff but I thought I'd
just<00:00:26.340> get<00:00:26.490> them<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:26.760> chat<00:00:27.359> with<00:00:27.480> them<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.660> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
just get them out chat with them in a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.300 
just get them out chat with them in a
board<00:00:27.960> so<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:28.439> you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.710> actually<00:00:28.980> get<00:00:29.279> a

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
board so that you can actually get a

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.130 
board so that you can actually get a
feel<00:00:29.550> for<00:00:29.910> what<00:00:30.119> they<00:00:30.269> could<00:00:30.480> look<00:00:30.689> like<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.080> a

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
feel for what they could look like in a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.930 
feel for what they could look like in a
system<00:00:31.470> yes<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.769> know<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.070> not<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.279> prebuilt

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
system yes I know it's not a prebuilt

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
system yes I know it's not a prebuilt
system<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.540> will<00:00:33.780> come<00:00:34.020> later<00:00:34.050> in<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
system but that will come later in the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.250 
system but that will come later in the
formal<00:00:35.880> review<00:00:36.230> but<00:00:38.270> essentially<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.600> thought

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
formal review but essentially I thought

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.639 
formal review but essentially I thought
you<00:00:40.500> would<00:00:41.280> appreciate<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:42.270> look<00:00:43.170> around<00:00:43.290> them

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
you would appreciate a look around them

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.549 
you would appreciate a look around them
like<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:43.980> now<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.309> do<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.140> just

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
like this now I do know that it is just

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.139 
like this now I do know that it is just
a<00:00:47.539> look<00:00:48.920> now<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.160> get<00:00:50.340> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:50.910> light

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
a look now if we get in the right light

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.340 
a look now if we get in the right light
you<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.600> see<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.289> says<00:00:52.730> there<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:53.820> go

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
you can see that it says there we go

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.279 
you can see that it says there we go
dominate<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:55.379> ddr4<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> top<00:00:57.289> something

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
dominate a ddr4 on the top something

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.750 
dominate a ddr4 on the top something
that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> can<00:00:58.739> get<00:00:58.949> for<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.190> which<00:00:59.399> doesn't

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that you can get for these which doesn't

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.229 
that you can get for these which doesn't
get<00:00:59.879> mentioned<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.359> lot<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.870> these<00:01:01.559> um<00:01:01.890> tops<00:01:02.550> can

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
get mentioned a lot is these um tops can

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.149 
get mentioned a lot is these um tops can
be<00:01:03.390> taken<00:01:03.750> off<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.110> Corsair<00:01:04.589> do<00:01:04.860> what's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
be taken off and Corsair do what's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.730 
be taken off and Corsair do what's
called<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.489> light<00:01:05.760> bar<00:01:06.150> upgrade<00:01:06.810> kit<00:01:07.140> and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
called a light bar upgrade kit and

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.469 
called a light bar upgrade kit and
essentially<00:01:08.159> these<00:01:08.310> light<00:01:08.640> downwards

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
essentially these light downwards

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.240 
essentially these light downwards
they've<00:01:09.990> got<00:01:10.140> white<00:01:10.380> LEDs<00:01:10.740> on<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.920> top<00:01:11.130> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
they've got white LEDs on the top and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.070 
they've got white LEDs on the top and
they<00:01:11.340> light<00:01:11.520> downwards<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> can<00:01:12.930> get

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
they light downwards but you can get

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.289 
they light downwards but you can get
like<00:01:13.260> little<00:01:13.470> cut<00:01:13.799> out<00:01:13.950> sections<00:01:14.310> for<00:01:15.060> them<00:01:15.180> so

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
like little cut out sections for them so

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.539 
like little cut out sections for them so
you<00:01:15.390> change<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.960> silver<00:01:16.830> bit<00:01:16.979> on<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> top<00:01:17.369> so

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
you change the silver bit on the top so

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.249 
you change the silver bit on the top so
they<00:01:17.640> release<00:01:17.970> light<00:01:18.270> into<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.659> inside<00:01:19.110> of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
they release light into the inside of

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.130 
they release light into the inside of
the<00:01:19.350> case<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.770> well<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.180> have<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.840> some<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the case as well now I have got some of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.649 
the case as well now I have got some of
these<00:01:22.259> light<00:01:22.979> bar<00:01:23.250> kits<00:01:23.549> but<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.450> are

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
these light bar kits but there are

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.460 
these light bar kits but there are
actually<00:01:25.350> in<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:27.330> test<00:01:27.659> rig<00:01:27.930> for<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
actually in the the test rig for the

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.109 
actually in the the test rig for the
graphics<00:01:28.860> cards<00:01:29.189> at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.340> moment<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.759> some<00:01:30.030> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
graphics cards at the moment on some of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
graphics cards at the moment on some of
the<00:01:30.210> original<00:01:30.350> 2133<00:01:31.350> ddr3<00:01:32.390> Platinum<00:01:33.390> Ram<00:01:33.680> I'm

going<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.009> be<00:01:35.100> tracking<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.490> set<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.880> these<00:01:36.210> when

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
going to be tracking a set on these when

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.660 
going to be tracking a set on these when
we<00:01:37.200> do<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.530> main<00:01:37.710> review<00:01:38.100> actually<00:01:38.490> just

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670

will be stuff that we will cover and
will<00:02:31.019> come<00:02:31.920> about<00:02:32.040> but<00:02:32.340> 2800<00:02:33.090> I'd<00:02:33.180> say<00:02:33.359> you're

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
will come about but 2800 I'd say you're

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.559 
will come about but 2800 I'd say you're

I've been able to do with XMP you may

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689 
need a tiny little bit of tweaking but

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:44.929 
need a tiny little bit of tweaking but
once<00:02:42.900> you've<00:02:43.139> kind<00:02:43.379> of<00:02:43.530> bought<00:02:43.769> yourself<00:02:44.159> into

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
once you've kind of bought yourself into

the 2011 v3 socket the kind of pretenses
that<00:02:49.620> we're<00:02:49.739> assuming<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.250> you're<00:02:50.459> going<00:02:50.489> to

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
that we're assuming that you're going to

that we're assuming that you're going to

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
know your way around the BIOS anyway

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.619

especially<00:02:53.340> if<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.790> want<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.180> know<00:02:54.299> really

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629 
especially if you want you know really

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.879 
especially if you want you know really
really<00:02:54.930> quick<00:02:56.569> memory<00:02:57.569> or<00:02:58.109> loads<00:02:58.739> of

really quick memory or loads of

really quick memory or loads of
bandwidth<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.280> anyway<00:02:59.519> but<00:02:59.669> that's<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.090> it's

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
bandwidth for anyway but that's it it's

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.679 
bandwidth for anyway but that's it it's
obviously<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.079> Asus<00:03:01.650> x99<00:03:02.579> deluxe<00:03:03.419> it's

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
obviously in the Asus x99 deluxe it's

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.179 
obviously in the Asus x99 deluxe it's
the<00:03:03.810> black<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:04.230> white<00:03:04.349> board<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.799> probably

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
the black and white board it's probably

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:08.089 
the black and white board it's probably
my<00:03:05.340> favorite<00:03:05.939> looking<00:03:06.299> at<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:06.900> x99<00:03:07.680> boards

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
my favorite looking at the x99 boards

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.640 
my favorite looking at the x99 boards
that<00:03:08.250> I've<00:03:08.400> seen<00:03:08.699> so<00:03:09.000> far<00:03:09.439> certainly<00:03:10.439> the<00:03:10.530> one

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
that I've seen so far certainly the one

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.520 
that I've seen so far certainly the one
that<00:03:10.799> stuck<00:03:11.040> with<00:03:11.629> me<00:03:12.629> when<00:03:12.810> I<00:03:12.840> first<00:03:13.199> saw<00:03:13.500> it

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
that stuck with me when I first saw it

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.670 
that stuck with me when I first saw it
but<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.549> think<00:03:14.699> that<00:03:15.090> memory<00:03:15.689> does<00:03:15.959> really<00:03:16.439> look

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
but I think that memory does really look

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.920 
but I think that memory does really look
the<00:03:16.829> part<00:03:16.859> with<00:03:17.250> this<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.609> personally<00:03:18.540> would

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
the part with this I personally would

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.979 
the part with this I personally would
even<00:03:19.169> be<00:03:19.259> tempted<00:03:19.439> to<00:03:19.889> buzz<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.699> Ali<00:03:21.419> top<00:03:21.780> off

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
even be tempted to buzz this Ali top off

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.379 
even be tempted to buzz this Ali top off
and<00:03:22.290> paint<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.280> white<00:03:23.489> if<00:03:23.759> it<00:03:23.909> was<00:03:24.030> going<00:03:24.209> in

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
and paint it white if it was going in

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.789 
and paint it white if it was going in
with<00:03:24.509> these<00:03:24.629> boards<00:03:25.019> but<00:03:25.199> maybe<00:03:25.379> that's<00:03:25.650> an

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
with these boards but maybe that's an

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.219 
with these boards but maybe that's an
option<00:03:26.129> that<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.310> guys<00:03:26.669> can<00:03:27.389> consider<00:03:27.930> for

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:28.229 
option that you guys can consider for

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:31.520 
option that you guys can consider for
your<00:03:28.889> own<00:03:29.129> builds<00:03:29.729> because<00:03:30.299> if<00:03:30.509> it<00:03:30.930> was<00:03:31.169> your

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
your own builds because if it was your

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.259 
your own builds because if it was your
own<00:03:31.560> rig<00:03:31.979> you<00:03:32.250> could<00:03:32.430> paint<00:03:32.609> them<00:03:32.729> red<00:03:32.790> you

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
own rig you could paint them red you

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.449 
own rig you could paint them red you
could<00:03:33.389> paint<00:03:33.540> yellow<00:03:33.870> blue<00:03:34.799> whatever<00:03:35.340> you

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
could paint yellow blue whatever you

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.099 
could paint yellow blue whatever you
really<00:03:35.699> wanted<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.060> go<00:03:36.269> with<00:03:36.299> and<00:03:36.689> it's<00:03:36.810> really

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109 
really wanted to go with and it's really

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:38.390 
really wanted to go with and it's really
not<00:03:37.319> too<00:03:37.560> much<00:03:37.590> of<00:03:37.829> a<00:03:37.889> problem<00:03:38.040> because<00:03:38.220> they

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
not too much of a problem because they

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.670 
not too much of a problem because they
do<00:03:38.459> just<00:03:38.819> unscrew<00:03:39.449> where<00:03:40.199> they<00:03:40.290> unscrew

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
do just unscrew where they unscrew

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.800 
do just unscrew where they unscrew
they're<00:03:40.859> actually<00:03:41.099> allen<00:03:41.370> keys<00:03:41.629> so<00:03:42.629> that's

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
they're actually allen keys so that's

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.929 
they're actually allen keys so that's
something<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.169> could<00:03:43.379> keep<00:03:43.560> in<00:03:43.799> mind<00:03:44.189> as<00:03:44.489> well

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
something you could keep in mind as well

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.099 
something you could keep in mind as well
but<00:03:45.979> if<00:03:46.979> I<00:03:47.099> put<00:03:47.340> that<00:03:47.459> gently<00:03:47.879> down<00:03:48.060> there<00:03:48.299> this

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
but if I put that gently down there this
