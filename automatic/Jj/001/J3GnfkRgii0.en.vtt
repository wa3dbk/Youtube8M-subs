00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.829 

the<00:00:13.799> comparison<00:00:14.309> video<00:00:14.549> between<00:00:14.670> iPhone<00:00:15.360> 4<00:00:15.599> I

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
the comparison video between iPhone 4 I

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.510 
the comparison video between iPhone 4 I
think<00:00:15.900> yes<00:00:16.529> this<00:00:17.039> video<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.340> gonna<00:00:17.460> be

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
think yes this video is gonna be

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.480 
think yes this video is gonna be
focusing<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.690> camera<00:00:19.080> quality<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:20.100> video

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
focusing on the camera quality of video

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.349 
focusing on the camera quality of video
and<00:00:20.760> photos

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
and photos

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.849 
and photos
obviously<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.840> iPhone<00:00:22.140> 4<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.529> gonna<00:00:22.740> be

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
obviously the iPhone 4 is gonna be

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.439 
obviously the iPhone 4 is gonna be
better<00:00:23.039> because<00:00:23.189> it's<00:00:23.460> got<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> 5<00:00:23.820> megapixels

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
better because it's got the 5 megapixels

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.560 
better because it's got the 5 megapixels
and<00:00:24.740> 720p<00:00:25.740> HD<00:00:26.130> movie<00:00:26.340> recordings<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.330> I<00:00:27.420> want

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and 720p HD movie recordings but I want

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.429 
and 720p HD movie recordings but I want
to<00:00:27.630> show<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.930> difference<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.380> can

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
to show you the difference so you can

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.019 
to show you the difference so you can
see<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.680> yourself<00:00:28.769> okay<00:00:29.460> first<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> a

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
see it yourself okay first up is a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.460 
see it yourself okay first up is a
general<00:00:30.390> picture<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> house<00:00:30.960> which<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.289> took

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
general picture of a house which I took

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.440 
general picture of a house which I took
on<00:00:31.590> both<00:00:31.800> phones<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.340> good<00:00:32.520> lighting<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.059> you

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
on both phones in good lighting so you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.270 
on both phones in good lighting so you
can<00:00:33.600> compare<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> difference<00:00:34.079> okay<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.070> here

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
can compare the difference okay so here

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.770 
can compare the difference okay so here
you<00:00:35.309> can<00:00:35.399> see<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> different<00:00:36.030> contrast<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
you can see a different contrast in the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.470 
you can see a different contrast in the
iPhone<00:00:37.079> 4<00:00:37.290> iPhone<00:00:37.530> 3GS<00:00:38.129> although<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.210> colors

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
iPhone 4 iPhone 3GS although the colors

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.180 
iPhone 4 iPhone 3GS although the colors
on<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.690> 3GS<00:00:39.989> seemed<00:00:40.260> slightly<00:00:40.500> deeper<00:00:40.860> and

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
on the 3GS seemed slightly deeper and

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.650 
on the 3GS seemed slightly deeper and
richer<00:00:41.309> than<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> iPhone<00:00:42.030> 4<00:00:42.239> they're

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
richer than the iPhone 4 they're

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
richer than the iPhone 4 they're
actually<00:00:42.930> less<00:00:43.110> realistic<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.250> details

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
actually less realistic and the details

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.220 
actually less realistic and the details
of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.030> pavement<00:00:45.510> and<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> plants<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
of the pavement and the plants and the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.720 
of the pavement and the plants and the
background<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.219> clearer<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.640> the

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
background actually much clearer on the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
background actually much clearer on the
iPhone<00:00:48.000> 4<00:00:48.300> as<00:00:49.050> well<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.890> as

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
iPhone 4 as well as that you can see as

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
iPhone 4 as well as that you can see as
me<00:00:50.370> but<00:00:50.550> these<00:00:50.700> pictures<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.180> cropped<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
me but these pictures are cropped the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.540 
me but these pictures are cropped the
iPhone<00:00:52.050> 4<00:00:52.199> takes<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.559> much<00:00:52.710> wider<00:00:52.980> picture<00:00:53.250> than

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
iPhone 4 takes a much wider picture than

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
iPhone 4 takes a much wider picture than
the<00:00:53.610> iPhone<00:00:53.879> 3GS<00:00:54.329> ok<00:00:55.199> next<00:00:55.410> up<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.800> low-light

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the iPhone 3GS ok next up is a low-light

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
the iPhone 3GS ok next up is a low-light
condition<00:00:56.670> photo<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.600> taken<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.930> both<00:00:58.050> phones

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
condition photo is taken on both phones

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.930 
condition photo is taken on both phones
in<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.680> subway<00:00:59.070> so<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.430> darker<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.879> the

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
in the subway so it's darker in the

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.490 
in the subway so it's darker in the
foreground<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.600> gets<00:01:00.840> lighter<00:01:01.079> out<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
foreground and gets lighter out in the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.020 
foreground and gets lighter out in the
background<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.309> he<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.640> compare<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
background so he can compare the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
background so he can compare the
difference<00:01:03.120> okay<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.110> can<00:01:04.229> see<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
difference okay here you can see the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.200 
difference okay here you can see the
work<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.890> iPhone<00:01:05.189> 4s<00:01:05.400> backlit<00:01:05.790> sensor

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
work of the iPhone 4s backlit sensor

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.240 
work of the iPhone 4s backlit sensor
with<00:01:06.600> most<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.080> foreground<00:01:07.439> stuff<00:01:07.920> in

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
with most of the foreground stuff in

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
with most of the foreground stuff in
detail<00:01:08.640> where<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.360> tiling<00:01:09.780> on

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
detail where you can see the tiling on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
detail where you can see the tiling on
the<00:01:10.080> floor<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> pavement<00:01:11.040> whereas<00:01:11.760> on

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
the floor and the pavement whereas on

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
the floor and the pavement whereas on
the<00:01:11.939> 3GS<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> much<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.840> blurred<00:01:13.110> out<00:01:13.290> and

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
the 3GS is much more blurred out and

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.380 
the 3GS is much more blurred out and
that<00:01:13.830> said<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.250> iPhone<00:01:14.640> 4<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.000> does<00:01:15.180> look

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
that said on the iPhone 4 it does look

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.880 
that said on the iPhone 4 it does look
like<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.689> slightly<00:01:15.869> over<00:01:16.320> sensitive<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
like it's slightly over sensitive to

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
like it's slightly over sensitive to
light<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> background<00:01:17.869> okay<00:01:18.869> next<00:01:19.049> up<00:01:19.200> is

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
light in the background okay next up is

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.050 
light in the background okay next up is
a<00:01:19.380> macro<00:01:19.710> shot<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:20.040> plants<00:01:20.400> taking<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.970> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
a macro shot of plants taking on the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
a macro shot of plants taking on the
phones<00:01:21.270> using<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.720> tap<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.049> autofocus<00:01:22.470> here

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
phones using the tap to autofocus here

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.140 
phones using the tap to autofocus here
you<00:01:23.310> can<00:01:23.400> prepare<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.759> difference<00:01:24.030> again

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
you can prepare the difference again

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.730 
you can prepare the difference again
although<00:01:24.930> both<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> these<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.530> quite<00:01:25.680> good

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
although both of these are quite good

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.499 
although both of these are quite good
macro<00:01:26.220> shots<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.150> does<00:01:27.330> have

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
macro shots so I think for does have

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.030 
macro shots so I think for does have
much<00:01:27.689> more<00:01:27.840> detail<00:01:27.990> in<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> foreground<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
much more detail in the foreground and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
much more detail in the foreground and
the<00:01:29.220> plants<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.700> background<00:01:30.090> as<00:01:30.600> well<00:01:30.750> as

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the plants in the background as well as

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.630 
the plants in the background as well as
that<00:01:30.960> once<00:01:31.200> again<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> cousin<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> iPhone<00:01:32.430> 4

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that once again the cousin the iPhone 4

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
that once again the cousin the iPhone 4
look<00:01:32.790> much<00:01:33.030> more<00:01:33.180> realistic<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.900> I've<00:01:34.409> been<00:01:34.560> 3

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
look much more realistic and I've been 3

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.219
