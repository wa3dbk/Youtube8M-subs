server you must be opted for this to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.260 
server you must be opted for this to
work<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.510> type<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.899> slash<00:00:49.289> give<00:00:49.710> zero<00:00:50.700> and

work and you type in slash give zero and
that's<00:00:51.390> for<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> player<00:00:51.809> name<00:00:52.079> one<00:00:52.860> that's

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
for the amount and to hold on I can't

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.430 
for the amount and to hold on I can't
quite<00:00:56.789> remember<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:59.480> two<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.109> item

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
quite remember to is for two is the item

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.470 
quite remember to is for two is the item
and<00:01:01.800> that's<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.520> order<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.300> on<00:01:03.449> a

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and that's the order that it is in on a

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
and that's the order that it is in on a
vanilla<00:01:03.780> server<00:01:04.049> so<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.799> would

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
vanilla server so this is what you would

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.570 
vanilla server so this is what you would
have<00:01:04.949> slash<00:01:05.610> give<00:01:05.960> just<00:01:06.960> like<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.580> it

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
have slash give just like this and it

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.920 
have slash give just like this and it
should<00:01:08.820> already<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.299> set<00:01:09.540> like<00:01:09.689> this<00:01:10.189> so<00:01:11.930> once

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
should already be set like this so once

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.399 
should already be set like this so once
you<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.380> server<00:01:13.670> I<00:01:14.670> will<00:01:15.600> show<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.780> just

array<00:01:38.409> it<00:01:38.560> doesn't<00:01:38.799> have<00:01:38.890> any<00:01:39.069> plugins

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
array it doesn't have any plugins

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:46.590 
array it doesn't have any plugins
installed<00:01:43.289> so<00:01:44.289> that's<00:01:45.009> how<00:01:45.159> this<00:01:45.399> works<00:01:45.640> still

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
installed so that's how this works still

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.050 
installed so that's how this works still
use<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.069> /give<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.109> go<00:01:50.229> see<00:01:51.060> it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
use the /give and there you go see it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.719

just gave me before sandstone and I

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.370 
just gave me before sandstone and I
could<00:01:54.939> just<00:01:55.090> get<00:01:55.179> whatever<00:01:55.329> else<00:01:55.810> I<00:01:56.049> wanted

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
a command book give might work

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.979 
a command book give might work
however<00:02:11.489> /i<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.579> generally<00:02:13.239> what<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.450> used<00:02:13.750> or

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
however /i is generally what is used or

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.220 
however /i is generally what is used or
if<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.319> use<00:02:14.760> essentials<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.540> would<00:02:16.660> do<00:02:16.810> item

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
if you use essentials you would do item

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
if you use essentials you would do item
like<00:02:17.980> this<00:02:18.220> and<00:02:19.530> that's<00:02:20.530> how<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.739> would<00:02:20.860> be<00:02:21.069> set

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
like this and that's how it would be set

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.220 
like this and that's how it would be set
up<00:02:21.370> or<00:02:21.579> if<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.910> use<00:02:22.180> default<00:02:22.599> commands<00:02:22.930> you

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
up or if you use default commands you

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.629 
up or if you use default commands you
would<00:02:23.349> do<00:02:23.440> slash<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.650> basically<00:02:26.859> that's<00:02:27.340> it

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:27.639 
would do slash I so basically that's it

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.729 
would do slash I so basically that's it
you<00:02:27.760> just<00:02:27.910> type<00:02:28.180> slash<00:02:28.510> give<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.109> use<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
you just type slash give to use on a

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.220 
you just type slash give to use on a
vanilla<00:02:30.100> server<00:02:30.400> or<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:31.120> bucket<00:02:31.690> server<00:02:32.019> with

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
vanilla server or a bucket server with

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.539 
vanilla server or a bucket server with
no<00:02:32.380> plugins<00:02:32.620> if<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.069> have<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> plugin<00:02:33.430> just

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
no plugins if you have a plugin just

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.979 
no plugins if you have a plugin just
figure<00:02:33.880> out<00:02:33.910> what<00:02:34.000> your<00:02:34.150> slash<00:02:34.329> given<00:02:34.720> command

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
figure out what your slash given command

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.550 
figure out what your slash given command
is<00:02:35.170> and<00:02:35.410> then<00:02:36.100> set<00:02:36.819> it<00:02:36.910> up<00:02:37.030> how<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.200> needs<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.500> be

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
is and then set it up how it needs to be

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.620 
is and then set it up how it needs to be
set<00:02:38.709> up<00:02:38.739> in<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:39.010> description<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.670> will<00:02:39.730> tell

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
set up in the description I will tell

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.110 
set up in the description I will tell
you<00:02:40.720> exactly<00:02:40.870> what<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.500> 0<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:42.040> 1<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.819> 2<00:02:42.849> and

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you exactly what the 0 the 1 the 2 and

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.039 
you exactly what the 0 the 1 the 2 and
the<00:02:43.180> 3<00:02:43.209> mean<00:02:43.480> because<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.720> can't<00:02:43.930> quite

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
the 3 mean because I can't quite

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.629 
the 3 mean because I can't quite
remember<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:44.920> 3<00:02:45.250> is<00:02:45.340> for<00:02:45.459> item

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
remember I know that 3 is for item

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.610 
remember I know that 3 is for item
damage<00:02:45.970> 0<00:02:46.299> is<00:02:46.450> the<00:02:46.630> amount<00:02:46.870> one<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.410> player

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
damage 0 is the amount one is the player

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.030 
damage 0 is the amount one is the player
name<00:02:47.859> and<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.040> think<00:02:48.250> 2<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.670> item<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:50.040> this

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
name and I think 2 is the item so this

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.809 
name and I think 2 is the item so this
would<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.579> give<00:02:51.940> Caleb<00:02:52.900> Johnny<00:02:53.139> which<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.470> me

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
would be give Caleb Johnny which is me

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.140 
would be give Caleb Johnny which is me
amount<00:02:54.819> which<00:02:55.209> would<00:02:55.389> be<00:02:55.599> 64<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.340> item<00:02:57.700> would

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
amount which would be 64 the item would

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.360 
amount which would be 64 the item would
be<00:02:58.209> sand<00:02:58.810> and<00:02:59.079> then<00:02:59.709> this<00:02:59.769> would<00:02:59.919> be<00:03:00.010> damaged

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
be sand and then this would be damaged

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.520 
be sand and then this would be damaged
but<00:03:00.489> there's<00:03:00.639> no<00:03:00.760> damage<00:03:01.060> on<00:03:01.180> sand<00:03:01.510> so<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.380> can

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
but there's no damage on sand so you can

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.349 
but there's no damage on sand so you can
essentially<00:03:02.769> just<00:03:02.889> leave<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.220> like<00:03:03.250> this<00:03:03.609> but

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
essentially just leave it like this but

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.240 
essentially just leave it like this but
we<00:03:04.870> do<00:03:04.989> need<00:03:05.139> this<00:03:05.349> for<00:03:05.590> some<00:03:05.769> items<00:03:06.069> if<00:03:06.190> you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
we do need this for some items if you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.870 
we do need this for some items if you
want<00:03:06.459> to<00:03:06.549> give<00:03:07.500> items<00:03:08.500> less<00:03:09.160> such<00:03:09.310> as<00:03:09.430> a<00:03:09.459> pic<00:03:09.730> or

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
want to give items less such as a pic or

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.220 
want to give items less such as a pic or
something<00:03:10.150> with<00:03:10.269> damage<00:03:10.660> or<00:03:10.750> whatnot<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.079> don't

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
something with damage or whatnot I don't

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
something with damage or whatnot I don't
know<00:03:11.290> why<00:03:11.410> you'd<00:03:11.500> want<00:03:11.650> to<00:03:11.680> do<00:03:11.769> that<00:03:11.889> but<00:03:12.130> you

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
know why you'd want to do that but you
