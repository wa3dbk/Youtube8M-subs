Japanese Imperial Navy and the American

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.920 
Japanese Imperial Navy and the American
Navy<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.340> question<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:47.880> how<00:01:48.659> did<00:01:48.840> this

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
Navy so my question is how did this

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.560 
Navy so my question is how did this
happen<00:01:49.380> how<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.890> hell<00:01:50.369> did<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:50.850> happen<00:01:51.090> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
happen how the hell did this happen I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.080 
happen how the hell did this happen I
think<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.170> makes<00:01:52.350> no<00:01:52.799> sense<00:01:52.829> why<00:01:53.759> would<00:01:53.970> you

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
think that makes no sense why would you

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.580 
think that makes no sense why would you
just<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.780> know<00:01:54.899> random<00:01:55.320> storm

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
just have a you know random storm

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
just have a you know random storm
throwing<00:01:55.890> people<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.369> time<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:57.270> know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
throwing people back in time you know

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.899 
throwing people back in time you know
that<00:01:57.509> there's<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> movie<00:01:58.829> that<00:01:58.979> came<00:01:59.130> out<00:01:59.189> like

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
that there's a movie that came out like

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.520 
that there's a movie that came out like
last<00:02:00.180> year<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.509> think<00:02:00.600> called<00:02:00.930> Hot<00:02:01.200> Tub<00:02:01.469> Time

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
last year I think called Hot Tub Time

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.499 
last year I think called Hot Tub Time
Machine<00:02:01.829> like<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.790> hot<00:02:02.969> tub<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.360> was<00:02:03.479> a

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Machine like it was a hot tub that was a

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.899 
Machine like it was a hot tub that was a
time<00:02:03.750> machine<00:02:03.979> this<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.159> even<00:02:05.399> worse<00:02:05.610> than

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
time machine this is even worse than

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
time machine this is even worse than
that<00:02:05.969> because<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.960> ocean<00:02:07.469> Time

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that because this is like ocean Time

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.960 
that because this is like ocean Time
Machine<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.280> they're<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> ocean<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
Machine like they're on the ocean and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.369 
Machine like they're on the ocean and
