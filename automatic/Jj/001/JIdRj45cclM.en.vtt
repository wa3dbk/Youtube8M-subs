 microorganisms with micro exposure 

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:13.580
 life beyond the human eye a

 the human eye is unable to perceive 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.800
 thanks to the advancement of science and 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.990
 technology we have been able to get closer to 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 all these microscopic living beings 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.930
 the exhibition is based on the magnificent 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.240

 leyden hoop discovered the bacteria 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.140
 even the most modern microscopes that
