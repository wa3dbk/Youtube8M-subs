00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
while so I am gonna show you guys my
twenty<00:01:06.869> gallon<00:01:07.200> setup<00:01:07.909> this<00:01:08.909> is<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.119> 20<00:01:09.420> gallon

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
twenty gallon setup this is a 20 gallon

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.679 
twenty gallon setup this is a 20 gallon
long<00:01:09.930> tank<00:01:10.290> don't<00:01:11.220> what<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.850> longer<00:01:12.180> tank<00:01:12.450> is

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
long tank don't what the longer tank is

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
swim because fish most most fish swim

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.440 
swim because fish most most fish swim
horizontally<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.409> vertically<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.430> it's<00:01:24.150> only

or<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.600> reptile<00:03:37.020> tank<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.620> I<00:03:37.650> just

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
or a reptile tank that I just

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.220 
or a reptile tank that I just
transformed<00:03:38.370> into<00:03:38.460> a<00:03:38.580> fish<00:03:38.820> tank<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.780> filter

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
transformed into a fish tank the filter

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.070 
transformed into a fish tank the filter
jeff's<00:03:40.680> hits<00:03:41.040> in<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:42.080> and<00:03:44.960> yeah<00:03:45.960> I<00:03:46.020> think

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
jeff's hits in here and yeah I think

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.710 
jeff's hits in here and yeah I think
that's<00:03:46.440> good<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:47.130> is<00:03:47.310> a<00:03:47.340> cascade<00:03:47.640> 100<00:03:48.360> filter

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
that's good this is a cascade 100 filter

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.010 
that's good this is a cascade 100 filter
