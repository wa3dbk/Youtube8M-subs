00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
interesting because I first planted this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090 
interesting because I first planted this
block<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.760> 1990<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:40.620> planted<00:00:40.920> two

Chardonnay a long story short after 15
years<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.649> didn't<00:00:46.649> like<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.070> didn't<00:00:47.340> like

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
years I didn't like it I didn't like

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.650 
years I didn't like it I didn't like
what<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.670> doing<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> pulled<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.510> all<00:00:48.629> out

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
what was doing so I pulled it all out

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.770 
what was doing so I pulled it all out
and<00:00:49.250> replanted<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.370> um<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.690> you

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
and replanted it um and that's what you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.630 
and replanted it um and that's what you
have<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> do<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.590> can't<00:00:52.829> could<00:00:53.100> say<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.489> well

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
have to do you can't could say that well

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.069 
have to do you can't could say that well
you<00:00:53.879> know<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> good<00:00:54.570> idea<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.899> do

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
you know I think it's a good idea to do

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
you know I think it's a good idea to do
this<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.559> then<00:00:55.649> when<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> plant<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.820> vineyard

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
this and then when you plant a vineyard

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.729 
this and then when you plant a vineyard
you're<00:00:57.570> not<00:00:57.690> planning<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.170> three<00:00:58.559> or<00:00:58.710> four

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
you're not planning it for three or four

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're not planning it for three or four
years<00:00:59.070> down<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.489> road<00:00:59.520> you're<00:00:59.789> planning<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
years down the road you're planning it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.510 
years down the road you're planning it
forever<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.809> mean<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.410> me<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.070> vineyard

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
forever I mean to me that the vineyard

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.340 
forever I mean to me that the vineyard
doesn't<00:01:02.850> start<00:01:03.180> producing<00:01:03.510> interesting

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
doesn't start producing interesting

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
doesn't start producing interesting
wines<00:01:04.589> until<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.369> least<00:01:05.489> 10<00:01:05.729> years<00:01:05.760> old

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
wines until it's at least 10 years old

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.300 
wines until it's at least 10 years old
that's<00:01:06.780> when<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.110> can<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.409> start<00:01:07.680> making

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that's when you can really start making

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.200 
that's when you can really start making
some<00:01:08.430> evaluations<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:10.280> eventually<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.670> said

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
some evaluations so eventually I said

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.120 
some evaluations so eventually I said
this<00:01:12.360> this<00:01:12.570> isn't<00:01:12.780> working<00:01:13.020> plus<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.920> I've

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
this this isn't working plus that I've

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
this this isn't working plus that I've
learned<00:01:14.549> now<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.180> soils<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.930> on

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
learned now that the soils this is on

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
learned now that the soils this is on
are<00:01:16.500> much<00:01:16.710> more<00:01:16.920> conducive<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.670> making<00:01:18.060> great

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
are much more conducive to making great

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
are much more conducive to making great
Reds<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> just<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.040> acre<00:01:20.250> grapes<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.820> we

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Reds this is just one acre grapes and we

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
Reds this is just one acre grapes and we
have<00:01:20.970> three<00:01:21.180> different<00:01:21.360> soil<00:01:21.720> types<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.350> what

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
have three different soil types and what

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.100 
have three different soil types and what
we<00:01:22.920> commonly<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.729> harvest<00:01:24.210> by<00:01:24.330> soil<00:01:24.750> types

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
we commonly do is harvest by soil types

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.679 
we commonly do is harvest by soil types
and<00:01:25.470> verify<00:01:26.430> by<00:01:26.640> soil<00:01:26.850> types<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> it's

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and verify by soil types and it's

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.990 
and verify by soil types and it's
amazing<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.290> differences<00:01:28.799> much<00:01:29.729> more

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
amazing the differences much more

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.160 
amazing the differences much more
there's<00:01:30.299> much<00:01:30.450> more<00:01:30.600> difference<00:01:30.900> between

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
there's much more difference between

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.010 
there's much more difference between
soil<00:01:31.380> type<00:01:31.680> then<00:01:31.950> there<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.250> clone<00:01:33.090> rootstock

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
soil type then there is clone rootstock

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.550 
soil type then there is clone rootstock
or<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.799> some<00:01:35.549> cases<00:01:35.610> even<00:01:36.090> variety<00:01:36.780> sometimes

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
or in some cases even variety sometimes

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
or in some cases even variety sometimes
like<00:01:38.009> Cabernet<00:01:38.430> Franc<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:39.000> two<00:01:39.329> different

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
like Cabernet Franc on two different

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.960 
like Cabernet Franc on two different
soil<00:01:39.869> types<00:01:39.990> will<00:01:40.470> taste<00:01:40.680> more<00:01:41.400> similar<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
soil types will taste more similar to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.600 
soil types will taste more similar to
cabernet<00:01:42.329> sauvignon<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.770> same<00:01:43.979> soils

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
cabernet sauvignon on the same soils

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310 
cabernet sauvignon on the same soils
rather<00:01:44.939> than<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> varietal<00:01:45.720> distinction

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
rather than the varietal distinction

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.679 
rather than the varietal distinction
what<00:01:47.009> we've<00:01:47.159> got<00:01:47.340> here<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.640> Merlot<00:01:48.329> we<00:01:48.509> just

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
what we've got here is Merlot we just

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.260 
what we've got here is Merlot we just
planted<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.079> yesterday<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.729> three

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
planted it yesterday and we have three

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.639 
planted it yesterday and we have three
different<00:01:51.540> soil<00:01:51.960> types<00:01:52.079> here<00:01:52.710> this<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:54.649> it's

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
different soil types here this is a it's

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.679 
different soil types here this is a it's
it's<00:01:56.600> decomposed<00:01:57.600> rock<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.360> see<00:02:00.540> how

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
it's decomposed rock and it you see how

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.100 
it's decomposed rock and it you see how

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
it doesn't ribbon ribbon is when I want

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
it doesn't ribbon ribbon is when I want
to<00:02:04.200> press<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.770> hard<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.600> has<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.750> lot

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
to press it really hard if it has a lot

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.859 
to press it really hard if it has a lot
of<00:02:06.960> clay<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.770> can<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.239> won't<00:02:09.450> fall

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
of clay I can do this and it won't fall

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.089 
of clay I can do this and it won't fall
to<00:02:10.020> see<00:02:10.170> how<00:02:10.289> it's<00:02:10.440> falling<00:02:10.709> away<00:02:10.830> from<00:02:10.890> my

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
to see how it's falling away from my

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.420 
to see how it's falling away from my
fingers<00:02:11.550> clay<00:02:12.420> wouldn't<00:02:12.750> do<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.900> it<00:02:13.170> would

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
fingers clay wouldn't do that it would

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.339 
fingers clay wouldn't do that it would
ribbon<00:02:13.670> it<00:02:13.790> would<00:02:13.909> make<00:02:14.090> a<00:02:14.120> long<00:02:14.420> ribbon<00:02:15.109> this

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
ribbon it would make a long ribbon this

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.619 
ribbon it would make a long ribbon this
it<00:02:15.500> would<00:02:15.650> stay<00:02:15.890> clump<00:02:16.280> together<00:02:16.629> exactly

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
it would stay clump together exactly

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.240 
it would stay clump together exactly
state<00:02:17.870> come<00:02:18.079> together<00:02:18.349> this<00:02:18.560> has<00:02:18.769> loose

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
state come together this has loose

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.890 
state come together this has loose
granular<00:02:19.579> and<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.120> course<00:02:20.329> there's<00:02:20.540> lots<00:02:20.750> of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
granular and of course there's lots of

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.800 
granular and of course there's lots of
rocks<00:02:21.079> here<00:02:21.530> we<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.129> rocks<00:02:22.489> my<00:02:23.150> guys<00:02:23.359> when<00:02:23.689> we

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
rocks here we like rocks my guys when we

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.750 
rocks here we like rocks my guys when we
plant<00:02:24.019> we<00:02:24.230> don't<00:02:24.409> like<00:02:24.530> rocks<00:02:24.769> but<00:02:25.099> the<00:02:25.549> vines

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
plant we don't like rocks but the vines

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.390 
plant we don't like rocks but the vines
like<00:02:26.000> rocks<00:02:26.650> rocks<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:27.829> good<00:02:28.040> thing<00:02:28.250> they

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
like rocks rocks are good thing they

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.339 
like rocks rocks are good thing they
provide<00:02:28.760> better<00:02:28.939> drainage<00:02:29.359> and<00:02:29.780> quite

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
provide better drainage and quite

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.470 
provide better drainage and quite
frankly<00:02:30.379> they<00:02:30.829> take<00:02:31.040> up<00:02:31.069> room<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.030> there's<00:02:32.359> not

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
frankly they take up room so there's not

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.839 
frankly they take up room so there's not
soil<00:02:32.870> because<00:02:33.709> I'm<00:02:33.980> one<00:02:34.370> of<00:02:34.519> our<00:02:34.609> biggest

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
soil because I'm one of our biggest

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.789 
soil because I'm one of our biggest
challenges<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.480> keeping<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.079> vines<00:02:36.290> small

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
challenges is keeping the vines small

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.129 
challenges is keeping the vines small
and<00:02:37.189> in<00:02:37.340> balance<00:02:37.879> that's<00:02:38.510> one<00:02:38.719> of<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.870> keys

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:39.139 
and in balance that's one of the keys

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:42.690 
and in balance that's one of the keys
making<00:02:39.920> great<00:02:40.159> wine<00:02:40.370> this<00:02:41.060> soil<00:02:41.389> will<00:02:41.930> do<00:02:42.109> it

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
making great wine this soil will do it

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.879 
making great wine this soil will do it
because<00:02:43.700> naturally<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.959> soil<00:02:45.230> just<00:02:45.560> doesn't

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
because naturally this soil just doesn't

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:49.569 
because naturally this soil just doesn't
have<00:02:46.069> a<00:02:46.340> lot<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:47.739> clay<00:02:48.739> which<00:02:49.069> gives<00:02:49.340> more

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
have a lot of clay which gives more

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.349 
have a lot of clay which gives more
vigor<00:02:49.819> it<00:02:50.269> has<00:02:50.389> less<00:02:50.629> water<00:02:50.959> holding<00:02:51.379> capacity

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:52.359 
vigor it has less water holding capacity

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.970 
vigor it has less water holding capacity
so<00:02:53.359> this<00:02:53.569> is<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:54.019> my<00:02:54.139> best<00:02:54.409> low<00:02:54.709> vigor

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
so this is one of my best low vigor

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.959 
so this is one of my best low vigor
soils<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:57.500> produces<00:02:58.069> some<00:02:58.280> great<00:02:58.730> wine

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
soils this produces some great wine

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.240 
soils this produces some great wine
right<00:02:59.359> here<00:02:59.629> it's<00:02:59.810> our<00:03:00.109> granite<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.889> we<00:03:01.129> can

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
right here it's our granite and we can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.089 
right here it's our granite and we can
go<00:03:01.370> down<00:03:01.579> and<00:03:01.700> take<00:03:01.879> a<00:03:01.909> look<00:03:02.180> at<00:03:02.299> this<00:03:03.099> it's

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
go down and take a look at this it's

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.789 
go down and take a look at this it's
just<00:03:04.430> basically<00:03:05.000> nothing<00:03:05.599> but<00:03:05.780> rock<00:03:06.379> and<00:03:07.689> and

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
just basically nothing but rock and and

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.129 
just basically nothing but rock and and
what's<00:03:09.799> in<00:03:10.010> between<00:03:10.159> it<00:03:10.730> is<00:03:10.879> almost<00:03:11.689> all

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:12.139 
what's in between it is almost all

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:14.170 
what's in between it is almost all
organic<00:03:12.799> matter<00:03:13.069> really<00:03:13.519> it's<00:03:13.669> a<00:03:13.790> hardly<00:03:14.120> even

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
organic matter really it's a hardly even

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.839 
organic matter really it's a hardly even
soil<00:03:14.659> it's<00:03:14.989> just<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.829> this<00:03:15.950> was<00:03:16.159> all<00:03:16.370> woods<00:03:16.639> I

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
soil it's just see this was all woods I

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.879 
soil it's just see this was all woods I
didn't<00:03:17.060> mention<00:03:17.239> that<00:03:17.419> that<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.409> area<00:03:18.739> was

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
didn't mention that that this area was

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.460 
didn't mention that that this area was
farmed<00:03:19.400> from<00:03:19.720> hundreds<00:03:20.720> of<00:03:20.810> years<00:03:21.079> a<00:03:21.409> couple

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
farmed from hundreds of years a couple

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.379 
farmed from hundreds of years a couple
hundred<00:03:21.859> years<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.519> then<00:03:22.639> it<00:03:22.760> was<00:03:22.849> abandoned

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
hundred years and then it was abandoned

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:25.420 
hundred years and then it was abandoned
back<00:03:23.569> in<00:03:23.810> the<00:03:23.959> starting<00:03:24.349> around<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.739> 40s<00:03:25.190> and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
back in the starting around the 40s and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.599 
back in the starting around the 40s and
the<00:03:25.459> wool<00:03:26.329> trees<00:03:26.659> grew<00:03:26.959> up<00:03:27.169> and<00:03:27.500> so<00:03:28.159> we<00:03:28.310> had<00:03:28.459> to

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
the wool trees grew up and so we had to

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.809 
the wool trees grew up and so we had to
take<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.299> trees<00:03:29.629> down<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:30.459> let<00:03:31.459> the<00:03:31.579> ground

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
take the trees down and let the ground

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.670 
take the trees down and let the ground
stay<00:03:32.209> follow<00:03:32.479> for<00:03:32.810> a<00:03:32.840> while<00:03:32.989> before<00:03:33.229> planting

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
stay follow for a while before planting

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.589 
stay follow for a while before planting
ok<00:03:34.489> so<00:03:34.549> that's<00:03:34.760> what<00:03:34.879> you're<00:03:35.000> doing<00:03:35.209> here<00:03:35.419> is

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
ok so that's what you're doing here is

ok so that's what you're doing here is
we<00:03:35.810> just<00:03:35.959> came<00:03:36.139> from<00:03:36.199> a<00:03:36.650> clay<00:03:37.099> lomi<00:03:37.400> area<00:03:37.790> where

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
we just came from a clay lomi area where

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.849 
we just came from a clay lomi area where
you<00:03:38.000> had<00:03:38.209> some<00:03:38.359> Merlot<00:03:38.629> we're<00:03:39.229> down<00:03:39.379> into<00:03:39.739> no

you're<00:03:42.739> going<00:03:42.859> to<00:03:42.919> identify<00:03:43.250> these

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:43.310 
you're going to identify these

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.969 
you're going to identify these
separately<00:03:43.819> you<00:03:44.000> know<00:03:44.150> just<00:03:44.479> yes<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:45.769> tell<00:03:45.919> you

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:45.979 
separately you know just yes to tell you

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:47.649 
separately you know just yes to tell you
the<00:03:46.009> truth<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.430> first<00:03:46.609> couple<00:03:47.060> harvests<00:03:47.599> I

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:47.659 
the truth the first couple harvests I

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.749 
the truth the first couple harvests I
won't<00:03:47.900> because<00:03:48.259> we<00:03:49.009> don't<00:03:49.189> crop<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.579> vines

00:03:49.749 --> 00:03:49.759 
won't because we don't crop the vines

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:50.949 
won't because we don't crop the vines
very<00:03:50.000> heavy<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.419> don't<00:03:50.599> have<00:03:50.720> enough

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
very heavy and I don't have enough

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.399 
very heavy and I don't have enough
volume<00:03:51.139> to<00:03:51.409> do<00:03:52.009> that<00:03:52.220> but<00:03:52.689> in<00:03:53.689> a<00:03:54.049> couple<00:03:54.259> years

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
volume to do that but in a couple years

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.409 
volume to do that but in a couple years
I<00:03:54.829> will<00:03:55.040> be<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.900> we<00:03:56.900> pick<00:03:57.769> a<00:03:57.949> lot<00:03:58.129> by<00:03:58.340> soil<00:03:58.639> we<00:03:59.389> I

00:03:59.409 --> 00:03:59.419 
I will be and we pick a lot by soil we I

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.390 
I will be and we pick a lot by soil we I
go<00:03:59.750> through<00:04:00.019> with<00:04:00.169> flagging<00:04:00.620> tape<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.129> tell

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
go through with flagging tape and tell

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.429 
go through with flagging tape and tell
the<00:04:01.489> guys<00:04:01.639> when<00:04:01.909> to<00:04:02.060> stop<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.329> we<00:04:03.079> keep<00:04:03.229> those

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
the guys when to stop and we keep those

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.610 
the guys when to stop and we keep those
separate<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:05.329> this<00:04:05.540> is<00:04:05.720> this<00:04:05.959> is<00:04:06.169> the<00:04:06.349> clay

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
separate so this is this is the clay

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.339 
separate so this is this is the clay
soil<00:04:07.129> and<00:04:07.459> I<00:04:07.489> mean<00:04:08.709> it<00:04:09.709> it's<00:04:10.340> it's<00:04:10.759> dense<00:04:11.349> this

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:12.349 
soil and I mean it it's it's dense this

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:14.409 
soil and I mean it it's it's dense this
is<00:04:12.530> not<00:04:12.650> wet<00:04:13.129> enough<00:04:13.159> to<00:04:13.579> try<00:04:13.759> to<00:04:13.819> ribbon<00:04:14.269> to

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:14.419 
is not wet enough to try to ribbon to

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:16.089 
is not wet enough to try to ribbon to
show<00:04:14.599> you<00:04:14.659> so<00:04:14.959> it<00:04:15.109> just<00:04:15.290> kind<00:04:15.409> of<00:04:15.439> crumples<00:04:15.949> up

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
show you so it just kind of crumples up

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.860 
show you so it just kind of crumples up
but<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.579> totally<00:04:17.209> different<00:04:17.509> soil<00:04:17.750> it's

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
but it's a totally different soil it's

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.080 
but it's a totally different soil it's
very<00:04:18.079> unfortunate<00:04:18.680> is<00:04:18.979> very<00:04:19.159> deep<00:04:19.489> which

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
very unfortunate is very deep which

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.140 
very unfortunate is very deep which
means<00:04:20.329> those<00:04:20.539> roots<00:04:20.840> go<00:04:21.169> deep<00:04:21.409> and<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:23.000> they

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
means those roots go deep and then they

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.940 
means those roots go deep and then they
can<00:04:23.330> suck<00:04:23.570> up<00:04:23.599> lots<00:04:23.990> of<00:04:24.169> water<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.680> lots<00:04:24.770> of

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
can suck up lots of water and lots of

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.070 
can suck up lots of water and lots of
nutrients<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.669> keep<00:04:25.849> going<00:04:26.180> all<00:04:26.300> season<00:04:26.719> long

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
nutrients and keep going all season long

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.980 
nutrients and keep going all season long
is<00:04:27.259> not<00:04:27.439> good<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:28.699> went<00:04:28.849> the<00:04:28.970> vines<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.300> kind

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
is not good you went the vines that kind

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.409 
is not good you went the vines that kind
of<00:04:30.050> shut<00:04:30.259> down<00:04:30.500> a<00:04:30.830> ver<00:04:31.520> Asian<00:04:31.970> which<00:04:32.120> is<00:04:32.270> when

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
of shut down a ver Asian which is when

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.869 
of shut down a ver Asian which is when
the<00:04:32.509> grapes<00:04:32.750> turn<00:04:33.169> from<00:04:33.470> a<00:04:33.680> green<00:04:34.340> color<00:04:34.610> to

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
the grapes turn from a green color to

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:37.959 
the grapes turn from a green color to
dark<00:04:35.270> color<00:04:35.629> and<00:04:36.310> often<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.430> clay<00:04:37.639> so<00:04:37.819> as

00:04:37.959 --> 00:04:37.969 
dark color and often on the clay so as

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.510 
dark color and often on the clay so as
they<00:04:38.120> don't<00:04:38.439> fortunately<00:04:39.439> Merlot<00:04:39.860> does

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
they don't fortunately Merlot does

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.700 
they don't fortunately Merlot does
because<00:04:41.180> its<00:04:41.659> cycle<00:04:42.139> is<00:04:42.259> shorter<00:04:42.680> than

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
because its cycle is shorter than

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.830 
because its cycle is shorter than
something<00:04:43.129> like<00:04:43.219> Cabernet<00:04:43.669> Sauvignon<00:04:44.180> which

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
something like Cabernet Sauvignon which

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.559 
something like Cabernet Sauvignon which
is<00:04:44.990> why<00:04:45.139> here<00:04:45.740> I<00:04:45.919> did<00:04:46.460> I<00:04:46.879> wanted<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.360> plant

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:47.569 
is why here I did I wanted to plant

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:49.450 
is why here I did I wanted to plant
cabernet<00:04:47.990> sauvignon<00:04:48.469> here<00:04:48.800> because<00:04:49.310> of<00:04:49.430> the

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
cabernet sauvignon here because of the

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.510 
cabernet sauvignon here because of the
steepness<00:04:49.960> you<00:04:50.960> lose<00:04:51.800> water<00:04:52.069> that<00:04:52.370> way

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
steepness you lose water that way

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.029 
steepness you lose water that way
through<00:04:52.759> drainage<00:04:53.180> but<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:53.449> also

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:54.039 
through drainage but I also

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.869 
through drainage but I also
unfortunately<00:04:55.039> found<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.520> soils<00:04:55.789> were

00:04:55.869 --> 00:04:55.879 
unfortunately found that the soils were

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.510 
unfortunately found that the soils were
very<00:04:56.060> deep<00:04:56.389> and<00:04:56.659> that's<00:04:57.620> not<00:04:57.860> good<00:04:58.099> for<00:04:58.129> cabs

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
very deep and that's not good for cabs

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.950 
very deep and that's not good for cabs
so<00:04:58.789> that's<00:04:58.969> why<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.150> went<00:04:59.360> ahead<00:04:59.479> and<00:04:59.629> put

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
so that's why I went ahead and put

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.860 
so that's why I went ahead and put
Merlot<00:05:00.349> here<00:05:00.650> we
