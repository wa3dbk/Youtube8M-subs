the<00:00:40.370> only<00:00:40.520> way<00:00:40.610> to<00:00:40.670> get<00:00:40.820> it<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:40.970> cut<00:00:41.150> off<00:00:41.270> was

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
the only way to get it to cut off was

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.620 
the only way to get it to cut off was
remove<00:00:42.590> the<00:00:42.739> actual<00:00:42.890> turn<00:00:43.220> signal<00:00:43.520> fuse<00:00:43.820> so<00:00:44.480> in

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
remove the actual turn signal fuse so in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.420 
remove the actual turn signal fuse so in
this<00:00:44.720> case<00:00:44.960> we<00:00:45.199> know<00:00:45.379> it's<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.770> turn<00:00:46.100> signal

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
this case we know it's the turn signal

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.939 
this case we know it's the turn signal
switch<00:00:46.460> or<00:00:47.440> multifunction<00:00:48.440> switch<00:00:48.559> you're

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
switch or multifunction switch you're

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.139 
switch or multifunction switch you're
going<00:00:49.070> to<00:00:49.129> have<00:00:49.219> these<00:00:49.340> things<00:00:49.520> called<00:00:49.699> a

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
going to have these things called a

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.430 
going to have these things called a
bunch<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.480> different<00:00:50.780> names<00:00:50.930> I've<00:00:51.199> heard<00:00:51.350> them

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
bunch of different names I've heard them

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.200 
bunch of different names I've heard them
called<00:00:51.469> by<00:00:51.829> but<00:00:52.039> I<00:00:52.100> think<00:00:52.340> the<00:00:52.879> overall

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
called by but I think the overall

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.420 
called by but I think the overall
official<00:00:53.840> name<00:00:53.989> is<00:00:54.170> multifunction<00:00:55.039> switch<00:00:55.160> is

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
official name is multifunction switch is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.889 
official name is multifunction switch is
that<00:00:55.550> correct<00:00:55.760> there<00:00:55.969> that<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.600> correct

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
that correct there that is correct

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.840 
that correct there that is correct
because<00:00:57.019> not<00:00:57.379> only<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:57.710> turn<00:00:58.309> signal

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
because not only this turn signal

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.490 
because not only this turn signal
operation<00:00:59.539> it<00:00:59.629> also<00:00:59.780> controls<00:01:00.289> your

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
operation it also controls your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.020 
operation it also controls your
headlights<00:01:00.890> well<00:01:01.340> that's<00:01:01.460> more<00:01:01.730> than<00:01:01.910> one

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
headlights well that's more than one

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.939 
headlights well that's more than one
function<00:01:02.269> right<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:02.870> we<00:01:02.989> can<00:01:03.170> safely<00:01:03.379> sell<00:01:03.739> a

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
function right so we can safely sell a

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.400 
function right so we can safely sell a
multifunction<00:01:04.730> switch<00:01:04.820> all<00:01:05.690> right<00:01:05.900> let's<00:01:06.260> get

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
multifunction switch all right let's get

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.700 
multifunction switch all right let's get
it

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
it

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.860

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:08.870 
Glenny we're going to go ahead and get

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.810 
Glenny we're going to go ahead and get
access<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.680> multifunction<00:01:10.340> switch<00:01:10.430> by

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
access to the multifunction switch by

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.930 
access to the multifunction switch by
doing<00:01:11.240> that<00:01:11.390> we<00:01:11.570> have<00:01:11.780> to<00:01:11.960> remove<00:01:12.230> the<00:01:12.500> bezel

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
doing that we have to remove the bezel

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.520 
doing that we have to remove the bezel
around<00:01:13.940> the<00:01:14.150> steering<00:01:14.420> column<00:01:14.690> on<00:01:15.140> this<00:01:15.320> one

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:15.530 
around the steering column on this one

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.600 
around the steering column on this one
we<00:01:15.620> have<00:01:15.740> two<00:01:15.920> screws<00:01:16.130> underneath

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
we have two screws underneath

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:24.910 
we have two screws underneath
let's<00:01:17.180> go<00:01:17.299> and<00:01:17.450> take<00:01:17.570> them<00:01:17.689> out<00:01:23.770> there's<00:01:24.770> also

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
let's go and take them out there's also

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
let's go and take them out there's also
two<00:01:25.250> screws<00:01:25.549> in<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.759> back

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:44.250 

once<00:01:37.390> forever

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:51.630 

now<00:01:44.920> we<00:01:44.980> have<00:01:45.190> access<00:01:45.550> to<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.790> switch<00:01:50.640> looks

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
now we have access to the switch looks

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.240 
now we have access to the switch looks
pretty<00:01:51.880> simple<00:01:52.120> to<00:01:52.300> remove<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.860> we<00:01:56.980> just<00:01:57.160> have

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
pretty simple to remove so we just have

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:06.120 
pretty simple to remove so we just have
two<00:01:57.400> screws<00:01:57.670> holding<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.060> in<00:02:04.770> make<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:05.890> top

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
two screws holding it in make the top

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.030 
two screws holding it in make the top
screw<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.810> then<00:02:08.230> your<00:02:08.320> bottom<00:02:08.650> screw<00:02:08.860> it

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
screw and then your bottom screw it

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.859 
screw and then your bottom screw it
looks<00:02:09.220> like<00:02:09.430> it<00:02:09.580> just<00:02:09.760> pulls<00:02:10.000> out<00:02:10.210> and<00:02:10.540> it<00:02:10.630> does

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
looks like it just pulls out and it does

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:30.720 
looks like it just pulls out and it does
I<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.890> your<00:02:18.100> electrical<00:02:18.490> connectors<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:30.610> can

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
I like your electrical connectors we can

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:50.920 
I like your electrical connectors we can
then<00:02:30.850> plug<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.210> new<00:02:31.330> one<00:02:31.450> in

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:25.960 

slide<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.049> back<00:02:52.079> in<00:03:22.730> see<00:03:23.730> if<00:03:23.790> it<00:03:23.879> works

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
slide it back in see if it works

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.610 
slide it back in see if it works
excuse<00:03:26.970> us<00:03:27.000> out<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.299> it<00:03:27.389> isn't<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.629> let's<00:03:28.470> put

excuse us out of it isn't it let's put

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.509 
excuse us out of it isn't it let's put
the<00:03:28.680> fuse<00:03:28.889> in<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.190> if<00:03:29.340> it<00:03:29.459> works<00:03:31.459> found<00:03:32.459> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
the fuse in this if it works found the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.599 
the fuse in this if it works found the
fuse<00:03:33.019> it'll<00:03:34.019> know<00:03:34.079> where<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.230> goes<00:03:37.549> there's<00:03:38.549> a
