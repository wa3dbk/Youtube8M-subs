00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.970
 thing that I did 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:51.790
 a castle that can give it the texture 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.030
 I'm going to paint it 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.490

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.530
 animals a castle is great 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.060
 because all that you grabbed him grabbed him and 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.530
 you know the play that I think the dragon 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.599
 attack the castle 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.489
 everything they invented everything that 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.209
 they have in their heads and they shaped it with 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.209
