hey guys this is my cage with Rockwell

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.210 
hey guys this is my cage with Rockwell
finally<00:00:04.529> put<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:04.830> it<00:00:04.950> took<00:00:05.490> a<00:00:05.580> little<00:00:05.670> while

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:07.220 
finally put in it took a little while

finally put in it took a little while
that's<00:00:08.220> all<00:00:08.370> done<00:00:08.550> with<00:00:08.580> cement<00:00:09.150> and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
that's all done with cement and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.930 
that's all done with cement and
styrofoam<00:00:11.120> all<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.210> did<00:00:12.509> was<00:00:13.400> basically<00:00:14.400> break

styrofoam all I did was basically break

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.460 
styrofoam all I did was basically break
up<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> bunch<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> cement<00:00:15.809> completely<00:00:16.260> cover

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
up a bunch of cement completely cover

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.349 
up a bunch of cement completely cover
the<00:00:16.650> wood<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:16.980> much<00:00:17.640> as<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.880> could<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:20.359> laid

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the wood as much as I could and laid

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.290 
the wood as much as I could and laid
cement<00:00:21.750> over<00:00:21.960> top<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.380> then<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:23.490> mixed

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cement over top of it then I mixed

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.950 
cement over top of it then I mixed
another<00:00:25.070> watery<00:00:26.070> batch<00:00:26.539> and<00:00:27.539> went<00:00:27.750> back<00:00:27.930> over

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
another watery batch and went back over

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.990 
another watery batch and went back over
top<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.680> cement<00:00:29.010> again<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> second

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
top of the cement again with a second

top of the cement again with a second
coat<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> make<00:00:30.660> sure<00:00:30.689> I<00:00:30.810> got<00:00:30.990> into<00:00:31.289> all

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
coat just to make sure I got into all

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.500 
coat just to make sure I got into all
the<00:00:31.500> little<00:00:31.740> cracks<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.790> smooth<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.120> any<00:00:33.329> of

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
the little cracks and smooth out any of

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.950 
the little cracks and smooth out any of
the<00:00:33.770> visible<00:00:35.960> cement<00:00:36.960> patches<00:00:37.649> from<00:00:38.960> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the visible cement patches from the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.150 
the visible cement patches from the
different<00:00:40.260> times<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.620> different<00:00:40.680> mixtures

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
different times and different mixtures

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.729 
different times and different mixtures
that<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.309> used<00:00:41.640> just<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.390> testing<00:00:42.750> still

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that I used just for testing still

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.060 
that I used just for testing still
perfecting<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.340> trying<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.640> see<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.059> can<00:00:46.070> get

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
perfecting it trying to see if I can get

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.799 
perfecting it trying to see if I can get
a<00:00:47.100> better<00:00:47.340> consistency<00:00:47.730> maybe<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.570> use<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
a better consistency maybe even use a

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.000 
a better consistency maybe even use a
different<00:00:51.440> material<00:00:52.440> other<00:00:52.590> than<00:00:52.680> cement

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
different material other than cement

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.660 
different material other than cement
because<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.460> cages<00:00:53.699> are<00:00:53.969> super<00:00:54.420> heavy<00:00:55.670> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
because these cages are super heavy this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.619 
because these cages are super heavy this
one<00:00:56.940> alone<00:00:57.360> weighs<00:00:59.239> probably<00:01:00.239> close<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.449> a

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
one alone weighs probably close to a

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.410 
one alone weighs probably close to a
couple<00:01:00.840> hundred<00:01:01.199> pounds<00:01:02.059> there's<00:01:03.059> no<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:03.329> it

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
couple hundred pounds there's no way it

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.549 
couple hundred pounds there's no way it
can<00:01:03.480> lift<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:03.840> my<00:01:03.960> own<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.290> don't<00:01:04.439> suggest

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
can lift it on my own so I don't suggest

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.219 
can lift it on my own so I don't suggest
anybody<00:01:05.159> using<00:01:05.820> this<00:01:05.939> method<00:01:06.360> unless<00:01:07.049> they

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
anybody using this method unless they

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.410 
anybody using this method unless they
have<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> friends<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.820> help<00:01:08.939> them<00:01:09.060> move<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
have the friends to help them move it

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.640 
have the friends to help them move it
around<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> parents<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.320> anything<00:01:10.470> like

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
around or the parents or anything like

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.140 
around or the parents or anything like
that

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
that

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
that
but<00:01:12.680> it<00:01:13.680> looks<00:01:13.830> pretty<00:01:13.950> good<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.430> dries<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> bit

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
but it looks pretty good it dries a bit

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.219 
but it looks pretty good it dries a bit
weird<00:01:15.650> I'm<00:01:16.650> gonna<00:01:16.830> paint<00:01:17.070> them<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:18.229> maybe

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
weird I'm gonna paint them and maybe

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.740 
weird I'm gonna paint them and maybe
even<00:01:19.380> use<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> bit<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.159> grout<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.210> sanded<00:01:21.720> grout

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
even use a bit of a grout a sanded grout

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.420 
even use a bit of a grout a sanded grout
which<00:01:22.200> will<00:01:22.380> still<00:01:22.650> give<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.100> texture

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
which will still give it some texture

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.810 
which will still give it some texture
but<00:01:23.670> smooth<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.119> lot<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> out<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.810> hide<00:01:25.409> any

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
but smooth a lot of it out and hide any

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.859 
but smooth a lot of it out and hide any
unwanted<00:01:26.820> may<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.150> fingerprints<00:01:27.720> that<00:01:27.810> might

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
unwanted may be fingerprints that might

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.539 
unwanted may be fingerprints that might
have<00:01:28.049> been<00:01:28.110> left<00:01:28.350> any<00:01:28.740> type<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.009> strokes<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
have been left any type of strokes that

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.749 
have been left any type of strokes that
just<00:01:29.729> look<00:01:29.939> awkward<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.200> don't<00:01:31.350> fit<00:01:31.759> then

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
just look awkward and don't fit then

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.840 
just look awkward and don't fit then
again<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> paint<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:34.280> a<00:01:35.280> whole<00:01:35.610> bunch<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
again you paint it and a whole bunch of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.859 
again you paint it and a whole bunch of
different<00:01:35.939> colors<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.509> take<00:01:36.659> away<00:01:36.840> from

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
different colors will take away from

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.789 
different colors will take away from
that<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.470> blend<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> stuff<00:01:39.210> like<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.799> but

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
that and blend it in stuff like that but

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.590 
that and blend it in stuff like that but
that's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.130> smaller<00:01:41.400> cage

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
that's a smaller cage

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.679 
that's a smaller cage
it's<00:01:43.640> six<00:01:44.640> by<00:01:45.600> three<00:01:45.780> by<00:01:45.990> two<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:47.570> that<00:01:48.570> will

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it's six by three by two and that will

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.980 
it's six by three by two and that will
be<00:01:48.810> sitting<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.380> top<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:50.210> this<00:01:51.210> cage<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
be sitting up on top of this cage here

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.179 
be sitting up on top of this cage here
I've<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.320> light<00:01:52.530> on<00:01:52.560> us<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> see<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.100> little

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
I've got a light on us you see a little

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.780 
I've got a light on us you see a little
bit<00:01:53.369> better<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.530> stand<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.430> holds<00:01:56.579> up

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
bit better I got the stand that holds up

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.010 
bit better I got the stand that holds up
in<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> bottom<00:01:57.270> put<00:01:57.450> some<00:01:57.600> wheels<00:01:57.750> on<00:01:57.990> that

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
in the bottom put some wheels on that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.490 
in the bottom put some wheels on that
because<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.790> tank<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.360> eight<00:02:00.810> feet<00:02:01.049> by<00:02:01.229> three

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
because this tank is eight feet by three

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.520 
because this tank is eight feet by three
feet<00:02:01.530> by<00:02:02.009> two<00:02:02.070> feet<00:02:02.540> with<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.930> cement

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
feet by two feet with the same cement

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.609 
feet by two feet with the same cement
idea<00:02:05.430> that's<00:02:05.729> both<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.030> exact<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.810> you

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
idea that's both the exact same and you
