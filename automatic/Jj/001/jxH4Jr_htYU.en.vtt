 durito which it is a little farther 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.190
 then whoever it is is fine there is a 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.190
 very very good brand that makes chorizo 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.530
 Spanish and it's not so greasy look no 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.420
 loose so much fat that's why I'm going to 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.850
 put a little bit of olive oil 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.240
 aside I love olive oil a 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.119
 trickle and remember the oil is the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 heat driver already saw how when 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.590
 because the chorizo ​​was not happening at all 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.060
 he puts an oil and then begins to 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 function 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.360

 I think it's going to be very attractive very very 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.970
 rich then let's give it a little bit 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.250
 more warmth but do not go to 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.220

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.800
 chorizo is already cured you can eat it 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.340
 well but look with a little bit of heat 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.230
 Take a little gold and you do not know how it smells 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.590

 also peanuts without any problem 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.599
 but when you have almonds, put it on and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.430
 You will see what a delight if you still want 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:57.689

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.680
 tomato 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.069
 all the flavor of chorizo is absorbed 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:10.980
 and of the chili a little chicken broth 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.840

 children if they do not eat spicy we do not put 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.859
 chile can put nothing else to a 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.680
 part then let's put a little bit 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:26.270
 of parsley 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:29.900

 all the people who still do not feel with 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.699
 safety to sew a paste is very 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:37.539
 simple put plenty of water to boil 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:39.620
 abundant water to boil salt too 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:41.240
 abundant salt they say it should be 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.490
 canceled as sea water 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.740
 Nothing more try Mediterranean lix 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.630
 It is very salty, perfect because the pasta 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.610
 it absorbs it afterwards it is difficult for the 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.289
 absorb puts your pasta to cook 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.500
 depending on what type of pasta is 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.630

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.099
 cooking and the pasta is left al dente 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.500
