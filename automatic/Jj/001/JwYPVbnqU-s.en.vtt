looking paint scheme on this airplane

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.130 
looking paint scheme on this airplane
now<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:26.039> model<00:00:26.310> comes<00:00:26.699> almost<00:00:27.240> plug<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> fly

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
now this model comes almost plug and fly

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310 
now this model comes almost plug and fly
comes<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.740> motor<00:00:28.949> installed<00:00:29.369> giant<00:00:30.240> 50<00:00:30.689> 60

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
comes with a motor installed giant 50 60

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.970 
comes with a motor installed giant 50 60
390<00:00:32.160> kV<00:00:32.579> no<00:00:33.570> ESC<00:00:34.170> that's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> only<00:00:34.800> thing

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
390 kV no ESC that's the only thing

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.260 
390 kV no ESC that's the only thing
missing<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.460> keeps<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.760> from<00:00:35.790> being<00:00:35.969> plug

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
missing that keeps it from being plug

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.900 
missing that keeps it from being plug
and<00:00:36.420> fly<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:36.870> will<00:00:37.079> need<00:00:37.290> your<00:00:37.440> own<00:00:37.590> 100<00:00:38.219> 120

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
and fly you will need your own 100 120

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.139 
and fly you will need your own 100 120
amp<00:00:39.090> ESC<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.710> designed<00:00:41.100> around<00:00:41.309> 6<00:00:41.879> s

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
amp ESC and this is designed around 6 s

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
amp ESC and this is designed around 6 s
so<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> need<00:00:42.600> about<00:00:42.780> 6<00:00:43.140> s<00:00:43.379> 4000<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> 5000

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so you need about 6 s 4000 to 5000

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
so you need about 6 s 4000 to 5000
milliamp<00:00:45.239> pack<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:45.840> for<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.260> plane

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
milliamp pack for this for this plane

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.350 
milliamp pack for this for this plane
here<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.430> servos<00:00:47.910> come<00:00:48.120> pre-installed

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
here now servos come pre-installed

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
here now servos come pre-installed
you've<00:00:49.320> got<00:00:49.500> individual<00:00:49.980> 9<00:00:50.250> gram<00:00:50.520> servos<00:00:51.030> for

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
you've got individual 9 gram servos for

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
you've got individual 9 gram servos for
each<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.600> around<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.289> ailerons<00:00:52.770> on<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.160> model

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
each a around for ailerons on this model

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.580 
each a around for ailerons on this model
they<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.420> quite<00:00:54.660> sufficient<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.350> you

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
have a single servo for each aileron now

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.709 
have a single servo for each aileron now
also<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> rear<00:01:00.210> servos

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
also you have for the rear servos

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.650 
also you have for the rear servos
actually<00:01:01.590> 40<00:01:02.070> grams<00:01:02.340> standard<00:01:02.940> sized<00:01:03.149> servo

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
actually 40 grams standard sized servo

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.149 
actually 40 grams standard sized servo
so<00:01:03.870> plenty<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.260> power<00:01:04.439> for<00:01:04.589> your<00:01:04.830> control

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159

mentioned<00:02:02.330> 6s<00:02:02.810> four<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.320> five<00:02:03.500> thousand

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
mentioned 6s four to five thousand

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.560 
mentioned 6s four to five thousand
milliamp<00:02:04.160> will<00:02:04.670> be<00:02:04.820> perfect<00:02:05.420> that's

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
milliamp will be perfect that's

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.480 
milliamp will be perfect that's
basically<00:02:06.320> with<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.620> airplane<00:02:07.010> is<00:02:07.130> designed

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
basically with this airplane is designed

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.580 
basically with this airplane is designed
around<00:02:07.640> and<00:02:08.630> moving<00:02:08.899> on<00:02:09.020> to<00:02:09.050> the<00:02:09.229> rear<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.410> the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
around and moving on to the rear of the

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.100 
around and moving on to the rear of the
plane<00:02:09.800> we<00:02:10.520> have<00:02:10.550> a<00:02:10.670> bolt-on<00:02:11.150> tail<00:02:11.450> section<00:02:11.930> so

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
plane we have a bolt-on tail section so

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.140 
plane we have a bolt-on tail section so
no<00:02:12.260> glue<00:02:12.440> require<00:02:12.800> vertical<00:02:13.730> stab<00:02:13.940> and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
no glue require vertical stab and

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.790 
no glue require vertical stab and
horizontal<00:02:14.600> stab<00:02:14.780> bolt<00:02:15.050> right<00:02:15.230> on<00:02:15.290> very

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
horizontal stab bolt right on very

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.500 
horizontal stab bolt right on very
secure<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.490> also<00:02:16.730> makes<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.180> easy<00:02:17.390> to
