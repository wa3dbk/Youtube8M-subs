00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
plant that have been plucked as we say

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.940 
plant that have been plucked as we say
all<00:01:17.790> picked<00:01:18.149> and<00:01:18.479> then<00:01:19.049> allow<00:01:19.350> two<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
all picked and then allow two to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.520 
all picked and then allow two to
dehydrate<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:21.270> most<00:01:21.570> cases<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.259> leaves

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
dehydrate so in most cases the leaves

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
dehydrate so in most cases the leaves
are<00:01:22.890> not<00:01:23.610> fully<00:01:23.909> developed<00:01:24.360> by<00:01:24.509> they're<00:01:24.780> not

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
are not fully developed by they're not

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.800 
are not fully developed by they're not
opened<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.610> helps<00:01:27.240> with<00:01:27.479> some<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.720> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
opened and that helps with some of the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.200 
opened and that helps with some of the
flavor<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.920> Bush<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> yearning<00:01:29.970> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
flavor because that Bush is yearning to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.789 
flavor because that Bush is yearning to
survive<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:30.899> lot<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.080> the<00:01:31.200> nutrients<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
survive and a lot of the nutrients of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.940 
survive and a lot of the nutrients of
flavors<00:01:32.360> extend<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.539> these<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:34.200> extremities

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
flavors extend to these very extremities

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.680 
flavors extend to these very extremities
of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.190> bush<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:35.789> hopefully<00:01:36.360> we're<00:01:36.509> going<00:01:36.630> to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
of the bush so hopefully we're going to

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.010 
of the bush so hopefully we're going to
have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.140> tasty<00:01:37.649> tea<00:01:38.100> here<00:01:38.310> now<00:01:38.850> the
