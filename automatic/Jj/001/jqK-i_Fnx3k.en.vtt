00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.370
 lion the hype technology and telecommunications with a server asks 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.170
 that the morocho the first topic that we are going to address this week refers to the future 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.350
 of both wireless telephone lines and is known as 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.159
 cell phones or wire that to residential lines 

00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:17.400
 facing the future 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.990
 the intermediate under par what are telephone services with a 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.990
 technology that is known as IP telephony or telephony of 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.000
 internet because ip comes from internet protocol hotels put on 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.199
 the internet protocol is also known as boys over -internet protocol 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.140
 the voice over ip this technology is going to revolutionize what we know until the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.180
 today 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.130
 as a way of telecommunications since it's going to allow one connected to his 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.020
 phone an internet connection cable and through there you will be able to 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.989
 make local and international long distance calls 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.829
 extremely cent to appreciate kyb leo or back and also going to be able 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.229
 use demanded that so interesting features 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.379
 like the background video is to say that one can see the person with whom he is 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.769
 talking as well as sending messages 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.840
 p integral email to say that the future 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.740
 of the telephone that this one has his house is going away to integrate to the computer 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.560
 We were going to be using this innovative technology 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.369
 within the coming years as we know the technological evolution every 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.330
 time happens in a shorter time therefore I ranch many years we will be 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.850
 enjoying what is ip telephony 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.860
 the last topic and that we are going to share with you refers to the concept of 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.140
 telecommuting teleworking by definition that is work to 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.299
 distance and with the use of information technologies from 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.950
 communications in the appointment the possibility that also using the internet 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.540
 people can work from home this is a concept that although 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.530
 it seems something strange is already being used in many countries of the world and 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.070
 for example in japan much of the public hobby employment uses the 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.509
 teleworking AIDS does its job from home 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.130
 and big companies like ibm e for example have more than 60 percent of 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.939
 rise or mania of marketing and sales efe basically in three eyes efe area of 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.340
 business that is dedicated to what is teleworking one works from home 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.340
 using technology by making a conference call 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.340
 sending the reports online is a very important step because it will reduce 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.769
 the costs of the companies since as it is going to have to have a space 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:22.980
 for the employee 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.300
 and therefore paying uu 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.040
 I looked for exeter physical space is to say that that is going to benefit both the 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.490
 company as the employee 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.860
 who is going to have a better management of his time 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.660
 that is to say that technology little by little both with the subject that we approach 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.090
 as first of the ip telephony as with teleworking will be our life 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.670
 more bearable and much easier so with this we conclude the content of 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.460
 his section the technology and telecommunications hype this week 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.660
 I'm talking here about the Morrison continuing to enjoy his agent program
