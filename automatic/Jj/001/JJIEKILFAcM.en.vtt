00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and it sounded like an amazing

need<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.700> our<00:01:14.729> backs<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.840> have<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> focus<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
need on our backs but we have a focus on

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
need on our backs but we have a focus on
fairly<00:01:17.310> lightweight<00:01:17.490> gear<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.119> not<00:01:18.270> an

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
fairly lightweight gear it's not an

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.600 
fairly lightweight gear it's not an
ultralight<00:01:18.689> trip<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.799> only<00:01:19.950> take<00:01:20.280> just

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
ultralight trip but we only take just

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.010 
ultralight trip but we only take just
what<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.030> going<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> need<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.720> we

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
what we know we're going to need and we

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.260 
what we know we're going to need and we
pack<00:01:22.290> food<00:01:22.530> portions<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.130> carefully<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
pack food portions very carefully so the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.120 
pack food portions very carefully so the
pad<00:01:24.420> should<00:01:24.450> actually<00:01:24.750> not<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> heavy<00:01:25.320> I'd

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
pad should actually not that heavy I'd

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.910 
pad should actually not that heavy I'd
say<00:01:26.430> they're<00:01:27.299> probably<00:01:27.479> usually<00:01:27.869> between<00:01:27.990> 35

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
say they're probably usually between 35

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
say they're probably usually between 35
and<00:01:28.950> 40<00:01:29.430> pounds<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.119> right<00:01:30.600> after<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.869> resupply

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
and 40 pounds I right after a resupply

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
and 40 pounds I right after a resupply
and<00:01:31.619> they<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.130> lighter<00:01:32.340> as<00:01:32.549> we<00:01:32.729> eat<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> food

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
and they get lighter as we eat the food

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960 
and they get lighter as we eat the food
and<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.750> along<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.430> think<00:01:35.430> some<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> best
