00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
bolts in going this way because it's

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.630 
bolts in going this way because it's
only<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.410> head<00:00:43.680> when<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> put<00:00:44.280> them<00:00:44.399> on<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
only the head when you put them on the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.340 
only the head when you put them on the
other<00:00:44.850> way<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.690> nut<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
other way and you have the nut and the

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.090 
other way and you have the nut and the
end<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> bolt<00:00:47.910> sticking<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.660> here<00:00:49.100> they

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
end of the bolt sticking out here they

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
end of the bolt sticking out here they
stick<00:00:50.399> out<00:00:50.550> farther<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.149> then<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.390> have

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
stick out farther and then you have

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.630 
stick out farther and then you have
chain<00:00:51.899> issues<00:00:52.410> your<00:00:52.680> chain<00:00:53.010> rules<00:00:53.370> right

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
chain issues your chain rules right

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.060 
chain issues your chain rules right
through<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> area<00:00:54.329> always<00:00:55.199> put<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.739> bolts

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
through this area always put the bolts

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.160 
through this area always put the bolts

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
the face there washer down in the bottom

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.830 
the face there washer down in the bottom
slide<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:31.810> bolt<00:01:32.050> through<00:01:32.890> and<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:34.390> just<00:01:34.420> come

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
slide the bolt through and I just come

off<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.140> other<00:01:35.260> side<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.280> still<00:01:39.490> proceed

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
off the other side and you still proceed

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.969 
off the other side and you still proceed
to<00:01:41.440> put<00:01:41.650> that<00:01:41.830> on

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.380 

then<00:01:48.610> free<00:01:49.030> pad<00:01:50.039> one<00:01:51.039> under<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> battery<00:01:51.909> one

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
then free pad one under the battery one

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.969 
then free pad one under the battery one
on<00:01:52.539> either<00:01:52.719> side<00:01:53.079> of<00:01:53.110> the<00:01:53.320> battery<00:01:53.560> where<00:01:53.860> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
on either side of the battery where the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.359 
on either side of the battery where the
bark<00:01:54.189> over<00:01:54.460> stone

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.249 

so<00:01:58.229> black<00:01:59.229> pad<00:01:59.469> on<00:01:59.710> the<00:01:59.890> bottom<00:02:00.990> let's<00:02:01.990> just

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
so black pad on the bottom let's just

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.980 
so black pad on the bottom let's just
say<00:02:04.109> battery<00:02:05.880> have<00:02:06.880> mastered<00:02:07.479> be<00:02:07.689> still

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
say battery have mastered be still

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.960 
say battery have mastered be still
better<00:02:09.300> don't<00:02:10.300> get<00:02:10.450> started

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.470 

lad<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> battery<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.769> pin<00:02:18.190> or<00:02:18.459> hattery<00:02:19.239> ball

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
lad the battery on a pin or hattery ball

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:40.830 
lad the battery on a pin or hattery ball
put<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.319> haha<00:02:20.680> time

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
let's turn these into the battery as

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.690 
let's turn these into the battery as
tight<00:03:14.470> as<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.709> they<00:03:15.129> can't<00:03:15.340> hang<00:03:15.549> out

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
tight as you can they can't hang out

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.190 
tight as you can they can't hang out
this<00:03:15.849> way<00:03:16.030> 90<00:03:16.299> degrees<00:03:16.599> and<00:03:16.720> they<00:03:16.810> can't<00:03:17.080> go
