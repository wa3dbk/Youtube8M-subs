00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.990
 the shit on him 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:13.719
 he thinks for a moment only I want

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.500
 thing of the past 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:31.410
 we will leave for our adventure because 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 I canceled my commitments 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.620
 the mansion but the great among the mountains 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.780
 of the Himalayas and the lead of the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.640
 guerrillas rises kirat region 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.890
 controlled by the dictator pagan min 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:47.050
 the blond you have just seen in 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.030
 far cry 4 we will wear the clothes of he already i 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.940
 pirates year of birth but grown up 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.690
 in the united states his adventures 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.549
 they will start when it has to answer 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.750
 his father's last wish at 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:57.820
 time of his death 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.219
 spread his ashes in his own 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.350
 native land for a series of events e 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.330
 twists and already finds himself 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.550
 cooperate with the rebels led by 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.649
 saab al and love from both leaders of the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.630
 golden path and though these two 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.340
 aim to achieve the same end 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.440
 that is to overthrow the government 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.020
 each of them will have a different way of 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.759
 face things hamida will have one 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.549
 mentality more open to development e 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.229
 innovation while sabal will try to 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.409
 to return the kirat is linked to 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.880
 traditions and its secular culture 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.590
 there will be so many missions that 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.299
 will compose the main campaign 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.310
 but as with the best dishes 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.950
 also the contours must not be from 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.450
 less in fact in far cry 4 we will have 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.609
 spoiled for choice as far as 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.520
 concerns secondary missions or otherwise 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.810
 alternatives each of these will not have 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 just to increase ours 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.130
 experience points and the money earned 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.020
 but it will unlock different types of benefits 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.250
 which shelters to be able to travel more 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.469
 quickly via the option 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.479
 quick shift unlock new 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:58.810
 Map sectors sign in to give me 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.759
 tribute and much more probably that 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.710
 which makes the gameplay very cool is 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.450
 just the large amount of activity 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.149
 to be able to perform almost at any time 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.130
 the match was practically rendered 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.479
 better all that was present in 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.190
 far cry 3 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.930
 moreover, the events will not be few 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.480
 random that we will be offered to 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.250
 which we can participate or not among the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 the most common we have the liberation of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.060
 hostages where one needed to be solved 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.739
 dangerous situation in which 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.019
 we'll have to take out the enemy army and 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.970
 free prisoners or fight 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.130
 supplies from the government for then 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.510
 deliver them to the golden path this 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.430
 kind of missions will be great 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.530
 solution to get mainly 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.170
 bonus during purchases or exchanges 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.940
 of goods as each work done for i 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.849
 rebels will increase points 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.500
 karma another interesting thing is the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.130
 expansion methodology of its own 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.590
 inventory 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.260
 divided into various weapons sections 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.000
 medical ammunition devices each 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.260
 of them can be expanded thanks 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.210
 to the use of different skins 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.740
 from the local fauna for 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.380
 this reason will be very useful 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.880
 the bow as an arrow ruins a lot 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.890
 less animal skins each 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.960
 arch killing will allow us to 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.910
 collect twice as many skins 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.010
 on the contrary, killing with explosives 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.350
 rocket launchers and the like will involve the 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.120
 destruction of the head any kind of 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.220
 animal is shown on our map 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.900
 in such a way as to know where we have 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.120
 more likely to find one 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.690
 certain species that in the case of the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.520
 carnivores 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.380
 these can be attracted thanks to 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.960
 pieces of meat recovered from others 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.060
 animals so you can hunt them using 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.530
 a minimum of tactics is not fun 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.960
 when you are attacked in the tall grass 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.930
 from a tiger attract large predators 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.030
 it will not only be useful for hunting but 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.440
 also to thin out or distract groups of 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.290
 enemy soldiers present in the various 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.700
 camps the fights are not 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.860
 so different from the previous chapter 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.660
 and we will have a wide choice of weapons from 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.310
 use starting from rifles 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.020
 conventional assault until arriving 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.890
 flamethrower throwing knives or 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.110
 rocket launchers 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.180
 among other things through the various stores that 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.650
 we will find in the villages it will be possible 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.900
 customize your paraphernalia 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.540
 through accessories such as optics for 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.600
 rifle extended magazine and the like o 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.890
 even special paints 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.840
 dirty enemies like that of the gods 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.300
 allied guerrillas will not be much 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.010
 processed and this will involve in addition to 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.080
 movements and actions not always much 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.450
 it also makes sense to alternate moments 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.640
 in which we will be discovered in an instant by 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.970
 far away and others where we will not come 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.080
 notice even flanking the enemy 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.850
 fight performing missions there 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.890
 will allow you to gain experience points 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.130
 to spend in a table divided into 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.600
 two branches the tiger is the elephant the first 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.770
 will serve to develop our skills 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.660
 of combat 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.670
 the second one concerning the 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.740
 crafting health and generally all 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.450
 more practical aspects 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.790
 keeping in theme of such care in making 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.250
 cry 4 we will make extensive use of plants and herbs 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.960
 from which to extract serums or drugs which 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.280
 will develop our skills for a 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.700
 limited time period 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:54.550
 history though vaguely remember just 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.500
 Causes 2 has many twists 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.240
 but on the other hand it is well seasoned with 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.130
 original weird characters that 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.010
 they will succeed in making you entertain 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.390
 even the longest of the cutscenes but it is 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.550
 of the latter that the users 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.250
 pc are complaining particularly 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.200
 since it is subject to changes in some 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.790
 configuration file will not be 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.980
 can skip the long line of 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.270
 movies belonging to ubisoft is partner 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.700
 various at game start 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.170
 same thing for cutscenes we will have to 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.080
 see it all until the last second 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.610
 and without the possibility of pause rlh is a 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.340
 interesting aspect of the setting 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.440
 the references are the explanations and the 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.450
 representations of what concerns the 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.420
 culture and the mysticism of that slice 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:36.040
 of world composed of religions and temples 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.740
 a firm bond with nature 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.540
 during the campaign we will learn more from 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.760
 near meaning of certain 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:44.440
 symbols and idols that will accompany us 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.900
 for the duration of the game 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.240
 first of all the figure of the tiger is 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.130
 of the elephant so in some parts 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.170
 of the game we will face trips to 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.420
 limit between reality and fantasy to understand 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.800
 esotericism and the cults of that are better 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.960
 land rich in traditions 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.090
 another very real aspect 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.010
 interesting for pc users will be the 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.440
 possibility of having an editor for 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:07.330
 create from scratch or from presets 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.250
 own custom maps you can 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:11.290
 use multiplayer 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.820
 fortunately I say this as a former user 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.590
 unreal engine and hummer 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.230
 the mechanics of creation are a lot 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.150
 simple and intuitive and remember a lot 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:22.000
 far the creation mode of 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:23.980
 sim city 4 this will give a touch of 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.410
 longevity and extra variety in the different ones 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.450
 Multiplayer modes available too 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.850
 because if you want you can make them 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.830
 own maps available to everyone to do 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.930
 cry 4 as many have already said is 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.850
 actually the title that this year 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.110
 he saved ubisoft's face after the 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.090
 storm on assassin's creed 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.680
 the characteristic setting 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:43.420
 together with the characters well 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.910
 characterized and the methods of 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.410
 very varied combat confer 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.270
 to the title a judgment after all 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:51.490
 very positive 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.350
 fortunately the pc version that which 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.120
 I'm showing you has not reported 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.890
 large burrs 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.230
 indeed , he got away with very few glitches 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.540
 identified and although optimally 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.400
 also available in non-configurations 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:05.470
 brand new some problems of 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.430
 stuttering in ultrà yes configuration 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:08.560
 will be able to find 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.780
 avoidable easily if you don't overdo it 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.300
 with anti aliasing and details of 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:15.640
 shadows despite turning on his fourth 

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.410
 candelina far cry manages to hold the 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.540
 head up and manage to propose a 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.310
 Valid entertainment to pass a 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.040
 nice time immersed in a pleasant 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:26.050
 succession of actions and phases 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:28.360
 exploration hunts in the end a lot
