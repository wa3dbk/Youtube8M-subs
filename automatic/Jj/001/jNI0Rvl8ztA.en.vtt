00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
down most of the motor so it's pretty

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.090 
down most of the motor so it's pretty
well<00:00:43.579> oil<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:45.000> dirt<00:00:45.120> free<00:00:45.920> obviously<00:00:46.920> besides

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
it not getting a bath in a while had to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.350 
it not getting a bath in a while had to
replace<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> kick<00:00:51.930> starter<00:00:52.350> it's<00:00:52.949> uh<00:00:53.360> it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
replace the kick starter it's uh it's

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.290 
replace the kick starter it's uh it's
indexed<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.260> farther<00:00:55.469> down<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:56.879> might

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
indexed a little farther down so I might

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.619 
indexed a little farther down so I might
shift<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.379> up<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.250> little<00:00:59.309> higher<00:00:59.670> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
shift it up so it's a little higher you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.860 
shift it up so it's a little higher you
know<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.899> between<00:01:00.989> years<00:01:01.500> but<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.219> said

only<00:01:03.870> real<00:01:04.199> damage<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> whole<00:01:05.010> bike<00:01:05.220> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
only real damage on the whole bike is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
only real damage on the whole bike is
just<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.020> paint<00:01:07.020> rubbing<00:01:07.380> off<00:01:07.530> from<00:01:07.830> people

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just the paint rubbing off from people

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
just the paint rubbing off from people
riding<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.570> on<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.780> other

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
riding it you can see it on the other

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:16.219 
riding it you can see it on the other
side<00:01:10.170> when<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:11.479> blew<00:01:12.479> over<00:01:12.630> there<00:01:14.869> like<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.900> said

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
side when I blew over there like I said

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.450 
side when I blew over there like I said
this<00:01:16.380> rocket<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:16.860> probably<00:01:17.280> need<00:01:17.400> to

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
this rocket will probably need to

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.910 
this rocket will probably need to
replace<00:01:17.610> soon<00:01:18.119> I'm<00:01:18.509> starting<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.080> sawtooth<00:01:19.590> so

replace soon I'm starting to sawtooth so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.320 
replace soon I'm starting to sawtooth so
it<00:01:20.009> doesn't<00:01:20.280> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> whole<00:01:20.610> lot<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> life<00:01:21.090> left

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
clutch perch on the case was broken

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.320 
clutch perch on the case was broken
before<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.760> got<00:02:28.000> it

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
before I got it

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.680 
before I got it
so<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.510> fixed<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.280> by<00:02:30.280> making<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.910> retainer<00:02:31.330> for

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
so I fixed it by making a retainer for

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.160 
so I fixed it by making a retainer for
it<00:02:31.780> so<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.230> works<00:02:32.440> perfectly<00:02:32.830> fine<00:02:33.010> now<00:02:33.340> but

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
it so it works perfectly fine now but

throttle<00:03:13.269> tube<00:03:13.450> was<00:03:13.660> cracked<00:03:13.959> up<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.319> little

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
throttle tube was cracked up a little

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.849 
throttle tube was cracked up a little
bit<00:03:14.709> when<00:03:14.920> I<00:03:14.950> got<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.959> I<00:03:16.959> mean<00:03:17.410> it<00:03:17.500> still<00:03:17.709> works

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
bit when I got it I mean it still works

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:19.680 
bit when I got it I mean it still works
perfectly<00:03:18.040> fine<00:03:18.489> as<00:03:18.760> you'll<00:03:18.910> see<00:03:19.120> when<00:03:19.359> I<00:03:19.420> ride

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
perfectly fine as you'll see when I ride

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.170 
perfectly fine as you'll see when I ride
or<00:03:20.380> when<00:03:20.590> I<00:03:20.620> started<00:03:21.250> up<00:03:21.400> works<00:03:21.760> perfectly

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
or when I started up works perfectly

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.870 
or when I started up works perfectly
fine<00:03:22.420> but<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:23.160> guess<00:03:24.160> if<00:03:24.340> someone<00:03:24.519> was<00:03:24.730> really

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
fine but I guess if someone was really

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.309 
fine but I guess if someone was really
worried<00:03:25.209> about<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.540> I've<00:03:25.660> never<00:03:25.870> had<00:03:26.170> any

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
worried about it I've never had any

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.229 
worried about it I've never had any
problems<00:03:26.709> with<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:26.889> but<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.970> can<00:03:28.120> just

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
problems with it but you can just

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.660 
problems with it but you can just
replace<00:03:28.540> these<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.109> only<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.500> five<00:03:30.400> ten

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
replace these and only like five ten

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.330 
replace these and only like five ten
bucks<00:03:30.970> if<00:03:31.299> you're<00:03:31.750> you're<00:03:32.739> real<00:03:32.920> concerned
