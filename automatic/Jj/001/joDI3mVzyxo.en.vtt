00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
these train horns I have a small air

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.799 
these train horns I have a small air
tape<00:00:34.410> right<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.399> can<00:00:35.430> see<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:36.510> metal

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
tape right here as you can see the metal

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.630 
tape right here as you can see the metal
thing<00:00:37.350> right<00:00:37.530> here<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.800> an<00:00:37.890> air<00:00:38.010> tank<00:00:38.309> there's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
thing right here is an air tank there's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.150 
thing right here is an air tank there's
an<00:00:38.790> air<00:00:38.910> compressor<00:00:39.120> right<00:00:39.629> here

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
an air compressor right here

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.500 
an air compressor right here
and<00:00:41.160> then<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> 12-volt<00:00:42.780> power<00:00:43.550> air<00:00:44.550> air

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
and then this is a 12-volt power air air

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.180 
and then this is a 12-volt power air air
system<00:00:46.020> right<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.530> create<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.010> air

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
system right here to create the air

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.340 
system right here to create the air
helping<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.329> small<00:00:48.570> air<00:00:48.690> compressor<00:00:49.230> in

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
helping out the small air compressor in

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.139 
helping out the small air compressor in
my<00:00:49.530> tank<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:51.420> as<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.780> can<00:00:51.870> see<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:54.379> airline

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
my tank it as you can see this airline

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
my tank it as you can see this airline
attaches<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.350> outlet<00:00:58.920> right<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.370> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
attaches to that outlet right there and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.209 
attaches to that outlet right there and
the<00:01:00.270> air<00:01:00.420> line<00:01:00.690> goes<00:01:01.020> up<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.440> right<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:01.949> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the air line goes up to right here and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.429 
the air line goes up to right here and
plugs<00:01:03.120> into<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.019> air<00:01:04.229> tank<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.799> stuff<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
plugs into the air tank and stuff and

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.260 
plugs into the air tank and stuff and
the<00:01:07.439> air<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.220> travels<00:01:08.670> through<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:09.000> line

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the air just travels through the line

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.490 
the air just travels through the line
right<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.880> horns<00:01:12.689> which<00:01:13.049> powers

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
right here into the horns which powers

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.410 
right here into the horns which powers
them<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:15.890> what<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:18.030> here<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:19.340> the<00:01:20.340> air<00:01:20.580> line

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
them so what I have here is the air line

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.020 
them so what I have here is the air line
comes<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> valve<00:01:22.770> right<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.400> had<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> use

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
comes to a valve right here I had to use

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
comes to a valve right here I had to use
an<00:01:24.180> outlet<00:01:24.570> piece<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.990> attach<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.619> right<00:01:25.799> here

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
an outlet piece to attach on right here

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.859 
an outlet piece to attach on right here
because<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:29.540> pull<00:01:30.540> you've

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
because this right here is pull you've

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
because this right here is pull you've
grabbed<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.500> pull<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.770> down<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
grabbed it and you pull it down and it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.469 
grabbed it and you pull it down and it
makes<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.030> sound<00:01:33.270> right<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:34.040> so<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.700> won't<00:01:36.329> be
