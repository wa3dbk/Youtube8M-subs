00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
them and that would be super fast but

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.279 
them and that would be super fast but
then<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.210> would<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.629> sit<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:00.989> ten

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:01.639 
then you would have to sit there for ten
minutes

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
