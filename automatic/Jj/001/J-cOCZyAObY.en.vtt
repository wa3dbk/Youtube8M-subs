else in your lives this is really the
biggest<00:01:41.100> pride<00:01:41.490> chained<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.479> human<00:01:43.229> history

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
biggest pride chained in human history

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.340 
biggest pride chained in human history
this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.640> binary<00:01:45.119> numbers<00:01:45.659> but

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
this is right here is binary numbers but

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.380 
this is right here is binary numbers but
usually<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.520> number<00:01:48.530> 743<00:01:50.270> what<00:01:51.270> I'm

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
usually we have number 743 what I'm

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.949 
usually we have number 743 what I'm
saying<00:01:51.689> there<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.109> i<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.349> 7<00:01:52.799> 100<00:01:53.450> for<00:01:54.450> tens

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
saying there is i have 7 100 for tens

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.179 
saying there is i have 7 100 for tens
and<00:01:55.380> three<00:01:56.039> ones<00:01:56.840> what<00:01:57.840> I'm<00:01:57.929> saying<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.349> is<00:01:58.920> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
and three ones what I'm saying here is I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.130 
and three ones what I'm saying here is I
have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.369> seven<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.569> made<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:00.959> with

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
have a seven and it's made up with

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.740 
have a seven and it's made up with
binary<00:02:01.380> numbers<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.729> reason<00:02:02.759> why<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.179> is<00:02:03.569> so

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
binary numbers the reason why this is so

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.869 
binary numbers the reason why this is so
important<00:02:04.409> is<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> how<00:02:05.849> all

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:05.879 
important is that this is how all

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.059 
important is that this is how all
circuits<00:02:06.659> work<00:02:06.899> how<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.259> computers<00:02:07.829> work

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
circuits work how all computers work

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.330 
circuits work how all computers work
either<00:02:08.579> the<00:02:08.849> circuit<00:02:09.299> is<00:02:09.329> off<00:02:09.660> zero<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:11.099> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
either the circuit is off zero or the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.059 
either the circuit is off zero or the
circuit<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.790> an<00:02:11.940> odd<00:02:12.060> one<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:13.470> I<00:02:13.500> made<00:02:13.739> up<00:02:13.890> at

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
circuit is an odd one so I made up at

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.640 
circuit is an odd one so I made up at
seven<00:02:14.370> 43<00:02:15.230> 7<00:02:16.340> 100<00:02:17.340> 4<00:02:17.670> 10<00:02:17.879> 31<00:02:18.360> I'll<00:02:19.079> make<00:02:19.319> up<00:02:19.500> a

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
seven 43 7 100 4 10 31 I'll make up a

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.349 
seven 43 7 100 4 10 31 I'll make up a
seven<00:02:20.250> I<00:02:20.519> make<00:02:21.420> up<00:02:21.569> a<00:02:21.660> seven<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.709> 14<00:02:23.370> 12<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
seven I make up a seven with 14 12 and

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.920 
seven I make up a seven with 14 12 and
11<00:02:24.569> it's<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> binary<00:02:25.950> number<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.299> if<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> number

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
11 it's a binary number so if the number

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.770 
11 it's a binary number so if the number
it<00:02:28.019> has<00:02:28.170> two<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.650> zero<00:02:28.799> in<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.549> it<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.690> be

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
it has two to the zero in it it will be

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.400 
it has two to the zero in it it will be
in<00:02:30.930> here<00:02:30.959> to<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.890> 0<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.310> equal<00:02:32.549> to<00:02:32.819> 1<00:02:33.230> 2<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.260> the

the<00:02:45.720> fed<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.519> 32<00:02:48.680> okay<00:02:49.680> so<00:02:50.220> five<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.609> number<00:02:50.700> 7

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
the fed is 32 okay so five in number 7

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:52.970 
the fed is 32 okay so five in number 7
i'm<00:02:51.419> looking<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.840> here<00:02:52.200> what's<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.799> largest

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
i'm looking up here what's the largest

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.390 
i'm looking up here what's the largest
ever<00:02:53.340> that<00:02:53.609> will<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.819> into<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.560> before<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.370> i

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
ever that will go into it before so i

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.180 
ever that will go into it before so i
have<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.669> positive<00:02:56.940> for<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> 4<00:02:57.980> after<00:02:58.980> having

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
have a positive for a 4 after having

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.550 
have a positive for a 4 after having
four<00:02:59.519> and<00:02:59.940> a<00:02:59.970> half<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.239> two<00:03:00.480> then<00:03:00.930> i<00:03:01.079> have<00:03:01.169> a<00:03:01.200> one

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
four and a half of two then i have a one

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:06.170 
four and a half of two then i have a one
that<00:03:02.099> gives<00:03:02.310> me<00:03:02.489> 4<00:03:02.790> plus<00:03:03.030> 2<00:03:03.060> plus<00:03:03.799> 17<00:03:05.030> make<00:03:06.030> up

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that gives me 4 plus 2 plus 17 make up

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.050 
that gives me 4 plus 2 plus 17 make up
the<00:03:06.299> number<00:03:06.569> 57<00:03:07.340> what's<00:03:08.340> the<00:03:08.430> largest<00:03:08.609> numbers

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the number 57 what's the largest numbers

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.770 
the number 57 what's the largest numbers
i'll<00:03:09.209> go<00:03:09.359> into<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:10.040> 32<00:03:11.090> then<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.299> 16<00:03:12.810> is<00:03:13.079> 48<00:03:14.780> 48

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780

to<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.620> a<00:03:47.770> I<00:03:48.250> think<00:03:48.670> that's<00:03:48.790> considered<00:03:49.210> a<00:03:49.330> bit

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
to the a I think that's considered a bit

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.690 
to the a I think that's considered a bit
a<00:03:49.690> memory<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.620> then<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.920> thousand<00:03:51.460> of<00:03:51.550> those

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
a memory and then the thousand of those

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.040 
a memory and then the thousand of those
were<00:03:52.030> bite<00:03:53.430> make<00:03:54.430> sense<00:03:54.670> a<00:03:54.790> question<00:03:55.180> sir<00:03:55.300> so

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
were bite make sense a question sir so

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.930 
were bite make sense a question sir so
if<00:03:56.170> I<00:03:56.260> have<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.410> number<00:03:56.650> like<00:03:57.840> 38<00:03:58.980> well<00:03:59.980> 32<00:04:00.790> will

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
if I have a number like 38 well 32 will

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.970 
if I have a number like 38 well 32 will
go<00:04:01.060> into<00:04:01.240> that<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.830> 16<00:04:02.830> we've<00:04:03.100> got<00:04:04.320> 32<00:04:05.320> this<00:04:05.860> is

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
go into that a 16 we've got 32 this is

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.070 
go into that a 16 we've got 32 this is
negative<00:04:06.340> 40<00:04:06.730> so<00:04:06.880> da<00:04:07.180> being<00:04:07.480> here<00:04:08.490> 32<00:04:09.720> plus<00:04:10.720> 4

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
negative 40 so da being here 32 plus 4

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.250 
negative 40 so da being here 32 plus 4
plus<00:04:11.550> 2<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:14.520> 38<00:04:15.520> so<00:04:16.330> that's<00:04:16.510> how<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.720> write<00:04:17.110> it

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
plus 2 is 38 so that's how I write it

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
plus 2 is 38 so that's how I write it
thru<00:04:17.440> da<00:04:19.260> any<00:04:20.260> questions<00:04:20.700> it's<00:04:21.700> kind<00:04:21.820> of

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
thru da any questions it's kind of

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.450 
thru da any questions it's kind of
interesting<00:04:22.120> huh
