00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
there's so many things that you can clip
onto<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.630> stuck<00:01:33.930> too<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.290> in<00:01:34.619> addition

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.319 
onto and get stuck too and in addition
to<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> don't<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.490> any<00:01:35.670> jug<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.150> one

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to that you don't have any jug so one

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.690 
to that you don't have any jug so one
mistake<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.320> are<00:01:37.590> toast<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.460> is

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
mistake and you are toast it is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.340

this is one of your few training options
good<00:01:45.060> luck<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:46.079> fifth<00:01:46.470> hardest<00:01:46.920> train<00:01:47.159> of<00:01:47.310> all

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
good luck the fifth hardest train of all

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.120 
good luck the fifth hardest train of all
time<00:01:47.640> in<00:01:47.820> my<00:01:47.939> opinion<00:01:48.090> was<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.930> Duriez<00:01:49.619> power

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
time in my opinion was the Duriez power

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.550 
time in my opinion was the Duriez power
room<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.509> place<00:01:51.720> wasn't<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.259> meant

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
room now this place wasn't really meant

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.770 
room now this place wasn't really meant
to<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:53.009> a<00:01:53.250> training<00:01:53.759> area<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:54.329> many<00:01:54.600> other

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
to be a training area like many other

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.719 
to be a training area like many other
training<00:01:55.200> areas<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.680> zombies<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.369> was<00:01:56.490> one

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
training areas in zombies but it was one

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
training areas in zombies but it was one
of<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.880> larger<00:01:57.210> courtyards<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.719> what<00:01:57.869> people

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
of the larger courtyards and what people

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.410 
of the larger courtyards and what people
do<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.950> naturally<00:01:59.490> start<00:01:59.700> training<00:02:00.240> here

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
do is they naturally start training here

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.080 
do is they naturally start training here
but<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.079> difficult<00:02:01.619> train<00:02:02.310> there<00:02:02.880> are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
but this is a difficult train there are

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.910 
but this is a difficult train there are
so<00:02:03.450> many<00:02:03.630> things<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> can<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.290> wrong<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.829> this

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
so many things that can go wrong in this

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.800 
so many things that can go wrong in this
area<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.549> because<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.119> zombies<00:02:06.479> sort<00:02:06.719> of

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
area and because the zombies sort of

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.570 
area and because the zombies sort of
funnel<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.320> from<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:08.009> door

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
funnel in from that one door

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.969 
funnel in from that one door
then<00:02:09.030> they<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.750> sort<00:02:09.960> of<00:02:10.110> spew<00:02:10.619> in<00:02:10.770> like<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
then they just sort of spew in like a

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.860 
then they just sort of spew in like a
constant<00:02:11.580> line<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.000> that<00:02:12.060> line<00:02:12.120> can<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.600> hard

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
constant line and that line can be hard

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.510 
constant line and that line can be hard
to<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.110> around<00:02:13.290> no<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.530> course<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.160> can<00:02:14.280> open

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
to get around no of course you can open

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.890 
to get around no of course you can open
up<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.730> door<00:02:14.790> back<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.180> but<00:02:15.540> then<00:02:15.660> that'll

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
up that door back there but then that'll

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.020 
up that door back there but then that'll
just<00:02:16.050> open<00:02:16.350> up<00:02:16.410> more<00:02:16.620> areas<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.220> spawn<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.940> a

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
just open up more areas to spawn it's a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.760 
just open up more areas to spawn it's a
pretty<00:02:18.240> difficult<00:02:18.510> area<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.020> train<00:02:19.350> this<00:02:19.560> map

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
pretty difficult area to train this map

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.200 
pretty difficult area to train this map
is<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.040> hard<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.280> training<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:20.790> most<00:02:20.970> people

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
is so hard to training that most people

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.670 
is so hard to training that most people
just<00:02:21.240> end<00:02:21.540> up<00:02:21.630> running<00:02:21.780> routes<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.410> reach<00:02:22.440> the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
just end up running routes to reach the

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.890 
just end up running routes to reach the
high<00:02:22.830> rounds<00:02:23.250> coming<00:02:24.060> into<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.510> number<00:02:24.720> four

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
high rounds coming into the number four

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.560 
high rounds coming into the number four
spot<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> nuketown<00:02:26.250> backyard<00:02:27.120> now<00:02:27.300> I'm

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
spot is the nuketown backyard now I'm

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.630 
spot is the nuketown backyard now I'm
referring<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.320> backyard<00:02:28.530> by<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.100> yellow

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
referring to the backyard by the yellow

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.370 
referring to the backyard by the yellow
house<00:02:29.880> there's<00:02:30.480> something<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.080> train

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
house there's something about this train

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.560 
house there's something about this train
that<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.560> much<00:02:31.830> harder<00:02:32.370> than<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.000> training

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
that is much harder than the training

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.900 
that is much harder than the training
spot<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.080> other<00:02:34.230> end<00:02:34.500> of<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.800> map<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.220> think

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
spot on the other end of the map I think

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.490 
spot on the other end of the map I think
it's<00:02:36.090> because<00:02:36.270> we<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:36.990> little<00:02:37.200> gap

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
it's because we have this little gap

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's because we have this little gap
right<00:02:37.710> here<00:02:37.770> between<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.580> furnace<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.150> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
right here between the furnace and the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.450 
right here between the furnace and the
bush<00:02:39.780> you're<00:02:40.290> always<00:02:40.770> going<00:02:41.070> through<00:02:41.310> this

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
bush you're always going through this

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.190 
bush you're always going through this
one<00:02:41.730> little<00:02:42.060> section<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.660> if<00:02:42.780> two<00:02:42.960> zombies

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
one little section and if two zombies

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.380 
one little section and if two zombies
get<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.650> your<00:02:43.800> way<00:02:43.920> good<00:02:44.550> luck<00:02:44.790> getting<00:02:45.000> out<00:02:45.240> of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
get in your way good luck getting out of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.250 
get in your way good luck getting out of
there<00:02:45.510> you're<00:02:45.660> going<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.050> turn

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
there you're going to have to turn

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.449 
there you're going to have to turn
around<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.680> hopefully<00:02:46.830> there<00:02:47.130> aren't<00:02:47.280> too

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
around and hopefully there aren't too

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.640 
around and hopefully there aren't too
many<00:02:47.490> zombies<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.209> other<00:02:48.420> way<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:49.050> then<00:02:49.440> in

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
many zombies that other way and then in

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.590 
many zombies that other way and then in
addition<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.790> other<00:02:50.970> area<00:02:51.390> you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
addition to that the other area you

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.180 
addition to that the other area you
might<00:02:51.750> slip<00:02:52.020> through<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.410> between<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.010> house

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
might slip through is between the house

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.740 
might slip through is between the house
and<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.459> deck<00:02:53.700> which<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.000> also<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.420> pretty

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and the deck which is also a pretty

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.960 
and the deck which is also a pretty
tight<00:02:55.020> area<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.650> your<00:02:56.160> paths<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.790> have

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
tight area so your paths that you have

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.820 
tight area so your paths that you have
to<00:02:57.090> go<00:02:57.209> through<00:02:57.540> are<00:02:57.720> constricted<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.530> very

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
to go through are constricted and very

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.680

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
narrow and this makes for very difficult

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.720 
narrow and this makes for very difficult
training<00:03:00.900> especially<00:03:01.230> with<00:03:01.980> such<00:03:02.220> chaotic

is<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.700> dories<00:03:06.390> garage<00:03:07.050> now<00:03:07.620> I<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:07.920> know

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
is the dories garage now I don't know

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.800 
is the dories garage now I don't know
why<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.520> area<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.150> such<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.510> difficult

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
why this area is such a difficult

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.720 
why this area is such a difficult
training<00:03:10.200> spot<00:03:10.530> but<00:03:10.800> it<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.010> for<00:03:11.250> me<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:11.400> always

this<00:03:13.500> area<00:03:13.560> like<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.220> said<00:03:14.459> the<00:03:15.120> main<00:03:15.330> way

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
this area like I said the main way

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.970 
this area like I said the main way
people<00:03:15.870> get<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.140> high<00:03:16.350> routes<00:03:16.590> is<00:03:16.800> by

people get to the high routes is by

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.620 
people get to the high routes is by
running<00:03:17.280> routes<00:03:17.489> because<00:03:17.730> they<00:03:18.269> found<00:03:18.540> that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
running routes because they found that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.180 
running routes because they found that
training<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.530> too<00:03:19.739> unpredictable

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190

injuries<00:03:21.000> there<00:03:21.269> isn't<00:03:21.570> really<00:03:21.690> a<00:03:21.840> nice

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
training spot with the barrels and then

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.080 
training spot with the barrels and then
the<00:03:25.560> difficult<00:03:26.280> spawns<00:03:26.610> because<00:03:26.880> you<00:03:26.970> have

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
the difficult spawns because you have

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.220 
the difficult spawns because you have
the<00:03:27.239> zombies<00:03:27.540> coming<00:03:27.750> down<00:03:27.959> from<00:03:28.140> the

the zombies coming down from the

the zombies coming down from the
staircase<00:03:28.680> and<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:28.950> haven't<00:03:29.220> coming<00:03:29.459> through

the<00:03:29.850> door<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.870> makes<00:03:31.050> for<00:03:31.200> an<00:03:31.380> all-around

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
the door it just makes for an all-around

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.130 
the door it just makes for an all-around
unpleasurable<00:03:32.459> training<00:03:33.209> experience<00:03:33.959> I

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
unpleasurable training experience I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.110 
unpleasurable training experience I
don't<00:03:35.010> really<00:03:35.280> like<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.550> train<00:03:35.730> in<00:03:35.910> here<00:03:36.090> I

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
don't really like the train in here I

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759 
don't really like the train in here I
only<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.570> when<00:03:36.780> I<00:03:36.840> have<00:03:37.080> to<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.410> find<00:03:37.680> it

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
only do it when I have to and I find it

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.350 
only do it when I have to and I find it
to<00:03:37.800> be<00:03:37.860> fairly<00:03:38.250> difficult<00:03:38.550> but<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.330> just

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
to be fairly difficult but that just

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.170 
to be fairly difficult but that just
might<00:03:39.630> be<00:03:39.720> my<00:03:39.870> opinion<00:03:40.290> here<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:41.400> second

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
might be my opinion here the second

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.420 
might be my opinion here the second
hardest<00:03:42.480> training<00:03:43.080> spot<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:43.530> all<00:03:43.800> of<00:03:43.830> zombies

hardest training spot in all of zombies

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.120 
hardest training spot in all of zombies

boys this place too tough to train and

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.960 
boys this place too tough to train and
it's<00:03:49.620> your<00:03:49.860> only<00:03:50.040> option<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.790> want<00:03:50.940> a

it get tough the spawns in this room are

it get tough the spawns in this room are

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
is this place hard to train in we have

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.220 
is this place hard to train in we have
three<00:04:38.460> lanes<00:04:38.730> created<00:04:39.210> by<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.390> tables<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.080> as

three lanes created by the tables and as
a<00:04:40.260> result<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:41.100> funnels<00:04:41.700> you<00:04:41.940> and<00:04:42.240> the<00:04:42.480> zombies

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
really a wonder weapon that will easily

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.780 
really a wonder weapon that will easily
clear<00:04:48.630> your<00:04:48.810> path<00:04:49.050> so<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:49.830> have<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.340> be<00:04:50.460> very

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
clear your path so you have to be very

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.700 
clear your path so you have to be very
wise<00:04:51.240> with<00:04:51.600> your<00:04:51.630> training<00:04:52.200> you<00:04:52.290> have<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.560> know

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
wise with your training you have to know

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.680 
wise with your training you have to know
how<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:52.950> train<00:04:53.340> without<00:04:53.850> getting<00:04:54.360> yourself

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
how to train without getting yourself

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.300 
how to train without getting yourself
blocked<00:04:54.960> into<00:04:55.380> different<00:04:55.680> areas<00:04:55.770> because<00:04:56.190> you

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
blocked into different areas because you

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.520 
blocked into different areas because you
just<00:04:56.520> are<00:04:56.700> so<00:04:56.790> confined<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.840> this<00:04:57.960> tight<00:04:58.200> space

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
just are so confined to this tight space

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.230 
just are so confined to this tight space
now<00:04:58.770> I've<00:04:59.160> seen<00:04:59.400> people<00:04:59.520> trained<00:04:59.880> in<00:04:59.910> this

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
now I've seen people trained in this

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.790 
now I've seen people trained in this
area<00:05:00.660> into<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.050> late<00:05:01.230> hundreds<00:05:01.650> sometimes

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
area into the late hundreds sometimes

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.010 
area into the late hundreds sometimes
even<00:05:02.280> as<00:05:02.400> close<00:05:02.520> two<00:05:03.060> hundred<00:05:03.600> but<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.870> thing

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
even as close two hundred but the thing

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.050 
even as close two hundred but the thing
is<00:05:04.050> they're<00:05:04.620> always<00:05:04.890> using<00:05:05.490> a<00:05:05.580> pack<00:05:05.760> a<00:05:05.790> punch

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
is they're always using a pack a punch

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.240 
is they're always using a pack a punch
crossbow<00:05:06.570> which<00:05:06.900> means<00:05:07.170> the<00:05:07.500> only<00:05:07.770> way<00:05:08.220> people

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250

find<00:05:08.820> that<00:05:08.910> this<00:05:09.450> room<00:05:09.630> is<00:05:09.660> actually

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
find that this room is actually

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.050 
find that this room is actually
manageable<00:05:10.620> for<00:05:10.650> training<00:05:11.220> is<00:05:11.340> when<00:05:11.910> they

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
manageable for training is when they

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.210 
manageable for training is when they
have<00:05:12.330> several<00:05:13.230> monkey<00:05:13.560> bombs<00:05:13.770> at<00:05:13.980> their

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
have several monkey bombs at their

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.370 
have several monkey bombs at their
disposal<00:05:14.550> most<00:05:15.120> training<00:05:15.540> spots<00:05:15.780> do<00:05:16.050> not

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
disposal most training spots do not

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.800 
disposal most training spots do not
require<00:05:16.860> 10<00:05:17.610> monkey<00:05:17.940> bombs<00:05:18.120> at<00:05:18.330> your<00:05:18.510> disposal

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
require 10 monkey bombs at your disposal

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.920 
require 10 monkey bombs at your disposal
at<00:05:19.140> all<00:05:19.230> times<00:05:19.310> this<00:05:20.310> place<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:21.210> difficult

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
at all times this place is so difficult

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.350 
at all times this place is so difficult
to<00:05:22.410> train<00:05:22.740> in<00:05:23.040> it<00:05:23.220> forces<00:05:23.790> people<00:05:23.820> to<00:05:24.090> play

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
to train in it forces people to play

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.330 
to train in it forces people to play
differently<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.080> forces<00:05:25.530> people<00:05:25.650> that<00:05:26.190> have

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
differently you forces people that have

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.940 
differently you forces people that have
to<00:05:26.490> give<00:05:26.760> up<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.240> weapon<00:05:27.450> slot<00:05:27.900> so<00:05:28.560> that<00:05:28.830> they

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
to give up a weapon slot so that they

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.730 
to give up a weapon slot so that they
can<00:05:29.130> have<00:05:29.370> the<00:05:29.610> crossbow<00:05:30.270> I<00:05:30.540> think<00:05:31.200> this<00:05:31.680> is

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
can have the crossbow I think this is

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.740 
can have the crossbow I think this is
probably<00:05:32.010> one<00:05:32.640> of<00:05:32.670> the<00:05:32.820> hardest<00:05:33.210> places<00:05:33.480> to

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
probably one of the hardest places to

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.800 
probably one of the hardest places to
train<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:34.290> all<00:05:34.620> of<00:05:35.010> zombies<00:05:35.640> anyway<00:05:36.630> that's

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
