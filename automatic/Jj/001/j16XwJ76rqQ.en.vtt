00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.360 
was getting more value for money let's
put<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.520> way<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.930> had<00:00:48.930> like<00:00:49.370> well

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
put it that way I had like well

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.760 
put it that way I had like well
brilliant<00:00:50.969> views<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.050> course<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
brilliant views of that and of course it

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.010 
brilliant views of that and of course it
had<00:00:52.920> stadium<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.850> was<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.960> of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
had stadium in it which was it kind of

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
had stadium in it which was it kind of
balanced<00:00:55.530> out<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.649> map<00:00:55.920> pack<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> whole

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
balanced out the map pack as a whole

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.540 
balanced out the map pack as a whole
because<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:57.390> first<00:00:57.660> map<00:00:57.930> pack<00:00:58.199> was<00:00:58.379> very<00:00:59.340> much

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because the first map pack was very much

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.299 
because the first map pack was very much
on<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> side<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.059> free<00:01:00.539> large<00:01:00.899> maps<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.649> one

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
on the side of free large maps and one

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.179 
on the side of free large maps and one
medium<00:01:02.879> small<00:01:03.090> map<00:01:03.420> with<00:01:03.600> Stadium<00:01:04.070> which<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
medium small map with Stadium which I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.260 
medium small map with Stadium which I
didn't<00:01:05.430> think<00:01:05.460> was<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:06.060> way<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
didn't think was the right way to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
didn't think was the right way to
balance<00:01:06.510> because<00:01:06.840> cooler<00:01:07.080> juhi<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:08.040> me<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
balance because cooler juhi to me is a

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.899 
balance because cooler juhi to me is a
fast-paced<00:01:09.390> frenetic<00:01:10.229> FPS<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.729> why

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
fast-paced frenetic FPS and this is why

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.580 
fast-paced frenetic FPS and this is why
it's<00:01:11.970> love<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.049> why<00:01:13.229> it's<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.560> popular

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
it's love this is why it's so popular

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
it's love this is why it's so popular
and<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.729> why<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.939> makes<00:01:15.150> good<00:01:15.390> youtube

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and this is why it makes good youtube

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
and this is why it makes good youtube
videos<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.590> or<00:01:16.680> less<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> action

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
videos more or less it's just the action

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.539 
videos more or less it's just the action
is<00:01:18.150> really<00:01:18.600> super<00:01:19.200> fast<00:01:19.560> paced<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.100> treyarch

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
is really super fast paced and treyarch

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.499 
is really super fast paced and treyarch
must<00:01:21.299> know<00:01:21.600> what<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.439> maps<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:23.509> people

these<00:01:44.070> maps<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:44.909> much<00:01:45.439> more<00:01:46.439> to<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
these maps like so much more to the

these maps like so much more to the
point<00:01:46.939> why<00:01:47.939> can't<00:01:48.270> treyarch<00:01:48.840> figure<00:01:49.229> that<00:01:49.409> out

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
point why can't treyarch figure that out

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.550 
point why can't treyarch figure that out
because<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.810> collect<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.079> these<00:01:52.290> that's

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
because they collect all these that's

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.080 
because they collect all these that's
all<00:01:52.740> tongue<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> mean<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.610> you're<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.880> lobby

all tongue I mean when you're in a lobby

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
all tongue I mean when you're in a lobby

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you see these stats running across the

you see these stats running across the

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
all this stuff and of course they've

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.780 
all this stuff and of course they've
released<00:02:02.610> like<00:02:03.380> figures<00:02:04.380> like<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.189> top<00:02:05.490> three

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
released like figures like the top three

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.819 
released like figures like the top three
most<00:02:06.060> used<00:02:06.450> weapons<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.140> that<00:02:07.320> before<00:02:07.680> in

most used weapons and all that before in
the<00:02:07.920> past<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.970> all<00:02:09.239> these<00:02:09.450> stats

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
the past so they have all these stats

the past so they have all these stats
that<00:02:10.020> go<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.349> making<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:11.270> however

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that go about making the game however

that go about making the game however
when<00:02:12.360> they<00:02:12.510> seem<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:12.720> make<00:02:12.930> map<00:02:13.290> pack

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
when they seem to make map pack

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.840 
when they seem to make map pack
they<00:02:14.440> seem<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.710> take<00:02:15.070> this<00:02:15.220> approach<00:02:15.520> of

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
they seem to take this approach of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.810 
they seem to take this approach of
quality<00:02:16.600> over<00:02:16.960> quantity<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.680> I'll<00:02:18.430> kind<00:02:18.760> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
quality over quantity and I'll kind of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.370 
quality over quantity and I'll kind of
explain<00:02:18.940> what<00:02:19.450> I<00:02:19.510> mean<00:02:19.540> by<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.900> analogy

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
explain what I mean by that analogy

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.690 
explain what I mean by that analogy
because<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.800> probably<00:02:20.920> not<00:02:21.220> meant<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
because it's probably not meant in the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.390 
because it's probably not meant in the
exact<00:02:22.150> way<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.810> it<00:02:22.930> sounds<00:02:23.470> they<00:02:24.130> seem<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
exact way that it sounds they seem to

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.310 
exact way that it sounds they seem to
make<00:02:24.670> all<00:02:24.910> these<00:02:25.060> maps<00:02:25.330> Ali's<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:26.230> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
make all these maps Ali's with the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.280 
make all these maps Ali's with the
escalation<00:02:27.100> DLC<00:02:27.490> they<00:02:27.610> made<00:02:27.850> for<00:02:28.270> large<00:02:28.900> maps

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
escalation DLC they made for large maps

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.590 
escalation DLC they made for large maps
and<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.980> think<00:02:30.250> that's<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.580> massive<00:02:30.970> issue<00:02:31.300> this

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
and I think that's a massive issue this

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.350 
and I think that's a massive issue this
isn't<00:02:31.930> battlefield<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:33.280> isn't<00:02:33.610> home<00:02:33.910> front

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
this is call of duty and call of duty is
