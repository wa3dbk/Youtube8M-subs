00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.039 
is the top it is just a bandeau striped
and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.850> this<00:01:54.240> is<00:01:54.390> kind<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> looks<00:01:54.810> funny

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
and then it this is kind of looks funny

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.530 
and then it this is kind of looks funny
right<00:01:55.170> now<00:01:55.409> but<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.700> tie<00:01:56.939> with<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.390> the

right now but it's a tie with like the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.709 
right now but it's a tie with like the
multi<00:01:57.869> colors<00:01:58.079> on<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:59.149> when<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.240> put<00:02:00.450> it<00:02:00.570> in<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
multi colors on it when you put it in a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.910 
multi colors on it when you put it in a
bow<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.500> looks<00:02:01.740> better<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:03.500> it's<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.710> thigh

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
bow it looks better so it's like thigh

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.950 
bow it looks better so it's like thigh
or<00:02:05.280> usually<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.880> don't<00:02:05.969> even<00:02:06.299> something<00:02:06.509> cuz<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
or usually I don't even something cuz it

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.440 
or usually I don't even something cuz it
kind<00:02:07.200> of<00:02:07.259> does<00:02:07.409> look<00:02:07.619> funny<00:02:07.920> but<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.149> whole

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
kind of does look funny but the whole

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.360 
kind of does look funny but the whole
point<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.989> it<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.319> so<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.590> see<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> colors

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
point of it is so you see the colors

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.200 
point of it is so you see the colors
because<00:02:11.700> this<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
because this is

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.080 
because this is

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
matching bonds to it believe it or not

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.790 
matching bonds to it believe it or not
but<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:15.360> just<00:02:15.600> has<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.140> cool<00:02:16.410> design<00:02:16.620> on
