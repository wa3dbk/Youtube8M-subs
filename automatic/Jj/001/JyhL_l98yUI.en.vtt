Cut towards the opponent's court
This is but it is common

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.549
In I also youtube videos
Many times in the better of Wisdom

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.090
In How to cut under rotation
Racket of surface

I'll give you this kind of how to cut
That Tteyuu

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.430
The Are You cut of Japanese
In how to cut of China players

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.450
Rather than an anti-
In fact the tip of the racket

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.450
And here is by horizontal'm not
Better off you'll be the next to vertical

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.379
Chinese players
It is cut lower rotation

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.840
It is this kind of cut people
And I mean expire in Ekore

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.480
Feel I think you a little
At first

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.760
Cut Eko
But it is this swing

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.650
By the tip of the racket vertically
Cut doing this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.790
Of here
This is Japan players beside

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.749
Chinese players vertical
There is a difference Tteyuu

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.579
Wei Qingguang san
When you turn off the lower rotary

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.510
Doing this like a Japanese player
Rather than do cut in the transverse

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.909
I am now off to vertical
Of rehearsal with me

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.139
Mr. Era-seki of Saab
Although I understand when someone look

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:59.379
I contains this
Once you have from our Japanese players

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.839
In this off the camera
I think you sense that it is not cut

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:05.549
Once you have a vertical
Can not be applied so strongly

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.150
I feel that would out with a pan
There will

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.889
We Japanese
Such off the camera

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.379
By the racket in the transverse
Doing this

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.489
I rub the bottom of the ball
This is Japan players

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.029
Since well doing that
I bet here of rotation

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.499
Feeling very
Well developed

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:23.499
So this kind of rubbing way
I can really

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:29.469
Rub But also our way in a vertical
Such rubbing way

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:30.989
From when small
But it is not doing

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.189
I am not doing at all
I also rub this way is usually

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.689
Since not do at all
So is there is no sense

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:39.089
sense to apply is no
So rotation of here

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:41.379
Is not to apply
Here under rotation

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.889
Takes
But under the Koch rotation

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.889
It 's such does not take any
It has become to feel

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.790
And the interesting to the contrary,
China players

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.349
Conversely, Japanese players
How to cut the lower rotation Saab

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.479
Tteyuu'll not be able to be difficult
I heard a story

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.719
So this in reverse
I'd like difficult

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:02.069
Chinese players
Ball susceptible

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.599
Also the Tteyuu
There may be

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.739
How to make the lower rotation that was next to
When was this

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.669
Is likely to be higher
The rotation will take

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.669
In a little shallow
Since high tends

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.599
Maybe would hit
I do not know

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.789
So Tteyuu difficult
You may become the story

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.780
After entering in here vertical
Is better to put the lower rotary

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.870
Entering low as still deeply
Something like slide

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.370
Since entering
Better of here

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.240
Tama-shitsu basis to the odious to be the
Might

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.189
If you are the kind of story
Because such a result came out

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:38.409
It is was a great and interesting story
Toka Haoshai players

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:40.659
Also Chinese players
Doing this

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.159
When you get the lower rotary Serve
When guy of youtube videos

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:45.500
This is
I think I have not cut down

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.349
I'm'm entered in the vertical
I'm lacking in vertical

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:52.389
In it is difficult to understand the change
It 's is that Tteyuu

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.060
Is a change into a vertical
Or hard to understand

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.060
Deep in the opponent's court
Enter under rotation anti

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.569
It becomes situation Tteyuu
Or Which is the nice

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.539
I'm not sure
Under rotation of the Chinese players

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.689
I go in here vertical
Tip

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:11.840
I'm facing the opponent's court
This is cut more

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.689
The Japanese here
Chinese here

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.409
Tteyuu feeling of
There was a difference

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.789
The interesting kinda
I'm deep feelings

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:23.789
Also Chinese players
0523 players also

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:25.930
Also how to cut under rotation Serve
Little vertical ish

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.129
Then you have entered solidified
In a well to see if this surface

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:32.560
Japanese off doing this
I'd cut in the transverse

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.289
I mean in such state beside
I'd cut

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:38.770
By this kind of go
Finally I want to vertical

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.659
Chinese players were also had Tteyuu
The vertical Finally, while the transverse

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.520
From the first vertical players
Chinese players

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.729
I was there two patterns
So from the side in a vertical

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.479
Or'll give you
Or issue under vertical only

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:54.900
The Chinese players that Tteyuu
It were many

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.729
That get to know
Today I think amazing important Kana

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:00.969
Though I can not be technically
To try to tell you

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:03.430
I think I was
Among everyone

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.909
When you issue Serve
And not just put out the same under rotation

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.219
I was the vertical
'S not only next to the

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:15.219
Under rotation Saab was the vertical
When'll doing such

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.229
It may be more effective for
Many times doing this

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.610
To practice alone
As can be multiplied by the vertical

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.990
I am also now in practice
You are doing this now

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.990
I bet in a vertical
And then I thought also serve

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.150
Someday, such as Chinese players
The lower rotation Serve

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.990
The kana not you put out
You are doing while I think

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.249
Still a little today
Be practiced

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:43.639
Is not a level
Hey everyone it

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.840
To try
That wanna got

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.319
I tried out the video in feeling
Come everyone

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.099
The vertically racket
The tip over there

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:56.300
In the state towards the opponent's court
How to cut of this kind under rotation

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.740
Please try go out
That this time interesting

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.590
Because we understand
Everyone

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.400
How to cut the lower rotation Serve
How to cut the Chinese opening

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.289
Such as how to cut the Japanese style
By selectively used consciously

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.029
The asked to trie
Under rotation serve more

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.979
The kana width is spread
I think you

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:17.389
I also have a special training from now
I will wear

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:19.639
And then one more time
Want to put out a video of the technology

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.399
I think you
THANK YOU
