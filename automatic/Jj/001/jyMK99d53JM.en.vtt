00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.930
 Hello everyone in this cremona video in 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.250
 particular we will create a new gym 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.910
 with enough properties 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.910
 particular 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 let's see how to proceed to create this 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.619
 fashion to create our crossbow 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.550
 we will use as a graphic element of 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.900
 base the bow the PNG and the bow you can 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.210
 found in the installation directory 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.970
 of your enrique simply behind 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.970
 looking blue I starred everything by law 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.210
 once the image is found in the arc 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.290
 place it in a live video 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.640
 your choice and then proceed 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.750
 change it to a photo editor 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.090
 as always I will use paint.net one 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.680
 once the image is opened we increase the 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.280
 zoom level in such a way 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.010
 enlarge it as much as possible 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.780
 now we use the selection as you do 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.869
 rectangular and let's select 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.320
 the whole image we press against the former 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.760
 to cut it then control v for 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.680
 remember it kind 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.020
 at this point we could move it 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.100
 let's limit the image to drag it 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.150
 towards the upper left corner in 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.150
 way to get 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.920
 more or less this affection 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.280
 and we have created what will be the 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.500
 main section of our gym 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.200
 now we must proceed by creating 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.759
 the handle 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.950
 to do this we will draw on colors 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.579
 already present in the image using 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.439
 this tool took fright 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.400
 let's click on this brown 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.810
 clear 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.810
 then select the pencil 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.060
 pull 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.060
 a hint of 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.640
 continuing the texture of the image 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.640
 exists 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:19.319
 now using the tool again 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.630
 detects color we go to select the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.770
 Wednesday a little darker 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.780
 we must select my life 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.780
 we complete our handle 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.630
 and here is the image that will make up the 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.340
 our gym 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:41.760
 at this point we can save it 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:44.310
 we'll call it a gym, let's make sure that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.370
 forming a point pmg and click on 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.690
 save 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.489
 let's stop and our former Turkish prota 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.159
 we start the creator and import the 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:59.260
 textures we have just created 

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:59.260
 click on import external texture 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.030
 and let's select the texture 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.340
 of the crossbow we have just created 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:13.270
 gym PNG point as a typology of 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:19.530
 textures we will select item and time 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:24.730
 we create the fashions fashion name of the vault 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.560
 type of mode gun ok let's go to 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.830
 select the texture of ours 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.830
 gym 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.370
 click on next and now set the 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.600
 property of our weapon first and foremost 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:43.390
 the name the game will have but right 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400
 then we select the texture on 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.170
 bullet that our crossbow will go 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.130
 to shoot that will clearly be the 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.990
 arrow this is the number of shots 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:57.540
 available that will have the first crossbow 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:04:01.570
 to break let's take it from 100 to 2000 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.300
 this is the firepower value 1 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.540
 and like that of the bow let's take it 5 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.730
 let's make a very powerful crossbow 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.300
 finally in this field there is the damage that 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.520
 every hit will make on the enemies 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.269
 also in this case we increase 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.930
 considerably bringing it from 5 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.280
 we can leave 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:27.320
 thanks parameters to their default e 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.680
 click on next and here is the section 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:38.949
 forcing to generate the 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:38.949
 our gym we will use a bow 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.110
 together 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.110
 to a fragment of red stone 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.580
 click on next and then on finish 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:55.590
 to start compiling the death 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:58.129
 and now we see our mod ingame 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.830
 we have a bow 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:04.000
 a fragment of red stone 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.000
 and here is our gym 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:25.309
 at this point we can also show 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:29.989
 so far we try our machine like 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:33.399
