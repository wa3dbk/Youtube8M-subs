00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.609
 hi in this video I wanted to show a 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.360
 tutorial for the resolution of cud ruiz 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.759
 of 2 x 2 the method as method of ortega 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.010
 which is quite fast and quite effective 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.789
 well let's cut and this method is what 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.039
 which is to perform 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.490
 the orientation from the layers 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.189
 proposals would be for example I chose 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.599
 this has already given me red or yellow 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.790
 would insert another red yellow though 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.050
 it was not inserted correctly insert 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.120
 another and now another one like that one face 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.040
 that is one color but that this 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 be well and now below the same 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.210
 this to get that I already have here 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.480
 I give here where I would be to raise the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.840
 two blacks like that and now we do not have to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.519
 we would have a good coat on top 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.500
 oriented below another layer well 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:59.280
 oriented and entry once arrived at 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.559
 this point there are only three cases the case 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 where we have a good pair up 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.149
 ordered that it would be like that and below it 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.800
 same a couple of in orderly to 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.050
 solve this would be to leave them both 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.420
 pairs that are well ordered so to the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.399
 back of the cube and then 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:22.220
 we would perform from here around and 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:22.220
 third hugo r 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.680
 this would solve another case of 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.570
 riding 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.190
 and we're going to do the same thing that we 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.960
 leaves almost always usually leave two 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.080
 parents come on let's go here I already have two 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 yellow would be to insert one here and 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.070
 the other by teams I already have a face 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.680
 yellow or black face 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 it would be good if it were all oriented 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.960
 how is your method of orientation and 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.210
 well let's see we return to the same 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.650
 now we have a layer down here under 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.520
 in which we do not have any party 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.409
 done this turn 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.969
 badly done so we have the case of 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.420
 how is this flavors and here 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.740
 up we have a pair a bread made this 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.080
 what you have to do is let yourself go 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 towards the back and from here 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.860
 we would perform 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.010
 r premium 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.540
 or 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.740
 the cousin juice 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.290
 r 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.269
 a cousin and we go down 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.459
 and we would only have one case that almost 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.459
 He never leaves that would be it would not 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.670
 we go there one side here another 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.680
 and we would go up all wrong 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.629
 no pair of fact and work 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.549
 same no profile well done 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.500
 this can be resolved from waters like 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:44.079
 this face and just like 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.579
 We apply from here or from here it 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.650
 it's simpler and this would be just 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:52.180
 perform around 20 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.540
 that's as simple as this 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.670
 basically this method consists of those 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.590
 three cases in getting guidance 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.610
 of two letters for that there are many 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.830
 algorithms 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.420
 of orientation but we do not know 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:12.020
 we could guide this by those below 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:16.700
 for inside to be able like this until 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:19.820
 raise your legs and in case you do not 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.300
 we have none top down that would be 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.040
 around 2 is simpler and the more 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:31.400
 short case are 22 and 2 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:35.450
 others that we have said were 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.290
 this one that would be going to a couple around here and 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.870
 through here below none worth series 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.730
 we have a couple and here under everything 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.400
 ok then I would be leaving for here 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.400
 behind and from here we would do this 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.989
 and it would already be the cube and the other case that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.629
 normally that almost always comes out 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:04:01.810
 the two pairs here and another here 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:04.810
 that would be around and fedor played 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:04.810
 around 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.819
 well done 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.390
 would be to put the two pairs to perform 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:18.989
 so for example we had to see 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.989
 and this here 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.960
 and the same thing a couple here and another one 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.300
 here we leave the two pairs like this one 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.590
 back and we do it around 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.620
 and the c2 could around an error and already 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.900
 it will be only order 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.639
 also after this method for the 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.919
 orientation of the last field because this 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.900
 get a one load of just one 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.880
 color would be very simple because 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:48.460
 have it by not importing the order of 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:52.400
 colors would be just for example 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.190
 yellow and yellow already directly 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.380
 infected 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.389
 and for the orientation of this layer there are 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:02.690
 very good very short algorithms 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.949
 I do not know but what it does to you 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.540
 in that organism is that it guides you in 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.940
 this stage and the one below it moves it 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.860
 then they only contain those organisms 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.210
 for this method I use the 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.449
 jessica's orientation algorithms 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.889
 frydrych of advanced method of 3 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:17.690
 for 3 that also smaller yen is 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:20.479
 perfectly and good from here 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:23.090
 this time we would have up none of 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:24.729
 down here in far would be to put here the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.230
 couple well done here of three from here 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:30.240
 would we have said before 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.210
 with this safe method that can be 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.820
 normally make the cube an average of 7 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.820
 seconds 5 seconds 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.160
 is already in the skill 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.000
 of each one but that the symbols of 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:43.370
 help this method 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.210
 Thank you very much for our visits and 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.210
 see you our video
