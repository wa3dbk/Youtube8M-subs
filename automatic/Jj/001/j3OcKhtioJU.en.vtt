00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 here is protection here is protection on 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.410
 shoulders 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.170
 double protection on the boat why this 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.440
 because outwardly it will go softer and 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.110
 internal rate inside in tough here 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.100
 double elbow protection 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.280
 bets on shoulder protection and back protection 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.720

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.030
 soft elbows and shoulders stiff 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.060
 this is your reflective edging 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.150
 she very much reflects the light then on 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.479
 photos it should be seen that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.950
 concerns the overall quality of the jacket itself here 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.540
 collar stoyechka here thickenings such 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.860

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:52.110
 Velcro with button 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.159
 it was just sticky but how do you know 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.159
 there are not enough stickies for a long time 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.880
 Well, I use a jacket every day 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.980
 so I put another duplicate 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.990
 button like it works whether the cork in 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:08.540
 tandem is very cool and still problems of places 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:10.450
 here is a collar inside are here 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.650
 here's how you see 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:20.000
 inner i kevlar insert 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:22.250
 side of the hand let's say this is a tissue 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.380
 Kinah inserts and perforated leather 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.459
 here is completely at hand with the bottom for 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.610
 so that it is ventilated 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.850
 sold for you to be 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.860
 comfortable here i am now they are open at 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:42.040
 right now how about me and it's hot here 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:43.790
 such ventilation ducts they go 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.420
 rolling sternum 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.070
 in the areas of the substrate let's say 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:52.070
 vent open mesh so well a 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.850
 the speed is very cool blown not 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.080
 I will competently thought up buttons 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:03.489
 Then when on pocket and here pocket two 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:07.720
 small two side pockets estest 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:11.540
 here I will try to show it is still there 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:17.030
 such corrugated leather is called 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.630
 area of ​​the shoulder blades and gaze on the eyelashes in order 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.489
 so that when you pull your hands the steering wheel is leather 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.440
 stretched and you were comfortable or 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:28.340
 for example in the zone further so she you 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.800
 covered with velcro 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.720
 sides regulate the amount of required 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.510
 potali eat by themselves all 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:41.720
 exhibit below too 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.870
 molar below closes another 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.269
 Velcro and thereby hides the slider 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.260
 zippers which usually if velcro is 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.540
 no on a motorcycle jacket 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.330
 then ran from my gas tank rubs 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.390
 scratching paint is a classic of the genre 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.790
 so it’s all been thought out long ago 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.770
 inside now i have winter linings 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:01.180
 there is no here although she stayed at home she 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.900
 Generally there is this jacket and there 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.510
 podstёzhku warm now it's just 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.760
 perforated fabric here is possible and 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.490
 for moto pants wear moto what we 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.170
 in the lumbar zone and do not use but in general 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.290
 here they are two specifically for different 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.130
 machine options and so on as for 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.320
 of protection 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.950
 Well, I think the form you do not see it 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:26.200
 polyurethane foam insert with no 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:29.190
 I will definitely not remember a massive mistake 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.610
 how is it called the material 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.530
 but let's say such a defense here 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.180
 for those who are engaged in camp driven din 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.120
 or other extreme sports 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.740
 Of course, this same does not make up more 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.380
 there are dense aluminum plates and 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.000
 all sorts of different fragile cool but this is already 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.510
 shit screaming sports let's say 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.210
 so i ride with such protection since 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.380
 ride in the city no 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:56.980
 extreme motor sports are not 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.370
 carried away at least for now 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:02.910
 concerns 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.290
 Well, let's start with the fact that there is 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.229
 elongated waist area to the waist 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.490
 when you sit on a motorcycle 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.640
 my back was soft on here 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.350
 specially and such thickening 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.980
 a piece of it is cool so compacted very 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.950
 nicely 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.950
 for back on back there are also zones
