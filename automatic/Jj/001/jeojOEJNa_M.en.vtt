quickly<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.750> were<00:00:42.840> at<00:00:42.930> ni<00:00:43.170> week<00:00:43.410> last<00:00:43.739> year

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
quickly if you were at ni week last year

quickly if you were at ni week last year
I<00:00:44.280> am<00:00:44.430> pretty<00:00:44.730> certain<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.539> remember<00:00:45.960> my

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I am pretty certain that you remember my

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.090 
I am pretty certain that you remember my
quill<00:00:46.379> burger<00:00:48.140> well<00:00:49.140> recently<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:50.010> was

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
quill burger well recently it was

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.130 
quill burger well recently it was
announced<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.670> Optima<00:00:51.210> deca<00:00:51.480> was<00:00:51.750> acquired

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
announced that Optima deca was acquired

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.560 
announced that Optima deca was acquired
by<00:00:52.230> Abbott<00:00:52.680> Labs<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:53.190> 400<00:00:53.850> million<00:00:54.149> dollars

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
by Abbott Labs for 400 million dollars

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.540 
by Abbott Labs for 400 million dollars
so<00:00:55.530> way<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.949> go<00:00:56.100> Mike<00:00:56.430> and<00:01:00.590> he<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.370> here

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so way to go Mike and he would be here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.770 
so way to go Mike and he would be here
but<00:01:02.640> he's<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> beach<00:01:03.180> somewhere<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.690> think

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
but he's on a beach somewhere I think

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.770 
but he's on a beach somewhere I think
but<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.700> financial<00:01:06.299> proof<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
but I think that is financial proof of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
but I think that is financial proof of
the<00:01:07.200> power<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.159> platform<00:01:08.490> based

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the power of this platform based

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.969 
the power of this platform based
approach<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.930> an<00:01:10.049> idea<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.619> market

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
approach to get an idea to market

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.340 
approach to get an idea to market
quickly<00:01:11.450> now<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> platform<00:01:12.810> wouldn't<00:01:13.290> be

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
quickly now this platform wouldn't be

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
quickly now this platform wouldn't be
possible<00:01:13.560> without<00:01:14.100> collaboration<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.450> key

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
possible without collaboration with key

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.080 
possible without collaboration with key
technology<00:01:16.680> suppliers<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.340> industry<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
technology suppliers in the industry and

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.080 
technology suppliers in the industry and
so<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.439> know<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.770> advance<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.610> platform

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
so you know the advance our platform

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.330 
so you know the advance our platform
forward<00:01:21.420> requires<00:01:21.960> underlying<00:01:22.680> innovation

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
forward requires underlying innovation

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.690 
forward requires underlying innovation
and<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.000> processors<00:01:24.740> FPGA<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.130> i/o

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and the processors FPGA and i/o

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
and the processors FPGA and i/o
technologies<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> think<00:01:28.500> it's

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
technologies and so I think it's

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
technologies and so I think it's
appropriate<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.640> ready<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.970> launch<00:01:30.150> a

demonstration<00:02:02.710> I<00:02:03.250> pretty<00:02:03.760> confident<00:02:04.330> our

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
demonstration I pretty confident our

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.060 
demonstration I pretty confident our

with<00:02:06.430> that<00:02:06.580> technology<00:02:06.910> tell<00:02:07.720> us<00:02:07.840> a<00:02:07.870> little

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
with that technology tell us a little

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.389 
with that technology tell us a little
bit<00:02:08.080> more<00:02:08.320> about<00:02:08.440> 7-series<00:02:08.950> kind<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.280> under

allowed<00:02:17.170> us<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.350> lower<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.770> power

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
allowed us to lower the power

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.860 
allowed us to lower the power

they<00:05:31.759> had<00:05:31.879> previously<00:05:32.389> designed<00:05:32.659> this

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
they had previously designed this

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.010 
they had previously designed this
machine<00:05:33.439> with<00:05:34.009> the<00:05:34.159> compact<00:05:34.580> for<00:05:34.849> your<00:05:35.020> 1974

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
machine with the compact for your 1974

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.200 
machine with the compact for your 1974
and<00:05:36.319> with<00:05:36.740> that<00:05:36.979> they<00:05:37.430> were<00:05:37.460> able<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.909> achieve

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
and with that they were able to achieve

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.920 
and with that they were able to achieve
14<00:05:39.139> thousand<00:05:39.650> units<00:05:39.979> per<00:05:40.159> hour<00:05:40.599> with<00:05:41.599> the<00:05:41.719> new

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
14 thousand units per hour with the new

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.890 
14 thousand units per hour with the new
compact<00:05:42.560> for<00:05:42.800> 1968<00:05:43.460> they<00:05:44.389> were<00:05:44.449> able<00:05:44.690> to

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
compact for 1968 they were able to

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.409 
compact for 1968 they were able to
increase<00:05:45.319> the<00:05:45.440> throughput<00:05:45.770> even<00:05:46.550> further<00:05:46.819> to

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
increase the throughput even further to

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.869 
increase the throughput even further to
twenty<00:05:47.900> thousand<00:05:48.409> units<00:05:48.710> per<00:05:48.860> hour<00:05:48.889> so<00:05:49.699> that's

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:49.879 
twenty thousand units per hour so that's

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.790 
twenty thousand units per hour so that's
a<00:05:50.060> 10x<00:05:50.569> performance<00:05:50.780> improvement<00:05:51.620> over

a 10x performance improvement over

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.939 
a 10x performance improvement over
competition<00:05:52.539> so<00:05:53.539> ten<00:05:53.930> extra<00:05:54.259> machine<00:05:54.409> control

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
competition so ten extra machine control

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.280 
competition so ten extra machine control
there<00:05:55.099> you<00:05:55.159> go
