a little bit for for brewing it what I'm

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.390 
a little bit for for brewing it what I'm
going<00:00:10.410> to<00:00:10.440> do<00:00:10.590> here<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.800> I'm<00:00:10.980> just<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.190> to<00:00:11.340> go

going to do here is I'm just going to go
ahead<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.790> apply<00:00:12.120> pressure<00:00:12.570> to<00:00:12.990> the<00:00:13.290> middle

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
ahead and apply pressure to the middle

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.830 
ahead and apply pressure to the middle
and<00:00:13.860> break<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:15.240> tea<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.809> try<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.560> break<00:00:16.830> it

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
and break the tea and try and break it

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.140 
and break the tea and try and break it
there<00:00:18.840> we<00:00:18.930> go<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.470> now<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.430> should<00:00:20.820> be<00:00:20.910> able<00:00:21.000> to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there we go and now I should be able to

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.540 
there we go and now I should be able to
put<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.510> into<00:00:21.810> into<00:00:22.380> my<00:00:22.529> clay<00:00:22.949> storage

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
put this into into my clay storage

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.779 
put this into into my clay storage
vessel<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:25.189> one<00:00:26.189> of<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.340> reasons<00:00:26.670> that

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
vessel here and one of the reasons that

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.109 
vessel here and one of the reasons that
people<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.039> because<00:00:29.160> they<00:00:29.369> say<00:00:29.609> if

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
people do this is because they say if

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.749 
people do this is because they say if
you<00:00:30.929> if<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.590> break<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> T<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.700> and

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
you if you break the T up like this and

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.590 
you if you break the T up like this and
keep<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.600> clay<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.040> drink<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
keep it in the clay before you drink it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.630 
keep it in the clay before you drink it
then<00:00:36.600> it<00:00:36.719> produces<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.380> tea<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.250> little

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
then it produces a tea that's a little

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.819 
then it produces a tea that's a little
bit<00:00:38.760> nicer<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.350> has<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> nicer<00:00:41.850> flavor<00:00:42.829> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
bit nicer and and has a nicer flavor so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.319 
bit nicer and and has a nicer flavor so
we'll<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.040> continue<00:00:44.370> breaking<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.180> tea

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
we'll just continue breaking the tea

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
we'll just continue breaking the tea
here<00:00:46.610> and<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.620> thing<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.070> look<00:00:50.190> for

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
here and and the other thing to look for

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.100 
here and and the other thing to look for
in<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.640> poor<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.750> tell<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
in a poor and you can tell when you

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.439 
in a poor and you can tell when you
break<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:53.520> it's<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.210> same

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
break it is that it's the same

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.060 
break it is that it's the same
throughout<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.420> this<00:00:57.420> T<00:00:57.920> throughout<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
throughout so this this T throughout the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.680 
throughout so this this T throughout the
whole<00:00:59.250> cake<00:00:59.460> it's<00:00:59.730> all<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> same<00:01:00.329> it's<00:01:00.600> all

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
whole cake it's all the same it's all

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.709 
whole cake it's all the same it's all
this<00:01:00.899> ancient<00:01:01.170> tree<00:01:01.590> leaf<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.359> quite

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
this ancient tree leaf so it's quite

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.940 
this ancient tree leaf so it's quite
consistent<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> good<00:01:05.909> sign<00:01:09.950> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
consistent and that's a good sign and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.350 
consistent and that's a good sign and
one<00:01:11.220> more<00:01:11.400> break<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.760> should<00:01:11.909> be<00:01:12.000> able<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.210> get

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
one more break we should be able to get

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.749 
one more break we should be able to get
it<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.630> in<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:14.659> maybe<00:01:15.659> two<00:01:15.960> more<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.580> this

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
it all in the maybe two more and this

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.510 
it all in the maybe two more and this
leaf<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.330> would<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.540> good<00:01:19.470> for<00:01:19.740> making<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.340> pot

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
leaf here would be good for making a pot

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.090 
leaf here would be good for making a pot
of<00:01:20.549> tea<00:01:20.759> right<00:01:20.939> now<00:01:21.350> now<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.799> tea<00:01:22.950> in

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
of tea right now now we have the tea in

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.330 
of tea right now now we have the tea in
and<00:01:23.460> then<00:01:23.970> I'll<00:01:24.060> use<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.270> cork<00:01:24.750> lid<00:01:25.290> so<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.040> will

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
and then I'll use a cork lid so it will

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
and then I'll use a cork lid so it will
be<00:01:26.400> able<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.700> breathe<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:28.310> poor

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
be able to breathe a little bit poor

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.600 
be able to breathe a little bit poor
actually<00:01:29.790> develops<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:31.009> the<00:01:32.009> changes<00:01:32.430> in

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
actually develops through the changes in

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.510 
actually develops through the changes in
humidity<00:01:32.880> so<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.979> C<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.220> going<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
humidity so this this C is going to

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.780 
humidity so this this C is going to
taste<00:01:35.670> different<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.900> winter<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
taste different in the winter or the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.969 
taste different in the winter or the
summer<00:01:39.210> or<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.930> spring<00:01:40.200> as<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.619> seasons

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
summer or the spring as the seasons

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.039 
summer or the spring as the seasons
change<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.780> tea<00:01:42.990> will<00:01:43.170> taste<00:01:43.409> different<00:01:44.070> so

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
change the tea will taste different so

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.289 
change the tea will taste different so
if<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.470> have<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> poor<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.340> taste<00:01:47.909> it<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
if you have a poor and you taste it and

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.230 
if you have a poor and you taste it and
you<00:01:48.420> don't<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.049> tastes<00:01:49.320> now

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
you don't like the way it tastes now

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.719 
you don't like the way it tastes now
just<00:01:51.240> save<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.450> till<00:01:51.810> next<00:01:52.619> summer<00:01:52.950> try<00:01:53.670> it

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
just save it till next summer try it

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.090 
just save it till next summer try it
again<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:55.170> might<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.350> supposedly

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
again and you might be supposedly

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.060 
again and you might be supposedly
surprised<00:01:57.229> and<00:01:58.229> that's<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.500> little<00:01:58.590> bit<00:01:58.829> about

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
surprised and that's a little bit about

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.270 
surprised and that's a little bit about
poor<00:01:59.909> storage
