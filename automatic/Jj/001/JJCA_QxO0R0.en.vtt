00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
that's another good strategy plus the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.339 
that's another good strategy plus the
ability<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.760> change<00:03:20.329> sides<00:03:20.569> is<00:03:20.780> important<00:03:21.230> I

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
ability to change sides is important I

each side to change size on the whistle

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.110 
each side to change size on the whistle
these<00:03:36.049> are<00:03:36.230> all<00:03:36.379> good<00:03:36.650> tactics<00:03:37.129> on<00:03:37.280> stopping

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
these are all good tactics on stopping

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.789 
these are all good tactics on stopping
