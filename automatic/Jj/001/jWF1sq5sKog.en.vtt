00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:31.080
 I'm doing the sun cupcakes today 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.700
 we need 15 grams something 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.309
 everyone wishes like that 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:39.989
 May you more or less then a bit 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.030
 vanilla aroma 60 grams of protein powder 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.030
 cacau banana vanilla whatever 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.489
 Reinhard gram going on I have in the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.250
 but you can attack too 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:56.699
 basel must take whatever war 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.280
 some baking powder in packets over 400 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.379
 gramme magerquark gives six eggs of it 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.680
 her the yolk directly into the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.129
 lean quark the protein that beats everything 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.129
 we on 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:26.360
 Now let's start easy 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:31.210
 with the egg yolk which is the 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.210
 first that gives a uniform mass 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.860
 then here flavors like vanilla pure 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.860
 pure lemon 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.900
 and you can do it perfectly 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:55.390
 protein will take over now 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.700
 whole story also next 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.110
 then baking powder with the manne so gries 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.160
 The people called you can they said so too 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.440
 see something else if so then 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.120
 looks then you are done 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.500
 now I take the tongue out of it 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.210
 the igniter of the magic belongs then go 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.740
 we're not a bit over a third of 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.600
 this whole story here for 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.310
 example and the same 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.510
 of course thought of as such 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.040
 then he will just be the one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.040
 all rest in it 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.640
 so 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.459
 prevent make a uniform 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.740
 and then finally to the very last one 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.410
 the very last problem is your problem 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.120
 choose pure and go why thick 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.340
 Brocken to the end, I explain to you 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.690
 now because of the glue formation if you 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.730
 it would be right at the beginning 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.739
 Immediately live right and so will and 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.870
 It finds a steady mass here 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.290
 The story does not work 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.290
 listen again 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.870
 Next is the whole story 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.160
 a pouch in the optimal case so 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.860
 I wanted the confectioner I'm through 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.200
 my first confectioner of fitness tips 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.489
 and nutritional power and are so one 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.840
 I have to be the head of the sled just like that 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.220
 now that we have our beautiful shape exactly 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.600
 you can of course also expensive metal 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.280
 take shape and must have papers 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.130
 of course, only the whole thing 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.959
 stories do something like that yes 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.459
 so half a little less 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.959
 by baking powder it's all but already 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.959
 a bit high 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.050
 you can do more here 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.870
 Write like that if I find that 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.820
 should do what is tolerated or what I do 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.890
 Eat a little hope that I still 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.510
 cooked or maybe you find 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.930
 can you also then write what 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.370
 I do that well then you can too 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.530
 maybe if you want a few 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.090
 Fruits make apples look good 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.010
 good at fast and healthy 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.110
 carbohydrates and keeps the whole 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.290
 story also a bit fruity, too 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.090
 Do not reckon too much and or you can 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.470
 stop also had to make head and head 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:10.110
 Student food makes it easy 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:11.190
 finished next will be the whole 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.750
 shove history in the oven 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.760
 there is chemistry the whole story 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.830
 it's kind of really deep inside 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.250
 Of course, one as above as me too 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:24.520
 and now we set a 20 minutes 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:26.169
 you will find 20 minutes to the same 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.650
 That's right even if I agree 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.650
 hear 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.820
 so are the that I am now in cologne we 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.520
 do not take for granted 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.260
 put this next for me 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.180
 bit on theories with Peter 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.500
 make couverture superfluous 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.000
 Just over here , something can happen 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.360
 Being covered is no problem at all 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.240
 You can also do that too 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.280
 we athletes do not care that they all 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.600
 think like it really only knows one and 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.220
 so what everything is right not then 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.830
 we could say something on this 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.620
 indulgently good fats for the heart just fine 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.540
 and to the sugar pearls here around the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:13.400
 to top things off what really into the 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.660
 weight falls when too many are approx 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.880
 so next we can of course 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.750
 also the whole story of course 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.590
 decorative decorative 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.950
 we can do the whole story 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.080
 of course also decorative decorate 

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.340
 I stand with my name could 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.680
 Talk show I have a bit 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.260
 Integrity next will be the whole 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.040
 history decorative creative 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.360
 decorate 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:37.550
 I stand with my name comes the 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.050
 that's why the confectioner has integrity 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.820
 I have integrity 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.520
 that would also have to reflect that to you 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.230
 and what we do there rande the 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.240
 exemplary lean curd with about sonys 

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.710
 interrogated believes and makes the cloth 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.050
 easy bananas a rose makes you 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.340
 can now also cut the apple 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.980
 just put it on shows such as here 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:01.190
 such a small rose you can or how 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:04.120
 you learn the kreissprecher fan 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.840
 fortmann also spoke as easy 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.780
 of course, that you learned your profession 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:16.280
 confectioner movement which or are you 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:21.500
 Of course, becker also knows everything here 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.210
 a hood checkout can open quietly 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.520
 also other side and calls no 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.770
 problem 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.479
 then i have a bit of cranberry and 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.510
 rosina resp 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.950
 Johannsberg mixes the cards sold 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.890
 but of course also the highest 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:38.900
 also that we are also natural 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.620
 healthy eating is here also 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.150
 in between is not even time 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.940
 Just throw it on her 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:49.220
 Art is just not as laid as 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.290
 you think so must be professionals all over 

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:54.229
 history in offices and ready 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:07:01.580
 of course, of course, make that expand 

00:06:54.229 --> 00:07:03.950
 like aunt emma yes there you already have 

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:05.750
 made a commitment because he is you are up 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.070
 The confectioner can not bring you that way 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.030
 you can not do that, yes, too 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:15.360
 not had so I've got was 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:18.660
 more variants are still on this 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.220
 put almost nothing on this 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:32.940
 Imagine I failed you 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:35.630
 to thank you even if you just 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.630
 wanted to lose weight
