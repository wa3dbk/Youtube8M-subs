00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
going very well clearly we've never been

going very well clearly we've never been
through<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> process<00:00:29.010> before<00:00:29.400> so<00:00:29.820> we're<00:00:30.000> not

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
through this process before so we're not

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.630 
through this process before so we're not
entirely<00:00:30.510> sure<00:00:30.720> what<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.769> expect<00:00:31.800> from<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
entirely sure what to expect from the

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520 
entirely sure what to expect from the

audit but we've had the football league
visit<00:00:34.980> us<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> they've<00:00:35.880> been<00:00:36.000> impressed<00:00:36.420> with

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
visit us and they've been impressed with

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.660 
visit us and they've been impressed with
what<00:00:36.899> we've<00:00:37.050> put<00:00:37.260> together<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.370> obviously

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
what we've put together and obviously

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310 
what we've put together and obviously
time<00:00:38.940> will<00:00:39.090> tell<00:00:39.329> that<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.960> thing<00:00:40.140> that<00:00:40.170> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
time will tell that the one thing that I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.209 
time will tell that the one thing that I
can<00:00:40.379> be<00:00:40.710> confident<00:00:41.190> about<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.760> well<00:00:42.390> time<00:00:42.930> is

of the essence we do have a genuinely
committed<00:00:46.200> staff<00:00:46.739> base<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.760> they've<00:00:47.910> been

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
committed staff base and they've been

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.369 
committed staff base and they've been
working<00:00:48.210> around<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> clock<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.840> try<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.289> do

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
working around the clock to try and do

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.959 
working around the clock to try and do
their<00:00:49.530> level<00:00:49.770> best<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:50.100> pull<00:00:50.730> everything

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
their level best to pull everything

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.790 
their level best to pull everything
together<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.809> sure<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.260> Academy

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
together and make sure that this Academy

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.130 
together and make sure that this Academy
is<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> absolutely<00:00:54.090> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.239> best<00:00:54.539> foundations

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
is is absolutely on the best foundations

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.229 
is is absolutely on the best foundations
that<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.379> can<00:00:55.590> be<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.489> practice<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.090> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that it can be a little practice all it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.970 
that it can be a little practice all it
recently<00:00:57.629> how<00:00:57.750> did<00:00:57.899> that<00:00:58.079> go<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.649> what<00:00:58.859> are

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
recently how did that go and what are

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.529 
recently how did that go and what are
the<00:00:59.160> timescales<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.820> forward<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.300> your<00:01:00.390> apt

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
the timescales going forward to your apt

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.990 
the timescales going forward to your apt
audit<00:01:00.960> yeah<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.070> practice<00:01:02.489> audit<00:01:02.850> went

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
audit yeah the the practice audit went

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
audit yeah the the practice audit went
very<00:01:03.239> well<00:01:03.390> they<00:01:03.719> came<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.199> they

they were impressed by not only the
amount<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.990> documentation<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.369> had<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
amount of documentation that we had to

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.120 
amount of documentation that we had to
support<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.240> work<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.600> we<00:01:12.659> do<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.020> also<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
support the work that we do but also the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670 
support the work that we do but also the
support<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.180> evidence<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.200> we've<00:01:16.409> got

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
support and evidence that that we've got

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.440 
support and evidence that that we've got
to<00:01:16.860> accompany<00:01:17.100> some<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.850> reasons<00:01:18.119> behind

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
to accompany some of the reasons behind

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.859 
to accompany some of the reasons behind
you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.320> why<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.009> what<00:01:20.040> we<00:01:20.310> do<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.570> terms

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
you know why we do what we do in terms

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.890 
you know why we do what we do in terms
of<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.229> scales<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.830> we've<00:01:23.369> got<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.900> mock

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
of time scales now we've got a mock

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.289 
of time scales now we've got a mock
audit<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> twenty-ninth<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.030> month

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
audit on the twenty-ninth of this month

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.539 
audit on the twenty-ninth of this month
and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.439> that's<00:01:28.680> pretty<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.189> straight

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
and then that's pretty much straight

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
and then that's pretty much straight
into<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> real<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:31.079> we've<00:01:31.200> got<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
into to the real thing so we've got a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
into to the real thing so we've got a
couple<00:01:31.530> of<00:01:31.740> days<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.340> between<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:33.810> tweak

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
couple of days in between to tweak

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.520 
couple of days in between to tweak
anything<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.070> needs<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.460> be<00:01:35.640> changed<00:01:36.630> but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
anything that needs to be changed but

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
anything that needs to be changed but
then<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.729> systems<00:01:39.240> go

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
then it's going to be all systems go

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.359 
then it's going to be all systems go

everyone<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.500> everything<00:02:16.770> together<00:02:17.209> they

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
everyone and everything together they

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.290 
everyone and everything together they
must<00:02:18.450> be<00:02:18.630> pretty<00:02:18.959> pretty<00:02:19.560> upset<00:02:20.040> with<00:02:20.940> with
