00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
feel like it did better than some but

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.720 
feel like it did better than some but
not<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.090> well<00:03:53.269> as<00:03:53.420> others<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:54.220> what<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.250> noticed

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
not as well as others and what I noticed

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.539 
not as well as others and what I noticed
with<00:03:55.850> this<00:03:56.030> time<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.510> time<00:03:56.600> again<00:03:56.780> on<00:03:57.380> my<00:03:58.220> skin

00:03:58.539 --> 00:03:58.549 
with this time and time again on my skin

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.860 
with this time and time again on my skin
is<00:03:59.170> that<00:04:00.170> when<00:04:00.769> it<00:04:00.890> finally<00:04:01.100> settled<00:04:01.870> it

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
is that when it finally settled it

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.310 
is that when it finally settled it
looked<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.769> me<00:04:03.799> like<00:04:04.340> I<00:04:05.000> had<00:04:05.600> more<00:04:05.810> lines<00:04:06.110> than

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
looked to me like I had more lines than

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.490 
looked to me like I had more lines than
I<00:04:06.470> ever<00:04:06.500> even<00:04:06.739> knew<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.250> I<00:04:07.280> had<00:04:07.610> it<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:09.470> know

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
I ever even knew that I had it you know

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.350 
I ever even knew that I had it you know
when<00:04:09.829> you<00:04:09.920> put<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> moisturizer<00:04:10.340> on<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.299> it

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
when you put a moisturizer on and it

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.720 
when you put a moisturizer on and it
absorbs<00:04:11.480> into<00:04:11.930> your<00:04:12.110> skin<00:04:12.350> that's<00:04:12.739> great<00:04:12.980> well

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
absorbs into your skin that's great well

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.449 
absorbs into your skin that's great well
I<00:04:14.030> feel<00:04:14.540> like<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.840> put<00:04:15.019> this<00:04:15.200> on<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.190> just

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459 
I feel like I put this on and it just

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.039 
I feel like I put this on and it just
completely<00:04:16.940> absorbed<00:04:17.419> into<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:17.660> skin<00:04:17.750> and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
completely absorbed into the skin and

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.229 
completely absorbed into the skin and
with<00:04:18.500> a<00:04:18.530> concealer<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:19.430> really<00:04:19.729> do<00:04:19.910> need<00:04:20.180> that

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
with a concealer you really do need that

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.409 
with a concealer you really do need that
perfect<00:04:20.780> balance<00:04:21.049> of<00:04:22.150> settling<00:04:23.150> into<00:04:23.330> the

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
perfect balance of settling into the

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.310 
perfect balance of settling into the
skin<00:04:23.660> enough<00:04:23.900> so<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.169> stays<00:04:24.470> on<00:04:24.680> but

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
skin enough so it stays on but

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.170 
skin enough so it stays on but
sitting<00:04:25.680> on<00:04:25.770> top<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.370> that<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.610> continues<00:04:27.030> to

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
sitting on top so that it continues to

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.030 
sitting on top so that it continues to
conceal<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:28.200> dark<00:04:28.440> area<00:04:28.770> that<00:04:28.920> you're
