hey<00:00:04.080> guys<00:00:04.290> especially<00:00:04.650> JS<00:00:05.220> tech<00:00:05.490> here<00:00:05.670> and

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
hey guys especially JS tech here and

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.940 
hey guys especially JS tech here and
today<00:00:06.240> and<00:00:06.569> show<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:07.109> to<00:00:07.170> jailbreak<00:00:07.919> your

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
today and show you how to jailbreak your

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.520 
today and show you how to jailbreak your
iphone<00:00:08.639> 4s<00:00:09.150> or<00:00:09.480> basically<00:00:09.960> any<00:00:10.200> device<00:00:10.500> that

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
iphone 4s or basically any device that

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.919 
iphone 4s or basically any device that
runs<00:00:10.860> iOS<00:00:11.130> 6<00:00:11.610> of<00:00:12.030> course<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.300> have<00:00:12.389> my<00:00:12.540> 4s<00:00:12.900> in

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
runs iOS 6 of course I have my 4s in

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:14.990 
runs iOS 6 of course I have my 4s in
front<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.440> me<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.400> with<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.790> new

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
front of me so this is with the new

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.480 
front of me so this is with the new
evasion<00:00:15.540> jailbreak<00:00:15.980> so<00:00:16.980> basically<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
evasion jailbreak so basically this

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.609 
evasion jailbreak so basically this
supports<00:00:17.880> any<00:00:18.029> device<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.510> runs<00:00:18.660> iOS<00:00:18.930> 6<00:00:19.380> up

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
supports any device that runs iOS 6 up

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.580 
supports any device that runs iOS 6 up
to<00:00:19.770> 6.1<00:00:20.369> some<00:00:21.300> pre-work<00:00:21.720> rosettes<00:00:22.140> would<00:00:22.410> be

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
to 6.1 some pre-work rosettes would be

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.230 
to 6.1 some pre-work rosettes would be
that<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> take<00:00:23.400> off<00:00:23.640> your<00:00:23.820> passcode

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240

on your device you also have to make

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
oftentimes new update some things get

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.770 
oftentimes new update some things get
messed<00:00:41.370> up<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> filesystem<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
messed up with the filesystem and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.840 
messed up with the filesystem and
especially<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> OTA<00:00:43.890> update<00:00:44.399> that's<00:00:44.579> over

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
especially if you OTA update that's over

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
especially if you OTA update that's over
the<00:00:44.969> air<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.210> means<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.020> plug<00:00:46.289> your

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
the air that means you did not plug your

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.560 
the air that means you did not plug your
phone<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.219> computer<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.940> update<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
phone into the computer to update that

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.299 
phone into the computer to update that
means<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:49.829> going<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
means that you are not going to have a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
means that you are not going to have a
good<00:00:50.460> time<00:00:50.640> jailbreaking<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:52.020> it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
good time jailbreaking this because it

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.139 
good time jailbreaking this because it
will<00:00:52.320> not<00:00:52.530> work<00:00:52.640> so<00:00:53.640> there's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.910> lot<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
will not work so there's a lot of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
will not work so there's a lot of
prerequisites<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.559> will<00:00:55.980> have

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
prerequisites like that I will have

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.650 
prerequisites like that I will have
everything<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.730> description<00:00:57.300> but

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
everything in the description but

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.900 
everything in the description but
ultimately<00:00:58.230> if<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.649> jailbreak<00:00:59.100> fails<00:00:59.370> you

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
ultimately if the jailbreak fails you

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.660 
ultimately if the jailbreak fails you
plug<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> this<00:01:00.600> little<00:01:00.809> computer<00:01:00.930> and<00:01:01.460> if<00:01:02.460> it's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
plug in this little computer and if it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270 
plug in this little computer and if it's
really<00:01:03.180> bad<00:01:03.300> which<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:04.170> not<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.949> bad

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
really bad which is not really that bad

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.090 
really bad which is not really that bad
you<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.479> dfu<00:01:06.930> mode<00:01:07.020> restore<00:01:07.710> which<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
you use the dfu mode restore which is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.469 
you use the dfu mode restore which is
when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.310> hold<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> power<00:01:08.880> button<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.390> you

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
when you hold the power button and you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.170 
when you hold the power button and you
wait<00:01:09.689> for<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.470> home<00:01:10.740> button<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.880> just

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
wait for the home button and you just

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.690 
wait for the home button and you just
plug<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.479> into<00:01:12.600> itunes<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:13.140> hit<00:01:13.260> restore

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
plug it into itunes and hit restore

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.920 
plug it into itunes and hit restore
after<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> finish<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.270> you<00:01:15.420> go<00:01:15.630> through<00:01:15.659> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
after you finish that you go through the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.330 
after you finish that you go through the
setup<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> don't<00:01:16.799> restore<00:01:17.100> from<00:01:17.280> backup

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
setup and just don't restore from backup

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.030 
setup and just don't restore from backup
and<00:01:17.880> then<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.450> jailbreak<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.920> very

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and then you jailbreak so it's very

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.230 
and then you jailbreak so it's very
important<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:20.580> understand<00:01:21.090> those

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
important that you understand those

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.969 
important that you understand those
sipping<00:01:21.600> simple<00:01:22.080> diagnostic<00:01:22.439> steps

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
sipping simple diagnostic steps

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.950 
sipping simple diagnostic steps
ultimately<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> does<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.390> work<00:01:24.540> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
ultimately if it does not work you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.380 
ultimately if it does not work you
restore<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.560> try<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:25.979> again<00:01:26.180> that's<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
restore it and try it again that's the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.630 
restore it and try it again that's the
ultimate<00:01:27.540> diagnostics<00:01:28.470> there<00:01:29.070> may<00:01:29.220> be<00:01:29.250> some

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
ultimate diagnostics there may be some

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.359 
ultimate diagnostics there may be some
bugs<00:01:29.820> with<00:01:29.939> evasion<00:01:30.329> but<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.009> will

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
bugs with evasion but that it will

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.149 
bugs with evasion but that it will
guarantee<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.479> jailbreak<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> first

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
guarantee you a jailbreak so the first

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.350 
guarantee you a jailbreak so the first
thing<00:01:35.250> you're<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.700> want<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.939> do<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.240> go

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
thing you're going to want to do is go

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.819 
thing you're going to want to do is go
ahead<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.720> open<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:36.990> evasion<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.680> your

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that up on Windows you just extract all

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.230 
that up on Windows you just extract all
and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.380> open<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:54.210> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and then open it up so right here you

phone is the 4s of course that's iOS 6.1
and<00:01:59.540> yeah<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> pretty<00:02:02.100> much<00:02:02.189> you're<00:02:02.700> just

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and yeah so pretty much you're just

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.310 
and yeah so pretty much you're just
going<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.090> click<00:02:03.240> jailbreak<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.930> it's<00:02:04.170> as

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
going to click jailbreak and it's as

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.100 
going to click jailbreak and it's as
simple<00:02:04.560> as<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:05.240> so<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.509> we<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.659> my<00:02:06.869> phone

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
simple as that so there we have my phone

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.770 
simple as that so there we have my phone

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
of course it's on 6.1 firmware we're

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.270 
of course it's on 6.1 firmware we're
just<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.110> click<00:02:10.289> jailbreak<00:02:10.530> and<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.220> we

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
just going to click jailbreak and now we

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.280 
just going to click jailbreak and now we
just<00:02:11.459> sit<00:02:11.670> back<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.120> wait<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.989> jailbreak

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
just sit back and wait the jailbreak

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.760 
just sit back and wait the jailbreak
process

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
process

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.950 
process
is<00:02:13.830> fairly<00:02:14.250> simple<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.570> once<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.780> click

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
is fairly simple so once you click

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.840 
is fairly simple so once you click
jailbreak<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.620> wait<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.100> I'm<00:02:17.640> going<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
jailbreak you just wait and I'm going to

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:24.680 
jailbreak you just wait and I'm going to
go<00:02:17.910> ahead<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.180> speed<00:02:18.420> this<00:02:18.540> up

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.840 

during<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.590> jailbreak<00:02:26.100> process<00:02:26.310> you're

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
during the jailbreak process you're

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.310 
during the jailbreak process you're
going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.180> go<00:02:27.300> ahead<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:28.080> ahead<00:02:28.230> and

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
going to go ahead and go ahead and

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.780 
going to go ahead and go ahead and
unlock<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.830> device<00:02:28.890> once<00:02:29.250> this<00:02:29.340> says<00:02:29.520> tout

and<00:02:32.040> then<00:02:32.310> go<00:02:32.430> ahead<00:02:32.550> over<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.300> app<00:02:33.480> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
and then go ahead over to that app this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.930 
and then go ahead over to that app this
is<00:02:33.750> jailbreak<00:02:34.290> you're<00:02:34.740> going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.950> press<00:02:35.730> it

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
is jailbreak you're going to press it

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
is jailbreak you're going to press it
and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:36.540> it's<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.870> to<00:02:36.960> crash<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.470> then

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
and then it's going to crash and then

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.200 
and then it's going to crash and then
it's<00:02:37.860> going<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.130> go<00:02:38.280> ahead<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:38.700> finish<00:02:38.910> up

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
it's going to go ahead and finish up

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.990 
it's going to go ahead and finish up
here<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.350> it's<00:02:40.500> pretty<00:02:40.830> simple<00:02:41.190> that's<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
here so it's pretty simple that's the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.180 
here so it's pretty simple that's the
only<00:02:42.180> thing<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.390> have<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.540> do<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.130> now<00:02:44.130> you

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
only thing you have to do and now you

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.650 
only thing you have to do and now you
just<00:02:44.370> wait<00:02:44.520> for<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.790> rest<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.060> the<00:02:45.150> process<00:02:45.330> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
just wait for the rest of the process to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.210 
just wait for the rest of the process to
finish

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.680 

so<00:02:52.220> once<00:02:52.520> your<00:02:52.670> device<00:02:52.760> school<00:02:53.180> went<00:02:53.630> ahead

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
so once your device school went ahead

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.930 
so once your device school went ahead
and<00:02:54.050> turned<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.650> pretty<00:02:55.340> much<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.550> just<00:02:55.580> slide

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
and turned on pretty much you just slide

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.839 
and turned on pretty much you just slide
to<00:02:55.970> unlock<00:02:56.120> and<00:02:56.720> install<00:02:57.440> Cydia<00:02:57.950> or<00:02:58.190> initial<00:02:58.760> I

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
to unlock and install Cydia or initial I

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.540 
to unlock and install Cydia or initial I
Cydia<00:02:59.209> you<00:02:59.959> basically<00:03:00.230> just<00:03:00.349> open<00:03:00.770> it<00:03:00.860> up<00:03:01.040> wait

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
Cydia you basically just open it up wait

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.010 
Cydia you basically just open it up wait
for<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.849> stuff<00:03:02.150> to<00:03:02.239> go<00:03:02.360> through<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.900> going

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
for that stuff to go through it's going

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.229 
for that stuff to go through it's going
to<00:03:03.080> respring<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.830> pretty<00:03:04.760> much<00:03:04.819> from<00:03:05.030> there

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
to respring and pretty much from there

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.840 
to respring and pretty much from there
you<00:03:05.510> have<00:03:05.810> Cydia<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.100> it's<00:03:07.250> fairly<00:03:07.550> simple

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
you have Cydia so it's fairly simple

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.110 
you have Cydia so it's fairly simple
jailbreak<00:03:08.480> basically<00:03:09.050> it's<00:03:09.200> click<00:03:09.739> and

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
problems that you have is one backing up

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.600 
problems that you have is one backing up
before<00:03:23.180> you<00:03:23.420> do<00:03:23.600> this<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.050> then<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:25.130> basically

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
before you do this and then to basically

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.670 
before you do this and then to basically
just<00:03:25.850> restoring<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:27.080> then<00:03:27.260> putting<00:03:27.500> your

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
just restoring and then putting your

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.100 
just restoring and then putting your
stuff<00:03:27.830> on<00:03:27.980> later<00:03:28.220> after<00:03:28.730> you<00:03:28.880> jailbreak<00:03:29.120> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
stuff on later after you jailbreak so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.509
