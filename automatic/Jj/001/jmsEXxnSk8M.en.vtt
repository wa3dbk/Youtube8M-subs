00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 
make two more puddles of ink and then I

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.700 
make two more puddles of ink and then I
just<00:00:50.149> fill<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.539> with<00:00:50.750> a<00:00:50.780> third<00:00:51.109> color<00:00:51.410> of<00:00:51.559> ink

first thing I do if I get a really nice
blend<00:01:15.170> of<00:01:15.290> ink<00:01:15.500> then<00:01:16.070> I'm<00:01:16.250> going<00:01:16.460> to<00:01:16.520> do<00:01:16.700> some

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
ghosting backgrounds my inks are made

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.160 
ghosting backgrounds my inks are made
with<00:01:19.729> retardent<00:01:20.299> in<00:01:20.450> them<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:20.869> that<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.140> can

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
with retardent in them so that you can

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.520 
with retardent in them so that you can
lift<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.799> color<00:01:21.979> out<00:01:22.210> when<00:01:23.210> you're<00:01:23.540> working

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.810 
lift the color out when you're working
with<00:01:24.680> them<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:24.979> I'm<00:01:25.040> going<00:01:25.130> to<00:01:25.189> place<00:01:25.399> part<00:01:25.670> of

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
with them so I'm going to place part of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.410 
with them so I'm going to place part of
my<00:01:25.969> stencil<00:01:26.390> of<00:01:26.590> wrong<00:01:27.590> color<00:01:27.890> great<00:01:28.880> I'm

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
my stencil of wrong color great I'm

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.910 
my stencil of wrong color great I'm
going<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.689> use<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:29.990> Pitt<00:01:30.229> over<00:01:30.500> there<00:01:30.680> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
going to use that Pitt over there and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.469 
going to use that Pitt over there and
sit<00:01:31.009> past<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.399> stencil<00:01:31.759> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:31.909> Tom's<00:01:32.119> just

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
sit past the stencil of the Tom's just

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.959 
sit past the stencil of the Tom's just
spritz<00:01:32.810> with<00:01:33.140> water<00:01:33.409> I've<00:01:33.920> got<00:01:34.189> water<00:01:34.369> on<00:01:34.820> my

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
spritz with water I've got water on my

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.490 
spritz with water I've got water on my
stencil<00:01:35.390> as<00:01:35.479> well<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:35.750> what<00:01:35.869> I<00:01:35.899> always<00:01:36.110> do<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.409> I

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
stencil as well so what I always do is I

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.399 
stencil as well so what I always do is I
flip<00:01:36.799> it<00:01:36.950> over<00:01:37.189> press<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.299> down<00:01:38.479> so<00:01:39.079> where<00:01:39.380> I

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
flip it over press it down so where I

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.440 
flip it over press it down so where I
went<00:01:39.799> through<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.280> stencil<00:01:40.850> and<00:01:41.000> got<00:01:41.329> the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
went through the stencil and got the

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.630 
went through the stencil and got the
positive<00:01:41.630> image<00:01:42.200> you<00:01:42.860> can<00:01:43.039> see<00:01:43.280> how<00:01:43.490> it's

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
positive image you can see how it's

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.240 
positive image you can see how it's
lifted<00:01:44.090> the<00:01:44.270> ink<00:01:44.390> out<00:01:44.630> where<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> turned<00:01:46.070> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
lifted the ink out where I turned it

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.340 
lifted the ink out where I turned it
over<00:01:46.399> here<00:01:46.880> you've<00:01:47.360> got<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.659> negative<00:01:47.810> image

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
over here you've got the negative image

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.230 
over here you've got the negative image
and<00:01:48.590> this<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.100> fine<00:01:49.369> all<00:01:49.610> we're<00:01:50.000> doing<00:01:50.180> is

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
and this is fine all we're doing is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.760 
and this is fine all we're doing is
we're<00:01:50.420> creating<00:01:50.570> layers<00:01:51.170> we're<00:01:51.469> making

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
we're creating layers we're making

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.190 
we're creating layers we're making
backgrounds<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.430> clean<00:01:52.969> everything<00:01:53.180> up<00:01:53.810> in<00:01:54.079> my

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
backgrounds I clean everything up in my

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.319 
backgrounds I clean everything up in my
journal<00:01:54.619> as<00:01:55.159> you<00:01:55.369> can<00:01:55.520> see<00:01:55.759> so<00:01:56.000> anything

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
journal as you can see so anything

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.450 
journal as you can see so anything
that's<00:01:56.509> left<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.079> stencil<00:01:57.409> just<00:01:58.280> gets

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
that's left on a stencil just gets

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.029 
that's left on a stencil just gets
pressed<00:01:58.789> off<00:01:59.149> into<00:01:59.689> the<00:01:59.810> journal<00:02:00.259> for<00:02:00.799> another

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
pressed off into the journal for another

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.069 
pressed off into the journal for another
page<00:02:01.310> and<00:02:01.609> I'll<00:02:01.789> just<00:02:01.969> start<00:02:02.270> another<00:02:02.539> page<00:02:02.750> as

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
page and I'll just start another page as

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.490 
page and I'll just start another page as
we<00:02:03.680> go<00:02:03.859> so<00:02:04.520> once<00:02:04.729> you've<00:02:04.969> added<00:02:05.060> some<00:02:05.780> ghosting

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
we go so once you've added some ghosting

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.599 
we go so once you've added some ghosting
on<00:02:06.590> there<00:02:06.859> I'm<00:02:06.950> going<00:02:07.070> to<00:02:07.130> add<00:02:07.219> a<00:02:07.280> little<00:02:07.460> bit

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609 
on there I'm going to add a little bit

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:08.830 
on there I'm going to add a little bit
more<00:02:07.909> on<00:02:08.090> here<00:02:08.270> actually<00:02:08.570> I'm<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.780> to

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
more on here actually I'm going to

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.630 
more on here actually I'm going to
through<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.229> stencil<00:02:09.590> and<00:02:09.979> then<00:02:10.369> I'm<00:02:10.490> going

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
through this stencil and then I'm going

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.930 
through this stencil and then I'm going
to<00:02:10.729> flip<00:02:11.030> it<00:02:11.060> over<00:02:11.480> here<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.340> ghost<00:02:13.580> in

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
to flip it over here and the ghost in

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.640 
to flip it over here and the ghost in
people<00:02:14.630> said<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.350> it<00:02:15.470> straight

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
people said you have to do it straight

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.470 
people said you have to do it straight
away<00:02:15.890> no<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.370> can<00:02:16.610> do<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.790> straight<00:02:17.060> away<00:02:17.240> when

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
away no you can do it straight away when

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.850 
away no you can do it straight away when
it's<00:02:17.600> wet<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.080> could<00:02:18.230> do<00:02:18.320> it<00:02:18.410> when<00:02:18.500> it's<00:02:18.620> dry

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's wet you could do it when it's dry

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.930 
it's wet you could do it when it's dry
you<00:02:18.920> can<00:02:19.160> do<00:02:19.310> its<00:02:19.430> day<00:02:19.610> tomorrow<00:02:20.120> next<00:02:20.420> week

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
you can do its day tomorrow next week

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120 
you can do its day tomorrow next week
because<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.450> inks<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.810> not<00:02:21.930> permanent<00:02:22.500> so

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
because the inks are not permanent so

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.470 
because the inks are not permanent so
you<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:23.730> see<00:02:23.880> we've<00:02:24.030> got<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.270> lovely

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.820 
you can see we've got this lovely
ghosted<00:02:25.020> image<00:02:25.290> now<00:02:25.560> so<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.220> I<00:02:26.430> need<00:02:26.670> to<00:02:26.820> dry

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
ghosted image now so this I need to dry

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.780 
ghosted image now so this I need to dry
normally<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:29.010> just<00:02:29.040> turn<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.550> another

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
normally I would just turn to another

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.250 
normally I would just turn to another
page<00:02:29.970> in<00:02:30.180> my<00:02:30.270> book<00:02:30.300> and<00:02:30.570> do<00:02:30.660> another<00:02:30.870> one<00:02:31.080> do

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
page in my book and do another one do

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.660 
page in my book and do another one do
another<00:02:31.290> one<00:02:31.650> by<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.830> time<00:02:32.040> I<00:02:32.100> come<00:02:32.280> back<00:02:32.340> to

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
another one by the time I come back to

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.340 
another one by the time I come back to
this<00:02:32.790> it's<00:02:32.970> dry<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.720> I'm<00:02:33.810> going<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.200> give

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
this it's dry but I'm going to just give

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.050 
this it's dry but I'm going to just give
it<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.500> quick<00:02:34.680> dry<00:02:34.920> today<00:02:37.520> okay<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.880> reason

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
it a quick dry today okay the reason

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940 
it a quick dry today okay the reason
that<00:02:39.300> I<00:02:39.360> was<00:02:39.510> drying<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:40.050> was<00:02:40.170> because<00:02:40.440> if<00:02:40.560> I<00:02:40.740> go

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
that I was drying it was because if I go

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.680 
that I was drying it was because if I go
to<00:02:41.010> spray<00:02:41.340> more<00:02:41.580> ink<00:02:41.820> on<00:02:41.970> top<00:02:42.210> and<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.450> ink<00:02:42.570> is

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
to spray more ink on top and the ink is

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.390 
to spray more ink on top and the ink is
wet<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.020> will<00:02:43.170> just<00:02:43.350> bleed<00:02:43.650> and<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.010> want<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.250> nice

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
wet it will just bleed and I want a nice

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.030 
wet it will just bleed and I want a nice
crisp<00:02:44.790> finish<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.260> I'm<00:02:46.380> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.680> take<00:02:46.860> one<00:02:47.010> of

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
crisp finish so I'm going to take one of

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.220 
crisp finish so I'm going to take one of
the<00:02:47.130> stencils<00:02:47.670> again<00:02:47.970> and<00:02:48.210> whenever<00:02:48.810> I'm

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
the stencils again and whenever I'm

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.290 
the stencils again and whenever I'm
doing<00:02:49.590> backgrounds<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.310> stay<00:02:50.700> with<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.000> same

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
doing backgrounds I stay with the same

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.540 
doing backgrounds I stay with the same
color<00:02:51.600> inks<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.380> I've<00:02:52.530> used<00:02:52.560> these<00:02:53.010> three<00:02:53.310> inks

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
color inks so I've used these three inks

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.310 
color inks so I've used these three inks
in<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.730> background<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.390> whatever<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.050> put<00:02:55.200> on

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
in the background and whatever I put on

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.570 
in the background and whatever I put on
the<00:02:55.410> top<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.770> going<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:55.980> use<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.370> then<00:02:56.460> it's

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
the top I'm going to use and then it's

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.120 
the top I'm going to use and then it's
all<00:02:56.730> coordinated<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.900> background<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.830> called<00:02:59.070> a

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
all coordinated a background is called a

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.680 
all coordinated a background is called a
background<00:02:59.490> because<00:02:59.730> it's<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.240> background

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
background because it's the background

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.030 
background because it's the background
and<00:03:00.930> people<00:03:01.020> forget<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:01.710> they<00:03:01.770> put<00:03:01.890> all

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
and people forget that and they put all

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040 
and people forget that and they put all
bright<00:03:02.340> new<00:03:02.520> colors<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:02.910> so<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.600> just<00:03:03.810> stick

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
bright new colors in so we just stick

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.450 
bright new colors in so we just stick
with<00:03:04.200> these<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.770> I'm<00:03:04.860> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.130> take<00:03:05.310> the

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
with these so I'm going to take the

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.520 
with these so I'm going to take the
paler<00:03:05.820> one<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.600> give<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.780> light<00:03:07.080> spritz

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
paler one just give a light spritz

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.650 
paler one just give a light spritz
through<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.920> stencil<00:03:08.160> again<00:03:09.000> I've<00:03:09.210> got<00:03:09.390> ink

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
through the stencil again I've got ink

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.350 
through the stencil again I've got ink
on<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.930> stencil<00:03:10.140> I'm<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.680> to<00:03:10.800> flip<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.040> over

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
on the stencil I'm going to flip it over

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.790 
on the stencil I'm going to flip it over
because<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.660> all<00:03:12.810> about<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.350> creating

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
because it's all about just creating

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.950 
because it's all about just creating
texture<00:03:14.400> on<00:03:14.580> there<00:03:15.180> so<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.480> flipped<00:03:15.780> through

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:15.960 
texture on there so I flipped through

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.770 
texture on there so I flipped through

can see my journal is just full of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.980 
can see my journal is just full of
cleanups<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.920> you<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.250> pages<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.360> the

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990

cleanups so you get pages going all the
time<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.560> then<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.400> maybe<00:03:29.730> go<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.060> this

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
time and then going to maybe go to this

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.420 
time and then going to maybe go to this
one<00:03:30.480> will<00:03:30.660> go<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.900> snowflakes<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:32.040> I'm<00:03:32.220> going

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
one will go for snowflakes and I'm going

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.130 
one will go for snowflakes and I'm going
to<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:32.610> with<00:03:32.730> another<00:03:33.000> color<00:03:33.270> and<00:03:33.600> I'm<00:03:34.110> just

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
to go with another color and I'm just

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.250 
to go with another color and I'm just
going<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.560> spritz<00:03:35.450> flip<00:03:36.450> this<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.020> what<00:03:37.170> we

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
going to spritz flip this is what we

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.060 
going to spritz flip this is what we
call<00:03:37.470> it<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.830> spritz<00:03:38.310> flip<00:03:38.700> spritz<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.709> you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
call it the spritz flip spritz so you

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.730 
call it the spritz flip spritz so you
can<00:03:41.250> see<00:03:41.580> all<00:03:41.910> the<00:03:42.270> layers<00:03:42.480> are<00:03:42.900> now<00:03:43.440> building

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:43.740 
can see all the layers are now building

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.130 
can see all the layers are now building
up<00:03:44.040> there<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:44.670> nothing<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.450> standing<00:03:45.780> out

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
up there but nothing is standing out

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.650 
up there but nothing is standing out
nothing<00:03:46.500> is<00:03:46.890> just<00:03:47.190> pulling<00:03:47.940> your<00:03:48.090> eye<00:03:48.120> into<00:03:48.540> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
everything's got equal space and you can

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.420 
everything's got equal space and you can
just<00:03:50.880> see<00:03:51.030> them<00:03:51.209> all<00:03:51.360> building<00:03:51.720> up<00:03:51.900> so<00:03:52.709> what

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
just see them all building up so what

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.880 
just see them all building up so what
you<00:03:53.520> can<00:03:53.700> also<00:03:53.880> do<00:03:54.180> as<00:03:54.300> well<00:03:54.450> one<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.630> my<00:03:54.750> in<00:03:55.470> all

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
you can also do as well one of my in all

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.010 
you can also do as well one of my in all
my<00:03:56.130> inks<00:03:56.430> are<00:03:56.550> translucent<00:03:57.300> and<00:03:57.510> they<00:03:57.840> can

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
my inks are translucent and they can

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.900 
my inks are translucent and they can
build<00:03:58.230> up<00:03:58.410> all<00:03:58.590> together<00:03:58.890> apart<00:03:59.250> from<00:03:59.640> my

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
build up all together apart from my

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.000 
build up all together apart from my
white<00:04:00.120> linen<00:04:00.360> my<00:04:01.020> white<00:04:01.200> linen<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> semi

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
white linen my white linen is a semi

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.550 
white linen my white linen is a semi
opaque<00:04:02.459> this<00:04:03.300> means<00:04:03.570> that<00:04:03.720> it's<00:04:03.930> got<00:04:04.020> pigment

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
opaque this means that it's got pigment

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.680 
opaque this means that it's got pigment
in<00:04:04.800> now<00:04:05.340> pigment<00:04:05.790> will<00:04:05.880> drop<00:04:06.239> to<00:04:06.510> the<00:04:06.540> bottom

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
in now pigment will drop to the bottom

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.530 
in now pigment will drop to the bottom
of<00:04:06.989> your<00:04:07.080> bottle<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:08.100> my<00:04:08.520> tip<00:04:08.880> for<00:04:08.910> this<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.390> if

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
of your bottle so my tip for this is if

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.240 
of your bottle so my tip for this is if
you<00:04:09.630> hold<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:10.110> put<00:04:10.290> store<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.890> its<00:04:11.010> side

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
you hold if I put store it on its side

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.800 
you hold if I put store it on its side
so<00:04:11.580> whenever<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:11.970> pick<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.270> bottle<00:04:12.570> up<00:04:12.660> if

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
so whenever you pick the bottle up if

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.630 
so whenever you pick the bottle up if
you<00:04:12.930> forget<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.260> shake<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:14.190> will<00:04:14.430> just

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
you forget to shake it it will just

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.610 
you forget to shake it it will just
spray<00:04:14.970> otherwise<00:04:15.480> you'll<00:04:15.720> suck<00:04:15.989> pigment<00:04:16.440> up

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
spray otherwise you'll suck pigment up

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.590 
spray otherwise you'll suck pigment up
and<00:04:16.859> you<00:04:17.190> think<00:04:17.820> they'll<00:04:17.970> think<00:04:18.180> it's<00:04:18.330> broken

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
and you think they'll think it's broken

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.449 
and you think they'll think it's broken
so<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.290> need<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.530> give<00:04:19.680> it<00:04:19.709> a<00:04:19.799> shake<00:04:20.070> it's<00:04:20.310> got

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
so you need to give it a shake it's got

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.720 
so you need to give it a shake it's got
a<00:04:20.489> ball<00:04:20.700> bearing<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.919> then<00:04:22.919> because<00:04:23.460> it's

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
a ball bearing in and then because it's

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.180 
a ball bearing in and then because it's
semi<00:04:24.120> translucent<00:04:24.600> it<00:04:25.410> will<00:04:25.590> pick<00:04:25.860> up<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
semi translucent it will pick up the

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.740 
semi translucent it will pick up the
color<00:04:26.370> of<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.610> ink<00:04:26.730> that's<00:04:27.030> underneath<00:04:27.330> there

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
color of the ink that's underneath there

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.360 
color of the ink that's underneath there
so<00:04:28.290> I'm<00:04:28.350> just<00:04:28.530> going<00:04:28.710> to<00:04:28.830> give<00:04:28.979> it<00:04:29.010> a<00:04:29.160> live

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
so I'm just going to give it a live

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.270 
so I'm just going to give it a live

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
even the blocks work so that is a

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:09.029 
even the blocks work so that is a
typical<00:06:06.039> background<00:06:07.139> that<00:06:08.139> I<00:06:08.169> would<00:06:08.409> do<00:06:08.710> and

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039
