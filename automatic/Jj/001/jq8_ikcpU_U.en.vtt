 so guys today we get 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.320
 found for a mkp yeah but that's 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.670
 a little special it's not actually I you 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.509
 explain why look at what I 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.759
 mark actually on the deceased the qg what 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:31.880
 that was the subject today if it's the 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.320
 team game explain why 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.809
 if you are expecting real shock for his 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.340
 part leave the video but I you 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.350
 advise to stay just out of curiosity 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.820
 for the subject and for the stop words with 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.829
 not bad anyway 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.870
 despite his bills and 60% even 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.579
 to explain why because already 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.600
 first hand what is kneaded 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.390
 very old 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.399
 I found on my hard drive and he 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.719
 more about France cautiously 3 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.019
 must have two three years old says more than 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.120
 three years i think is actually at 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:01.829
 the time with my team dedication to matip 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.300
 besides big dedication to matino cb 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.909
 it's nice to put a gameplay 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.140
 on a qcm w3c on his not the brothel 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.800
 it's a defense of qg 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.870
 and I did not explain you coming there radio 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.970
 here I have a video that has been pretty 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.370
 popular too long ago two 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.150
 kids was ben me and me barrette 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.920
 50 without moving next to the qg and those of the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.360
 frost in france said reject side grass 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.150
 we'll see later I'll put myself 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 two or three times before callÃ  

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.190
 exactly m here I am twenty 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.770
 month bo barrette 50 without moving it is at 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.090
 to say next to the qg to a meter subject without 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.050
 to move a game of equipped that holds there my 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.760
 blocked colleagues must not they 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.900
 come behind me I took what 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.440
 can get out of the hallway is a little 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.480
 surprising face 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.300
 so short this video has been seen more than 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.310
 22 thousand times that was the first on 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.630
 youtube must die is 50 without moving 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.729
 it's a challenge to do no good 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.829
 you are without moving brief the top 10 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.600
 and in the countryside but certainly when 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:56.680
 not even easy to do so so after 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.360
 seven months ago I had done it there 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.470
 a long time took the helm is I got 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.110
 said i'm going to try a little bit of moving 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.100
 anyway but 12 and 2 takes over the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.259
 principle of team 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.119
 these few months as well as live 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.649
 to 0 to 0 and 80 topics there it was our 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.869
 favorite food we made fucking 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.910
 series of four five months in the 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.080
 part I also understand five months 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.030
 it was from what we did on that 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.680
 subject there it is sometimes she 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.000
 had adversaries and that exist and 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.560
 who lived if you lived I had my 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.599
 defend he had disputed the two jeep 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.980
 took the lead in fact there one 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.380
 believe that you can his watts side be 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.819
 cardiff smiled on the map the wood on 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.390
 the map we see there a 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.980
 repositioning 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.030
 after me I 'm going to know one more who 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.500
 since she can because I 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.390
 remake tractors had to be able without 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.709
 that his box or canberra his standard and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.380
 finally the spanking of the praises took a little 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.750
 at the micro razal is that razak ito 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.700
 steven raja cbt evening there at the difficult 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.170
 so the spirit the team the young team 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.519
 what are you going to say true 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.930
 you are worried because you 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.310
 wait for the enemies and you want them 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.170
 now what do you remember 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.790
 do not hesitate to the scout who does not occupy 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.410
 waiting it goes the most at home we are 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.840
 well positioned you have throne frame 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.310
 and he did not arrive more or less 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.859
 of fright sometimes he was doing himself 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.880
 repeat everyday 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.780
 but it's still a subject 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.799
 defend in the team 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.109
 and frankly she also saw at 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.750
 the troubled time through these shortcomings 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:07.580
 know 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.220
 because it was really the most 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.500
 beautiful games that I did as a team 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.600
 are there as everything is different 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.340
 and frankly of his mac do I hope 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.230
 today even though it's not 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.310
 bosch group advise you to stay 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.570
 to do it because the 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.950
 triggering the m had not hurt 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.780
 frankly really not bad guys 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.900
 these titles simple man life but that's 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.760
 super nice so do not want me if I have 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.170
 a little bit when and so I you 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.020
 take that's what I mean it's 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.090
 defending goals and appreciated 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.250
 do not necessarily belong to this phenomenon 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.500
 is a precious good come come all 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.470
 only here I hope they like that 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.610
 will please if you like +36 new school course 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.130
 it's not rush because the current one 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.070
 pure monster pubic sugar follow my 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.870
 videos before it's serious or ghost 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.739
 writer we have how to play a two 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.010
 or three I do not know at all 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.310
 sector 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.010
 I was a player here to grab the 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.380
 his carache me I'm here this is 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.510
 not at all that and why 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:05.650
 the 14th is 14 and so if 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.930
 you missed the previous videos 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.030
 look at nuclear seems to be causing 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.940
 high dsr 100% of that I put you very 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 soon much worse saiper us 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.750
 also his black ops so this cap and not 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.360
 you do not trust he 's three years old it's not 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.440
 my way of playing now 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:26.590
 certainly it's ugly food turf 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:27.940
 I admit I did 3 ko seized 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.710
 his cross he made me 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.850
 I also cut sequences do not need 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.200
 that because it's enough to play when 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:38.160
 even you can strive you got a 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.160
 fairly compact video Monday 9 and

 layana crutch it's a unique and I 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.760
 favorite move I remember fresh 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.850
