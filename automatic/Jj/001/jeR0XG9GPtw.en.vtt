00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.399
 during this week you will not eat the 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.959
 that we are learning to do 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.660
 American recipes 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.030
 I already told you Popover Century 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.040
 when tisbury and banana brazil 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.200
 today we are going to make a recipe for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.200
 chocolate cookies that looks delicious 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.270
 in various types of coconuts out there but 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.400
 What I like best is the one that is 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.529
 crispy on the outside and soft inside he 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.180
 It's just the way it is, it's the way I feel. 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.310
 I like it and I really hope you like it 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.350
 of this recipe also the first step 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.210
 of this recipe to melt chocolate and 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.370
 butter can melt so much in 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.989
 microwaves as in a water bath, which is 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.120
 how I'm going to do here I have here one 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.850
 pot with very hot water 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.680
 I'm going to put a cap on a book and 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 Temperature bracket can be made of metal 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.820
 or glass and we will melt the 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.550
 chocolate 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.110
 I'm just getting droplets 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.239
 practicality but you can use the 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.620
 I'm going to have chocolate too. 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:02.449
 butter along with chocolate and 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.830
 now just mixing it up from time to time 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.830
 until it is well retinal 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.619
 the chocolate melts completely 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.060
 now I'll leave it here by chilling 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:23.500
 A little while we'll go 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.670
 beating eggs with sugar in the 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.500
 food mixer 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.450
 this method to make it a 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.860
 a little different from the traditional 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.500
 usually made with butter 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.880
 You hit with sugar and you people. 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.190
 will do the opposite we will beat 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.340
 the eggs first with sugar until you 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.840
 well incorporated 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.880
 we just hit it here in 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.600
 maximum speed until the cream is well 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.600
 danced 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.930
 ready 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.490
 It was a good hopeful cream the way 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.860
 what I wanted now we'll go 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.860
 incorporate this melted chocolate into 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.479
 butter careful that chocolate does not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.160
 It is very hot because if you have to 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.080
 You can cook the eggs there. 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.640
 spoiling the recipe is why I 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.890
 I like to start always melting the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
 chocolate because while I'm going to hit 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.390
 in the eggs it's getting cold 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.180
 I'll show it again and I'll go 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:29.750
 incorporate the flour the salt a little bit 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 yeast with the help of the four 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.630
 We'll be fine for the 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.680
 people do not lose the air that people 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.680
 found to stay 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.000
 now I'm going to throw my little drops of 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.850
 chocolate you can use chocolate 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.680
 chopped or chocolate chips I 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.960
 I found these colored I 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.020
 I find a cutie then it 's not that I 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.940
 I'll put you do not want too 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.620
 put the chocolate may be replaced 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.030
 pecans or put nuts 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.030
 also white chocolate that looks delicious 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.320
 you can see that the smoke is also liquid 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.330
 this is not the ideal place for people 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.360
 to model our cookies so that the 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.190
 People now need to cover if this pot 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.980
 here and take to the refrigerator for at least 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:27.280
 half an hour until this mass becomes firm 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:29.920
 for us to be able to model now walks 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.990
 Mass debuted is firmer and it's just people. 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.880
 to model cookies you can do this 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.130
 with a scoop of ice cream or with 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.930
 a normal tablespoon and then I 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.090
 I will look my toes in the water and gives a 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.130
 boring dinha and we will put in the 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.170
 oven as soon as I leave the oven I go 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.760
 put the chocolate droplets and 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.620
 people will cool on their own 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.580
 I do not know, I'll transfer what if 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.020
 he streaks 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.360
 You have to wait for it to cool. 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.360
 completely after transfer 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.250
 I hope goose is crunchy on the outside. 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.550
 softer inside and percent of 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.079
 It's the way it's supposed to be when 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.790
 You make this recipe, do not forget to 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.639
 post a picture with the hashtag will eat 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.639
 The gay kiss of mine.
