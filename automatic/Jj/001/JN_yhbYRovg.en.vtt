00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.050
 hello people i have a few other youtubers 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.080
 do in a winter series with though 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.450
 second part on the advent days comes 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.090
 one video per channel and it will 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.590
 but give a raffle 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.300
 more detailed information is available in the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.590
 infobox 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.619
 and I wish you a lot of fun with that 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.619
 Video 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:34.160
 in today's video I show you as you 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.050
 friend that can bake that 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.400
 recipe is quite easy and you 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.180
 can your loved one enjoy it 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.730
 prepare 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.030
 she just needs to have a lot of courage for yours 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.879
 choosing cookie cutters to cut something 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.500
 something with structure otherwise and 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.879
 optional frosting made of fimo g3 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.940
 pastel chalk or handle have and 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.170
 of course an oven 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.070
 but that could all happen again in the 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.070
 read infobox in more detail 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.490
 Of course, for the cookies needs 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.680
 fimo and if available one 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.600
 cutters and then today 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 cookie dough out and I do that 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.090
 quite professional with glass like 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:25.619
 could see there was quite normal 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:27.149
 from and structured that everything to the 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.600
 Example with aluminum foil or one 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.600
 toothbrush 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.369
 and then you can color that on 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.960
 This step is optional before the 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.399
 Baking is very suitable for pastel chalk 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.590
 good and after baking for example 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:44.049
 acrylic paint depending on what you prefer 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.689
 is and you watch yourself one 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.140
 bright color base should serve and that 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.939
 she colors the border a bit darker 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.799
 I would like to use as a base gate 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:57.990
 and for the edge of a mixture of 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.990
 orange yellow and a bit brown 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.520
 to make friend of that trailer 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.289
 you can cook in for example 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.340
 cut two halves or you come it 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.340
 just let it go 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.319
 made of polymer clay gel and white pastel chalk 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.319
 can you break down in frosting 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.890
 and of various colors finger can 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.850
 then you sprinkle and then that 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.110
 warping cookies 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.060
 before baking could be wire or in 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.940
 Boiler stages the dough so you can 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.980
 later have a user and after the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.360
 the places could bake the borders 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.150
 should be glossy or nail polish 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:56.000
 paint and then you are actually 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:57.470
 already ready for the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.380
 gingerbread man needs the dough again 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.910
 and existing ones from the keyword I had 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.030
 unfortunately no one knew that try 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.020
 to do it myself somehow 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.890
 and you can see it here too 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.570
 Holiday lettings pretty well 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:19.880
 more complicated and infinite though 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:22.130
 in the end it works when it is 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.480
 you finally managed to do it 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.640
 Here's Buchmann again 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.900
 Get some structure and then 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.900
 to decorate for funny 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:36.040
 For example, that could be a good idea 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.040
 or make frosting 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.150
 if you are satisfied with the ornament 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.150
 then you are already finished again 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.670
 I have a bit of a taste for the biscuit 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.940
 just 23 minutes in the yard in 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.370
 let it heal and then handle it all 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.360
 sliced 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.940
 we just have to do that with the dough 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.620
 mix 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.100
 and then I'm just looking forward to nothing 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.100
 your choice 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.820
 I know that there structure again 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.299
 This time I'm doing this, for example 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.299
 alufolie 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.290
 Optionally you can do that again 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.290
 to dye 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.740
 and you have a chocolate biscuit 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.340
 the easiest way to get started 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.850
 here you really only need such 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.530
 slim roll out badge bid I think 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.120
 that looks best when you have two 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.320
 bit thicker and two thin red ones 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:06.250
 Snakes then you do the whole thing 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.250
 to your white snake 

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.150
 then you threaten the whole thing 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.150
 once it's so nice 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.170
 transition therefore has a good factory 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.170
 will and nothing stands 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.430
 and then he just turns it all over 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.690
 long one to you like the pattern 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.680
 and then you can already do yours 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.680
 candy cane shape 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:45.380
 You can also choose two , for example 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.620
 candy cane even a stang heart 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.620
 do 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.529
 that was it with my own 

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.149
 tactics fun 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:02.189
 as I said if you as a trailer 

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:04.900
 you want to have hardened before 

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.190
 still put the wire in it 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.440
 and that was it, too 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.030
 school if you have any wishes 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.919
 then write me in the comments 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.500
 I would also like feedback 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.750
 happy and I link you again 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.280
 the other youtuber's videos and then 

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.280
 Let's see you next time
