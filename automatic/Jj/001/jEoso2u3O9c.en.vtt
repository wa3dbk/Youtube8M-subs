00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
new ability now which is gonna be shell

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.419 
new ability now which is gonna be shell
armor<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:28.289> completely<00:00:29.070> excited

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
armor which I not completely excited

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.849 
armor which I not completely excited
about<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.179> then<00:00:30.779> it's<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> get<00:00:31.619> his

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
about and then it's going to get his

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.970 
about and then it's going to get his
boosts<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.790> defense<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.870> special<00:00:34.530> defense

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
boosts in defense and special defense

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.860 
boosts in defense and special defense
which<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.640> guess<00:00:35.820> makes<00:00:35.850> up<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.540> losing

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
which I guess makes up for losing

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
which I guess makes up for losing
regenerator<00:00:37.700> yeah<00:00:38.700> those<00:00:39.000> are<00:00:39.180> pretty<00:00:39.210> big

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
regenerator yeah those are pretty big

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.260 
regenerator yeah those are pretty big
boosts<00:00:40.500> force<00:00:40.800> logo<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:41.760> already

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
boosts force logo that it's already

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.180 
boosts force logo that it's already
pretty<00:00:42.780> bulky<00:00:43.079> so<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.710> thing<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:43.920> going<00:00:44.129> to

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
pretty bulky so this thing is going to

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.430 
pretty bulky so this thing is going to
be<00:00:44.309> extremely<00:00:44.610> bulky<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:46.170> don't<00:00:46.289> see

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
be extremely bulky I really don't see

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
be extremely bulky I really don't see
its<00:00:46.649> moveset<00:00:47.100> changing<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.969> think<00:00:48.750> it's

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
its moveset changing at all I think it's

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.150 
its moveset changing at all I think it's
still<00:00:48.960> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.829> regular

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
still going to just be like a regular

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.950 
still going to just be like a regular
well<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.180> you're<00:00:51.360> gonna<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> include

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
well now you're gonna have to include

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.430 
well now you're gonna have to include
slack<00:00:52.379> off<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.690> maybe<00:00:54.690> with<00:00:54.960> something<00:00:55.289> like

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
slack off but maybe with something like

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
slack off but maybe with something like
T<00:00:55.710> wave<00:00:55.920> psychics<00:00:56.489> called<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.270> slack<00:00:58.079> off

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
T wave psychics called and slack off

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.689 
T wave psychics called and slack off
something<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:58.980> maybe<00:00:59.129> gonna<00:00:59.370> add<00:00:59.430> Fire

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
something like that maybe gonna add Fire

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
something like that maybe gonna add Fire
Blast<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.539> um<00:01:00.719> but<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.859> is

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
Blast here there um but this thing is

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.939 
Blast here there um but this thing is
gonna<00:01:02.309> be<00:01:02.550> a<00:01:02.579> huge<00:01:03.059> defensive<00:01:03.510> wall<00:01:03.960> now<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.409> I

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
gonna be a huge defensive wall now and I

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.109 
gonna be a huge defensive wall now and I
think<00:01:05.159> it's<00:01:05.309> still<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.760> used<00:01:06.000> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
think it's still going to get used a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.090 
think it's still going to get used a
little<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.330> more<00:01:06.570> than<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.590> original

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
little bit more than the original

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.770 
little bit more than the original
regenerator<00:01:08.700> slow<00:01:08.970> go<00:01:09.119> just<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
regenerator slow go just because of the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140 
regenerator slow go just because of the
huge<00:01:10.140> defense<00:01:10.560> boots<00:01:10.830> now<00:01:11.640> let's<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.030> out

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
huge defense boots now let's get out

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.910 
huge defense boots now let's get out
with<00:01:12.270> mega<00:01:12.540> d<00:01:12.750> know<00:01:12.900> which<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.200> course<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
with mega d know which of course is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.820 
with mega d know which of course is
going<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.280> have<00:01:14.430> normal<00:01:15.000> fairy<00:01:15.509> typing<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.170> it

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
going to have normal fairy typing on it

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.490 
going to have normal fairy typing on it
also<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.030> healer<00:01:18.840> ability

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
also is going to have healer ability

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.130 
also is going to have healer ability
which<00:01:19.860> again<00:01:20.490> not<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.240> great<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.479> what<00:01:22.110> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
which again not as great as what I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.219 
which again not as great as what I
thought<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.650> original<00:01:23.369> bility<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:24.020> but<00:01:25.020> it's

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
thought is original bility was but it's

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.450 
thought is original bility was but it's
going<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.470> get<00:01:25.530> some<00:01:25.680> pretty<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:25.979> boost<00:01:26.220> in

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
going to get some pretty good boost in

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to get some pretty good boost in
defense<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:27.119> special<00:01:27.390> attack<00:01:27.900> which<00:01:28.229> again

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
defense and special attack which again

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.080 
defense and special attack which again
can<00:01:29.009> make<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.310> thing<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.790> bit<00:01:29.970> more

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
can make this thing a little bit more

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.179 
can make this thing a little bit more
bulkier<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.350> can<00:01:31.470> get<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.799> special

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
bulkier and it can get its special

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.859 
bulkier and it can get its special
attack<00:01:32.400> moves<00:01:32.700> off<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.180> little<00:01:33.360> bit<00:01:33.630> better

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
attack moves off a little bit better

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.140 
attack moves off a little bit better
than<00:01:34.229> before<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.340> don't<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:36.000> how

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
than before so I don't really know how

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.840 
than before so I don't really know how
odd<00:01:36.659> email<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.500> be<00:01:37.680> used<00:01:37.920> honestly<00:01:38.579> I
