STX 25 days for the overheads but I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.719 
STX 25 days for the overheads but I
think<00:01:16.509> with<00:01:16.660> every<00:01:16.990> instrument<00:01:17.560> there's<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
think with every instrument there's a

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.210 
think with every instrument there's a
personality<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.899> voice<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.530> if<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.070> can

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
personality and a voice and if you can

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.170 
personality and a voice and if you can
connect<00:01:21.580> with<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:21.910> and<00:01:22.060> have<00:01:22.149> a

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
connect with that and have a

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.210 
connect with that and have a
conversation<00:01:22.450> with<00:01:22.899> it<00:01:23.200> then<00:01:23.920> you've<00:01:24.070> got

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
conversation with it then you've got

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.940 
conversation with it then you've got
this<00:01:24.399> relationship<00:01:25.119> with<00:01:25.390> your<00:01:25.600> drums<00:01:25.960> if<00:01:26.320> you

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
this relationship with your drums if you

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.920 
this relationship with your drums if you
can<00:01:27.130> capture<00:01:27.369> the<00:01:27.580> noise<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.450> instrument

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
can capture the noise of the instrument

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.570 
can capture the noise of the instrument
after<00:01:29.050> the<00:01:29.320> musician<00:01:29.740> knows<00:01:29.890> how<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.160> play<00:01:30.399> it

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
after the musician knows how to play it

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.969 
after the musician knows how to play it
that's<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.750> relationship<00:01:32.200> you<00:01:32.470> get<00:01:32.649> with<00:01:32.860> the

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
shall we say the microphones that are

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.839 
shall we say the microphones that are
being<00:02:22.569> used<00:02:22.870> but<00:02:23.410> also<00:02:23.470> on<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.190> sound<00:02:24.489> of<00:02:24.790> the

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
being used but also on the sound of the

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.120 
being used but also on the sound of the
instrument<00:02:25.150> itself<00:02:25.840> another<00:02:26.830> thing<00:02:27.040> that's

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
instrument itself another thing that's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.589 
instrument itself another thing that's
very<00:02:27.220> important<00:02:27.730> on<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:28.060> sound<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.450> your

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
very important on this sound is your

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.270 
very important on this sound is your
technique<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.290> instrument<00:02:29.770> because<00:02:30.130> if

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
technique on the instrument because if

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.589 
technique on the instrument because if
you<00:02:30.400> don't<00:02:30.580> know<00:02:30.670> how<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.849> get<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.030> proper<00:02:31.450> sound

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
you don't know how to get a proper sound

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.059 
you don't know how to get a proper sound
out<00:02:31.870> of<00:02:31.989> an<00:02:32.080> instrument<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.650> doesn't<00:02:32.890> matter

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
out of an instrument that doesn't matter

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.800 
out of an instrument that doesn't matter
how<00:02:33.220> good<00:02:33.459> the<00:02:33.640> instrument<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.660> not

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
how good the instrument is it's not

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:43.690 
how good the instrument is it's not
going<00:02:35.020> to<00:02:35.080> sound<00:02:35.230> that<00:02:35.440> good<00:02:35.650> so

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.979 

now<00:02:44.700> those<00:02:44.909> to<00:02:45.120> make<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.420> look<00:02:45.569> really<00:02:45.959> easy

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
now those to make it look really easy

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.990 
now those to make it look really easy
let's<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.069> ahead<00:02:47.129> move<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:47.760> you<00:02:47.819> can<00:02:47.969> see

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
let's go ahead move on so you can see

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:01.449 
let's go ahead move on so you can see
how<00:02:48.269> simple<00:02:48.569> this<00:02:48.810> fan<00:02:48.989> setup<00:02:49.379> is

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.399 

on<00:03:02.459> bass<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:03.030> simply<00:03:03.420> used<00:03:03.629> a<00:03:03.750> d6<00:03:04.109> on<00:03:04.319> the

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
on bass I simply used a d6 on the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.530 
on bass I simply used a d6 on the
cabinet<00:03:04.859> and<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.459> like<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.760> start<00:03:05.939> with<00:03:06.060> placing

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
cabinet and I like to start with placing

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.630 
cabinet and I like to start with placing
the<00:03:06.629> mic<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.959> the<00:03:06.989> middle<00:03:07.079> of<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.439> cone<00:03:07.680> this

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the mic in the middle of the cone this

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.309 
the mic in the middle of the cone this
usually<00:03:09.030> gives<00:03:09.150> me<00:03:09.329> a<00:03:09.359> good<00:03:09.599> balanced<00:03:09.959> tone<00:03:10.140> as

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
usually gives me a good balanced tone as

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.729 
usually gives me a good balanced tone as
well

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
well

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.559 
well
now<00:03:11.069> sometimes<00:03:11.579> I'll<00:03:11.790> even<00:03:11.939> angle<00:03:12.359> it<00:03:12.510> a

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
now sometimes I'll even angle it a

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.209 
now sometimes I'll even angle it a
little<00:03:12.750> bit<00:03:12.989> and<00:03:13.379> that<00:03:13.500> depends<00:03:13.799> on<00:03:13.950> the<00:03:14.040> size

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:14.219 
little bit and that depends on the size

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:16.610 
little bit and that depends on the size
of<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> speaker<00:03:14.819> as<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.810> can<00:03:16.140> see<00:03:16.349> though<00:03:16.590> I

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
of the speaker as you can see though I

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.229 
of the speaker as you can see though I
placed<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.189> as<00:03:17.280> far<00:03:17.519> away<00:03:17.670> as<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.879> could<00:03:18.090> from

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
placed it as far away as I could from

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.059 
placed it as far away as I could from
the<00:03:18.389> drum<00:03:18.629> and<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.349> kind<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.560> helps<00:03:19.829> with<00:03:19.980> the

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
the drum and that kind of helps with the

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:44.949 
the drum and that kind of helps with the
bleed<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.579> live

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.410 

the<00:03:45.859> guitar<00:03:46.189> is<00:03:46.340> another<00:03:46.640> perfect<00:03:46.939> simple

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
the guitar is another perfect simple

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.080 
the guitar is another perfect simple
setup<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.530> I<00:03:48.560> just<00:03:48.769> used<00:03:48.950> an<00:03:49.069> i-5<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.609> that<00:03:49.819> I

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
setup and I just used an i-5 on that I

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.149 
setup and I just used an i-5 on that I
placed<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.930> i-5<00:03:51.230> about<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> half<00:03:51.799> an<00:03:51.950> inch<00:03:52.040> from

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
placed the i-5 about a half an inch from

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:54.160 
placed the i-5 about a half an inch from
the<00:03:52.370> grill<00:03:52.579> cloth<00:03:52.819> pointing<00:03:53.659> at<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.870> center

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
the grill cloth pointing at the center

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.039 
the grill cloth pointing at the center
of<00:03:54.260> the<00:03:54.349> speaker<00:03:54.709> cone<00:03:54.890> at<00:03:55.280> a<00:03:55.400> slight<00:03:55.790> angle<00:03:56.049> if

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
of the speaker cone at a slight angle if

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:58.869 
of the speaker cone at a slight angle if
you're<00:03:57.290> using<00:03:57.469> one<00:03:57.739> mic<00:03:57.980> this<00:03:58.430> is<00:03:58.609> a<00:03:58.640> good

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
you're using one mic this is a good

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.610 
you're using one mic this is a good
place<00:03:59.060> to<00:03:59.239> start<00:03:59.510> and<00:03:59.750> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.170> play<00:04:00.379> with<00:04:00.530> the

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
place to start and you can play with the

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.959 
place to start and you can play with the
placement<00:04:01.069> a<00:04:01.129> little<00:04:01.400> bit<00:04:01.519> to<00:04:01.609> change<00:04:01.790> your

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:01.969 
placement a little bit to change your

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:21.250 
placement a little bit to change your
tone

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.230 

the<00:04:22.260> organ<00:04:22.590> had<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> rotary<00:04:23.100> speaker<00:04:23.430> system<00:04:23.910> so

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
the organ had a rotary speaker system so

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760 
the organ had a rotary speaker system so
I<00:04:24.270> used<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.570> d6<00:04:24.960> at<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.290> bottom<00:04:25.560> of<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
I used to d6 at the bottom of the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.500 
I used to d6 at the bottom of the
cabinet<00:04:26.160> and<00:04:26.310> that<00:04:26.400> captured<00:04:26.940> the<00:04:27.060> bass<00:04:27.240> tone

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
cabinet and that captured the bass tone

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.350 
cabinet and that captured the bass tone
I<00:04:27.780> also<00:04:28.380> used<00:04:28.530> an<00:04:28.680> i-5<00:04:29.010> for<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.340> top-end<00:04:29.550> now

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
I also used an i-5 for the top-end now

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.510 
I also used an i-5 for the top-end now
these<00:04:30.540> two<00:04:30.780> mics<00:04:31.050> isolate<00:04:31.830> very<00:04:32.070> well<00:04:32.280> in<00:04:32.400> this

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
these two mics isolate very well in this

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.370 
these two mics isolate very well in this
live<00:04:32.760> situation<00:04:33.390> let's<00:04:33.930> go<00:04:34.020> ahead<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.230> take<00:04:34.350> a

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
live situation let's go ahead and take a

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.260 
live situation let's go ahead and take a
listen

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.330 

now<00:04:40.840> last<00:04:41.110> but<00:04:41.229> not<00:04:41.440> least<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.860> vocals<00:04:42.250> and

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
now last but not least the vocals and

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:49.720 
now last but not least the vocals and
harmonica

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.240 

and<00:04:50.600> we<00:04:50.720> used<00:04:50.900> in<00:04:51.050> om7<00:04:51.470> which<00:04:51.770> is<00:04:51.920> a<00:04:51.950> really

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
and we used in om7 which is a really

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.220 
and we used in om7 which is a really
versatile<00:04:52.730> mic<00:04:53.000> it's<00:04:53.570> great<00:04:53.810> for<00:04:53.990> a<00:04:54.050> live

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
versatile mic it's great for a live

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.110 
versatile mic it's great for a live
situation<00:04:54.470> like<00:04:54.950> this<00:04:55.130> because<00:04:55.670> it<00:04:55.970> has<00:04:56.060> a

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
situation like this because it has a

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.120 
situation like this because it has a
tight<00:04:56.420> pattern<00:04:56.660> so<00:04:57.260> it's<00:04:57.410> really<00:04:57.560> resistant

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
tight pattern so it's really resistant

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:07.350 
tight pattern so it's really resistant
to<00:04:58.220> feedback

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.719 

many<00:05:08.289> of<00:05:08.409> the<00:05:08.530> so-called<00:05:08.740> live<00:05:09.189> videos<00:05:09.550> that

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:09.729 
many of the so-called live videos that
