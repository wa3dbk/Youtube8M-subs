the<00:01:45.329> needle<00:01:46.220> put<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> end<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> needle

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
the needle put the end of the needle

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.980 
the needle put the end of the needle
into<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.479> loop<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.850> then<00:01:50.850> pull<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.720> clip

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
into the loop and then pull the clip

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
into the loop and then pull the clip
down<00:01:52.439> onto<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.340> leader<00:01:55.250> then<00:01:56.250> you<00:01:56.369> take<00:01:56.579> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
down onto the leader then you take the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.870 
down onto the leader then you take the
tail<00:01:56.939> rubber<00:01:57.560> again<00:01:58.560> push<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> tail<00:01:59.610> rubber

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
tail rubber again push the tail rubber

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.080 
tail rubber again push the tail rubber
onto<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.299> needle<00:02:01.430> take<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.579> loop<00:02:02.759> at<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.000> end

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
onto the needle take the loop at the end

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
onto the needle take the loop at the end
of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> leader<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.439> one<00:02:04.469> where<00:02:04.799> your<00:02:04.950> real

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
of the leader the one where your real

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.770 
of the leader the one where your real
line<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.729> go<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.780> then<00:02:08.660> pull<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
line is going to go and then pull the

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.059 
line is going to go and then pull the
tail<00:02:10.020> rubber<00:02:10.289> down<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.950> same

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
tail rubber down just the same

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.869 
tail rubber down just the same
slide<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.939> down<00:02:13.180> to<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.079> business<00:02:14.469> end<00:02:14.879> now

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
slide that down to the business end now

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:17.280 
slide that down to the business end now
we've<00:02:15.999> got<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> little<00:02:16.299> bit<00:02:16.510> more<00:02:16.689> work<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.139> do

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
we've got a little bit more work to do

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.800 
we've got a little bit more work to do
yet<00:02:17.939> obviously<00:02:18.939> I<00:02:18.969> need<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.329> show<00:02:19.510> you<00:02:19.599> how<00:02:19.749> to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
yet obviously I need to show you how to

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.989 
yet obviously I need to show you how to
put<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.200> lid<00:02:20.379> on<00:02:20.409> but<00:02:20.829> first<00:02:21.069> of<00:02:21.280> all<00:02:21.459> let's

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
put the lid on but first of all let's

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.580 
put the lid on but first of all let's
look<00:02:22.180> at<00:02:22.329> how<00:02:22.480> you<00:02:22.540> connect<00:02:22.989> this<00:02:23.109> to<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.319> main

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
look at how you connect this to the main

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.949 
look at how you connect this to the main
line<00:02:23.829> and<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.099> use<00:02:24.489> what's<00:02:25.150> called<00:02:25.269> a<00:02:25.510> loop<00:02:25.719> to

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
line and I use what's called a loop to

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.199 
line and I use what's called a loop to
loop<00:02:26.109> connection<00:02:26.769> this<00:02:27.430> is<00:02:27.549> very<00:02:27.730> simple<00:02:28.060> to

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
loop connection this is very simple to

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.170 
loop connection this is very simple to
do<00:02:28.650> take<00:02:29.650> about<00:02:29.950> 10<00:02:30.250> inches<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.609> line<00:02:30.909> and

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
do take about 10 inches a line and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.879 
do take about 10 inches a line and
double<00:02:31.719> it<00:02:31.780> over<00:02:31.989> forming<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:33.010> big<00:02:33.219> open<00:02:33.579> loop

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
double it over forming a big open loop

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.589 
double it over forming a big open loop
close<00:02:35.889> the<00:02:36.040> loop<00:02:36.250> up<00:02:36.459> by<00:02:36.670> holding<00:02:37.150> it<00:02:37.299> so<00:02:37.480> that

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
close the loop up by holding it so that

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.929 
close the loop up by holding it so that
it's<00:02:37.719> doubled<00:02:38.139> like<00:02:38.349> this<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.889> then<00:02:39.639> form

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:39.939 
it's doubled like this and then form

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.009 
it's doubled like this and then form
another<00:02:40.209> loop<00:02:41.549> passing<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:43.329> loop<00:02:43.540> in<00:02:43.749> the<00:02:43.840> end

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
another loop passing the loop in the end

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.259 
another loop passing the loop in the end
of<00:02:44.319> the<00:02:44.439> doubled<00:02:44.769> section<00:02:45.250> through<00:02:45.969> the<00:02:46.120> new

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
of the doubled section through the new

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.309 
of the doubled section through the new
loop<00:02:46.569> twice<00:02:47.790> then<00:02:48.810> moisten<00:02:49.810> they're<00:02:50.169> not

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
loop twice then moisten they're not

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.550 
loop twice then moisten they're not
always<00:02:50.560> moisten<00:02:51.099> your<00:02:51.310> fishing<00:02:51.819> knots<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
always moisten your fishing knots and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.699 
always moisten your fishing knots and
pull<00:02:54.540> everything<00:02:55.540> tight<00:02:56.019> so<00:02:56.319> you've<00:02:56.439> now<00:02:56.650> got

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
pull everything tight so you've now got

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.949 
pull everything tight so you've now got
a<00:02:56.889> loop<00:02:57.129> in<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.400> end<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.669> your<00:02:57.790> line<00:02:57.969> you<00:02:58.269> trim

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
a loop in the end of your line you trim

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.360 
a loop in the end of your line you trim
off<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.260> tag<00:03:01.439> either<00:03:02.439> with<00:03:02.799> some<00:03:02.980> scissors

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
off this tag either with some scissors

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.949 
off this tag either with some scissors
or<00:03:03.519> if<00:03:03.639> you<00:03:03.760> got<00:03:03.939> sharp<00:03:04.239> teeth<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.689> can<00:03:04.810> do<00:03:04.900> it

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
or if you got sharp teeth you can do it

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.899 
or if you got sharp teeth you can do it
with<00:03:05.049> your<00:03:05.169> teeth<00:03:05.349> if<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.709> want<00:03:05.889> but<00:03:06.609> anyway

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
with your teeth if you want but anyway

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.729 
with your teeth if you want but anyway
the<00:03:07.060> point<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.419> you've<00:03:07.629> now<00:03:07.840> got<00:03:07.900> a<00:03:08.109> loop<00:03:08.500> in

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
the point is you've now got a loop in

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.490 
the point is you've now got a loop in
the<00:03:08.949> end<00:03:09.099> of<00:03:09.219> your<00:03:09.310> main<00:03:09.489> line<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:11.290> way<00:03:11.439> you

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
the end of your main line the way you

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.319 
the end of your main line the way you
connect<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.010> to<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.189> leader<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.639> very<00:03:12.849> simple

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
connect it to the leader is very simple

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:15.059 
connect it to the leader is very simple
take<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.079> loop<00:03:14.260> in<00:03:14.439> the<00:03:14.530> end<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.889> main

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
take the loop in the end of the main

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.879 
take the loop in the end of the main
line<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.720> look<00:03:16.930> at<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.139> loop<00:03:17.319> in<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.620> end<00:03:17.769> of

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
line and look at the loop in the end of

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.599 
line and look at the loop in the end of
the<00:03:17.979> leader<00:03:18.189> the<00:03:19.180> real<00:03:19.389> end<00:03:19.629> one<00:03:20.189> push<00:03:21.189> the

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
the end of the main line and then draw

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.069 
the end of the main line and then draw
the<00:03:35.859> whole<00:03:36.129> thing<00:03:36.430> up<00:03:36.549> tight<00:03:36.879> and<00:03:37.180> what<00:03:37.989> you

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
the whole thing up tight and what you

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.409 
the whole thing up tight and what you
end<00:03:38.109> up<00:03:38.409> with<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.889> a<00:03:39.129> very<00:03:39.519> good<00:03:39.609> loop<00:03:40.090> to<00:03:40.299> loop

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
end up with is a very good loop to loop

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.439 
end up with is a very good loop to loop

me down and the beauty of it is is that
if<00:03:46.599> you<00:03:46.720> just<00:03:46.959> push<00:03:47.199> this<00:03:47.409> open<00:03:47.889> and<00:03:48.479> then<00:03:49.479> feed

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
if you just push this open and then feed

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.569 
if you just push this open and then feed
the<00:03:50.109> leader<00:03:50.319> back<00:03:50.709> through<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.159> loop<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.519> the

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
the leader back through the loop and the

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.699 
the leader back through the loop and the
main<00:03:51.759> line<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.449> whole<00:03:52.659> thing<00:03:52.959> disconnects<00:03:53.650> so

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
main line the whole thing disconnects so

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.349 
main line the whole thing disconnects so
you<00:03:53.799> can<00:03:53.919> change<00:03:54.159> leaders<00:03:54.579> instantly<00:03:55.090> it's

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
you can change leaders instantly it's

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.550 
you can change leaders instantly it's
very<00:03:55.569> very<00:03:55.840> easy<00:03:57.840> we<00:03:58.840> won't<00:03:59.019> do<00:03:59.169> that<00:03:59.229> now

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
very very easy we won't do that now

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.319 
very very easy we won't do that now
though<00:03:59.829> because<00:04:00.579> what<00:04:00.759> we<00:04:00.849> want<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.120> do<00:04:01.209> at

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
though because what we want to do at

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:03.589 
though because what we want to do at
this<00:04:01.419> stage<00:04:01.479> is<00:04:02.019> to<00:04:02.319> connect<00:04:02.620> the<00:04:02.650> lead<00:04:02.889> on

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
this stage is to connect the lead on

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.800 
this stage is to connect the lead on
that's<00:04:04.599> really<00:04:04.900> very<00:04:05.079> simple<00:04:06.449> let's<00:04:07.449> go<00:04:07.599> back

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
that's really very simple let's go back

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.259 
that's really very simple let's go back
down<00:04:08.019> to<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.199> clip<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:08.739> rubber<00:04:09.269> you'll

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
down to the clip and the rubber you'll

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:11.789 
down to the clip and the rubber you'll
find<00:04:10.539> that<00:04:10.659> there's<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.840> little<00:04:11.109> lug<00:04:11.349> here<00:04:11.620> on

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
find that there's a little lug here on

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.949 
find that there's a little lug here on
the<00:04:11.919> clip<00:04:12.219> if<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:13.209> open<00:04:13.509> that<00:04:13.689> up

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
the clip if you just open that up

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.759 
the clip if you just open that up
slightly<00:04:14.819> take<00:04:15.819> your<00:04:15.969> lead<00:04:16.320> push<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.440> onto<00:04:17.620> the

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
slightly take your lead push it onto the

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.879 
slightly take your lead push it onto the
lug<00:04:18.039> so<00:04:18.280> it<00:04:18.370> sits<00:04:18.639> on<00:04:19.229> the<00:04:20.229> little<00:04:20.349> recess

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:20.889 
lug so it sits on the little recess

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:23.879 
lug so it sits on the little recess
below<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.549> then<00:04:22.120> push<00:04:22.539> the<00:04:22.840> tail<00:04:23.349> rubber<00:04:23.620> just

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
below and then push the tail rubber just

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:25.880 
below and then push the tail rubber just
feed<00:04:24.159> it<00:04:24.190> onto<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.760> clip

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
feed it onto the clip

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.630 
feed it onto the clip
like<00:04:26.890> this<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:28.090> your<00:04:28.210> legs<00:04:28.390> now<00:04:28.600> connected

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
like this and your legs now connected

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.810 
like this and your legs now connected
then<00:04:30.640> you<00:04:31.330> pull<00:04:31.540> the<00:04:31.660> ring<00:04:31.840> swivel<00:04:32.350> up<00:04:33.010> inside

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
then you pull the ring swivel up inside

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.540 
then you pull the ring swivel up inside
the<00:04:34.060> clip<00:04:34.300> like<00:04:34.540> this<00:04:34.950> and<00:04:35.950> what<00:04:36.100> you've<00:04:36.250> got

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
the clip like this and what you've got

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.010 
the clip like this and what you've got
is<00:04:37.480> a<00:04:37.540> nice<00:04:37.810> heavy<00:04:38.110> bolt<00:04:38.470> rig<00:04:38.680> effect<00:04:39.840> so<00:04:40.840> why

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
is a nice heavy bolt rig effect so why

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.780 
is a nice heavy bolt rig effect so why
do<00:04:41.080> you<00:04:41.260> use<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.680> leader<00:04:41.980> well<00:04:42.220> it's<00:04:42.340> twofold

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
do you use this leader well it's twofold

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.120 
do you use this leader well it's twofold
really<00:04:43.300> first<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.840> all<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.200> fact<00:04:44.800> that<00:04:44.920> it's

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
really first of all the fact that it's

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.680 
really first of all the fact that it's
thicker<00:04:45.400> than<00:04:45.490> your<00:04:45.730> main<00:04:45.910> line<00:04:46.150> prevents

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
thicker than your main line prevents

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.440 
thicker than your main line prevents
tangles<00:04:47.170> when<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.440> cast<00:04:48.000> secondly<00:04:49.000> because

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
tangles when you cast secondly because

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.810 
tangles when you cast secondly because
the<00:04:49.780> leaders<00:04:50.110> impregnated<00:04:50.890> with<00:04:50.920> tungsten<00:04:51.340> it

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
the leaders impregnated with tungsten it

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.120 
the leaders impregnated with tungsten it
sinks<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.510> it<00:04:52.900> pins<00:04:53.200> down<00:04:53.440> the<00:04:53.650> line<00:04:53.860> behind

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
sinks and it pins down the line behind

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.820 
sinks and it pins down the line behind
the<00:04:54.670> lead<00:04:54.880> so<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.420> if<00:04:55.510> any<00:04:55.720> fish<00:04:56.020> feed<00:04:56.680> around

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
the lead so that if any fish feed around

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.290 
the lead so that if any fish feed around
your<00:04:57.190> hook<00:04:57.340> bait<00:04:57.580> they're<00:04:57.760> not<00:04:57.880> going<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.090> swim

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
your hook bait they're not going to swim

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.120 
your hook bait they're not going to swim
into<00:04:58.480> your<00:04:58.720> line<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.080> become<00:04:59.620> alarmed<00:04:59.860> or

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
into your line and become alarmed or

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.060 
into your line and become alarmed or
spook<00:05:00.520> out<00:05:00.730> of<00:05:00.910> the<00:05:01.000> area<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:02.140> it<00:05:02.470> helps<00:05:02.950> to

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
spook out of the area so it helps to

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.760 
spook out of the area so it helps to
prevent<00:05:03.340> spooking<00:05:03.940> fish<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.960> stuff<00:05:05.260> is<00:05:05.410> much

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
prevent spooking fish this stuff is much

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.430 
prevent spooking fish this stuff is much

which is very rough and can catch under
the<00:05:10.420> fish<00:05:10.570> scales<00:05:11.080> this<00:05:11.680> is<00:05:11.860> slippery<00:05:12.310> and

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
the fish scales this is slippery and

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.670 
the fish scales this is slippery and
won't<00:05:12.670> damage<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.090> fishy<00:05:13.420> scales<00:05:13.870> but<00:05:14.560> it

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
won't damage the fishy scales but it

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.770 
won't damage the fishy scales but it
will<00:05:14.770> still<00:05:14.980> pin<00:05:15.250> it<00:05:15.370> down<00:05:15.480> now<00:05:16.480> the<00:05:16.600> other

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
will still pin it down now the other

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
important point about this leader is

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.940 
important point about this leader is
that<00:05:18.910> it's<00:05:19.060> very<00:05:19.210> very<00:05:19.540> carp<00:05:19.870> safe<00:05:20.230> let's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
that it's very very carp safe let's

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.710 
that it's very very carp safe let's
imagine<00:05:21.250> that<00:05:21.520> you<00:05:21.820> crack<00:05:22.120> this<00:05:22.300> rig<00:05:22.540> off

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
imagine that you crack this rig off

imagine that you crack this rig off
maybe<00:05:23.020> you<00:05:23.230> cast<00:05:23.470> out<00:05:23.740> into<00:05:23.770> the<00:05:24.160> lake<00:05:24.310> with

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
maybe you cast out into the lake with

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.790 
maybe you cast out into the lake with

leader<00:05:35.110> and<00:05:35.440> a<00:05:35.560> great<00:05:35.710> big<00:05:35.980> heavy<00:05:36.190> lead<00:05:36.400> we

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.370 
leader and a great big heavy lead we
obviously<00:05:36.730> don't<00:05:37.120> want<00:05:37.420> that<00:05:37.600> because<00:05:37.840> the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
obviously don't want that because the

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.500 
obviously don't want that because the
cop<00:05:38.620> might<00:05:38.860> become<00:05:39.220> tethered<00:05:39.610> up<00:05:39.760> and<00:05:39.970> and<00:05:40.180> it

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
cop might become tethered up and and it

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.720 
cop might become tethered up and and it
might<00:05:40.690> injure<00:05:41.050> itself<00:05:41.230> so<00:05:41.800> what<00:05:42.430> we're<00:05:42.580> after

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730 
might injure itself so what we're after

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.020 
might injure itself so what we're after
is<00:05:43.150> a<00:05:43.780> bolt<00:05:44.650> rig<00:05:44.890> type<00:05:45.160> setup<00:05:45.520> that<00:05:45.910> will

is a bolt rig type setup that will

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.820 
is a bolt rig type setup that will
actually<00:05:46.150> disengage<00:05:46.900> and<00:05:46.930> disconnect<00:05:47.680> so

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
actually disengage and disconnect so

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.830 
actually disengage and disconnect so
what<00:05:47.980> happens<00:05:48.280> in<00:05:48.400> this<00:05:48.520> case<00:05:48.820> is<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.570> under

what happens in this case is that under

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.720 
what happens in this case is that under
moderate<00:05:50.140> pressure<00:05:50.470> should<00:05:51.280> this<00:05:51.460> lead<00:05:51.700> a

moderate pressure should this lead a

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.060 
moderate pressure should this lead a

end it will slide all the way up the

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.340 
end it will slide all the way up the
leader<00:05:59.320> and<00:06:00.480> when<00:06:01.480> it's<00:06:01.600> wet<00:06:01.840> it's<00:06:02.110> very

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
leader and when it's wet it's very

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.740 
leader and when it's wet it's very
slippery<00:06:02.800> it<00:06:03.280> will<00:06:03.490> just<00:06:03.520> pull<00:06:03.970> off<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:04.300> loop

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
slippery it will just pull off the loop

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.570 
slippery it will just pull off the loop
at<00:06:04.930> the<00:06:04.960> top<00:06:05.050> the<00:06:05.410> whole<00:06:05.590> LED<00:06:05.950> system<00:06:06.220> will

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
at the top the whole LED system will

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.690 
at the top the whole LED system will
fall<00:06:06.820> off<00:06:07.260> the<00:06:08.260> other<00:06:08.410> alternative<00:06:08.800> is<00:06:09.610> that

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
fall off the other alternative is that

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.880 
fall off the other alternative is that
under<00:06:10.270> certain<00:06:10.600> amount<00:06:10.960> of<00:06:10.990> pressure<00:06:11.260> the

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
under certain amount of pressure the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.800 
under certain amount of pressure the
tail<00:06:12.160> rubber<00:06:12.490> will<00:06:13.060> literally<00:06:13.330> pull<00:06:13.660> away

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
tail rubber will literally pull away

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.840 
tail rubber will literally pull away
from<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.200> clip<00:06:14.500> and<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.130> ladle<00:06:15.460> fall<00:06:15.640> off

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
from the clip and the ladle fall off

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.630 
from the clip and the ladle fall off
there<00:06:16.150> so<00:06:16.600> it's<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.870> very<00:06:16.900> very<00:06:17.560> carp<00:06:17.980> safe<00:06:18.310> way

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640 
there so it's a very very carp safe way

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.870 
there so it's a very very carp safe way
of<00:06:19.470> connecting<00:06:20.470> up<00:06:20.860> your<00:06:21.130> lead<00:06:21.340> to<00:06:21.760> the

weed and silt butt is not so good for
bag<00:06:49.539> work<00:06:49.809> but<00:06:50.559> the<00:06:50.739> principal<00:06:51.279> will<00:06:51.429> be

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
bag work but the principal will be

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.950 
bag work but the principal will be
pretty<00:06:51.969> much<00:06:52.149> the<00:06:52.209> same
