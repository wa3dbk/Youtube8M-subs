00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Now welcome if not for all of us 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.899
 to make some mandarin cupcakes that 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
 enough of the recipes in this book 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.700
 goal perfect cupcake 2 of alba 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.380
 obregÃ³n and to do it we are going to need 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.230
 The following ingredients for the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.029
 cake we're going to need 60 grams of 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 wheat flour 75 grams of sugar 2 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.849
 eggs 40 milliliters of juice 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.539
 tangerine the skin of a tangerine 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.110
 grated 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.540
 30 ml of oil in my case is oil 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.329
 olive smooth and a quarter teaspoon 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.070
 clinical yeast powder to make 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.140
 the cake the first thing we have to 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.420
 do is put the preheated oven to 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.719
 180 degrees with heat above and by 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.329
 down 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.070
 now let's move on to separate the clear 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.199
 of the yolk of the eggs the whites 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.070
 will in large bowl as 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.070
 then we have to ride 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.460
 and we put the yolks in a glass 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.520
 big 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:03.850
 in a bowl we add the yeast flour 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.909
 powder and about 140 grams of 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.860
 sugar that we come and we mix everything 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.020
 all right 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.290
 once we have it is to raise mixed 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.280
 let's move to add the yolks 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.360
 mandarin juice 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.550
 oil and grated porridges 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.650
 tangerine 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.160
 and let's mix everything well with help 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.290
 of a fork then let's go 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.630
 adding in the mixture of the yolks to the 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.750
 mix dry little by little and without stopping 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.750
 shake 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.619
 once it is well mixed we 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.869
 we went to the edge where we had the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.280
 We are going to move on to clear it with 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.509
 help of some rods until 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.509
 begin to be foamy 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.810
 once it starts to be frothy 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.970
 let's go adding the rest of sugar 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.119
 that we had little by little and beating the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.119
 time 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.750
 we have the meringue ready as you can 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.060
 see is very very firm 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.910
 so let's add 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.340
 up to more than a third of the medium 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.710
 English 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.960
 and with the help of a pastry tongue 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.960
 let's go with enveloping movements 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.890
 once one is well incorporated 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.890
 third part of the meringue we add everything 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.440
 and the same as before we incorporated it by 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.440
 envolvent movements 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.890
 we already have the mass ready and we have 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.480
 also list the tray what we're going to 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.100
 make our cupcakes I have 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.870
 bought in amazon and if you want to know the 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.030
 exact model I will leave the link to 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.310
 the description I have put these 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.290
 capsules for cupcakes and if you do not have the 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.450
 tray you can put two units for 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.520
 that it will not be now with this 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.970
 ice cream scoop 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.490
 I'm going to take mass and we'll go 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.040
 putting in each one of the capsules and 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.080
 so until we finish the dough we have already 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.060
 put all the mass of the capsules and the 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.490
 moon is preheated so we're going to 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.700
 put we are going to leave the 180 degrees 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:18.500
 celsius with heat above and below 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.660
 To complement the bizcochitos we are going to 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.120
 make a whipped cream so let's go 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.560
 need 100 milliliters of goal to 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.580
 Spread or cream to beat with 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.830
 approximately 35% fat 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.570
 10 grams of icing sugar and to decorate 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.270
 we are going to use some slices of mandarin 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.670
 The first thing we will do is ride 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:39.650
 the cream for it is very important that 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.810
 both the cream the bowl and the rods 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.910
 the blender are very very cold and I 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.660
 I'm very cold so I'm going to start 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.870
 beat until it's a little 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.790
 ace 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.280
 once the cream begins to think a 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.870
 little we add the icing sugar and 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.530
 we beat until it is completely 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.530
 mounted 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.990
 we have the whipped cream completely 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.450
 As you can see it is very firm and formed 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.130
 the yellowish grooves now we're going to 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.570
 put a film and we will keep them in the 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.270
 refrigerator while we continue with the 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.010
 recipe have passed 20 minutes and our 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.960
 bizcochitos are already ready so 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.600
 let's take them out let's check that 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.250
 they are already made with the help of a toothpick 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.290
 As you can see it will be totally clean 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.820
 so now they're ready let's close 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.290
 five minutes to remove us from the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.150
 tray and let it cool 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.860
 they have completely cooled down 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.350
 completely and we can move on to 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.390
 decorate them to avoid shrinking 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.760
 as it has happened to me or have 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.620
 cool in a rack a little below 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.870
 this way and so we will have that gap 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.360
 but nothing happens since we 're going to 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.190
 cover for decoration to decorate 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.170
 I put half the cream in one 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.700
 pastry bag I have put a clip 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.950
 here so that it does not come out on the outside 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.050
 content and I have cut it like I from a 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.740
 scissors and we are going to decorate the 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.280
 I'm going to put the sleeve in half and go 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.280
 to press 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:06.280
 until we see that we have the cream that 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.280
 we want and so with all 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.160
 and now we only have to put each one 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.620
 from them 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.540
 a tangerine bass on top and so on 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.670
 we will do with all 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:19.010
 we have finished decorating all 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.830
 our cupcakes as you can see have 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.990
 stayed precious and are very happy if 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.580
 you can decorate it also in 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.770
 place of cream with a deck of 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.210
 chocolate but it will be such a recipe 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.980
 light like this 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.250
 I'll go to try one to see how 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.250
 is it so 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.240
 it's great 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:46.400
 and I hope you liked it if you like 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.110

 social that I'm going to leave the links 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:00.850
 to the decision a little kiss and until the 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.850
 next recipe goodbye
