00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
look better put in some water paper in a

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.860 
look better put in some water paper in a
tray<00:04:31.710> we<00:04:31.980> play<00:04:32.220> the<00:04:32.280> pizza<00:04:32.910> don't<00:04:33.510> worry<00:04:33.720> if

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870
