00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Alex Pastor Jan we had good trouble 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.960
 here at ado the hague points at one 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.560
 go get it and 209 layer yes what is now 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.560
 story 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 well disappointment because two after loss 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.160
 Is not fun 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.539
 And the way that is is also 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.980
 not fun 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 we are ten with because 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.980
 because Kevin Conboy makes you a red one again 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.980
 card receives a legitimate incidentally and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.660
 and also because we have one in the second half 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.920
 play better football than ado and yet 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.239
 to be with the points to get so 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.910
 yes that disappoints 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.010
 Kevin Como also red cards so three 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.870
 time this year 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 yes what do you say then we what do you think 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.250
 then at that time 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 well look at the moment in you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.520
 match happens then you don't see 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.170
 exactly what happens there you have 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520
 just need the images because you 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010
 is about the same height with you 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.289
 eyes 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.609
 I saw the images afterwards and that 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.680
 is no doubt about it 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.089
 so first still hold neat but me 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.970
 do you think then stand my stretch you 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:09.320
 leg out and that just makes it one 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.820
 risky action and and if you see that 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.960
 there is still justified necklaces 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.009
 I can sit there too 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.600
 but that just wasn't true and understood 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.430
 my bb there completely ready I am there 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.720
 completely done with it 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.450
 why do you do something like that you can do that too 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.189
 present proposals at the moment 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.789
 you've been making the mistake once 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.340
 it's a repeat pattern so whether you 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.789
 want to apologize or 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.500
 science want 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.830
 want to offer that that does not shoot 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.319
 on you have to keep doing it 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.479
 yes then you will hear your be changed 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:42.920
 lee pretty frustrating right 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.459
 while taking the money off 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.500
 q that performance yes what do you think yourself 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.390
 if you have only five all your life 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.170
 minutes of sport than you know 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.520
 you that that hurts and and 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.310
 necessarily wanted to go with four defenders 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.720
 play and it is a rule when you get there 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.729
 want to bring one in and then less too 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.580
 give your stories why you want them 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.209
 made a choice for precisely that assignment 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.970
 after you want 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:10.250
 441 and then you have the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.959
 outside people needed who can 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.489
 attacks if you have the ball but also 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.590
 midfielder in particular can and must 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.970
 to be one that you do not have the ball 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.940
 well and nick van der fields and whining 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.550
 that is just a bit more than leroy 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.840
 so that we ourselves live by rays 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.550
 of course a dragon for remy 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.780
 amieux correct the person who is on the left 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.980
 he got a player inside 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.360
 passed by 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.470
 first always nec you need me the second 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.720
 in the middle of the year it was already a piece 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.060
 better and trainer 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.890
 yes before you do it on the job of that 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:43.330
 second half feeling that there is still something 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.330
 is all of the want that seems to me so 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.170
 the pump hit the bar once 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 have another goal in the final phase 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.530
 made and for the rest 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.150
 I thought we were doing very well 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.290
 were in control even lord and 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.170
 master 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.060
 play football much better and that with one 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.180
 man less and far from ours it applied 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.840
 that's a high position feeling about that 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.690
 on another side you also hope 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.710
 that the spa together have chances that you have that 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.660
 he then 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.830
 I agree that there is a lot here 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.150
 think it was deserved 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.950
 if we have a minimum one point here 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 had taken with them 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.710
 Natalia also wants a player that today 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.450
 make a good impression 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.460
 few times alone at one of a the port 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.290
 anyway defending was good on it 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.710
 style and see you again one 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.070
 certain young woman just say yes 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.210
 pick it up and develop it when you look 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.090
 the second half 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:35.070
 how we played football that is 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.440
 just really good is the money for it 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.520
 of all players 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.520
 thank you please
