we're updating from laughing 556 29.5 61
so<00:00:47.120> we're<00:00:47.270> going<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:47.449> answer<00:00:47.570> yes<00:00:47.900> to<00:00:47.930> this

00:00:48.189 --> 00:00:48.199 
so we're going to answer yes to this

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.780 
so we're going to answer yes to this
question<00:00:51.280> and<00:00:52.280> then<00:00:52.400> we'll<00:00:52.430> begin<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
question and then we'll begin the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.540 
question and then we'll begin the
updating<00:00:53.239> process<00:00:54.010> this<00:00:55.010> takes<00:00:55.250> quite<00:00:55.400> a<00:00:55.460> bit

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
updating process this takes quite a bit

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.030 
updating process this takes quite a bit
of<00:00:55.670> time<00:00:55.910> as<00:00:56.180> unit<00:00:56.839> goes<00:00:56.989> through<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.559> updates

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
of time as unit goes through and updates

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.320 
of time as unit goes through and updates
all<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.220> different<00:00:58.550> modules<00:00:58.699> internally<00:00:59.300> on

00:00:59.320 --> 00:00:59.330 
all the different modules internally on

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.060 
all the different modules internally on
the<00:00:59.449> radio<00:00:59.720> during<00:01:00.350> this<00:01:00.440> time<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.860> car

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
the radio during this time the car

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.100 
the radio during this time the car
should<00:01:01.250> be<00:01:01.309> running<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:02.690> make<00:01:02.809> sure<00:01:02.960> there's

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
should be running to make sure there's

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.329 
should be running to make sure there's
not<00:01:03.199> gonna<00:01:03.350> have<00:01:03.470> an<00:01:03.530> issue<00:01:03.620> with<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.980> pad<00:01:04.160> or

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
not gonna have an issue with the pad or

not gonna have an issue with the pad or
something<00:01:04.519> like<00:01:04.729> that<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.000> normally<00:01:05.780> takes

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
something like that so normally takes

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.180 
something like that so normally takes
about<00:01:06.050> 10<00:01:06.290> minutes<00:01:06.320> or<00:01:06.619> so<00:01:09.009> i'm<00:01:10.009> in<00:01:10.100> the
