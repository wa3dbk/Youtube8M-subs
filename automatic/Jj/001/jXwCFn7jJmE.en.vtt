pressure<00:02:56.570> line<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:58.090> put<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.240> new<00:03:01.810> evaporator

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
pressure line and put the new evaporator

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.940 
pressure line and put the new evaporator
or<00:03:03.080> thermal<00:03:04.010> expansion<00:03:04.400> valve<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:05.710> vacuum<00:03:06.710> the

or thermal expansion valve on vacuum the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.300 
or thermal expansion valve on vacuum the
system<00:03:07.280> and<00:03:08.210> charge<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.020> up<00:03:09.110> with<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.620> correct

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
system and charge it up with the correct

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.760 
system and charge it up with the correct
amount<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.820> freon<00:03:11.300> hopefully<00:03:12.290> this<00:03:12.440> will<00:03:12.560> fix

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
amount of freon hopefully this will fix

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.030 
amount of freon hopefully this will fix
my<00:03:13.010> my<00:03:13.880> leak<00:03:14.150> and<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.020> reason<00:03:15.290> I'm<00:03:15.410> looking<00:03:15.830> at

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
my my leak and the reason I'm looking at

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.430 
my my leak and the reason I'm looking at
this<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.900> if<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.170> can<00:03:18.410> see<00:03:18.860> I<00:03:20.020> mean<00:03:21.020> up<00:03:21.200> from

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
this is if you can see I mean up from

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.880 
this is if you can see I mean up from
here<00:03:22.030> you<00:03:23.030> see<00:03:23.240> how<00:03:23.360> the<00:03:23.420> frame<00:03:23.930> rail<00:03:24.230> is<00:03:24.500> real

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
here you see how the frame rail is real

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.560 
here you see how the frame rail is real
wet<00:03:25.190> right<00:03:25.970> there<00:03:27.520> I'm<00:03:28.520> thinking<00:03:28.970> thats<00:03:29.150> from

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
wet right there I'm thinking thats from

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:31.720 
wet right there I'm thinking thats from
the<00:03:29.750> oil<00:03:29.900> leaking<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.950> was<00:03:31.100> blowing<00:03:31.430> out<00:03:31.520> so

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
the oil leaking that was blowing out so

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.750 
the oil leaking that was blowing out so
I<00:03:31.790> put<00:03:31.970> some<00:03:32.380> leak<00:03:33.380> stop<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.370> was<00:03:34.489> blowing

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
I put some leak stop and it was blowing

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.910 
I put some leak stop and it was blowing
through<00:03:35.270> those<00:03:35.510> sides<00:03:35.930> so<00:03:36.350> I'm<00:03:36.590> trying<00:03:36.890> to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
through those sides so I'm trying to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.760 
through those sides so I'm trying to
find<00:03:37.130> out<00:03:37.280> where<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.520> leaks<00:03:37.730> at<00:03:38.770> hopefully

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
find out where the leaks at hopefully

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.670 
find out where the leaks at hopefully
it's<00:03:39.890> not<00:03:40.010> in<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.340> main<00:03:40.580> line<00:03:40.610> right<00:03:41.180> there

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
it's not in that main line right there

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.960 
it's not in that main line right there
right<00:03:42.680> here<00:03:43.209> this<00:03:44.209> one<00:03:48.340> can't<00:03:49.340> see<00:03:49.610> it<00:03:49.700> little

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
right here this one can't see it little

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.070 
right here this one can't see it little
right<00:03:50.150> there

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
right there

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.230 
right there
that<00:03:52.830> line<00:03:53.390> back<00:03:54.390> there

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.420 

hopefully<00:03:57.930> it's<00:03:58.050> not<00:03:58.110> there<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:58.830> we'll<00:03:59.220> find

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
hopefully it's not there so we'll find

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:06.560 
hopefully it's not there so we'll find
out<00:03:59.610> once<00:03:59.880> we<00:04:00.030> pressurize<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.690> system<00:04:05.570> all

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
out once we pressurize the system all

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.150 
out once we pressurize the system all
right<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.750> got<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.080> stud<00:04:07.350> back<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.010> new

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
right I got the stud back on the new

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.250 
right I got the stud back on the new
expansion<00:04:08.610> valve<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.720> notice<00:04:10.020> there's<00:04:10.200> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
expansion valve you notice there's a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.470 
expansion valve you notice there's a
third<00:04:10.500> hole<00:04:10.830> here<00:04:11.190> it<00:04:11.460> only<00:04:11.610> goes<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:12.090> one<00:04:12.120> way

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
third hole here it only goes in one way

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.300 
third hole here it only goes in one way
so<00:04:12.510> it<00:04:12.810> goes<00:04:12.960> this<00:04:13.230> way<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.830> can't<00:04:14.040> mess<00:04:14.250> it

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
so it goes this way so you can't mess it

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.810 
so it goes this way so you can't mess it
up

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
up

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.680 
up
be<00:04:15.330> sure<00:04:15.510> tighten<00:04:15.960> these<00:04:16.400> two<00:04:17.400> bolts<00:04:17.850> fairly

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
be sure tighten these two bolts fairly

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.380 
be sure tighten these two bolts fairly
tight<00:04:19.070> about<00:04:20.070> a<00:04:20.220> half<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.640> turn<00:04:20.820> once<00:04:21.209> you're

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
tight about a half a turn once you're

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.420 
tight about a half a turn once you're
snug<00:04:21.660> just<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.710> make<00:04:22.860> sure<00:04:22.980> they're<00:04:23.130> tight<00:04:23.280> you

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
snug just to make sure they're tight you

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.530 
snug just to make sure they're tight you
don't<00:04:23.520> wanna<00:04:23.730> do<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:23.910> too<00:04:24.030> tight<00:04:24.240> it's

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
don't wanna do it too tight it's

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.970 
don't wanna do it too tight it's
aluminum<00:04:24.930> so<00:04:25.140> you'll<00:04:25.290> end<00:04:25.380> up<00:04:25.500> stripping<00:04:25.740> it

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
aluminum so you'll end up stripping it

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.100 
aluminum so you'll end up stripping it
out

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
out

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.870 
out
I'll<00:04:28.110> show<00:04:28.350> you<00:04:28.410> the<00:04:28.620> two<00:04:28.800> differences<00:04:29.520> in<00:04:29.790> the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
I'll show you the two differences in the

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.430 
I'll show you the two differences in the
two<00:04:31.190> there's<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.550> old<00:04:32.760> one<00:04:33.090> there's<00:04:33.990> a<00:04:34.290> new

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
two there's the old one there's a new

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.800 
two there's the old one there's a new
one<00:04:34.590> actually<00:04:35.750> there<00:04:36.750> so<00:04:37.080> when<00:04:37.350> there's<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.710> new

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
one actually there so when there's a new

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.390 
one actually there so when there's a new
replace<00:04:39.810> this<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.380> see<00:04:40.560> how<00:04:40.680> this<00:04:40.860> does<00:04:41.130> and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
replace this and see how this does and

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.260 
replace this and see how this does and
we'll<00:04:41.610> go<00:04:41.730> from<00:04:41.880> there

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
we'll go from there

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.830 
we'll go from there
I'll<00:04:42.360> back<00:04:42.690> in<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.990> system<00:04:43.200> and<00:04:43.620> all<00:04:44.810> right

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
I'll back in the system and all right

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.060 
I'll back in the system and all right
the<00:04:46.400> expansion<00:04:47.400> valves<00:04:47.820> back<00:04:48.090> on<00:04:48.980> what<00:04:49.980> I'm

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
the expansion valves back on what I'm

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.830 
the expansion valves back on what I'm
going<00:04:50.190> to<00:04:50.220> do<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.640> connect<00:04:51.180> to<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.630> low

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
going to do is connect to the low

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.740 
going to do is connect to the low
pressure<00:04:52.050> side<00:04:52.290> here<00:04:52.950> a<00:04:53.160> smaller<00:04:54.090> valve<00:04:54.390> and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
pressure side here a smaller valve and

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.150 
pressure side here a smaller valve and
I'm<00:04:55.530> gonna<00:04:55.740> pull<00:04:56.100> a<00:04:56.130> vacuum<00:04:56.370> on<00:04:56.730> it<00:04:57.350> about<00:04:58.350> an

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
I'm gonna pull a vacuum on it about an

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.060 
I'm gonna pull a vacuum on it about an
hour<00:04:59.610> and<00:05:00.150> then<00:05:00.720> I'll<00:05:01.050> try<00:05:01.500> charging<00:05:01.800> the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
hour and then I'll try charging the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.159 
hour and then I'll try charging the
system<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.490> see<00:05:02.640> if<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:02.880> fixes<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.270> it's

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
system and see if that fixes it it's

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.680 
system and see if that fixes it it's
still<00:05:04.410> got<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.590> leak<00:05:05.060> detect<00:05:06.060> in<00:05:06.240> it<00:05:06.390> so

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
still got some leak detect in it so

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.560 
still got some leak detect in it so
hopefully<00:05:07.590> I'll<00:05:08.490> still<00:05:08.790> be<00:05:08.880> circulating<00:05:09.480> in

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
hopefully I'll still be circulating in

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.270 
hopefully I'll still be circulating in
there<00:05:09.720> but<00:05:09.870> didn't<00:05:10.500> have<00:05:10.620> the<00:05:10.650> system<00:05:11.010> open

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
there but didn't have the system open

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.260 
there but didn't have the system open
long<00:05:11.490> so<00:05:11.820> hopefully<00:05:12.270> we'll<00:05:13.020> be<00:05:13.110> good
