00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.640
 we have never been able to say where it came from 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.640
 whitera does wonders in freefall the ease in fact that a little trick to the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.579
 head she left yesterday 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.130
 make a big tournament 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.180
 at first you wanted to go by boat 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.180
 as we do not know to be worthy of a million traffic but it is not possible 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.170
 and percent looking a bit here on the internet we have already made people 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.930
 it takes a motorhome 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:46.879
 so we said 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.950
 it's more comfortable to wear 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.899
 here we go again 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.559
 but the project the project to leave 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.559

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.840
 certainly not yet said 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
 it's a desire to leave 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.110

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.510
 a little polar 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.540
 Well, this is it 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.920
 one in relation to the assets and finally his anger and his lands in relation to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.180
 their help 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.910
 so then in the global business differently for the most part in 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.910
 during these moments and then we can 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.360
 here it is done it's time for us gates

 with christian dispatch afp worse 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.019
 nothing is just a passing fad 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.019
 most that was 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:24.270
 while the most 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.650
 it's going to be all the wonders we offer another our planet 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.930
 with 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.279
 the 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:35.189
 we'll say 

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.469
 the landscapes work and the natural beauties then towards meeting with that 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.020
 peoples blade 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.240
 who do not have the same culture at all 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.330
 the initiators 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.330
 that's not the same culture those who do not live from most 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.430
 are funded through ways that you can see 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.330
 So that's a mix of faultless 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.979
 evacuated to the hospital 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:58.370

 the layout security is there in times of crisis 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.020
 at my age it's done and something here 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.589
 after a little bit the parent who think like themselves also the fight 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:27.120
 for luck 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.410
 today with the internet we are lucky to have someone to be afraid but 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.800
 especially having to have internet% 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.520
 people who have already made this journey 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.669
 before talking 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:40.520
 who gave a lot of information about the places where they fight in 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.960
 places a bit dangerous for her and to secure the lamal 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.020
 in the back in his room a lot of fears it's not like that party 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.819
 at 10,121 Picard censor not knowing where to go 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.310
 and ariary being the first to arrive 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.599
 it's on the source 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:05:59.389
 so it would be a lot of dollars for the sale on the title it was a lot of 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.119
 movies already quite a lot of stuff is sure it's an ideal 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:05.979
 there was nothing 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.389
 I did not have the problem we were the first to do it 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.569
 like for the moment all testimonies and military will become 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.689
 perhaps 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.689
 indeed the exception mortality rate but hey 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:19.330
 why do they prefer 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.589
 at the back a whole case 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:25.869
 in attack placed my words do not lend and resume and the first 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:28.869
 had to be less in a hurry that we are here 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.490
 she

 secularism react 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.999
 we knew to make beautiful pictures here 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:42.579
