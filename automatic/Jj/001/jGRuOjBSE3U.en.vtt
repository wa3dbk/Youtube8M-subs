might even have one but I doubt it but
the<00:02:54.350> bomb<00:02:54.530> code<00:02:54.769> is<00:02:54.890> something<00:02:55.190> that's<00:02:55.250> really

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
the bomb code is something that's really

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.190 
the bomb code is something that's really
reliable<00:02:55.910> because<00:02:56.269> sometimes<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:56.900> hard<00:02:57.080> to

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
reliable because sometimes it's hard to

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.449 
reliable because sometimes it's hard to
feel<00:02:57.350> through<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.680> bags<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.250> there's<00:03:01.430> a

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
feel through the bags so there's a

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.680 
feel through the bags so there's a
little<00:03:01.549> one<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.910> I'm<00:03:02.030> missing<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.510> I'll<00:03:02.569> be

be able to tell and a bump codes um it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.350 
be able to tell and a bump codes um it
is<00:03:09.200> time<00:03:09.410> consuming<00:03:09.549> but<00:03:10.549> like<00:03:10.730> I<00:03:10.819> said<00:03:10.880> target

collecting<00:03:49.040> these<00:03:49.310> probably<00:03:49.700> a<00:03:49.970> couple<00:03:50.180> weeks

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
collecting these probably a couple weeks

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.500 
collecting these probably a couple weeks
ago<00:03:51.190> but<00:03:52.190> I<00:03:52.489> think<00:03:52.579> most<00:03:52.970> stores<00:03:53.239> are<00:03:53.329> going<00:03:53.450> to

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
ago but I think most stores are going to

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.630 
ago but I think most stores are going to
start<00:03:53.690> carrying<00:03:54.049> them<00:03:54.230> may<00:03:54.680> first<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.220> think<00:03:55.489> is

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
start carrying them may first I think is

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.120 
start carrying them may first I think is
the<00:03:55.850> deadline<00:03:56.420> that<00:03:56.630> they've<00:03:56.810> given<00:03:57.040> so<00:03:58.040> if

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
the deadline that they've given so if

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.319 
the deadline that they've given so if
