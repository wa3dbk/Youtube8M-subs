00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.390
 as we are all going to make a remedy 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.059
 home 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.209
 for coughing to avoid those annoying 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:15.859
 dry every time we have is a very remedy 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.750
 simple based on figs and apples and a 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 little bit of life as you have seen 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:25.150
 we count the children 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.330
 and we put them in a saucepan with water 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.940
 we are cut we will add water a 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 liter of water 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:39.430
 of half a liter we will add water and 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:43.390
 guys and we let ourselves cook during 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 more or less 15 minutes there we have added 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:50.110
 and now what we have to do is 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.530
 cut an apple as you see the center 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.720
 from the field 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.960
 and leave what it costs 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.160
 simmer 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.160
 with the much earlier 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.010
 for now 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.500
 and then 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.500
 to take a friend 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.730
 which is the best for the white 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:26.810
 we go to the fields 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.260
 on the other side 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.370
 of local honey this 4 tablespoons 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.610
 we cast them while the team is already 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:41.220
 is heating the water 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.520
 and so it will dissolve better with him 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.710
 with the constant with the children 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.299
 we have cast them we have cut them around 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 of the 20 or so if they are larger 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:56.220
 you can cut catch 1 cast 12 15 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.110
 and the little ones like in this case that 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.540
 they were a little smaller I projected 20 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.060
 in a liter of water in a saucepan there is 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.500
 already throwing the honey and then what 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.300
 we do is once it has cooled 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.899
 the ends of the floor we put a 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.640
 we remove it from the fire and what 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.270
 we do is strain the liquid that we're going 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.550
 to take is the liquid with the o in a 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.830
 glass jar can not be a 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.620
 authorities 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.319
 the plastic where you want and then what 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.480
 we make is in a small glass 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.160
 instead of less than half a glass 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.560
 more or less 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.090
 half a glass and then we take every two 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.340
 hours because that's totally natural 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.340
 It is every two hours before bedtime 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 ah
