you see who wins and then there's a

that<00:04:44.300> car<00:04:44.600> is<00:04:44.810> like<00:04:45.050> super<00:04:45.919> card<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.550> entire

whatever<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:54.169> race<00:04:54.320> has<00:04:54.500> been<00:04:54.620> over<00:04:54.889> now<00:04:55.070> for

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
whatever the race has been over now for

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.600 
whatever the race has been over now for
almost<00:04:55.850> a<00:04:56.150> whole<00:04:56.270> lab<00:04:56.860> but<00:04:57.860> they<00:04:58.070> take<00:04:58.250> you

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
almost a whole lab but they take you

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.000 
almost a whole lab but they take you
know<00:04:58.729> not<00:04:59.000> very<00:04:59.060> long<00:04:59.419> couple<00:04:59.690> minutes<00:05:00.080> but<00:05:00.979> I

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
know not very long couple minutes but I

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:02.620 
know not very long couple minutes but I
destroyed<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> competition<00:05:02.150> and<00:05:02.330> I<00:05:02.389> think

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
destroyed the competition and I think

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.390 
destroyed the competition and I think
this<00:05:02.780> is<00:05:03.020> when<00:05:03.169> the<00:05:03.500> rest<00:05:03.800> of<00:05:03.919> them<00:05:04.070> will<00:05:04.190> start

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
this is when the rest of them will start

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.920 
this is when the rest of them will start
popping<00:05:04.760> up<00:05:04.880> but<00:05:05.479> there's<00:05:05.630> like<00:05:05.750> another
