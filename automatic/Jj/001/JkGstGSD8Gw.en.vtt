00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.060
 hello with you uncle gosh and i have to 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.340
 you have a suggestion as i am on many 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.550
 tanks already skated and not everything to me 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:14.849
 interesting but I would like to repeat the experience 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.490
 on them and seriously some kind of have an incentive 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.740
 I propose to do this myself 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.750
 vote and choose 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 what kind of tank do you want me to 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.689
 swept here you choose some kind of tank 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.340
 which will cause more desire there 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.750
 hype and i'm on this tank 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 take off some thread and video that is 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.130
 I will try there to play a lot on it 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.500
 copy show interesting on it 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.899
 moments to sum up some strong and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.149
 tatanka's weaknesses let me know 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.239
 what is your interest, I understand that everyone 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.450
 I want to know where their top tanks 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.190
 characteristics but I do not yet 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.230
 Opportunities now only play tanks 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.960
 that all this is open to the other side 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.850
 I just zabashlyat a lot of money and to 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 heaps of money there for a few thousand 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.260
 put in just put loose points 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 the experience is very much to promote the wrong 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.150
 does not want to do it because of course 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.780
 Interesting here are all these top tanks 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.960
 look but also curious maybe 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.180
 which one of these tanks seems to you 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:18.479
 well that's underrated for example you 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.400
 think that he is too weak or you 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.530
 think some tank is too strong 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.020
 maybe for which tank if so much 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.060
 controversial moments or it is very complicated in 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.340
 the game or vice versa it is very funny to you 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:33.210
 I want to see how well everyone has 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.409
 its own criteria like why some 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.500
 tank must be selected 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.500
 you are your inner predisposition 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.020
 some technique show that give 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.790
 I know how you want me to 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.100
 I rolled here and I will try 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.229
 accordingly on this tank as possible 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.689
 lose more and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.310
 something interesting to do i will play 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 I immediately speak in realistic fights 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.000
 that is, no arcade and simulators for me 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.520
 like the most realistic goddesses 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.610
 funny as a guy I feel comfortable on them 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.649
 play it should not be airplanes and from 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.960
 tanks it could be anything this 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.849
 may be any premium tank not 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.550
 The problem if the pulp is not bought buy 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.450
 also not a question here and it can be at least 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.330
 This gas is against 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.910
 airplanes also do not matter, I will play on it 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.220
 I like this challenge and choose what 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.290
 want of course i think many will want 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.170
 Dobryakova absolutely he vanshot 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.230
 also probably someone will want to see 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.599
 gas is still not clear for the Germans it will be 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.180
 most players either for tips 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.610
 but in general, if we suppose quite often 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.099
 will choose so for some one 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.190
 nation then i have some choice limited 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.110
 just one nation just know who 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.269
 it is necessary only German technology like 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.310
 Yes, someone both like someone at all 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.319
 machines do not like and only someone 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.900
 so why soviet balance 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:54.579
 should be yes and besides here such 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.099
 saying that know your enemy by sight 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.530
 need to understand there so i think everyone 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.690
 it will be interesting and can be admissible 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.420
 if you play for germans yes and you 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.400
 say goshan you make a video but make 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.319
 there are a couple of tips i play there for 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.390
 Germans but they will do about such tanks 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:13.120
 I know how to fight him play for him 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.400
 but tell me how weak he is 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.430
 sides against which tank against him 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.769
 there is some kind of well according to your feelings 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.829
 there against some not nice to play 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.049
 on the part of the Germans that is please so 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:28.930
 could it be these gifts ? 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.019
 I also have this panfilovich 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.090
 what about it can also write 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.950
 wishes what kind of shells do you want to 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.200
 I tested that is, I will not care 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.639
 It's there that you choose to test as 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.980
 I want to plan what 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.019
 I will read comfortable shells but if 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 Separately there will be items that gasha but 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.200
 make this tank here but I want you 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.810
 here on this projectile 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.780
 then I will have this too question have this 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.760
 many will be interested to educate here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.040

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.790
