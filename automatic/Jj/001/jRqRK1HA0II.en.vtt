00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860 

I've<00:00:00.930> seen<00:00:01.260> in<00:00:01.620> past<00:00:01.800> experiences<00:00:02.870> anyway

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
I've seen in past experiences anyway

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.930 
I've seen in past experiences anyway
starting<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.920> kale<00:00:05.100> chips<00:00:05.370> which<00:00:05.759> is

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
starting with the kale chips which is

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.519 
starting with the kale chips which is
probably<00:00:06.150> the<00:00:06.299> lesser<00:00:06.779> of<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.960> two<00:00:07.049> eagles

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
probably the lesser of the two eagles

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:09.890 
probably the lesser of the two eagles
and<00:00:07.770> if<00:00:07.859> you<00:00:07.980> make<00:00:08.160> kale<00:00:08.429> chips<00:00:08.460> at<00:00:08.849> home<00:00:09.090> with

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
and if you make kale chips at home with

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.290 
and if you make kale chips at home with
just<00:00:10.200> healthy<00:00:10.559> ingredients<00:00:10.740> I<00:00:11.550> think<00:00:12.179> they're

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
just healthy ingredients I think they're

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.580 
just healthy ingredients I think they're
probably<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.719> right<00:00:12.929> except<00:00:13.290> for<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.440> fact

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
probably all right except for the fact

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.160 
probably all right except for the fact
that<00:00:13.769> they're<00:00:13.980> missing<00:00:14.429> their<00:00:14.639> water<00:00:15.480> content

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
that they're missing their water content

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.460 
that they're missing their water content
so<00:00:16.710> they're<00:00:16.830> not<00:00:16.949> hydrating<00:00:17.699> to<00:00:17.820> your<00:00:17.940> body

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 
so they're not hydrating to your body

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.080 
so they're not hydrating to your body
these<00:00:19.470> ones<00:00:19.740> however<00:00:21.560> they<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.880> the<00:00:23.880> first

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
these ones however they have the first

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.500 
these ones however they have the first
ingredient<00:00:24.330> scale<00:00:25.199> again<00:00:25.590> that's<00:00:25.830> fine<00:00:26.789> then

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
ingredient scale again that's fine then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.750 
ingredient scale again that's fine then
they<00:00:27.689> have<00:00:27.840> cashews<00:00:28.500> now<00:00:28.830> cashews<00:00:29.340> are<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.730> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
they have cashews now cashews are not a

they have cashews now cashews are not a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
raw not it's been proven several times

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.910 
raw not it's been proven several times
over<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:33.870> cashews<00:00:34.290> at<00:00:34.410> least<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.739> ones

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
over that the cashews at least the ones

over that the cashews at least the ones
in<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> bulk<00:00:35.370> bins<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.910> ones<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.180> we

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
in the bulk bins and the ones that we

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.060 
in the bulk bins and the ones that we
probably<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.780> our<00:00:36.870> hands<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.320> for<00:00:37.649> making

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
probably get our hands on for making

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.639 
probably get our hands on for making
this<00:00:38.160> kind<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> stuff<00:00:38.870> they<00:00:39.870> have<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> be<00:00:40.440> heat

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
this kind of stuff they have to be heat

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.619 
this kind of stuff they have to be heat
processed<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.399> order<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.850> release<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.600> from

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
processed in order to release them from

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
processed in order to release them from
the<00:00:42.989> shell<00:00:43.230> that<00:00:43.440> they're<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> cashew

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the shell that they're in on the cashew

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
the shell that they're in on the cashew
fruit<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.059> I've<00:00:45.480> seen<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.780> cashew<00:00:46.320> fruit<00:00:46.500> in

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
fruit and I've seen the cashew fruit in

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.430 
fruit and I've seen the cashew fruit in
person<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> went<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.820> Costa<00:00:48.030> Rica<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
person when I went to Costa Rica and you

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.760 
person when I went to Costa Rica and you
can't<00:00:49.680> eat<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.070> cashew<00:00:50.610> nut<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.539> it's

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
can't eat a cashew nut because it's

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.889 
can't eat a cashew nut because it's
inside<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.980> light<00:00:53.190> tart<00:00:54.030> fruit<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.629> then

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
inside this light tart fruit and then

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
inside this light tart fruit and then
you<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> use<00:00:56.160> some<00:00:56.340> kind<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> heat

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
you have to use some kind of heat

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.849 
you have to use some kind of heat
processing<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.899> remove<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.710> not

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

from<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.160> shell<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.000> hard<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
from the shell that it's in hard to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
from the shell that it's in hard to
explain<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:01.620> maybe<00:01:01.980> another<00:01:02.250> video<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
explain but maybe another video or

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
explain but maybe another video or
anyway<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> cashiers<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.080> not<00:01:04.290> raw<00:01:04.470> even<00:01:05.100> if

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
anyway the cashiers are not raw even if

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.359 
anyway the cashiers are not raw even if
they<00:01:05.309> were<00:01:05.369> off<00:01:05.760> their<00:01:06.180> high<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.600> fat<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.369> that

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they were off their high in fat and that

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.570 
they were off their high in fat and that
can<00:01:08.850> slow<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.360> down<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.960> sure<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> other

cases agave nectar now gavi nectar is
not<00:01:23.130> wrong<00:01:23.369> either<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.000> mean<00:01:24.180> there's<00:01:24.390> no

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
not wrong either I mean there's no

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
person that can just pick up an agave

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.219 
person that can just pick up an agave
plant<00:01:27.630> out<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.579> somehow<00:01:29.579> create<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.750> syrup

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
plant out and somehow create a syrup

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.740 
plant out and somehow create a syrup
from<00:01:31.500> that<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> sweetener<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.600> has

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
from that it's a sweetener so there has

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
from that it's a sweetener so there has
to<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.930> some<00:01:34.170> kind<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.790> intense<00:01:35.790> processing<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
to be some kind of intense processing to

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.390 
to be some kind of intense processing to
make<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> gobby<00:01:37.140> syrup<00:01:37.619> sweet<00:01:37.920> enough<00:01:38.159> to

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
make a gobby syrup sweet enough to

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.080 
make a gobby syrup sweet enough to
actually<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.820> used<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.450> a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970 

concentrated<00:01:43.090> sweetener<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.810> I<00:01:44.740> don't<00:01:44.890> even

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
concentrated sweetener and I don't even

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.950 
concentrated sweetener and I don't even
know<00:01:45.130> why<00:01:45.310> these<00:01:45.370> savory<00:01:46.090> kale<00:01:46.480> chips<00:01:46.750> have

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
know why these savory kale chips have

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.040 
know why these savory kale chips have
any<00:01:47.140> kind<00:01:47.320> of<00:01:47.410> sweetener<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:47.950> them<00:01:48.190> but<00:01:49.050> agave

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
any kind of sweetener on them but agave

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.940 
any kind of sweetener on them but agave
is<00:01:50.230> definitely<00:01:51.030> not<00:01:52.030> a<00:01:52.090> good<00:01:52.540> idea<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.680> put<00:01:53.800> in

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
is definitely not a good idea to put in

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.560 
is definitely not a good idea to put in
your<00:01:54.070> body<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.550> I<00:01:54.850> always<00:01:55.120> notice<00:01:55.540> the
